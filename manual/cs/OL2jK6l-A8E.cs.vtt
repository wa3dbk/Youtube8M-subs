00:00:03.534 --> 00:00:07.491
&gt;&gt;What did please you and what did disappoint you at the festival?&lt;&lt;

00:00:07.492 --> 00:00:10.267
I'm here only since yesterday, so...

00:00:10.268 --> 00:00:13.233
I am pleased by the atmosphere, which is still the same

00:00:13.234 --> 00:00:15.317
like during those 6 years.

00:00:15.318 --> 00:00:16.832
I love it here.

00:00:16.833 --> 00:00:19.144
I'm little bit disappointed by the choice of films,

00:00:19.145 --> 00:00:22.088
till now I've seen really depressive ones.

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.680
The only positive one was film by Sam Mendes

00:00:25.681 --> 00:00:26.763
Away We Go.

00:00:26.764 --> 00:00:31.064
Toho, co se mi nelíbilo, mnoho nebylo.

00:00:31.065 --> 00:00:32.963
Toho, co se mi líbilo bylo naopak hodně.

00:00:32.964 --> 00:00:37.635
Vím, že je to velmi malý festival,

00:00:37.636 --> 00:00:44.618
ale díky dobrým filmům a velkým lidem, kteří přijeli,

00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:45.746
je to festival velmi velký.

00:00:45.747 --> 00:00:47.963
Byl jsem už na mnohých festivalech,

00:00:47.964 --> 00:00:50.859
ale Karlovy Vary jsou výjimečné.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.710
To proto, že jenom tady můžu vidět filmy z východní Evropy.

00:00:56.711 --> 00:01:05.633
Filmy z Gruzínska, Albánie, Bosny, Chorvátska, ze všech těchto zemí,

00:01:05.634 --> 00:01:08.489
které nemůžu vidět na žádném jiném festivalu.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.321
A určitě ne v mojí zemi.

00:01:10.322 --> 00:01:15.033
Já jsem tady teď poprvé a musím říct, že se mi to moc líbilo,

00:01:15.034 --> 00:01:16.410
bylo to pro mě nové.

00:01:16.411 --> 00:01:18.914
Co se mi nelíbilo, je počasí.

00:01:18.915 --> 00:01:22.592
Byla zima a pršelo,

00:01:22.593 --> 00:01:27.863
ale i tak to bylo super, bavili jsme se. Dobré filmy.

00:01:27.864 --> 00:01:31.230
Tady jsem poprvé a viděla jsem hodně dobrých filmů,

00:01:31.231 --> 00:01:36.644
jako ty od Sama Mendese nebo Pedra Almódovara,

00:01:36.645 --> 00:01:39.466
které jsou opravdu výborné.

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:42.600
Líbila se mi i celá organizace, všechno je skvělé.

00:01:42.844 --> 00:01:46.379
Jediné, co se mi nelíbilo, je počasí, ale nic víc.

00:01:47.455 --> 00:01:48.665
I've been here very shortly, 

00:01:48.666 --> 00:01:52.078
I liked the Georgian film The Other Bank

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.678
and we were very pleased.

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.069
Very nice film.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:56.540
&gt;&gt;What was the disappointment?&lt;&lt;

00:01:56.541 --> 00:01:57.488
The weather.

00:01:57.656 --> 00:02:00.260
I'm disappointed that Lázně I. (Baths I.) don't work

00:02:00.261 --> 00:02:07.928
and I like nothing has changed except of this.

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.614
I was delight by parties

00:02:10.615 --> 00:02:12.833
and I'm disappointed I haven't seen any film.

00:02:12.834 --> 00:02:14.098
It was sold out.

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:18.380
We don't really like that films were similar,

00:02:18.381 --> 00:02:23.964
with lot of violence and no spiritual overlap,

00:02:23.965 --> 00:02:26.645
but I don't want to generalize, one can see 30 films.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.872
I was really impressed by Antichrist from Lars Von Trier.

00:02:30.873 --> 00:02:34.966
Although there was lot of violence too, I appreciate the courage.

00:02:34.967 --> 00:02:37.728
Yesterday I saw La Tigra, Chaco

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:40.848
and that was super, because one of the main actress,

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:42.889
who participated in the discussion,

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.681
has parents who come from Morava,

00:02:44.682 --> 00:02:47.591
so she all of a sudden sang in Czech language in the film,

00:02:47.592 --> 00:02:50.694
and during the discussion she spoke to us in Czech,

00:02:50.695 --> 00:02:51.708
what was amazing.

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.972
I came yesterday and until now nothing disappointed me.

00:02:55.973 --> 00:02:57.012
And I hope it will stay like this.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.449
The biggest pleasure was for me the american clasic

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.688
The Cover Girl, the musical from 1944.

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.588
I enjoyed it in the big hall,

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:18.516
because such an old film on such a big screen

00:03:18.517 --> 00:03:20.822
I can see only in Karlovy Vary.

00:03:20.823 --> 00:03:27.218
In the competition was the best Cold Souls according to me

00:03:27.219 --> 00:03:31.479
for many reasons which I'd have to explain long time.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.137
Especially, but not only because of the performance of Paul Giamatti.

00:03:40.092 --> 00:03:42.486
Disappointment? I don't have any disappointment.

00:03:42.487 --> 00:03:46.749
Maybe only the weather, which was very changeable.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.310
And today on the other nice film The White Ribbon,

00:03:51.311 --> 00:03:54.417
that won in Cannes and I saw it first time only today

00:03:55.482 --> 00:03:57.072
and I enjoyed it,

00:03:57.073 --> 00:03:59.025
I was terribly cold in the cinema hall.
