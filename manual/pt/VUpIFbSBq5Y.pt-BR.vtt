The first service should be run on the right
side of the court.

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:26.610
Since the server has two chances to hit the
sack, missing the first can withdraw the second.

and drip in the drawing of the opposing side,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.469
always on the opposite side, if you took out
the right side, it should drip from the left

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.620

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:24.780

on the count of points during the game, we

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.190
always speak first point of who is serving,
then the point of who is receiving.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:46.020
For example: 15-0, if whoever made ​​the
point, who's been serving, 0-15, if whoever

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.601
made ​​the point was who is receiving
the serve.
