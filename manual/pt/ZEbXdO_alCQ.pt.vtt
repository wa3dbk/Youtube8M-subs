00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.140
Good Evening People !! Well.. i´m making this quick 
video 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:16.100
just for who have the Renault Scenic
1.6 16V. i found that my car was a litle acelerated .. little weird( rotation over 10RPM)

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.100
So now the rotation is ok !

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:31.000
what did i found people.. the engine it was acelerated so high,not when the acceleration was irregular,loosing the rotation...  so what did i do ?! 

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:51.800
on the left side of engine, checked a cable from that side of motor was disconnected...

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.900
because what´s happening...the Alternator Belt had broken..

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.600
and this cable here,it was loose..

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:13.340
Called Polli -V Belt  and this  cable here,it was loose..

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:21.000
and the reason of over rotation is this !!

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:29.540
and if you put back the cable in the place the rotation is normalized!!

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.200
and also what did i found..

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.000
when the cable disconnected

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.900
if i push the brake pedals 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:02:14.000
the rotation increases.
