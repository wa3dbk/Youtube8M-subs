Hey guys, I'm Filipe Nascimento
and this is Micro Sobrevivência.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.525
What is Micro Sobrevivência?
It's a show where I'm gonna teach

00:00:14.671 --> 00:00:17.066
you how to cook everything on
microwave. Everything!

00:00:17.459 --> 00:00:20.402
Baked potato, Italian rice, spaghetti

00:00:20.724 --> 00:00:25.682
fry an egg, everything on microwave.
You won't need your mom to turn the oven on.

00:00:25.913 --> 00:00:29.293
Everything is cooked on microwave.
And today I'll teach you how to cook

00:00:29.393 --> 00:00:30.666
a baked potato!

00:00:37.605 --> 00:00:38.965
You're gonna need

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.378
Potatos, a spoon of butter to each potato,
parsley, bacon,

00:00:46.378 --> 00:00:51.174
cheese, I'm gonna use Italian smoked cheese,
salt and cream cheese.

00:00:51.574 --> 00:00:53.461
It's only those ingredients to make
a baked potato.

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:58.163
You can fill your potato with
anything you want.

00:00:58.266 --> 00:01:00.523
I'm gonna fill it with bacon, ok?

00:01:01.374 --> 00:01:03.851
What do I need to do to cook my potato?

00:01:04.453 --> 00:01:09.760
A potato and a fork to make little
holes in all potato.

00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:11.180
You don't need to take the peel off.

00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:22.613
Guys, after that what I am
going to do is

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:29.413
I'm gonna put the potatos on a plate,
like this.

00:01:31.335 --> 00:01:34.079
And I'll cook them on the microwave
for 6 minutes.

00:01:34.685 --> 00:01:39.900
Ater 6 minutes I'm gonna turn them
and let them cook for more 6 minutes.

00:01:40.277 --> 00:01:45.049
Alright? It's 12 minutes, when it's
6 minutes I stop it, turn it,

00:01:45.423 --> 00:01:46.201
And let it cooking.

00:01:54.806 --> 00:01:56.447
After the first 6 minutes,

00:01:57.556 --> 00:01:59.602
I'm gonna put the glove on
or I'm gonna burn myself.

00:02:00.656 --> 00:02:00.921
Let's go.

00:02:05.392 --> 00:02:11.326
And now I'll turn the potatos and them will
be back to the microwave for 6 minutes.

00:02:18.947 --> 00:02:22.075
While the potatos are cooking

00:02:22.281 --> 00:02:26.881
I'm gonna cut the bacon because
mine is not cut yet.

00:02:38.535 --> 00:02:40.331
The potato is done, guys.

00:02:40.557 --> 00:02:42.999
I'm gonna see if they did cook.

00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:49.117
With a fork I'll see if they're not
like an apple, if they do

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:51.423
let them cooking for more 2 minutes.

00:02:52.651 --> 00:02:52.922
Let's go...

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:57.865
I'm seeing if all the potatos are cooked...

00:02:59.661 --> 00:03:03.963
My potatos are ready,
what am I gonna do now?

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.702
I'll put the bacon here and fry it.

00:03:08.703 --> 00:03:14.936
Let it fry for 2 minutes, ok?
Its own fat will fry it.

00:03:15.518 --> 00:03:18.067
It's not necessary any butter or
olive oil.

00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:21.626
2 minutes on the microwave.

00:03:27.652 --> 00:03:31.107
While the bacon is frying,
take the potato

00:03:33.715 --> 00:03:39.004
I'll cut the middle of the
potato opening it

00:03:41.884 --> 00:03:44.566
The same thing in the other side.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.356
Now...

00:03:47.742 --> 00:03:49.817
Salt.

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:51.997
This isn't the salt, it's
the crem cheese...

00:03:58.106 --> 00:04:04.097
A spoon of butter or margarine,
or anything you have it.

00:04:10.948 --> 00:04:13.042
Now I'm gonna take the cheese

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:16.369
and I'll grate it on my potato.
Now the bacon

00:04:22.094 --> 00:04:22.541
Now the bacon...

00:04:26.693 --> 00:04:32.481
The bacon is ready, and with
a fork I'll put it in the potato.

00:04:34.638 --> 00:04:35.771
Ok, now...

00:04:36.304 --> 00:04:40.036
I'll... I don't have another spoon...
I'll use the same...

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:43.750
I'll put the cream cheese.

00:04:50.126 --> 00:04:52.070
Ok, and to decorate it...

00:04:53.437 --> 00:04:55.446
just a little of
parsley on the top.

00:05:01.181 --> 00:05:02.433
Your baked potato is done!

00:05:02.741 --> 00:05:04.495
And to go with this potato

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:06.742
I'll drink an Irish beer

00:05:07.199 --> 00:05:07.552
Murphy

00:05:08.420 --> 00:05:09.350
It's a red beer

00:05:09.972 --> 00:05:11.295
with 5% acohol

00:05:14.608 --> 00:05:16.403
There's a Homer laughing here

00:05:20.727 --> 00:05:25.450

00:05:26.463 --> 00:05:29.761
