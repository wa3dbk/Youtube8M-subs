00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.500
The super busy Singapore airport is
considered one of the best in the world.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.000
We went there to get to know an exclusive service
of embarking and disembarking of passengers.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.400
Look at that,

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.800
everything starts once
you get off the plane,

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.300
and a recepcionist is waiting
for you with a golf cart.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.300
Quickly, she takes your baggage ticket

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.700
and from then on you start
being called by the name.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.100
Head of State treatment!

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.100
You don´t even have to go to the
baggage claim area to get your suitcases.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.500
In a few minutes she goes all the way
to the other side of this gigantic airport

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.600
without your having to take one step.

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.100
The way is full of stores
of all major brands

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.800
and she even can stop for you to shop.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.500
And suddenly you arrive
at a Federal Police counter

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.500
just for you, no passport queue.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.600
Look at this arrival !

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.600
Obrigado, muito obrigado.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.100
Este é o meu gerente, Colin.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.500
Muito prazer, Colin, eu sou o Jayme.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.400
The luggage has already left the plane
directly to the car that will take us

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.500
to the hotel, it´s fantastic.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.100
Look at the room you are
brought to while you wait.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:43.200
It´s been less than 4 minutes since
I left the plane and I´m already here.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.100
Muito obrigado.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.500
O senhor gostaria de um café?

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.800
Talvez uma água, ou...

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.200
Ou então champagne?

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:51.700
- Por que não?
- Claro.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.700
Sim, por favor, muito obrigado.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.400
Obrigado, muito obrigado.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.700
People, cheers!

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.000
Nosso café é um típico
café da manhã continental.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.600
Vocês têm uma seleção de bebidas,
vocês oferecem desde champagne...

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.900
Trabalhamos com a Taittinger.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.900
Ah, é um Taittinger.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.800
Check this out, if you are spending
a long time making a connection

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.500
in Singapore, and want to take a rest,
you have a room, just like a hotel room.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.200
If you need to work, you have
a complete business center.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.600
For smokers, a green open area.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.800
The car to take you to
the hotel is also included.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Look at this miracle.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.300
Parece um milagre

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.700
This is a kind of miracle, it´s magic,

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.200
the luggage is already inside the car.

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.700
- Obrigado.
- É um prazer, senhor

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:04.700
Muito obrigado!
