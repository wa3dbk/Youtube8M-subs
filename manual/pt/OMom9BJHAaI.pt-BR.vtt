Hi, my name is Beto FranÃ§a. It is a great
pleasure to be here with you and today I would

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.250
like to introduce a little bit of my makeup
work. It is artistic makeup, where I like

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:23.329
to use different techniques, mixing them with
the use of makeup brushes and air brush.

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:26.400
I hope you enjoy this work. Thank you, shall
we?

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.430
The first step of this job is to hide the
eyebrows and for this I will use the 400 brush.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:49.400
With it, we will be applying a type of varnish
on the eyebrow so that it's fixed on the skin.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:06.000
With the use of a brush for the eyebrow and
a spatula, we will apply wax gently over the eyebrow.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:27.500
Now, we will be mixing colors to get the skin
tone of our model. With the use of the fingers,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:37.500
we will apply the base over this wax and over
this mass

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and we will be making the texture smooth.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
In order to make it easier to hide the eyebrows,
I'll use the YG1 mixed with white.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.300
We will be preparing a sponge for base application,
using the most natural form of application.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
I'm applying base across the skin, using the
same colors that we used to cover the eyebrow.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.000
Separately, so that I can, at the same time,
apply brighter skin tones.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:06.860
As we will be applying the desired hue or
color for this job, we'll explore the anatomy

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.790
of the body, giving more volume to areas where
they are... This is a background that we are

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:33.290
preparing for our air brush.

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:40.290
In order to start the process of making colorful
skin, first I will fix some parts of the face

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.670
with a No 0 colorless powder.
