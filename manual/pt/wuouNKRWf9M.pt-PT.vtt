00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:15.740
José Dantas divides his days between music
and photography,

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:22.260
conciliating these two very different professions,
and proves us in his interview that they are

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:23.260
complementary.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.180
Now meet this musician / photographer
who has photographed numerous Portuguese personalities,

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:42.000
and has played with many musicians through
the national musical world.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.630
José you have dedicated your whole life to
photography and music.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.320
Was it easy to reconcile these two professions?

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.030
Not always
there were times I had to choose for either

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.950
one or the other.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:58.920
There were times I travelled around the country
touring and others just shooting.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.090
In photography what have you been doing?

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.250
A little bit of everything:
from photo reports, fashion,

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.170
I also give models some training on their
early career,

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:09.640
catalogs, magazines, whatever,
photojournalism too.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:12.420
And you love it when you can combine both
things.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.400
I know you have photographed many personalities
in music,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.060
like in cd's photo covers.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.370
Can you give me some names and tell me a little
about it?

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:28.790
The last job I had was Nucha's latest cd
I also did photo covers for João Tiago, Natasha,

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:35.000
for Henrique Fernandez and his rap project,
for a band named Mistura Quente and some more.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.951
Speaking about Band,
you also have a band who supports causes that

00:01:38.951 --> 00:01:40.490
mean something to you and touches you profoundly.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.600
How is it called?

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.490
It's The Famous Comission Band,
which is a band that refuses to be payed

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.820
and only works for social causes,
and just not long ago we have performed "É

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.970
a Acreditar",
which is also played to help companies to

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.930
make promotional events to raise funds for
themselves.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.610
We are also open to work with the Portuguese
communities abroad.

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:00.670
And If you had to choose between photography
and music,

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.270
would you easily drop one of these careers?

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.560
It is kind of tricky
because even when I'm just photographing

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.730
I don't know what happens but the music still
chases me whenever someone approaches me

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:15.720
because they want to play or I'm asked to
give a workshop about Bass,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.620
which is what I play,
and when I'm only in music the same happens,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.819
I'm invited for some shooting sessions.

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:25.999
It is always very tricky to manage these two
things,

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:26.999
extremely complicated.

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:32.450
In fashion, Is there someone that you have
photographed that marked you particularly?

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.870
In fashion, that I have photographed no
but there is one person that I would love

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.549
to photograph and she is Adriana Lima.

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:43.919
What do you think of the national Portuguese-level
in fashion photography?

00:02:43.919 --> 00:02:46.730
Do you believe we now have good fashion photographers?

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.330
We have great fashion photographers.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:51.739
Sometimes it's the customers who force photographers
to do things they dislike.

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.609
I think it should be given more freedom to
photographers creativity.

00:02:56.609 --> 00:03:01.489
I have seen work of photographers who are
not so good

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.680
but only because they were not allowed to
create,

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:10.609
because people sometimes do not have the notion
of what it takes for a catalog

00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:15.980
and end up doing everything backwards,
and they end not trusting the professionals

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.379
we have
We have excellent professionals.

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.489
I know you're also a mentor to many photographers
in early career,

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:22.730
you have had many trainees with you.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:26.249
What is the best advice you can give them?

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:29.019
I try to be extremely realistic
especially showing that in photography you

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:35.930
can not do everything you like,
we have to be versatile and be able to do

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:37.219
anything because our market is minimal and
extremely small,

00:03:37.219 --> 00:03:40.459
and so I always try to show them the reality.

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:45.909
I don't let them think "they will be a fashion
photographer or anything else."

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.370
It is very complicated to be only one thing
in this country.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:51.680
You've worked a lot in photography,
is there any specific area that you love more?

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.989
Fashion is what I like most.

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:59.200
And so you can imagine the rest of your career
as being a musician and a photographer?

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:07.439
Yes, that's how I see myself, just as long
as I'm capable of and this crisis allows me!
