Hey guys! This time you should listen VERY carefully!

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.700
Huh! Holy smoke!

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.500
Many great things are coming up in the near future

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.840
I can guarantee you that this is going to be awesome!

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.960
You know what's going to be awesome too?

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.240
An awesome collaboration between me, "Digges Ding" and YOU (The community)!

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.240
WHAT? Sounds quite complicated!

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.820
Oh hell no! Don't worry! I'll tell ya!

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:19.580
You know I love to translate international billboard charts into german cover versions since many years

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.720
and it seems that the artist 'Clean Bandit' noticed (and maybe followed) my work here in Germany

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.240
so now they challenged me for a competition together with 'Digges Ding'!

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.580
It's everything about creating a 'new' music video with a length of 1 minute for they billboard single 'Rather Be'

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.220
but with no frills, no cinema-production-like equipment, only with creativity

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.660
a smartphone (in this case a Lumia 830) and you - the spirit of my community.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.520
And if Clean Bandit is going to chose our video for the final ceremony we - as enthusiastic film makers -

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.220
have the chance to collaborate with Clean Bandits for their new music video (and yet to be released single).

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.620
Just wow!

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:13.080
'Pesh' from 'Digges Ding' and me, we did a little brainstorming before. We have the following idea:

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:16.480
We need YOUR help to get that video rockin'!

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.780
BUT HOW?

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.340
How? Well I think Pesh has something to tell you...

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.600
Thanks Alex! Got it?

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.980
Shoot a video, send it to us and this is what we want you to do:

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.140
Show us a nice big picture of your loved ones or just their names on a sheet of paper

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.800
Or how about a part of the original lyrics from 'Rather Be'?

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.640
Hold it straight into the camera, wait a couple of seconds, tear it apart 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.920
throw the paper shavings up in the air and enjoy the rain of pure paper. Awesome isn't it?

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.980
And lust but not least please record your video within one session not hard cuts.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.420
To make sure that your video gets full attention please use for all of your uploads the hashtag #LumiaMusic

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:56.519
That's all for now, back to Alex!

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.480
Big thanks to 'Digges Ding'! Alright you got it!

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.120
But if you have no cameras lying around, no problem. We also need your ideas as a written comment so bad!

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.640
Post your videos and ideas according to the video into the comments below and use the hashtag #LumiaMusic

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.980
or just use all of your favorites or all of the known social media sites but don't forget to use #LumiaMusic.

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:26.720
Oh and lust but not least: The best video and/or written idea submission get's a brand new Lumia 830 as a prize

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.140
We are very happy to have you with us and are excited to see your ideas and submissions.

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:35.620
And now have fun with watching the beginning teaser again! ;)

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.380
Because... you know... there were so many information between this and... you get the idea right? Well I hope...
