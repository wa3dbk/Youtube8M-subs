00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:05.850
I'm on the way to Trier and I got my guitar with me.

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:07.710
Also I decided to film my trip for you guys

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:13.000
since you've always asked for another tour-vlog.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:21.200
Unfortunately I'm not on tour right now, so I decided to take you with me on one of my summer concerts.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:29.300
Started my trip in Hamburg early in the morning and just now arrived in Koblenz.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.300
Going by car from here with Nicole, who's gonna sell my merchandise today.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.900
Off to Trier!

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.200
We're on the motorway now, still about 100km to go.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:57.200
As you can probably tell, I'm not with my band today, cause it's gonna be an acoustic concert.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:07.200
Only room for 300 people today, Posthof in Trier, and I'm gonna play for 90min.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:16.200
Just arrived in Trier, currently backstage, with something to eat and drink

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.200
Really cool location, sun is shining!

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.800
A sandwich for Schulte and then it's time to soundcheck!

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:47.300
Thanks a lot! No concert yet, only soundchecking.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.310
Did a quick soundcheck and now only have to wait until 7.30pm stagetime!

00:01:52.500 --> 00:02:01.300
Just checked the merchandise. Album, shirts and more.

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:05.500
Gonna sit down now and make a setlist!

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:29.600
That's my final setlist! I'm probably gonna change a few things while playing live though.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.709
Stagetime! Excited! My guitar is ready too! Let's go!

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.000
My name is Michael Schulte and I'm gonna play a few of my new songs for you!

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:23.400
Finished the concert, before it started to rain!

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.400
Really had a good time playing the acoustic set! Maybe we'll meet on one of these soon!

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:40.299
So Trier, if you want to, I'll be back. Let me know in the comments in what city I really need to come!
