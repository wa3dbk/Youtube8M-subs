00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.000
Hey folks!

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Today we’ll learn a new step of our choreography.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.680
And this is what it looks like once we’ve mastered all ten of them:

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:20.500
Today  I have the great pleasure to welcome Dounia Slimani.

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:23.600
The beauty, lifestyle and fashion influencer.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.200
Exactly

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.800
Alright, let’s get started!

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.800
Today we’ll learn the „V Travel Tip“

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.700
I’ll show you how it’s supposed to look like.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.500
We’ll basically stick to the movements from the V- Step

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.770
And later on

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.240
we’ll learn this

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.320
ok!

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.500
It looks way more complicated than it actually is.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.360
We only have four positions.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.280
We’ll start with position one.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.340
Starting point is always the closed V.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.680
Ok, like this.        Exactly

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.770
The first position woud be an open V  with our foot put out

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:06.570
like this.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.440
If possible with a straight leg.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.410
Yeah, it feels a bit weird at the beginning.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:18.480
So this would be position one

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:22.200
Keep in mind that we’ll travel with the left leg only,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.060
we just do a tap with the right

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.450
That means

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.860
we’ll try to only travel with the left leg

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.960
Maybe we’ll try to travel on one leg as an initial exercise.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.680
Our right leg is always a bit up in the air

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.500
And we try to move over using our other leg

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.500
ok

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.400
If this is position one,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.500
this would we position two

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.300
A closed V in the air

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.730
It’s a bit exhausting to hold the leg up like this.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:57.450
You guys might have notcied too :)

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.900
And three would be an open V again.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.600
So my leg goes down?

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.000
Yes, but not all the way. You just tap it.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.800
Put it down in front of  the other one...

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.800
Not that far,

00:02:11.839 --> 00:02:13.499
a bit further back.

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.789
Just a light tap

00:02:16.789 --> 00:02:19.359
 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.769
And the fourth

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.499
or „uncomfortable“ position is the open V again.

00:02:26.499 --> 00:02:29.000
And then we put our leg out again to position five.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.500
Position one

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:32.700
Position two

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.700
Position three

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.000
Postion four

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.900
Position five

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.569
ok

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.640
I’ll count us in a little faster...

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.599
We’ll just try

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:45.150
Six and seven and eight and

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.300
One and two and three and four and five and six and seven and eight

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.600
Perfect!

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:58.000
I find it amazing how you keep your balance. I always feel like I’m falling over.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
That’s just practice.

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:01.920
A lot of practice : )

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.889
Let’s try to let our arms join in.

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:09.309
I like to put my arm down here when I have my foot out

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:12.300
and point up when I put my leg back in.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:15.000
Just to get some dynamic in

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.049
One and two.

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.379
How do you do the movement from here? Just up?

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:22.200
It’s basically coming out of a turn

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.600
From a straight position up.

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:31.300
One and two. One and two.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.109
I’ll count us in again.

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.500
Six and seven and eight and

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.309
One and two and three and four and five and six and seven and eight.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.000
Well I think this looks great for a start.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.679
Yay!

00:03:45.679 --> 00:03:47.749
Shall we try once more with music?

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:49.400
Music, please.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.400
Five, six, seven, eight

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.900
One

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.500
I think you did a great job!

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.199
Thanks!

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:04.000
Next week will be a bit easier.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:10.149
We’ll try to turn the V Travel around.

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:13.259
Thank you so much!

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:14.399
Thanks to you guys too.

00:04:14.399 --> 00:04:18.000
I’m already looking forward to next week.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.939
Ciao

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.201
Here are the main elements of the V Travel Tip

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:24.900
No weight on the tapping leg

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.900
Constant travel with V step in the supporting leg

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.000
Alternating side and front tap

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.500
Next Thursday we’ll learn the „V Turn Tip“ together.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.000

I’d also like to know what progress you’re making
