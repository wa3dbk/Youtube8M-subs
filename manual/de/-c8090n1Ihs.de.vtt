00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.500
this is a honda civic sport

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:38.089

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:41.030

with a new middle box as well

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:51.129
what i had to end up doing

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:58.129
if you look here i toke the 2 bolts out from up there

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:04.439
here i had to get

00:03:04.439 --> 00:03:06.829
3 new nut and bolts

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.899
I put 3 new nut and bolts in

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:10.029
need 3 new nut and bolts

00:03:10.029 --> 00:03:13.869
used the old lamda sensors because the customer

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:17.059
customer wanted the old lamda sensors on

00:03:17.059 --> 00:03:18.700
so iv changed them

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:20.449
iv put some sealer around here

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:27.449
around the middle and a ring gasket around the middle as well a new one

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.569
if we go to the back of the car i put

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:34.209
a new

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.299

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:39.609
a new gasket in there as well as you can see

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.729
and iv had to buy a new bolt for it as well

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:45.749
this new bolt here

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:46.939
that snapped 

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.729
when it was coming out it was so tight

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:52.089
so there we go

00:03:52.089 --> 00:03:53.349
now im gonna 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:55.949
plug it back on to the machine

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:58.089
and we will see 

00:03:58.089 --> 00:03:59.819
what readings we get

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:00.579
and here is the new cat

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.000
