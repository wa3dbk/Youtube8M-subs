00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.000
We are with Skoda Octavia. 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Skoda manufactures very good cars since going under the umbrella of the VW Group. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The new Octavia is one of them. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Let's see if Octavia with its new design and with enlarged dimensions will increase its pretense?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Let's analyze it together...

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The new logo positioned on the extended bonnet and illumination group that has the new LED daylight lamps has earned the Octavia,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
which reflects the Skoda's new design language, totally new appearance. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
At the rear; that is exceedingly similar to its small sibling the Rapid, C shaped taillights as always draws attention. 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.000
Even though its size compared to the previous one has been increased Octavia looks more athletic. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
One of the strongest points of the Octavia is its boot. 

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The boot whose lid rises with the rear window as in the hatchbacks offers 590-liter loading capacity. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
In other words it can easily hold the luggage of a family of four. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Due to the wide opening of the lid loading is very easy.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.000
Octavia is very pretentious about its roominess.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Not only with its boot capacity but also with the living space of the interior which reinforce the claim. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Here a hand span of knee room and comfortable spacious headroom is offered. I think it is very successful. 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
As I've mentioned before the Skoda has gone quite a distance since joining the VW Group. 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
You can determine this easily by looking at the interior of the Octavia. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The soft plastic materials used and the quality of the ingredients that we are accustomed from the VW models raises the feeling of class. 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.000
The displays are legible and reaching to the controls and their usage is easy. 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.000
The touchscreen sensing when your hand approaches it is really something. 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:51.000
For your small items there are lots of places in front and at the back of the gear knob and in the door bins. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Now we come to the driving features of the Octavia. 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The Octavia is imported to our country with 3 different engine alternatives, discounting the RS models of course, they are 1.2 TSI and 1.4 TSI petrol engine and 1.6 TDI diesel engine. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:18.000
The Octavia that I'm driving has 1.6-liter diesel engine that develops 105 HP and 250 Nm of torque and it has 7-speed double clutch DSG gearbox. 

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.000
This engine is used in almost all of the models that are under the VW Group organization.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The engine's working character is successful, it satisfies the expectations of performance and frugality very well. 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.000
The Octavia is not hard put to reach high speeds. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
The DSG gearbox makes its decisions so well that fair traction is offered from the lower revs upwards. 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:45.000
Even though the engine works a bit noisy at the start the noise disappears as the engine warms up. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:54.000
In other words there is no engine noise problem in the interior. Only at very high speeds there is a little wind noise. 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I was with this car and have covered 350 km and most of it was in the city. 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
The trip computer shows me 6,7-liter average fuel consumption now. 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:15.000
This is not bad at all and on highway drives I can say that to lower it will not be hard. 

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.500
The suspensions fulfill their duties as handling and as comfortable ride successfully.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
You do not experience any difficulties at the curves that you drive with right speed. 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The absorption of the shock absorbers is quite good. 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:35.000
The comfort at asphalt surfaces and even at some rough surfaces of our country is high level. 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
The steering is not very sensitive but good enough to satisfy the requirement of this class. 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.000
The Skoda Octavia with its increased dimensions and more youthful design; shows that it is more pretentious. 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Large boot capacity and spacious interior is its real strong points. 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.000
The idea of buying the VW technologies and quality for more reasonable price sounds great. 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000
See you...
