00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:38.420
I can feel your wavering heart
I know that rain is tearing you apart

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:55.570
Your sorrow lingers through
You don't know what to do

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:58.829
But you can find
The brightness in your life

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.918
No matter how my words and thoughts
May be powerless for now

00:01:00.918 --> 00:01:01.918
May not be strong enough to feel the same
I still want to send this song

00:01:01.918 --> 00:01:08.970
To your tender loving heart
To reach out always and keep your flame

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.050
Your smile alone shines on you
Believe yourself so you can see

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:17.830
That we will always be together
Let yourself release the pain

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.370
Tomorrow will shine on you
Believe the world is by your side

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.000
Don't be afraid to say goodbye to your tears

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.229
Dreams that you have drawn in mind
Even the future maps you want to find

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.640
Are not yet to be found
The shadows are profound

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.950
A deeper sigh covers wishes, hopes and dreams
You can't feel the breath of spring

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.460
Or the light of summer days
As for now they are still too far to see

00:01:41.460 --> 00:02:16.940
But the world is by your side
To send love and pray for you

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:34.790
Please wait until we embrace your shoulder
s

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:43.260
Your smile alone shines on you
Believe yourself so you can see

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.510
That we will always be together
Let yourself release the pain

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:55.530
Tomorrow will shine on you
Believe the world is by your side

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.459
Don't be afraid to say goodbye to your tears

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:09.870
As for tomorrow as for tomorrow
I wonder if tears will fall from your chee

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:16.070
ks
Maybe tomorrow maybe tomorrow will be

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:25.160
A bright new day to bring back your love

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:41.340
Your smile alone shines on you
Believe yourself so you can see

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:58.729
That we will always be together
Let yourself release the pain

00:03:58.729 --> 00:04:26.730
Tomorrow will shine on you
Believe the world is by your side

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.050
Don't be afraid to say goodbye to your tears

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:37.530
You know that you are not alone
Your soul and braveness make you strong

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.660
We can unite and hold together
We can reach out for the sky

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.370
The sky that you draw in your mind
Together maybe we can find

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:57.750
We can build
A rainbow bridge

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:10.150
With a song of hope
