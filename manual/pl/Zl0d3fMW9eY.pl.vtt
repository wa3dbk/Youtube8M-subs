00:00:06.581 --> 00:00:10.081
Conservation and artistic bookbinding

00:00:11.034 --> 00:00:15.534
Some of the books we work with are valuable but heavily damaged.

00:00:19.083 --> 00:00:28.083
 Sometimes it is only when we disassemble a volume that losses 
and mould show up and we can see how far the damage goes.

00:00:31.206 --> 00:00:40.206
Professional conservation work can save the book and protect 
the rest of the collection from mould outbreaks and insect infestations.

00:00:44.775 --> 00:00:50.275
The pictures show book folios before and after conservation work.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.970
We are presenting the effects of a long conservation process:

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:04.180
cleaning, fungus treatment and pulp fills.

00:01:08.784 --> 00:01:12.584
Then the text block is sewn and bound.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.930
This leather binding was decorated using original ornaments and types from the 1930s.

00:01:25.473 --> 00:01:32.973
As a result the valuable album dedicated to a hero of the KoÅ›ciuszko uprising was given a new life.

00:01:33.216 --> 00:01:40.016
The great secret but also the pain of book conservation experts is to do it in such a way

00:01:40.949 --> 00:01:46.949
 that the tremendous work becomes as invisible as possible.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.200
The book looks almost like new.
