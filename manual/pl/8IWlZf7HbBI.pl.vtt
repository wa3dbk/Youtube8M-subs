00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hello

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.100
Today we will take basics of boxing and kickboxing

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.000
Another wards all hiting martial arts

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.000
Boxing position and guard

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:28.000
The easiest way to done a orthodox stand is this...

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:35.000
Feets together, then thurn right side 1/8

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Right leg goes back and sied,
(diagonally right sied)

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.000
back and sied,back and sied
(diagonally right sied)

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.000
slightly bending knees

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Twis right knee and right feet to the left side
(to the front)

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
As you can see shoulders turn front as well

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Now for the people who prefer hand fighting(boxing)

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Turn front leg (left leg) to right side like a boxing stand

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.000
If not just leave it straight

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.000
And i do have straight leag position

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Again, this time from behind

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Look a this:)

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Thurn, back nad sied

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
slightly bending knees

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.000
Thurn the leg

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.000
Thurn the shoulders

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Now everything should be obvious:)

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
The same for the left-hander

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.000
But other side

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.900
Hop

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
back and side (left side)
(diagonally)

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.000
slightly bending knnes

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.800
Thurn left legright side

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Front leg (right leg) can stay straigh

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:49.000
Ore goes to the left side

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:53.000
The same from back

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Hop

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.000
Back and side

00:01:58.002 --> 00:01:59.000
thurn feets right side

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The next stage is

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Guard

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.000
How we hold the hand to

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Successfully defence!

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
We already knew the leg position

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.000
First right hand

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.000
The fists

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.000
Maybe this

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.000
How we clamp the fists

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.500
As you know thumbs CAN'T gows in side of hand

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.000
Becouse you will break tem

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
During pounch...

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
First you clamp the fingest

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
then thumb

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Thumb is aut side of the fist

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
The same other hand

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
This bones

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.000
goes to

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.000
Right cheek

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.000
Like this

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.900
Important matter

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
the hand and elbow are not

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:44.000
golike this

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
or thus

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.800
It is straigh

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:49.000
Elbow is close to trunk

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.000
Left hand

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:53.100
Lift it upa

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.000
On the right hand level

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.000
Clamp the fist

00:02:57.200 --> 00:02:59.200
Look! I have elbows close to my body

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.500
Don't lift elbows up

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.900
Like this

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.800
It is a error

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.000
Elbovs heve to be very close to your body

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Lik this

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:06.000
The next thing is

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.000
To bent head

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Your chin should be close to chest

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Alsow bend your sholders

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Like this

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
It will give more secure uper body position

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
As you see

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:23.000
I have a hunch position

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I look benath my head:)

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.000
Important is thet this hand

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.000
Is covering my all right side

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
The head

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
And liver

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Here is liver

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000
In the right side of uper body

00:03:33.002 --> 00:03:34.000
Under right ribs

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It is very not pleasant place

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000
If you are hit there

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
If somobodi trays to hit me

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.000
I'm cover in this side

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.000
I don't have to do any movment

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.000
to be safe

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
I only heve to hold hard my hand

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
This is the guard

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Now look

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:50.000
