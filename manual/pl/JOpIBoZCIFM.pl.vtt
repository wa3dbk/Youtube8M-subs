00:00:05.272 --> 00:00:06.248
Dear Child,

00:00:07.414 --> 00:00:09.755
I see your tears you shed in hiding

00:00:10.821 --> 00:00:13.471
and I collect every one of them
in my wineskin,

00:00:14.541 --> 00:00:16.338
for they are so precious to Me.

00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:19.259
You are so dear in my sight.

00:00:20.731 --> 00:00:25.193
I hear every word of your suffering,
even before you pronounce it.

00:00:26.598 --> 00:00:28.083
And I want to encourage you.

00:00:29.884 --> 00:00:32.414
I know the burden
you carry on your shoulders

00:00:33.516 --> 00:00:35.051
because I bear it with you.

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:43.225
In the moments when you feel most lonely,
I am by your side.

00:00:45.647 --> 00:00:48.048
I have promised I will never leave you

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.629
and I will not step back from you.

00:00:54.298 --> 00:00:58.482
Even if you pass through the waters,
they will not sweep over you,

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.581
for I will be with you.

00:01:04.957 --> 00:01:08.478
Be strong and accept
whatever is brought upon you.

00:01:10.198 --> 00:01:16.276
Be strong and courageous!
Do not be afraid because I go with you!

00:01:18.834 --> 00:01:22.764
Even if your father or mother
forsakes you, I will receive you.

00:01:24.233 --> 00:01:26.002
I will give you refuge,

00:01:26.002 --> 00:01:29.233
in the day of trouble I will hide you
in the shelter of my tent.

00:01:31.516 --> 00:01:34.399
With me, you will go through
the darkest valley of your life

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:39.482
because I will be like
a lamp for your feet.

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:46.125
The darkness will cease to be dark
â€“ I will bring light to your life!

00:01:48.767 --> 00:01:50.728
Call on me in the day of trouble;

00:01:52.005 --> 00:01:54.972
I will deliver you, and you will honor me.

00:01:58.255 --> 00:02:02.370
Set your heart right and be steadfast.

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.421
I am with you to protect you.

00:02:09.107 --> 00:02:11.073
I will carry your weights.

00:02:12.685 --> 00:02:13.901
I will take care of you!

00:02:15.418 --> 00:02:18.835
I will do it
because you are my beloved Child.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.280
You are the creation of my hands

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.300
and I know you better than anybody else.

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:32.680
Do not concern yourself with great matter
or things too difficult for you.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.620
Every day passes so quickly.

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.200
Remember, you have only one life

00:02:40.005 --> 00:02:42.819
so live it in a good and wise way.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.980
It is too short to give yourself over
to sadness, so awake joy in your heart,

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.960
comfort it and remove sorrow far from you.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.500
Fill it with hope and rise!

00:03:00.251 --> 00:03:04.169
In quietness and trust is your strength.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.522
Consider my works
and see how much I have done for you.

00:03:12.956 --> 00:03:18.576
Yes, I am your God and there is no other.

00:03:20.526 --> 00:03:25.599
You will be blessed
because my strength is in you.

00:03:27.642 --> 00:03:29.707
Put your hope in me

00:03:30.308 --> 00:03:32.653
because without me you can do nothing

00:03:33.614 --> 00:03:35.933
and there are no things impossible for me.

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:40.255
Ask me and I will hear you.

00:03:41.423 --> 00:03:42.618
Remain in me

00:03:43.362 --> 00:03:45.989
and ask whatever you wish,
and I will give it to you.

00:03:48.011 --> 00:03:52.624
I can do immeasurably more
than you ask or imagine.

00:03:55.578 --> 00:03:57.804
Pour out your heart to me!

00:03:59.722 --> 00:04:04.525
If you repent, I will restore you
that you may stand before me.

00:04:06.382 --> 00:04:08.340
Leave your former way of life.

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:15.240
Come to me because I wait for you,
I grant you a return!

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.780
I will be waiting for you
filled with compassion.

00:04:20.905 --> 00:04:25.151
I will forgive your every mistake
and clean your heart.

00:04:27.211 --> 00:04:30.044
I am faithful and just,

00:04:31.549 --> 00:04:34.864
so confess your sins
and I will forgive you.

00:04:37.773 --> 00:04:42.873
I will remove your transgressions from you
as far as the east is from the west

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:48.302
and I will give you a new heart,
removing your heart of stone.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.640
Child, please
forgive those who have hurt you.

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:01.720
Forgive them so that I can forgive you.

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:06.340
Put your past behind you

00:05:07.169 --> 00:05:08.804
and I will bind up your wounds.

00:05:10.295 --> 00:05:15.302
I know it is difficult
but I myself set an example.

00:05:16.602 --> 00:05:19.160
Do not delay and do it now!

00:05:21.268 --> 00:05:24.141
Leave your past and look ahead of you

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.687
because I have a wonderful plan
for your life.

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:31.986
I have chosen you!

00:05:32.599 --> 00:05:36.348
If you follow my way,
I will work with you.

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.808
I myself am your way

00:05:42.364 --> 00:05:45.715
and in Me you will do deeds of valor.

00:05:48.634 --> 00:05:50.518
Will you follow me?

00:05:52.292 --> 00:05:54.125
I am waiting for your answer.

00:05:56.491 --> 00:05:57.789
Your Dad,

00:05:59.857 --> 00:06:01.502
God
