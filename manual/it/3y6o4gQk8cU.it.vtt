00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.530
Hi, we’re on Eeevolution.it,

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.450
it’s August and
 it’s really really hot

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.414
but we have an 8-inch 
 Galaxy Tab 3 to test.

00:00:06.414 --> 00:00:08.673
It will be available
 in Italy since September,

00:00:08.673 --> 00:00:12.549
but I bought one in the US, 
tested it for about ten days

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:14.490
and now I’m ready to show you
 how it’s gone.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.689
This is the thinnest and most stylish
 tablet of the Galaxy Tab 3 series:

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:24.518
8-inch screen, 7.4 mm thick,
314 grams of weight

00:00:24.518 --> 00:00:31.526
and its build quality is among the best
 in the Tablets’ field in 2013.

00:00:31.526 --> 00:00:36.992
This brown version is very nice,
 with copper finishes

00:00:36.992 --> 00:00:42.814
and a texture under the glossy paint,
giving more elegance to the whole device.

00:00:42.814 --> 00:00:48.488
Online you can find also the white 
and silver versions, more classic.

00:00:48.488 --> 00:00:54.397
The whole attention is on the
 8-inch display, resolution 1280x800 pixel:

00:00:54.397 --> 00:00:58.147
this density allows to read 
smaller texts too.

00:00:58.147 --> 00:01:01.322
The edges are flush with the frame,

00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:05.027
brightness and viewing angles
 are great,

00:01:05.027 --> 00:01:12.875
ergonomics is the best 
i've seen in this kind of format,

00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:20.428
‘cause with its rounded edges
 it perfectly fits your hands…

00:01:20.428 --> 00:01:28.204
both landscape and portrait mode, 
when you read or watch photos…

00:01:28.204 --> 00:01:35.879
it’s really pleasant to the touch 
and easy to use.

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:41.442
8-inch format is great,
display is, we can say, full screen…

00:01:41.442 --> 00:01:43.963
because you see buttons are on the frame,

00:01:43.963 --> 00:01:48.027
they’re capacitive except the central one, 
they’re not on Android,

00:01:48.027 --> 00:01:50.036
so it actually lacks the OS bar.

00:01:50.036 --> 00:01:56.229
Then we have many exclusive features
 just for models like this…

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:04.184
this is Multi-View, a little heavy
 for processor and performances,

00:02:04.184 --> 00:02:09.452
but it’s very nice for contents…

00:02:09.452 --> 00:02:13.951
and multimedia is also why 8-inch tablets 
are a step ahead of 7-inch.

00:02:13.951 --> 00:02:18.705
Well, I guess you’ve seen 
I really like this 8-inch Galaxy Tab 3…

00:02:18.705 --> 00:02:22.187
I like the format, 
I like how easy to the hand it is,

00:02:22.187 --> 00:02:25.166
I like stability, its build quality…

00:02:25.166 --> 00:02:27.238
but what is its behavior
 in the everyday use,

00:02:27.238 --> 00:02:29.736
how does Android work and
 what’s the user experience?

00:02:29.736 --> 00:02:30.928
Let’s have a look.

00:02:30.928 --> 00:02:34.458
Samsung included all the features
 of its TouchWiz interface,

00:02:34.458 --> 00:02:38.321
which makes this Android system
 actually different

00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:40.237
from what we’re used to,
 the standard Google.

00:02:40.237 --> 00:02:43.870
 Among all the options, some useful 
some not so much,

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.155
there's the Screen Mirroring 
which allows you to send video/audio signal

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:50.599
to an external TV without any wire,
just using Wi-Fi,

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:53.254
compatible only with 
Samsung devices though,

00:02:53.254 --> 00:02:59.982
and Power-Saving mode which 
allows you to save battery life,

00:02:59.982 --> 00:03:03.569
disabling some functions.

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.877
Processor is 1.5 GHz Exynos 4, dual-core,
 with 1.5 GB of RAM…

00:03:08.877 --> 00:03:14.745
it works good enough, but it’s a pity
 to see that great,

00:03:14.745 --> 00:03:19.001
well - conceived device, 
supported by hardware like this.

00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:26.512
Results are good anyway, 
except some little hangup, some delay…

00:03:26.512 --> 00:03:29.943
it’s good for Web navigation, 
it's fluid

00:03:29.943 --> 00:03:36.874
it works well with Full HD videos, 
the main formats - don't ask too much… -

00:03:36.874 --> 00:03:43.364
Mali400 MP2 as graphic card allows 
to play the main games,

00:03:43.364 --> 00:03:48.302
the latest and most common
 for this kind of device.

00:03:48.302 --> 00:03:52.939
One of the most interesting things
 is the GPS, it’s great…

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:59.551
indoor too, where other tablets 
can’t get a satellite lock…

00:03:59.551 --> 00:04:02.734
 here you see… 
19 at this moment.

00:04:02.734 --> 00:04:10.391
The two cams, 1.2 MP front-cam 
and 5 MP back-cam, are adequate…

00:04:10.391 --> 00:04:14.881
middle-low level, good for video-calls
 and photos

00:04:14.881 --> 00:04:18.743
but we’ve seen better
 in even cheaper devices.

00:04:18.743 --> 00:04:20.946
The audio system is great too,

00:04:20.946 --> 00:04:26.528
the two speakers on the side
 can give a good volume…

00:04:32.374 --> 00:04:34.616
but it’s true that, 
since they’re both on the same side,

00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:39.938
you can easily cover them 
while using the tablet…

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.229
The built-in IR sensor is useful too,

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:49.392
which let you use the tablet 
just like a remote control…

00:04:49.392 --> 00:04:55.052
pre-installed also some apps to manage
 the TV schedule,

00:04:55.052 --> 00:04:59.188
to plan recording and so on…

00:04:59.188 --> 00:05:03.740
There’s the OTG support for microUSB too,
 down here,

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.002
to charge it from PC and connect
 hard-disks, keys,

00:05:09.002 --> 00:05:10.790
mouses and external keyboards…

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:16.797
In conclusion, let’s talk about battery:
 it’s 4550 mAh.

00:05:16.797 --> 00:05:23.116
More than 5 hours of heavy use: 
full brightness, Wi-Fi, notifications,

00:05:23.116 --> 00:05:30.553
no power-saving mode… 
I think you could reach 7 or 8 hours

00:05:30.553 --> 00:05:33.416
of battery life setting these parameters…

00:05:33.416 --> 00:05:36.732
Power-saving during stand-by is good,

00:05:36.732 --> 00:05:40.954
and I've been using it a whole week-end 
with notifications for e-mails and browser…

00:05:43.122 --> 00:05:48.335
Well, it’s not like the best tablet 
of the field (Nexus7 for example)

00:05:48.335 --> 00:05:52.459
but battery life is definitely not
 a problem for this 8-inch Tab 3.

00:05:52.459 --> 00:05:55.287
That’s all, Galaxy Tab 3 8-inch
 will be on sale

00:05:55.287 --> 00:06:01.350
in Italy since September,
 299 Euros as list price.

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:07.671
It’s not perfect, we’ve seen, it could be
 more powerful and also cheaper,

00:06:07.671 --> 00:06:12.773
 that’s true, but it’s a great tablet, 
nice and comfortable.

00:06:12.773 --> 00:06:16.734
I suggest you take it into consideration 
even if you’re looking for a 7-inch,

00:06:16.734 --> 00:06:23.985
‘cause it’s very compact 
and plus you have a bigger screen,

00:06:23.985 --> 00:06:30.561
really useful while reading 
or using multimedia.

00:06:30.561 --> 00:06:33.091
For more info, details and benchmarks

00:06:33.091 --> 00:06:35.610
have a look at the complete review 
on Eeevolution.it

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.500
Bye!
