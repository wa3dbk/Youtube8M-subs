00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.880
Phoenix

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:32.149
Phoenix flies above the sky, Through the clouds
she dances her cryin'

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:45.480
Her tears cares the earth scares, Her mind
makes happy all the world.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:01:02.770
They said that I was crazy when I wanted it
around the world, Through the House of Wings

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:14.799
I Fly high,
Now you don't know times they re gonna change,

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:28.729
but now I feel It better,

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:46.930
1st Chorus:
Have you ever seen the shine of her heart,

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:57.750
with her presence I'll find a true sense in
this life,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:08.240
I'll be dazzled by her eyes and I ll find..
the truth, the sense of life

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:24.490
I don't need wealth or money to be happy,
peace in this life I can't find,

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:47.950
Now that I don't know what It's right to say,
in this moment I only have to hope.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:03:03.180
2nd Chorus:
From the stars she looks inside your heart,

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:42.060
She gives you the things in life you can't
find,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:04:31.240
I'll be dazzled by her eyes and I'll find..

00:04:31.240 --> 00:05:15.110
All I know is If you trust me, I'll ever trust
you..

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:55.319
All I know is that I need her, to find satisfy
..
