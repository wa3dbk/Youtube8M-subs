Hi girls!
Today I show you how to create a donut-rabbit

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.929
Hi girls!
Today I show you how to create a donut-rabbit

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:15.129
needed: brown polymer clay  - polymer clay colored - Pearls - Fimo liquid

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:16.230
needed: brown polymer clay  - polymer clay colored - Pearls - Fimo liquid

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.669
needed: brown polymer clay  - polymer clay colored - Pearls - Fimo liquid

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:21.699
needed: brownpolymer clay  - polymer clay colored - Pearl s - Fimo liquid

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.039
start with the brown ball and flatten

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.060
start with the brown ball and flatten

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.760
start with the brown ball and flatten

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.530
take the other 2 brown balls and realize the ears

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:42.940
take the other 2 brown balls and realize the ears

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.800
take the other 2 brown balls and realize the ears

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.200
take the other 2 brown balls and realize the ears

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.950
take the other 2 brown balls and realize the ears

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.100
Now we apply the ears to the donut

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.500
Now we apply the ears to the donut

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.260
Now we apply the ears to the donut

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:11.630
take the colored polymer clay and stretch it

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.920
take the colored polymer clay and stretch it

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.400
Now we take the rabbit and we apply the sheet of colored polymer clay

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.640
Now we take the rabbit and we apply the sheet of colored polymer clay

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.180
Now we take the rabbit and we apply the sheet of colored polymer clay

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.520
Now we take the rabbit and we apply the sheet of colored polymer clay

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.840
Now we take the rabbit and we apply the sheet of colored polymer clay

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.710
with the knife do the outline

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.690
with the knife do the outline

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:43.430
with the knife do the outline

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:48.370
with the knife do the outline

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.520
removing the excess, then with your hands work the colored polymer clay to make it adhere to the brown

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.390
removing the excess, then with your hands work the colored polymer clay to make it adhere to the brown

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.230
removing the excess, then with your hands work the colored polymer clay to make it adhere to the brown

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:08.639
removing the excess, then with your hands work the colored polymer clay to make it adhere to the brown

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.909
removing the excess, then with your hands work the colored polymer clay to make it adhere to the brown

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.299
removing the excess, then with your hands work the colored polymer clay to make it adhere to the brown

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:16.699
removing the excess, then with your hands work the colored polymer clay to make it adhere to the brown

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:22.759
removing the excess, then with your hands work the colored polymer clay to make it adhere to the brown

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:27.669
Now pierce the donut

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:30.719
Now pierce the donut

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:33.299
Now pierce the donut

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.099
Now pierce the donut

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:42.099
Now pierce the donut

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:45.519
then take the liquid polymer clay and smeared on colored polymer clay

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:49.489
then take the liquid polymer clay and smeared on colored polymer clay

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:51.799
then take the liquid polymer clay and smeared on colored polymer clay

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.259
then take the liquid polymer clay and smeared on colored polymer clay

00:02:55.259 --> 00:03:02.259
then take the liquid polymer clay and smeared on colored polymer clay

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:09.989
in the end we take the pearls and apply

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.009
in the end we take the pearls and apply

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:15.729
in the end we take the pearls and apply

00:03:15.729 --> 00:03:22.729
in the end we take the pearls and apply

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.819
Now our donut-rabbit is ready!

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:37.509
Now our donut-rabbit is ready!

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:38.469
Now our donut-rabbit is ready!
