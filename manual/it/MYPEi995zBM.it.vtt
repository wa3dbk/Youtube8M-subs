The amazing “30-40 bites diet”
The new extraordinary diet of the 30-40 bites,

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:15.240
or the 30-40 chewed, it seems something already
said, but when things are so often repeated,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.599
they make you think about it, because this
means that really works.

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:27.289
But perhaps you’ve never done it before
because nobody ever told you to do it like

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.079
I’m telling you to do now.

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:36.480
So, bear in mind this is an extraordinary
diet, it is more so based on how to eat rather

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.430
than what to eat.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.660
So let’s concentrate on how to eat.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.670
I’ll give you several rules and videos to
watch; this is the first and the most important

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.560
because it opens this sequence, then you’ll
see that each video has precious information;

00:00:52.560 --> 00:01:00.610
rule 1. to start the 30-40 bites diet; we
must sit at table, do not eat standing up

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:13.039
but eat sitting down I stress on this because
many people do that, put your legs below the

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:16.770
table in a proper position, in the way we
always should eat!

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.060
Drink two glass of water before eating, at
this point anything you’ll decide to eat,

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.020
you chew it between 30-40 times.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:32.729
You must begin to count, there’s no point
saying that I do chew my food, or that you

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:33.729
know it’s right to chew it.

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:42.650
Chew the food between 30-40 times shifting
the food from one side to the other side of

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:43.650
your mouth.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.109
So do chew it 30-40 times, note you can do
it with almost everything, I’ve been testing

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:49.110
it myself for days.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.170
It’s amazingly effective; you’ll feel
new amazing sensations.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.090
I just want to remind you the importance of
this concept, I’m about to tell you; Our

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.889
stomachs don’t have teeth and taste buds;
therefore you must bear in mind from the moment

00:01:59.889 --> 00:02:08.830
you eat, anything you eat like many people
do is engulfing food, you won’t even taste

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.840
and digest it.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:17.380
Pre-digesting process starts in our mouths
first but we’ll explain in the next videos

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.670
with many other important things.

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:29.220
I’m gonna ask you this only; test it for
at least 7 days, every time you sit at the

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.319
table do not speak, explain to people that
you’re doing this diet and chew it, you

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.870
can chew 30-40 times not just solid food like
French toast, I’ve been able to chew a little

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:44.159
cake 30 times, the exceptional sensations
are that you’ll feel much lighter and more

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:45.159
energetic.

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:47.460
Try it and let me know how you get on!

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.460
Chew it the food correctly!

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.599
Please do email me, below the video you’ll
find the link to my personal Facebook page,

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.819
I do promptly reply so if you click “I like”
and give me some feedback, Please do so because

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.760
I’m sure you’ll be able to eat less and
feeling sated (full), taste the food better

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.160
and feel more energetic.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.049

videos, in the meantime you can subscribe
