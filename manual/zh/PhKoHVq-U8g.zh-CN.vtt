00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Hi everyone, welcome to this episode of Amanda Tastes.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Today I am making this dish for summer, a Steak Salad.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Here I am using a filet steak, and it's okay to use sirloin in this dish, too.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:21.000
For the sides, I have celery, bell pepper, spring onion, coriander, cherry tomatoes, peanuts, bird eye chili, basil, radish, and lime.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
For the salad dressing, I have vegetable oil, fish sauce, garlic and palm sugar.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Today I am embracing a Thai flavor in the salad dressing, so I am using palm sugar. It has a creamy and coconut flavor. You may use brown sugar instead.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Cut palm sugar into fine pieces.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Peel garlic, and cut into pieces.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Same goes for bird eye chili.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And lime, give it a roll with your hand so it will be juicy, and then cut in half.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Add the garlic, bird eye chili and palm sugar in a mortar.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Add in lime juice.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Mash with pestle.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Mash them into very fine mixture. 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Add in fish sauce and oil.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Now a Thai salad dressing is done.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Put peanuts in a pan, stir-fry them until they get some color.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Now, cook the steak.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I have explained how to cook steaks in a previous episode.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Season both sides with coarse salt and ground pepper.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Drizzle some olive oil.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Make sure oil both sides.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Cook it immediately, and no marinade needed.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Preheat the pan over medium to high, and put the steak in.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
You can hear the steak sizzling right away.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Sear one side for about 1 min.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
And then flip over.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Cook the other side for a min.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
And don’t forget the sides.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Keep doing so, 1 min for one side.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:08.000
There is a common way to tell you how a steak is cooked. Put your thumb and index finger together, and touch your palm.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
The feeling represents how the steak is cooked, index finger means rare.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
When you put your middle finger and thumb together, the touch of your palm is the same as a medium rare steak, ring finger and thumb is the same as a medium steak, and little finger and thumb is the same as medium well.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000
So poke the steak with your finger, and compare it with your palm. And them you will know.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000
Well, as for me, I think it's not very accurate to test with your own palm. Better use others palms.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Now it's done. Leave it to rest in a bowl.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Let's prepare the sides. Cut peanuts into small pieces.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Slice celery stick.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Cut bell pepper into pieces.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Slice radish.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Slice the white part of a spring onion.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Cut cherry tomatoes into halves.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Put the side vegetables together in a large bowl.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Mince coriander and basil.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
Our fillet steak is ready.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Do not discard the gravy yet. Set it aside.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Cut the steak into thin slices.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Mix and toss those sides.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Get them in a plate.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Place steak slices over the sides.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000
Add the gravy from fillet steak into our salad dressing.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Mix well and then pour this Thai dressing over the salad.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Finish touch with some peanuts. Now it's ready to serve.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000
I am making this tutorial because I want to show you there are so many ways to serve a steak.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000
You can use vinaigrette instead of salad dressing in this dish.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000
I have mentioned the recipe of a vinaigrette in my potato salad episode.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:03.000
In such a hot summer day, a Thai dish really cools down the heat. It's refreshing and appetizing.

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:14.000
The Thai flavor balances acidity, spiciness and sweetness together. So it gives you a light and refreshing feeling on a plate.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:19.000
