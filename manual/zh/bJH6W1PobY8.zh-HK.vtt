Janice Yan 閻奕格 - Can't Take My Eyes Off You

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.560
You're just too good to be true

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.840
Can't take my eyes off you

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.320
You feel like heaven to touch

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.860
I wanna hold you so much

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.340
At long last love has arrived

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.760
And I thank God I'm alive

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.500
You're just too good to be true

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.320
Can't take my eyes off you

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.740
Pardon the way that I stare

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.380
There's nothing else to compare

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:01.020
The sight of you leaves me weak

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.760
There are no words left to speak

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.740
But if you feel like I feel

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.600
Please let me know that it's real

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.380
You're just too good to be true

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:20.460
Can't take my eyes off you

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.740
I love you baby,and if it's quite all right

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.180
I need you baby to warm the lonely night

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.640
