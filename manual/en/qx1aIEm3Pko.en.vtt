00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.240
The narrative arc of “Hide/Seek” is fairly
easy and comprehensible to understand.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.920
It begins in a position of repression and
oppression as the very concept to the homosexual

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.340
was defined.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.260
Artists working against that restriction.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.450
And it moves forward through the century to
1969 with the emergence after the Stonewall

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.560
Riots of the modern gay liberation movement.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.190
We have art under wartime, if you will, and
then art under liberation.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:33.250
The tragic disruption of this narrative, and
it's a small disruption given the overall

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.500
pandemic that occurred, is of course AIDS.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.480
We were faced with the curatorial decision
of how we would handle that.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.040
We could have stopped in 1969 and done art
before liberation.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.380
We could have stopped in 1983 and done art
before AIDS.

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.399
And then we just decided no, that we were
going to do this, that it was part of the

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.890
experience and we would take it all the way
through this century hoping to find an optimistic

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.450
ending as we move ourselves through a period
of the pandemic and the plague years.

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:07.110
But we did have to account for the art that
was produced under AIDS, and in many ways

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.700
the art deepens and becomes more moving and
more powerful.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.740
Nowhere more so than in this “Unfinished
Painting” by Keith Haring.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.470
Haring, of course, a graffiti artist whose
cartoon-like figures popped up in the subways

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.980
in Manhattan and was taken up and it became
an overnight success.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.800
And this was his last painting, “Unfinished
Painting,” with his little man woven into

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:34.280
the tapestry, woven into the fabric of the
carpet, a painting that couldn't be completed,

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.860
exemplifying the state of a society which
was unable to reach its full potential precisely

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.100
because it was blindsided by this horrible
disease.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.420
The great Anglo American poet Thom Gunn said
I always thought the term gay community was

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:52.220
bullshit until it started to disappear, a
notion again from Anthony Goicolea of finding

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.869
a home in a world destroyed by the terrible
progress of this disease.

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.670
And it's impossible to look at Keith Haring’s
painting without thinking of the AIDS quilt,

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.670
without thinking of this great project of
memorialization which exemplifies the lives

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.549
of the famous and the not so famous: the common
people, the many victims in the individual

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:13.879
quilts that were created so tragically upon
their loss.
