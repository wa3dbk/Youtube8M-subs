00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.910
 

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.800
SAM BENEDICT: Welcome to SBCU,
we're going to talk about the

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.890
Roubaix and why we believe
smoother is faster.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:15.080
This bike is for the rider that
wants to go big, wants to

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.900
go long miles, but also still
wants a performance machine,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.990
something that's going to be
fun to ride, and actually

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.240
pretty darn fast.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.890
 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:26.690
The Roubaix is the smoothest
ride that we have.

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.110
This is important, because at
the end of the ride, you want

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:29.990
to feel fresh.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:32.259
You had a great ride, you
want to feel good.

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:34.680
And we get this from three
places on the Roubaix.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:35.925
The first one is the geometry.

00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:38.950
This is very unique for the
Roubaix, and if you look at a

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:40.940
couple key places, you'll
see that we

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.840
have a taller head-tube.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.840
This is about 20 to 30
millimeters taller than, say,

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.030
a traditional-style bike.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.630
This is going to give you just
a little bit more upright

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.780
ride, take a little bit of
pressure off the back on those

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.760
long miles.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.360
You're going to feel
fresh at the end.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.860
The bottom bracket, just a
little bit lower than you

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.290
would normally see
on most bikes.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:00.160
This is going to be a more
confident ride, going to make

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.120
you feel good over
the long haul.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.360
And then the chain-stays, just a
little bit longer than you'd

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.450
see on your traditional-style
bikes.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.840
This is going to be more
comfortable, more stable over

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.530
those long miles.

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.100
The second part of how this bike
is smoother is the frame

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.910
construction.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:19.080
Now, the head-tube and
the fork, this is

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.350
an important junction.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.290
You're going to see a lot of
vibration, a lot of input from

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.260
the road here.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.190
We actually have size specific
head-tubes and

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:28.690
forks on these bikes.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.920
On the smaller bikes, you're
going to have smaller diameter

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.390
bearings, so it's not going to
be as rough and bouncing

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.810
around, and on the bigger
bikes-- for the taller,

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.210
heavier riders-- you're
actually going to

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.660
get a bigger bearing.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.230
So it's going to be a little bit
stiffer for those riders,

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:46.960
so specific for the size
rider and the size

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.530
frame that you have.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.650
And also in the construction
in the back here, this is

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.670
where you're going
to get a lot of

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:53.580
compliance out of the frame.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.430
That's its ability to move up
and down and accept those

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.070
bumps and vibrations that
you're going to

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.130
get from the road.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.060
And it's important that when
you put the top-tube, the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.080
c-tube, and the seat-stays
together that they work

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.470
together to get the compliance
out of the frame, so it's a

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.870
comfortable, good ride.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.580
The last part of
this is Zertz.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.230
You'll see the Zertz on
the seat-stays back

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.790
here and the forks.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.420
And what this does, this
absorbs vibration.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.880
There's a lot of vibration that
comes up off the road

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:24.940
through your wheels, and
eventually those get

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.060
transmitted into your hands,
into your butt, and those wear

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.670
you out over the long haul.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.400
You're not going to notice
it in the first couple of

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.720
minutes, but after a long time
on the road, this is going to

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.670
make your more tire,
more fatigued, and

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.720
we don't want that.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.740
So Zertz, it absorbs those
vibrations, takes them away

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:43.610
from you, keeps you feeling
fresh as a daisy all day long.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.940
 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.020
So let's also remember that
the Roubaix is faster.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:51.990
This bike is the king
of the cobbles.

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.180
It's won the Paris-Roubaix
race so many times.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.360
This thing wants to get up
and go, just as much as a

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:59.850
comfortable bike as well.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.100
So let's look at the three
places that we're able to give

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:03.190
the speed to this bike.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.380
One, it's freaking
lightweight.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.570
925 grams in the S-Works, that's
going to fly uphills,

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:10.960
super lightweight.

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.760
And if you look at the
construction of the bike, it's

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.560
the tippy top, the
best we can do.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:18.330
This is a FACT IS construction,
top-tube,

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.480
head-tube, down-tube,
all one piece.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:25.360
You got your one piece BB
chain-stay, your c-tube, so

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:26.870
these can all be built
individually.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:27.770
Where do you need the weight?

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:28.980
Where do you need
the stiffness?

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:31.210
Where do you want the compliance
of the bike?

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.480
And then the last part
are the seat-stays.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.220
We wanted to change these
up a little bit.

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:38.130
These are a little bit
straighter than they've been

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.710
before, a little bit wider
stance, so more triangulated.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:44.430
It's going to give you a stiffer
rear end, so when

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.800
you're stopping on the pedals,
it's going to get up and go,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:48.710
but still compliant at
the end of the day.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.130
 

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.580
So let's talk about some
of my favorite

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.290
pieces of the Roubaix.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.020
The first one is the gearing.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.460
This bike, long haul, going big,
long climbs, you got to

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:01.840
have the right gearing
on the bike.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.490
So this is your compact-style
gearing, 50/34, plenty of

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:08.970
teeth to get the speed that you
need for when that sprint

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.810
happens, but nice and low
gearing to get you up and over

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:13.330
those big tall hills.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.660
The second part on some of the
bikes is the C-GR seatpost,

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.190
freaking brilliant design, this
gives you 18 millimeters

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.930
of compliance.

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:24.190
That's going to move you up and
down, going to keep you

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:27.100
nice and comfortable, and it
looks pretty freaking rad too.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.960
And the last part is what that
C-GR is attached to, the Body

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:32.300
Geometry saddle.

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.620
Long day in the saddle guys, you
need to keep blood flowing

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.130
to wear blood needs to flow.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:40.570
We want things to work today,
and in the future.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.260
Body Geometry saddles are
going to keep you happy.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:44.190
That's the Roubaix.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.220
If you want to go long, you want
to go big, have a good

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:50.910
time on the bike, but also have
great performance twist,

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:52.160
this is your bike.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:05:00.651
