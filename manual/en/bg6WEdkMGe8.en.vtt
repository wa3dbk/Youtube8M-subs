00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.380
Well come on over here then.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.620
What we're going to do is we're going to do a progression. So get some chalk on your hands.

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:18.100
So the great thing about the CrossFit program, you guys, is that it's infinitely scalable.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.180
You can take someone like Scott who's winning TV shows and dominating local competitions, same thing with

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.220
Sheriff Lott, or you can take someone that's never climbed a rope before

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.540
and give them a great stimuli. This is called the no-leg rope climb.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.540
So her legs are never going to leave the ground, it's super safe,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.160
but she gets the stimuli of the rope climb so here's how we're going to start.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.380
You're just going to sit with the rope between your legs and you're going to use your legs just like on that jumping pull-up.

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:48.940
And I just want you to climb hand over hand while using your legs.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.640
So it looks like this—you're going to climb but you're going to stand at the same time.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.480
So using your legs and using your arms—great big pulls.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.020
Good. Now, she executed that like a true deputy sheriff.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.400
Because she did it the harder way. Did you guys see the difference between the way I did it and the way she did it?

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.520
Her legs were straight. So that's actually the next progression.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.740
What I did was I had a bent leg, which is easiest,

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:25.320
she's like, "Nah, it's too easy for me." She went straight-legged

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:28.780
and she also leaned back, which makes it even more difficult.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.300
So that's outstanding. Do one more of those.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.160
Then we'll see if we can get her off the ground.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.000
Student: Good luck with that one!

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.240
Great job, great job. Now, you guys see that range of motion?

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.400
If you were going to pull me and get behind me to handcuff me, how are you going to grab my arm?

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.220
What's that hand going to do? Student: It's going to come over here. You see that range of motion she just did?

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.240
That grip is no different than the grip she took on the rope.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.580
It just had a different plane. So here's that grip at the plane she grabbed me, here's that grip at the plane she grabbed the rope.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.900
It's the exact same thing. So here she is climbing the rope in the gym,

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:13.480
she takes that same strength she's developed, that hand strength,

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.980
she goes on the street, man, she's going to be sending guys left and right across the parking lot.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.820
OK, ready to get off the ground?

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.700
Alright, we're going to get her off the ground. So here's what we're going to do first. You right- or left-handed?

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.600
Student: Right-handed.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.300
OK, take your right leg, you're going to wrap it around the rope,

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:34.200
and inside. That's all you're going to do, just do that once or twice.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.720
When you get that foot inside, curl that toe up. Good. One more time like that.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.100
Good, one more time so it's kind of muscle memory.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.200
Perfect. Now, you're going to do the same thing but I want you to reach your hands up as high as you can,

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.900
tippy toes, wrap and stand on that rope.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.620
So what I'm doing is I'm locking my feet and I'm not using my hands but I'm super safe and I'll

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.920
spot you.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.960
So tippy toes. Student: Tippy toes first. Yes, reach up as high as you can,

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.040
wrap that foot around, little pull and jump and stand on the rope.

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.080
Lock that foot in. Good.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.640
Student: I'm as high as I can go. That's OK, do it again.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.940
I'll give you a little boost. I want you to grab as high as you can,

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.180
and you're going to kind of do like on that pull-up bar, you're going to jump and pull and you're going to stand

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.380
on that rope.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.900
You're doing great, you're doing great.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:42.820
Yeah! And stand on that rope. Good! You are off the ground.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.820
Give her a hand, that's legit.

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.780
So here's how that progresses—and this would kind of be your homework—

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:53.500
you just do a series of those jumps. So you're going to lock your hands

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.760
you're going to jump and pull, stand on the rope.

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.440
My hands are right where I left them so now I raise my hands

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.760
Little jump and pull, stand.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:04.400
I'm a little bit higher. Look at my hands. Again.

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:07.780
Higher. Want to try?

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.340
I'll give you a spot if you need it. You're doing fine.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:13.820
Just getting off the ground like that is perfect. There it is!

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.340
Step on the rope. Yeah! Look at that!

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.420
Now stand up. Open your legs, stand up. Oh, she's doing no-leg rope climbs.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.120
You're doing great!

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.760
(applause)

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:35.020
I love it! Class: Keep going!

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.780
When you come down, hand over hand. No sliding.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.860
There you go. Good job. Hand over hand.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.640
Give her a round of applause, that is awesome. (applause)

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.800
Give me some skin! How cool is that?

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.180
That's outstanding. First rope climb! That's outstanding.
