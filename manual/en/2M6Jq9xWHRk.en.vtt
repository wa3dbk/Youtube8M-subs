00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.199
Hey guys, what's going on?

00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.309
This is Tripp from TrippAdvice.com and today
we're talking about male fashion advice with

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:07.559
Kimberly Seltzer.

00:00:07.559 --> 00:00:12.480
She is a dating and makeover expert from EliteImageMakeovers.com.

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.560
And today on video number four, we're talking
about how to wear a sport coat and a shirt,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:18.610
just like this.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.890
So here's the thing about sport coats.

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.680
It goes back to if you watched the other video
about your frame, it's really important to

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.860
know your frame.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:33.960
Tripp has a very thin frame as you know and
what's important for him is to have something

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.880
that fits him really well.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.310
This jacket fits him amazingly well.

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.500
You also, by the way, could do a double breasted
jacket.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.820
It's not really trending right now, so it's
not...Yeah I feel it looks better to do the

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.020
two buttons.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.020
Yes.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.050
Double breasted looks a little old.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.410
Yeah, it's a little old.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.100
It's a little old fashioned.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.239
However, I'm just saying, you could handle
it if it ever goes back in, whereas guys who

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:01.270
are heavier set should avoid that.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.979
So again, it's all about adding bulk.

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:12.930
The fact that he's layering it with a nice
colored shirt underneath actually the pattern

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.930
as well is creating a nice bulk to him.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.690
You'll also notice that if you want to turn
around for your audience, the back of his

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.780
jacket is fitting him really well.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.390
You want to make sure that it's hitting your
shoulders at a good length, because sometimes

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.659
it will either be too baggy up here, it doesn't
fit across the shoulder, but this is fitting

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.429
him almost perfect without tailoring, but
I do want to mention, you can turn back around

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:44.040
unless you want to do the rest of the video
turned...

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:51.920
A lot of times, people who are smaller frame
don't want to worry about tailoring, but the

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.740
thing is you'll have a better cut.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:59.200
I'd rather see you get something that fits
you all the other areas and just do a little

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.219
bit of tailoring to make it that perfect fit.

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:07.240
Okay but what about guys who don't have this
thin frame.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.940
They're a little bit bigger.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:14.440
What are some tips for them so they can wear
sport coats and shirts like this that will

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:15.780
still make them look good.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:16.780
Definitely.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.870
Well this style is still really good for bulkier
men, but I would definitely, if you want to

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.209
take it off, definitely I would tend to wear
it open.

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:35.060
Another thing about it is that see how he
has his shirt tucked, you can again do that

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.610
because you have a smaller frame.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:41.400
For men who aren't as thin, I would the shirt
out.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.190
And now here's a clue for the shirt.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.409
If you want to take the shirt out, I want
to give you guys also about dress shirts,

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:49.530
because I get this question all the time.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.329
How do I know whether or not I tuck it in
or out?

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:57.860
The shirt itself can dictate it as well.

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.400
If you look on the side, can you see how it
almost scallops right here?

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.969
You see how there's almost like a V?

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:09.609
That means that this shirt is meant to be
either tucked in or out, so you can definitely

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:10.969
wear it out.

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:15.239
If it goes all the way across, that means
that it's a dress shirt and it's supposed

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:16.750
to be tucked in.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.840
So those are kind of my couple tips for the
day.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.170
One is about knowing about your body frame
and what looks good on your weight, your height,

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.549
it's what I talked about before, but also
knowing exactly the kind of shirt that you're

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:32.549
buying.

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:33.549
That will help you.

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:34.569
Okay, I love it.

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:35.850
