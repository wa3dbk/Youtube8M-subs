00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.246
Everyone knows what it’s like to turn on the shower and 
then wait, shivering while the hot water reaches you.

00:00:06.246 --> 00:00:11.262
Within an hour, water that remained in the 
line after it was turned off will have cooled. 

00:00:11.262 --> 00:00:17.810
So you find yourself clearing the line of cooled water 
again before getting to water warm enough to use. 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.810
Well with Watts instant hot water 
re-circulating system there’s no wait. 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.426
And today on Around The House 
we’ll show you how it works.

00:00:25.426 --> 00:00:36.200
[Music]

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.748
The average household wastes between 10 and 20 thousand 
gallons of water each year waiting for hot water.

00:00:42.748 --> 00:00:46.556
Making it a big waste of time and money.

00:00:46.556 --> 00:00:53.779
Now you can save 10 to 20 percent on your water 
bill while helping to save a valuable resource. 

00:00:53.779 --> 00:01:01.347
The comfort of instant hot water and the elimination of 
water waste is just a Watts water technology solution away. 

00:01:01.347 --> 00:01:07.895
The heart of the Watts hot water re-circulating system is 
a pump installed on the hot water side of your water heater. 

00:01:07.895 --> 00:01:13.004
This pump fills the line with hot water 
when it’s activated by a built in timer. 

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:17.555
At the same time a patented bypass sensor installed 
at the furthest point of hot water use

00:01:17.555 --> 00:01:22.431
flushes the cold water in the line 
back to the hot water heater. 

00:01:22.431 --> 00:01:27.400
Extremely quiet and maintenance free, the Watts instant 
hot water re-circulating system costs only about five

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:36.734
cents a day to operate around the clock. Because the 
24 hour timer switch activates the pump, only when you need it.

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:44.000
It’s recommended for all types of pipes, requires no return 
lines, and comes with a 10 foot power cord to reach  

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.370
even the furthest outlet. And it’s easy to 
install usually taking less than an hour! 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:55.640
First, shut off the power and water supply to the water 
heater according to your water heaters instruction manual. 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.260
Drain the water from the line by opening the 
hot water valve until the water stops flowing. 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.740
Leave this valve open until you need to restart the system. 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:15.190
Now drain the remaining water from the water heater drain. 
Disconnect the water heater connector from the hot water 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:22.060
side of the water heater. Install the pump on to the water 
heater discharge. The pump should be installed so that it 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.930
is pumping water towards the house. You can confirm the direction 
of water flow by checking the arrows on the body of the pump. 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:34.200
Then connect the pump to a flexible copper 
or stainless steel supply line. 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.800
Now you can reopen the water valve to the water heater. 
Restart your water heater according to the manufacturer’s instructions 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.910
and plug in the Watts re-circulating pump to the nearest outlet. 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.000
All that’s left is installing the sensor valve!
For instant hot water through out

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.330
the line it is best to install the sensor valve at the 
faucet located the greatest piping distance from the water heater. 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:02.550
Begin by closing both the hot and cold water valves below that faucet. 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.710
Place the washers in the female end of the supplied adaptors. 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:10.980
Attach the adaptors to both the cold and hot water out ports. 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:16.460
Connect one end of each of the new flexible lines 
to the hot and cold water in ports. 

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:22.640
Disconnect the supply lines from both valves then 
reattach them to the supplied adaptors. 

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:28.000
Finally, connect the other end of the new flexible line to the hot and 
cold water valves. 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.718
Now, just open the stops and your system is ready to go. 

00:03:32.718 --> 00:03:36.760
If you have multiple hot water loops 
in your system you will need to install 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:43.820
additional Watts sensor valve kits for each loop. 
This does not require the purchase of an additional pump. 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.810
Now, you’ll never have to wait for hot water again! 
Try the Watts hot water re-circulating system today. 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:56.840
It’s NSF and IAPMO certified. And you can 
find it right now at your local Menards.
