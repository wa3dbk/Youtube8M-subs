00:00:02.559 --> 00:00:07.029
I've already applied my face makeup, I thought
I would skip this step since you see me do

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:08.799
it all the time!

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:13.389
So now, I'm going in with an eyeshadow base
onto the lids — this is going to ensure,

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.889
that my shadows don't crease all day; especially
on this day, because I had a lot to do!

00:00:18.889 --> 00:00:23.449
Then, with the Anastasia Lavish Palette, I'm
taking orange soda — it's going into the

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.939
crease and onto the upper crease and blending
that out!

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:30.989
It's going to help sienna, which is the next
color I'm using blend out, really nicely.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:35.198
And I don't remember what sigma brush this
is, but it will be linked down below as well

00:00:35.198 --> 00:00:42.888
as all the other products that I used in this
video.

00:00:42.888 --> 00:00:47.759
From that same palette, I'm taking black diamond,
and this is going to be an outer corner color.

00:00:47.759 --> 00:00:52.079
You can make this as intensified or less intensified
as you want.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.498
Just make sure that you blend it out, because
if you don't, it just looks like an un-blended

00:00:56.498 --> 00:01:01.118
mess!

00:01:01.118 --> 00:01:09.599
Then, with Cream from that same palette, I'm
packing this onto the lid and brow bone.

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:13.429
If you guys want to see a technique video
on how I blend out my shadows, I'll have it

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:15.949
linked down below if you haven't seen it yet.

00:01:15.949 --> 00:01:18.559
And then, I'm going to make a dramatic set
eye.

00:01:18.559 --> 00:01:19.559
I know…

00:01:19.559 --> 00:01:21.009
I'm so obsessed with these things.

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:26.928
I'm getting better and better each day I do
it.

00:01:26.928 --> 00:01:33.519
And, I'm using a little bit of concealer to
clean up that wing.

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:36.679
I want it to be as sharp as a knife!

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:40.859
Then, I'm applying a mascara to the upper
and lower lashes — this is waterproof because

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:45.809
I have issues with watery eyes and if you
want to add some lashes, you can go ahead

00:01:45.809 --> 00:01:47.438
and do so.

00:01:47.438 --> 00:01:52.739
And onto the waterline, I'm using a waterproof
black eyeliner and smoking out that lower

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:56.669
lash line with Sienna and a little bit of
orange soda.

00:01:56.669 --> 00:02:00.968
And you can add some of the black diamond
down there too; I do that sometimes.

00:02:00.968 --> 00:02:06.078
But for this look, I just used sienna and
orange soda.

00:02:06.078 --> 00:02:10.729
For my cheeks, I applied a blush from city
color cosmetics called guava — it's on of

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:11.729
my favorites!

00:02:11.729 --> 00:02:13.869
And bronzed up my face just a little bit.

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:15.489
For a little bit of warmth.

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:20.609
And then, for the lips, I used Nyx cosmetics
Istanbul and London I believe…

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:21.609
Yes!

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:29.489
London for the lips!

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.039
