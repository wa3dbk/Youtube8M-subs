00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.850
We'll do it all

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.800
Everything

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.760
On our own

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.630
We don't need

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.950
Anything

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.610
Or anyone

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.970
If I lay here

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.120
If I just lay here

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.630
Would you lie with me

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:53.280
And just forget the world?

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.580
I don't quite know

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.290
How to say

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:08.260
How I feel

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:16.130
Those three words

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.580
Are said too much

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:23.240
They're not enough

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:28.710
If I lay here

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.680
If I just lay here

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.690
Would you lie with me

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.540
And just forget the world?

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.440
Forget what we're told

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.460
Before we get too old

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.980
Show me a garden

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.750
That's bursting into life

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.230
Let's waste time

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.460
Chasing cars

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.550
Around our heads

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.220
I need your grace

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.500
To remind me

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.140
To find my own

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.560
If I lay here

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.270
If I just lay here

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.720
Would you lie with me

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.680
And just forget the world?

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.280
Forget what we're told

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:47.180
Before we get too old

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:49.630
Show me a garden

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.340
That's bursting into life

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.750
All that I am

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.720
All that I ever was

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.680
Is here in your perfect eyes

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.270
They're all I can see

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.420
I don't know where

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.250
Confused about how as well

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:19.900
Just know that these things

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.110
Will never change for us at all

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.460
If I lay here

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:32.170
If I just lay here

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.870
Would you lie with me

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:40.410
And just forget the world?
