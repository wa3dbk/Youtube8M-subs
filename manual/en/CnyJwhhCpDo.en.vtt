Hi this is Bryan Peterson

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:13.529
in a beautiful country of Bhutan and as
you can see in the background I am at

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:14.600
the world

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.240
famous Tiger's Nest it's quite
a trek to get up here but it is well worth it the trek.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.400
AdoramaTV presents,

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.600
You Keep Shooting with Bryan Peterson.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.859
If you're going to come to Bhutan and

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:35.020
photograph Tiger's Nest, number one
there's no rush to get up here really

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.620
bright and early in the morning because
the light doesn't get good

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.010
believe it or not until almost midday
and then into the late afternoon,

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.719
because of that a couple of things to bring
along for sure;

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.370
a polarizing filter which will cut down
a lot of the haze that sometimes will

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.809
be here in this area

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.359
but more importantly notice in front of me
the colorful prayer flags

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:59.089
and notice the very common, almost daily
occurrence

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:02.100
of the wind thats blowing at this altitude of
almost

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.869
10,000 feet here in the Himalayas. What we're going to do is take advantage of that wind

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:12.480
and deliberately shoot at an exposure of
a shutter speed thats around a 15th to

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.760
a 20th of a second. Yes I know I don't
have a tripod

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.560
but I got a good support right here I can
usually support myself

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.950
so with that in mind, and by the way I've
accepted a Canon challenge

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.370
from one of the students here, so you'll see
me using the Canon today

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.920
and low and behold I'm setting my exposure up

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.550
I've got the 16-35mm on here, so I'm able to get
a really nice vertical

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.550
and fill this whole foreground up with
these wonderful blowing flags,

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.650
my exposure time with 200 ISO and a polarizer

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:47.700
f/22, 15th of a second here we go and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.549
one second I have to turn the camera on, that helps,

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:54.930
and here we go, there you go, take a look at that.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.090
Notice to energy thats exuded

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.899
by that slow motion, it almost is a way
of complimenting

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:06.240
the energy have those prayer flags, that's
the whole idea in my opinion

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.259
not to mention the beautiful colours
that are filling up that foreground.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.970
Just an idea another thought you might
have when you get here, there is also

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:14.810
different levels

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.390
where you can shoot Tiger's Nest from
so make sure to work the subject go to all the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:20.220
different levels

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.680
and I know you won't go home
empty handed, you came all this way

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.760
work the subject. Hey until next time this is
Bryan Peterson reminding all of you,
