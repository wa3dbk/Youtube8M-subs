00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.420
Today on our 2005 Subaru Outback Wagon, well
be installing the Tow Ready T-One Connector,

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.420
part number 118461.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.400
Before we begin the installation, well need
to go ahead and locate the manufacturers tow

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.900
port on the driver side.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.349
Well start by removing the interior trim panels,
first the access door on the driver side,

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:19.270
then the center spare tire cover.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.730
Next well remove the carpeting on the driver
side porter panel.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.060
Now with those removed, we can go ahead and
remove the interior trays, the center and

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:40.030
driver side.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.190
With those removed, we can now just see part
of the manufacturers tow port wire hanging

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.100
under the driver side interior quarter panel.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.470
Well need to go and reach under the interior
quarter panel and pull the plug free as it

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.390
will be taped to the wire.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.320
Now that we have the connector pulled out
to where we can access it, well go ahead and

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.850
take the new Tow Ready T-One Connector and
plug in line with the manufacturers wiring.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.000
As you can see, they are matching connectors.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.659
Next well need to mount the convertor box.

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:09.810
Well go ahead and tuck the wiring inside the
interior quarter panel, remove the two-way

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:54.990
adhesive from the convertor box and adhere

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:02.810
it to a clean, flat surface.
