Hey Guys!

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.730
So today I'm going to be showing you how I
created this Messy Bun Look.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.790
It's super fun and easy to do.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:28.340
You'll be needing some gel of your choice,
a soft bristly brush, a spray bottle to dampen

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.740
your hair.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:31.509
Stay tuned for this small little giveaway.

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:37.730
You'll also need a Large elastic and a small
&amp; your DIY Hair extensions!

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.610
If you haven't seen this tutorial already,
click here to watch it.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:48.420
So I'm going to start off by re-dampening
my hair so that I can apply the gel.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.470
I'm going to smooth it using my brush.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.290
I use the water to get a more sleek look without
the flakes.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:03.400
You're going to position your ponytail where
you desire.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.690
Taking my clip in extensions which I showed
you guys exactly how I created this using

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:09.690
braiding hair.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.789
I'm just going to pin them around the base
of the puff ball.

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:20.740
If you have longer hair, your bun.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:28.289
You pretty much just want to surround the
outer parts of the bun specifically the front.

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.549
You can add as much or as little hair as you
want.

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.810
You want to have enough to cover up the actual
puff ponytail.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.499
The more hair you have, the more clip in extensions
you may want to add in.

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:48.500
Now you're just going to flip the hair backwards
to cover the ponytail.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.520
It's really that simple.

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.599
It's really easy to do.

00:01:55.599 --> 00:01:57.889
This could totally be a great protective style.

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:03.469
You could add a little bit of your favorite
essential oil to your ends and tuck away your

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:07.090
hair for a couple of days or so.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.650
Now I'm going to leave a little piece of curl
hanging, I like that look!

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.700
This is an effortless and messy bun.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.510
Let's get on to the giveaway details.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.069
So I was shopping and I picked up a little
spray bottle.

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:29.120
