00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.460
"Convergence of Evidence"

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.620
Dr. Ornish published an editorial in the
American Journal of Cardiology

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.280
last year that I think really
sums up where we are,

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.570
describing a growing convergence
of scientific evidence

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.680
that an optimal diet
is mostly plant-based.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.170
Make sure it has nuts, soy, and fiber,
and you can drop your bad cholesterol

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:24.380
as much as taking drugs
every day for the rest of your life—

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.060
but without the cost,
and without the side effects.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.270
Save the country $20 billion.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:33.770
Of course, most patients aren’t
even given the plant-based option,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.430
because of the patronizing belief among
doctors that no one will actually do it.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.700
But in reality, most people
don’t want to take the drugs.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:42.830
People hate the side effects.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.790
They don’t make you feel any better,

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.670
and it’s scary popping pills every day
so you don’t keel over and die.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.790
People don’t even
want to think about it.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:55.400
However, when people
actually improve their diets,

00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:02.200
you actually feel so much better,
so quickly, that it reframes the reason

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.260
for making these changes
from fear of dying—

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.749
which usually is not sustainable—
to joy of living, which often is.

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:12.240
And the diet doesn’t
just help your cholesterol.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.950
Unlike the drugs, a plant-based diet
can also prevent and treat diabetes,

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:19.630
hypertension, obesity,
prostate cancer, breast cancer, etc.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.979
Pills can’t do all that.

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.679
And instead of being
on a list of medications—

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:26.270
one drug for this;
one or two drugs for that;

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.890
there’s not one diet for heart disease,
another one for diabetes,

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.220
a plant-based diet
covers all the bases.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.939
Why?

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:39.249
Because plant-based foods
contain more than 100,000

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:41.940
different disease-preventing nutrients.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.540
Let me say that again:
100,000 phytonutrients.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.749
Only found in plants.

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:50.560
You know, blueberries have
the anthocyanins for memory.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:53.530
Tomatoes are rich in
the red pigment lycopene,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.499
which targets heart disease and cancer.

00:01:55.499 --> 00:01:58.500
Ginger’s got gingerols
for hypertension;

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.810
pomegranates have some
totally different phytonutrients.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.819
And let’s never forget kale!

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.780
The list goes on and on.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.520
And you can’t just take
these phytonutrients in a pill.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.269
Beta carotene pills may actually
increase cancer risk,

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:17.260
as opposed to the whole carrot,
which may lower our risk.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:21.519
And we probably couldn’t swallow
a hundred thousand pills a day anyway.

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:26.640
Then he talks about his work stopping
and reversing the progression of even

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.270
severe coronary artery disease.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:35.260
Slowing, stopping,
or reversing cancer.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:39.739
Living and eating healthy actually
changes you on a genetic level,

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:44.319
upregulating disease-preventing genes,
and downregulating genes that promote

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.400
breast cancer, prostate cancer,
inflammation, and oxidative stress.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.230
Drugs can’t do that.

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:54.120
The bottom line:
people tend to think of

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.260
breakthroughs in medicine as
new drugs, lasers, high-tech surgery—

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.079
but they have a hard time
believing that simple choices

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:04.290
can be as powerful
as drugs and surgery.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.680
But they often are.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.510
Sometimes, even better.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.819
And I will leave you, on that note.
