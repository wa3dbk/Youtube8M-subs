00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:08.670
1 00:00:04:01 00:00:09:21 Browsing the internet
on an iPad is so much easier and more convenient

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:09.670
than on a computer.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.100
2 00:00:09:22 00:00:13:21 You can just pick
up your iPad, press a button,

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:15.040
tap an icon,
3 00:00:13:22 00:00:17:16 and you're online

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.090
and ready to visit
your favourite websites.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.810
4 00:00:17:17 00:00:24:00 The iPad has a special
app, or program, for web browsing.

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.810
It's called Safari.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.550
5 00:00:24:01 00:00:27:03 The icon looks just
like a compass.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.640
6 00:00:27:04 00:00:31:16 To browse the internet,
your iPad needs to be connected to the internet

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.820
7 00:00:31:17 00:00:35:12 via a 3G connection
or via WiFi.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.850
8 00:00:35:13 00:00:42:18 Look at the top
left of the screen.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.579
If there are little curved lines or mobile
phone-style reception bars,

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.780
9 00:00:42:19 00:00:45:00 then you're connected
and ready to go!

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.989
10 00:00:45:01 00:00:48:11 Tap the Safari
icon to get started.

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.970
11 00:00:48:12 00:00:56:23 The first screen
you see will be mostly blank, because you

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.399
need to tell the web browser which webpage
to open.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.830
12 00:00:56:24 00:01:02:04 Tap the bar to
bring up the onscreen keyboard and type in

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:01.830
the address (www.bigpond.com).

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.489
13 00:01:02:04 00:01:07:12 If you make a mistake
tap the backspace key

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.229
here and it will correct it.

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.270
14 00:01:07:12 00:01:11:09 When you've typed
in the address, tap the Go button.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.350
15 00:01:11:10 00:01:18:16 The Bigpond website
opens.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.590
You can tap on any blue text to 'link' to
another page.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.009
16 00:01:18:17 00:01:24:03 If the text is
too small, you can double-tap to zoom in

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.009
a little way.

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:27.979
17 00:01:24:04 00:01:29:05 If you want more
control over the amount of zoom, make a pinching

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:30.369
motion with your fingers
18 00:01:29:06 00:01:33:09 and slide them

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.770
apart on the screen, like this.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.039
19 00:01:33:10 00:01:37:13 If you zoom in
too far, pictures can become blurry.

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:39.979
20 00:01:37:14 00:01:40:12 Quickly double-tap
to zoom out again,

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.590
21 00:01:40:13 00:01:45:17 or pinch-to-zoom,
but this time slide your fingers together,

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:45.590
to zoom out.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.469
22 00:01:45:18 00:01:51:11 Usually when you
browse the internet, you won't know the exact

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:52.359
website address you want to go to,
23 00:01:51:12 00:01:54:00 so you'll need

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:53.359
to do a search.

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:57.079
24 00:01:54:01 00:01:57:10 Tap the Search
box – you can see it's called 'Google'.

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.569
25 00:01:57:11 00:02:02:07 That's the internet
search engine which helps

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:01.670
you find information.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.859
26 00:02:02:08 00:02:07:02 When the onscreen
keyboard appears, type in anything you want

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:06.859
to search for.

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:09.509
27 00:02:07:03 00:02:10:06 Let's do a search
for 'caravan Australia'.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.720
28 00:02:10:07 00:02:14:00 A list appears,
showing some suggestions

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.900
for useful searches.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:16.890
29 00:02:14:01 00:02:21:12 Google's Search
page appears.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.830
The top result, in the yellowish box, is a
paid advertisement.

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:24.320
30 00:02:21:13 00:02:30:04 The blue text is
called a link.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:29.790
If you tap it, the screen will change to the
website the link connects to.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.310
31 00:02:30:04 00:02:33:12 If you move the
page by sliding your

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:33.470
finger from bottom to top.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.730
32 00:02:33:12 00:02:39:00 you can see a map,
and even further down, lots more links to

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:38.730
other websites.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.080
33 00:02:39:01 00:02:44:21 Each link has a
short description, giving you an idea of what

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.410
the website contains.

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:48.470
34 00:02:44:22 00:02:49:12 Tap the link that
interests you, and read the

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:49.470
page that appears.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:54.160
35 00:02:49:13 00:02:54:06 Any blue text on
that page is a link to yet another page.

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:58.380
36 00:02:54:07 00:03:00:21 Think of it as
turning a page in magazine – each tap on

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:00.360
a link turns the page.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.870
37 00:03:00:22 00:03:05:04 Don't forget, you
can move the page up and down by sliding your

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.220
finger on the screen,
38 00:03:05:04 00:03:07:07 and you can zoom

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.220
by pinching.

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.230
39 00:03:07:07 00:03:15:05 Up on the top left
of the screen is a grey arrow pointing to

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.370
the left.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:14.840
This is the back arrow.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.780
40 00:03:15:06 00:03:21:12 Tap this to go
back to the previous page, and keep tapping

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.240
to retrace your steps!

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:25.040
41 00:03:21:13 00:03:28:02 It's easy to get
'lost' on the internet.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.720
If the pages you're reading no longer seem
relevant,

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.730
42 00:03:28:03 00:03:34:00 you can always
do another search.

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.280
Just tap the box in the top right again.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.420
43 00:03:34:01 00:03:38:10 The more specific
your search, the more

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.550
accurate the results.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.060
44 00:03:38:11 00:03:42:00 To finish your
browsing session, just press the

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.060
Home button.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:46.490
45 00:03:42:01 00:03:50:00 The next time you
start the Safari web browser, the last page

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:49.220
you visited will be the first page you see.
