00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.290
There might be a few possible answers here, but I'll talk about the one I came

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.860
up with. If you came up with a different one, that might be right, I'd like to

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.190
see it. We'll start by moving all the way left. And then, while we haven't

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.290
found what we're looking for, if the piece you're looking at is blue, you'll

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.380
need to keep looking. Move one space right. Else, if the piece to the right is

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.910
blue, you should stop, because you found it. Else, if the piece to the right is

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.950
yellow, move a space right. I think it's a good way to start by moving all the

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:34.240
way left because that means the first time we find a yellow followed by a blue,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:39.352
that'll be the left most one. Now, as long as we haven't found it, we're

00:00:39.352 --> 00:00:43.920
going to keep looking. While we're looking, if the piece you're looking at is

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.010
blue, like right here, that means that we haven't found what we're looking for

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.064
yet, and we should move one space right. Otherwise, that means the piece that

00:00:53.064 --> 00:00:58.660
you're looking at is yellow. And if the one to the right of it is blue, so if

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.250
we were right here, we're looking at a yellow, the one to the right is blue.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.280
You would stop, because you've found it. But if you're looking at a yellow and

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.410
the piece to the right is also yellow, we haven't found what we're looking for

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.431
and we need to keep moving. So, in that case we still move a space right. So,

00:01:13.431 --> 00:01:19.530
the way this would work on this input is we would start all the way to the left

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.340
and we haven't found it yet. So, we would look at the piece, it's blue. So, we

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.480
move right. We still haven't found it, so we look at this piece, it's blue. So,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.600
we move right. We still haven't found it. So, we look at this piece, it's blue,

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.500
so we move right. We look at this piece. It's not blue. So, we check what the

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.030
piece to the right is. The piece to the right is not blue. So, we check if the

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.640
piece to the right is yellow, which it is, then we move a space right. Okay.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.830
Now, we need to check again. If the piece you're looking at is blue, nope.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:59.410
Else, if the piece to the right is blue. Yep. You want to stop because you

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.635
found it. So, it looks like it works on this input.
