00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:04.580
Hey what's up everybody, Bradley here, and
we're going to look at the Weather and Lighting

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.190
Effects in Project Cars.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:09.460
Before we get started, I just want to thank
everyone who has subscribed recently.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.690
I'm not sure where the channel is heading
yet, but everyone's support is really helping.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.189
Where going to use the Gumpert Apollo S as
our test car which contains both light and

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:19.810
dark colors in its paint job, for comparison.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.259
The white texture makes it more difficult
to see the rain, but once you're up close

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.039
you can see the similarity.

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:29.619
Unlike many racing games, Project Cars uses
the power of windshield wipers and they actually

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:30.619
work.

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:33.710
It's nice to see game developers going into
this much detail for their game.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.030
Maybe EA shouldn't have stopped using this
engine which was originally made for the Need

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.239
For Speed Shift series.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.780
As of now, the tires and rims of the car don't
seem to have rain drops, but the movement

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.400
of the tires still causes water to splash
as you drive.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.920
Because it is darker during a rainstorm, you
notice the street lights are reflected onto

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.370
the road, even though it is daytime.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.760
There's also great detail in the sky of this
game.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.560
The clouds move at relatively good speed for
a rainstorm, and also look extremely realistic.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.609
When viewing from above you can see a large
difference from the track lit by street lights

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.990
to behind the stands where it is not.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.120
So now we're going to look at the other end
of the spectrum which is daytime without rain.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.400
You can see the reflections are a lot sharper
on the car too.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.580
The main light source now is just the sun.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.090
Obviously the windshield wipers have stopped
rolling, and the reflection on the car windows

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.340
is a lot smoother.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.070
You're not being bombarded with light sources
like you are when it is darker outside.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.410
The clouds seem to move at the same speed,
and the shadows like the one from that nearby

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.450
tree are a lot darker.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.880
Lastly I just want to look at the sunrise
and sunset in Project CARS at a speed of 240

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.270
times faster.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.230
All of the shadows expand accordingly, and
the sky slowly begins to darken.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.280
The many light sources in the game begin to
brighten, to make for a great transition into

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.280
night.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.960
Once dark, many of the buildings and tents
light up as well.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.430
By morning, basically the same happens but
obviously backwards.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.850
The sun begins to rise and shadows decrease
in length.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.430
So overall, Thanks for watching everyone if
you made it this far.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.020
I hope you enjoyed this analysis and maybe
learned a thing or two from it.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.050
