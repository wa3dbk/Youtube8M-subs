00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:06.650
Avengers: Age Of Ultron is absolutely jam-packed
with action, characters, comedy, call-backs,

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.820
and little seeds of continuity that lay the
foundation for Marvel movies to come.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.070
In fact, if Age Of Ultron were any more crammed,
it’d be bursting at the seams, much like

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.050
Bruce Banner’s clothes when he turns into
the Hulk.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.230
Actually, when I left the cinema after watching
Age Of Ultron, I felt pretty overwhelmed,

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.630
but in a good way; the kind of way that makes
you want to run back into the cinema and watch

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.160
it all over again!

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.190
I still can’t get over the scale of this
production – it really is breath-taking.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.890
The sheer visual spectacle of the film is
such a sight to behold.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.290
The movie hits the grounds running, with fast-paced
action right from the very start; and being

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.950
a Marvel movie, the humour comes thick and
fast.

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:51.380
There’s a lot of great action set-pieces
– I particularly loved all the Hulkbuster

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.380
stuff.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:57.600
As for the array of characters in Age Of Ultron,
don't worry, this is definitely not a Spider-Man

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.720
3 situation here.

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.470
Writer-director Joss Whedon does a great job
juggling all the existing characters we’ve

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.729
come to know and love while adding a considerable
number of new ones to the line-up.

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.380
Among the Avengers themselves, Hawkeye, the
Hulk and Black Widow get more screen time

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.340
than they did last time.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.110
And Whedon balances things nicely so it doesn’t
feel like that’s at the expense of time

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.840
spent with Iron Man, Captain America, or Thor.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.380
I really do love the Avengers cast.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.569
Obviously, this isn’t their first time at
the rodeo – they’ve all got their characters

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:33.549
finely honed now, and the chemistry between
them all just pops off the screen.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.390
There is an incredible amount of charisma
on screen.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.880
Scarlett Johansson gets some kick-ass action
as Black Widow as well as some lovely scenes

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.739
with Bruce Banner and the Hulk, which have
touches of King Kong about them.

00:01:45.739 --> 00:01:50.470
Mark Ruffalo continues to be the absolute
best big-screen Banner and Hulk.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:54.529
Jeremy Renner gets to show the man behind
the bow and arrow this time, as well as getting

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:56.600
some good action and comic lines.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.439
Robert Downey Jr just IS Tony Stark and Iron
Man.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:04.821
And there’s a lot of cool interplay between
him and Chris Evans as Captain America, which

00:02:04.821 --> 00:02:09.039
bodes very well for 2016’s Captain America:
Civil War movie.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.180
Chris Hemsworth proves himself yet again to
be a worthy Thor, and gets a good mix of action

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.349
and comedy, quite a bit of which centres around
his hammer.

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:23.099
James Spader’s off-kilter style of delivery
works superbly well for the AI robot Ultron,

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:29.040
who’s a snarky, volatile, creepy, and, at
times, strangely needy megalomaniac.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.709
The various incarnations of Ultron are brilliantly
realised.

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.870
Hats off to the visual effects team and to
Andy Serkis’s company The Imaginarium Studios

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.489
for its motion capture work on the movie.

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.689
After the little scene we got with Elizabeth
Olsen’s Scarlet Witch and Aaron Taylor-Johnson’s

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:48.870
Quicksilver at the end of Captain America:
The Winter Soldier, Age Of Ultron gives us

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.190
an extended introduction while still leaving
plenty of room for further development.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.360
And I’m very interested to see how that
pans out in future films.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.579
It was great to see Andy Serkis actually on
screen, not hidden by CGI like he is in his

00:03:03.579 --> 00:03:07.150
brilliant roles in The Planet Of The Apes
movies and Lord Of The Rings.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.859
It’s just a little cameo he gets as the
nasty Ulysses Klaw, but I thought he was fab

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:12.859
in the part.

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.120
Paul Bettany is fantastic in the film, but
I’m going to leave talking about his role

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.340
to my spoiler review.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.579
Don Cheadle’s role is limited in Age Of
Ultron, but it feels like we’re working

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:27.620
up to something more from him in future films,
so I’m hoping his character gets more development

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.230
and a clearer identity from hereon in, as
I think he’s a really good actor.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.680
Samuel L Jackson and Cobie Smulders return
as Nick Fury and Maria Hill, and each gets

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.150
some very nice interaction with the Avengers.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.530
There’s also a bunch of other cameos from
supporting actors we’ve seen in the previous

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.530
movies.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.540
But I won’t spoil those for you by revealing
who they are or what they do!

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.180
As for the plot, the beats will feel largely
familiar to fans of comic books and the movies

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.269
they’ve inspired, particularly the first
Avengers team-up – a supervillain causes

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.939
discord among the superheroes; a supervillain
wants to raze and take over a neighbourhood

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:08.599
or a city or even the world in order to start
afresh and be in control; and that supervillain

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:12.870
may well come from within, like Loki did as
brother of Thor, and as Ultron does as the

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.260
sort of bastard offspring/creation of Iron
Man/Tony Stark.

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:22.240
However, the way Whedon weaves everything
together with stacks of awesome action, spectacle,

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:28.669
humour and heart, not forgetting a top-notch
cast, makes Avengers: Age Of Ultron an entertaining

00:04:28.669 --> 00:04:29.669
watch.

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:34.110
While the two movies share a lot of the same
DNA, this isn’t The Avengers movie we saw

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.700
in 2012.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.479
Age Of Ultron is so much bigger and more dense
than that first movie, and it’s also darker,

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:47.300
definitely not as dark as Marvel’s Daredevil
on Netflix, but we certainly see a more tortured,

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:51.319
darker side of our heroes than in their first
get-together; which is a sign of things to

00:04:51.319 --> 00:04:53.740
come in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.020
Of course, you can expect a lovely little
cameo from Stan Lee, and there’s also a

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:03.150
shed-load of call-backs to previous movies
in the MCU as well as references to possible

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.680
threads and characters in upcoming Marvel
movies, though I’m not going to spoil any

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.870
of that here.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.200
As for the credits, there’s no post-credits
scene this time.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:17.060
But, there is still a short but tantalising
mid-credits sting, which you won’t want

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:18.060
to miss.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.419
So, to sum up: Avengers: Age Of Ultron is
a dizzying and dazzling spectacle that shifts

00:05:22.419 --> 00:05:27.750
between insane heart-pounding action scenes
and equally enjoyable, quieter character-driven

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:28.750
moments.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:32.479
Avengers: Age Of Ultron gets 4 out of 5 Flicks.

00:05:32.479 --> 00:05:34.919
