00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:15.410
Ready?

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:39.430
Hey, what's going on guys I've got some new
shadow boxes in that I'm adding to my personal

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.430
collection.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.690
So I just wanted to open them in front of
you so you can see what you're going to be

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.630
getting when you get them and how they're
shipped and how they're packaged and I switched

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:49.630
it up a little bit.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.550
You know I usually go with the cherry frame
and the black background.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.760
I think this time I went with the black on
black maybe and cherry on the big one.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.590
I've got two, I've got one XL, and two Larges.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:23.130
So, anyway, I'm going to go ahead and unbox
them and you can check em out when I get them

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.720
out.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.310
Alright?

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:42.590
So there you go, as always, I guess I did
go with the, I forgot I went with the cherry

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.979
frames again but I went with the black background
I'm pretty sure.

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:46.979
Yup!

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.630
There it goes.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.439
That nice black felt.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.450
Usually I go with the red but I'm switching
it up a little bit.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.580
But some notable things as far as the shipping
goes you can see we've changed the styrofoam.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:08.369
So if you've ordered from my website before,
the old styrofoam used to break apart and

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.729
get all over the place.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.450
So the styrofoam has changed in the shipping
and we've added this front protection piece

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:25.060
on front of the frames for to make it better
for shipping and they are just beautiful man.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.440
Beautiful, beautiful.

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.120
All around.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.991
So I'll show you a finished product after
I hand these up and of course you can get

00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:37.690
these on my website YouGoProBaseball.com So
here they are.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.730
I haven't pinned them or anything.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.090
I just stuck them in there and closed them
up.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.340
I put the little name plate on them.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:51.080
So I'll probably go back and pin them and
make them a little bit nicer, but that's one

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:58.360
of the small ones, or excuse me, the Large
size, and that's the other large size ones

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:03.970
and then I took that one that used to be there
and put that one up there so.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:05.300
It turned out nice.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:12.410
I went with the red, black, red felt, you
know changing the colors from the felt but

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.410
I think it turned out nice.

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:16.080
I'll probably do the same thing on the other
side eventually.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.710
So, anyway, I don't know, I don't know, should
I hang these?

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:27.459
Like actually hang these up a little bit on
the wall, like that, or should I just leave

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.860
them leaning?

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:29.860
What do you think?

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:30.860
Let me know.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.880
Leave a comment and let me know if I should
leave them leaning against the wall like that

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.700
or hang them up just a little bit higher.
