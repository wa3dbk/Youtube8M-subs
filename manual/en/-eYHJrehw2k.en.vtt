00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:04.690 position:72%
&gt;&gt; Hi. My name is Mike Bell, and I'm a student
and a personal trainer at Duke University.

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.990
And I also have a bit of
a martial arts background.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:11.180 position:72%
And today I'm going to give you a workout that
you can do by yourself with a punching bag

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.640
or potentially with a friend if you
have punching bags or thai pads.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.130
It's important to note that the
objection of this video is not

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:23.670 position:70%
to teach you any self-defense maneuvers, just
to give you a good, fun full-body workout.

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.020 position:64%
This workout will use four basic punches.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.380 position:59%
The first of these punches is the jab.

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.670 position:56%
Jab with the same hand as your lead
leg, usually your less-dominant leg.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.940
Begin with your elbows in
and fists at chin height.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.210 position:64%
To throw the jab simultaneously, push off
with your back leg and twist your body

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.330 position:73%
on your lead leg side, rotating your fist until
your arm reaches full extension on contact.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.060 position:59%
Make sure to keep your wrist straight,
and don't throw the jab so hard

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.780 position:69%
that you injure your elbow on the extension.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.240 position:67%
After contact, immediately recoil your
body and bring your hand back to your chin.

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.230
The next punch is the cross.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.810
A cross is thrown with your
trail leg or dominant hand.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.760 position:69%
The cross is similar to the jab in mechanics
except that now you're both pushing off

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.580
and twisting with the trail
leg side of your body,

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.240
therefore delivering much
more power in the punch.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.570
Like with the jab, after contact,
you want to immediately recoil

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.370 position:61%
and bring your hands back to your chin.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.640 position:69%
Our third punch in this routine is the hook.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.450 position:59%
Throw the hook with your lead hand,
the same one you use to throw the jab.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.230 position:70%
Plant your rear foot, and begin the motion by
twisting slightly towards your lead leg side.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.840
Then unwind back into your
stance as you bend your arm

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.600 position:73%
to a 90-degree angle and parallel to the floor.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.080 position:73%
Pivot all the way back through on your lead leg
foot; and maintain the 90-degree arm position

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.200 position:56%
as you make contact, using your abs
to generate power and stay balanced.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.300
Again, immediately after the punch,
return your hands to your chin.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:52.370 position:70%
Our fourth punch is going to be an upper cut.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:57.760 position:66%
An upper cut is performed with the rear
leg hand, the same one you used for cross.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.080 position:75%
Keeping your arm tight to your body, lower your
trail leg hand and turn your palm to the ceiling

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.340
as you slightly twist your
body to the punching hand side.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.010 position:72%
Pivot back into your stance by driving off
your back leg as you punch in an upward motion

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:12.870
with power generated from
the legs, hips, and abs.

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.260
Return to the set position
before throwing the next punch.

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:18.500
Once you've mastered the
four punches individually,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.650 position:61%
it's time to start trying combinations.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.560
The first combination we're
going to try is a jab cross.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.300 position:61%
The jab cross is exactly what it sounds
like: jab with the lead leg hand;

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.280 position:72%
return to the set position with both hands at
the chin; and then immediately use your motion

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.680 position:61%
from the recoil to launch a hard cross,
making sure to generate the power

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.730
from your core, not just your arms.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:42.110
Once you have the jab cross
down, try adding a hook.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.640 position:67%
The sequence is now jab with the lead hand,

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.770
cross with the rear hand,
hook with the lead hand.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:54.130
Remember to bring the hands back
to the chin after each punch.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.020 position:61%
Finally, you can try stringing all four
punches together: jab with the lead,

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.610
cross with the rear, hook with
the lead, upper cut with the rear.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:06.090 position:64%
Again, be sure to come back to the set
position in between each individual punch

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.690 position:70%
to ensure correct form and build good habits.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.030 position:59%
An extra motion that you can add in to
give your abs some explosive work is

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.170 position:66%
to simulate slipping a jab from an
opponent and coming back with a hard hook.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:24.340 position:72%
This allows you to really twist your torso and
uncork on the bag, generating a lot of power.

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.680
The beauty of working out on a
punching bag is that you can make

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:28.620
up just about any workout you want.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.820 position:59%
Begin by learning to throw the punches
individually, switching up sides

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.140
after every maybe 10 to 20
reps or 20 to 30 seconds.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:38.780 position:63%
Then once you feel comfortable with your
technique, learn to throw combinations.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.080 position:67%
Start slowly and build proper muscle memory
before launching into a worthless flurry.

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:46.810 position:66%
Finally, once you're comfortable with
combinations, start freestyling on the bag

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:48.910 position:73%
and make up your own workouts to keep it fresh.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.800
And remember, if you're training
for general fitness purposes,

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:54.910
it's important to use both
side of your body evenly.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.400
That's it for now.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.490 position:67%
If you find yourself interested in learning
martial arts in a formal environment,

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:03.930 position:70%
check out the area around you for kickboxing,
karate, or a mixed martial arts center.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.770
Until next time, good luck
and keep your hands up.
