00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:13.446
It was great fun to craft with the kids

00:00:13.446 --> 00:00:16.883
cause their little imaginations are just so full of wonderful things. 

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.952
Well I have a great craft to show you today, 

00:00:18.985 --> 00:00:20.687
that mom or dad, you can do with the kids

00:00:20.754 --> 00:00:22.022
Let's take a look at this one

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:24.424
and here we have our little wooley worm

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:25.959
and just some fun little things

00:00:25.992 --> 00:00:28.128
the kids can make up, all the pictures 

00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:29.963
and maybe make it into an alphabet book.

00:00:29.996 --> 00:00:32.232
We're actually going to make a little texture book 

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:35.402
but we're going to make it out of fun little craft bags. 

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:36.403
So what we've done 

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:37.804
is I have two of them here 

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.072
what we're going to do 

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:40.407
is we're going to take and we're going to 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.641
Mom, you need to do this

00:00:41.641 --> 00:00:43.743
and we're just going to cut the handles 

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:45.712
Now what we're going to do

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:47.347
is we're going to take the first bag

00:00:47.347 --> 00:00:49.516
and we're just going to fold it in half

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:50.917
and we're going to crease it

00:00:51.151 --> 00:00:52.886
Now Mom, some of this you will have to 

00:00:52.886 --> 00:00:52.919
and then the kids can have the fun part.

00:00:54.521 --> 00:00:56.756
They get to make all the fun things that go inside

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.825
So this is going to be the center of our book 

00:00:58.825 --> 00:00:59.726
so what we're going to do

00:00:59.793 --> 00:01:00.760
is we're going to insert 

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:02.262
this into this one

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:03.063
and then we're going to use

00:01:03.063 --> 00:01:04.030
our Cropadile

00:01:04.497 --> 00:01:06.399
which has got two sizes of holes 

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:08.835
so we're going to use the big hole 

00:01:09.803 --> 00:01:11.204
So let me show you here what we have done

00:01:11.237 --> 00:01:12.372
We've got this one all put together

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:14.040
So we punched the holes, 

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:15.442
and then we just took some fun ribbon

00:01:15.475 --> 00:01:17.410
and Mom, it's a little hard 

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.111
to get it through the holes

00:01:18.144 --> 00:01:19.512
so you're going to want to do this 

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:22.549
Now you have this fabulous canvas

00:01:22.582 --> 00:01:24.551
that the kids can have so much fun with

00:01:24.551 --> 00:01:25.351
You know what?

00:01:25.351 --> 00:01:27.353
We just took some chenille stems

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:28.354
twisted them together, 

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:29.289
and the kids can make a fun 

00:01:29.322 --> 00:01:29.355
little wooley worm. 

00:01:30.223 --> 00:01:30.757
But you know what?

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:32.092
If you don't want to do a texture book, 

00:01:32.092 --> 00:01:33.760
I think this could be fun too

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.261
It could be a little photo album. 

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:36.596
So we've done the same thing, 

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.031
We've put our bags together 

00:01:38.031 --> 00:01:39.532
this time we actually used 

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:40.533
an additional bag

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.602
and look, they can put their photos in here. 

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:44.237
What's even more fun is, look

00:01:44.237 --> 00:01:45.939
they can put their little treasures 

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.141
so if you're on a little vacation or something, 

00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:48.208
they can pull out their little treasures

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.111
they can keep their photos or 

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:52.712
or whatever they want to 

00:01:52.712 --> 00:01:54.214
in their little bag book,  

00:01:54.214 --> 00:01:55.381
and they've got a fun little

00:01:55.381 --> 00:01:56.749
photo album to take with them anywhere 

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:57.584
they want to go

00:01:57.584 --> 00:01:59.119
This could be a great party idea

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.087
let all the kids just get together 

00:02:01.087 --> 00:02:02.622
put a bunch of craft stuff out there

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.124
wiggle eyes, chenille stems, 

00:02:04.124 --> 00:02:04.991
pom poms, 

00:02:05.024 --> 00:02:06.292
and of course some glitter,  

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:07.727
and they can have a fun time

00:02:07.727 --> 00:02:09.262
being really creative. 

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:10.997
