00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.510
Welcome to illuminati Silver, we tell you
the truth about silver.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.230
Today is Monday 20th July 2015 and we are
issuing this video to update you on today’s

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.710
sudden decline in the price of Gold this morning
which has taken many people by surprise.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:40.860
Coincidentally, we have been asked by subscribers
to produce a video on gold, which we planned

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:48.550
to do over the next 2 weeks, however today’s
fall has been so dramatic; we could not let

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:55.340
the situation pass without at least making
a brief comment about it.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:05.829
Spot gold fell to as low as $1,083 in Asian
trade at about 2.25am BST with gold losing

00:01:05.829 --> 00:01:12.430
over 4% of its value in just a few minutes
as five tonnes of gold were sold through the

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:19.360
Shanghai Gold Exchange in the opening half
hour - marking its lowest price since November

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.420
2009.
Since its peak in 2011 gold has lost nearly

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:36.540
40% of its value and is currently trading
at $1110 as we speak.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:42.040
There are a number of potential reasons for
this rapid ‘sell off’ which includes:

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.920
• The Sale already mentioned through the
Shanghai Gold Exchange

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:52.130
• The threat of US interest rate rise – as
announced again by Janet Yellen last week

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.119
is maintaining dollar strength and downward
pressure on Gold and Silver

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.810
• The near term resolution of the Greek
crisis with their banks having re-opened today

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:10.200
has reduced the safe haven premium of gold
• The People’s Bank of China stating on

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:22.969
Friday that it owns just 1658 tonnes of gold
as opposed to the 3500 tonnes analysts expected;

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:31.019
- and some 10,000 – 20,000 tonnes less than
some of the ‘pumpers’ have predicted.

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:40.239
The World Gold Council which announced the
first quarter results in May 2015 showed that

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:49.439
year on year gold demand was down approximately
1% and mine supply was up 1%. So even at lower

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:56.900
gold prices, both demand and supply are little
affected.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:02.969
With gold sentiment amongst Western investors
being historically low and the world still

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:09.750
in economic recession or deflation, we still
see little preventing both the gold and silver

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:16.219
prices declining further unless a significant
‘black swan event’ were to occur.

00:03:16.219 --> 00:03:17.290
Today’s fall and recovery shows how volatile
the precious metals market can be which is

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:19.719
why we try to avoid making weekly predictions
and prefer to highlight the directional trend

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:22.459
in which they are heading.
A final comment, for those who predict that

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.659
silver prices are bound to sky rocket because
the gold to silver ratio is well above the

00:03:28.659 --> 00:03:36.889
historic average. Our advice is do not forget
that this balance could also be corrected

00:03:36.889 --> 00:03:44.650
by the gold price falling compared to silver
– so this euphoric jump need not happen

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:50.529
at all.
