Info on the Australian Pokemon National Championships,
a new Awakened Mewtwo trailer, and more! Hey

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:18.630
guys, Jess here! And this is the Pokemon update
from Curse and Marriland!

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.180
FIrst up - finally, Australia and New Zealand
are both able to be represented at the Pokémon

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:27.340
Video Game World Championships, with players
to compete in the Australian National Championships

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.430
held at PAX Australia in the middle of July.
Unfortunately, tickets to attend PAX Australia

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.750
are already sold out, but Pokémon will be
holding special Pokémon Battle Competitions

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.300
in five locations across Australia with the
grand prize being a trip and hotel stay to

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.620
PAX Australia along with tickets to enter.
Details are still being released, so for more

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.310
information, check out Marriland.com or the
official Nintendo Australia website.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.350
Next, the Japanese Pokémon YouTube channel
has recently released a new video showing

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:58.680
what appears to be a trailer to a Prologue
to Mewtwo's Awakening, showing off Mewtwo

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.060
transforming into its awakened form. It's
a special TV broadcast that will be shown

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.869
in Japan on July 11th, just two days before
the release of the new Pokémon movie there,

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:11.120
called ExtremeSpeed Genesect and the Reawakening
of Mewtwo.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:15.450
Moving on, as was the case with the Pokémon
Video Game National Championships in other

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.670
countries, a special Shiny Metagross modeled
after the Metagross used by the three-time

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:24.080
world champion, Ray Rizzo, will be distributed
to people attending the Pokémon Video Game

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.420
National Championships in the US, as well
as Australia. You have to be at the championships

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.369
in Indianapolis or Melbourne in order to receive
it, though, but it makes the travel all the

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:34.369
more rewarding.

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.260
Finally, want to learn more about EV Training
but get confused anytime you read up on it?

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.090
Maybe a video would be more your style, so
go ahead and check out TamashiiHiroka's new

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.900
video on how to EV Train Pokémon, and be
sure to congratulate her for reaching 100,000

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:53.560
subscribers on YouTube! Of course we'll put
a link to that in the video description.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.340
That's all for this week! Oh, but one more
thing - the X &amp; Y giveaway bonanza is STILL

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.340
going on until July 12th, so enter that if
you haven't already. And be sure to subscribe

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.270
