00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:06.390
I'm going to explain the procedure of electrology.
Now this morning I have Pam. I'm going to

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.200
be working on her face. She has a serious
hair issue going on on her face and the hair

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.670
is very heavy. So, a lot of it is lighter
color so that's one reason I'm doing electrology

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:25.010
on Pam. She cannot be done with laser because
of the lightness of her hair. And when we're

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:30.890
doing an area as sensitive as a face, not
all clients but a lot of clients, have a hard

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:37.420
tolerating the current. So right now I have
a product on which is called EMLA, it's a

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.350
numbing agent. And with clients to get the
best effect of that EMLA, we have them put

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.399
cellophane over the face and have this on
50 minutes when they hit my door to be treated.

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:52.980
By the time I get things prepped and we do
paperwork and whatever is needed to get her

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.609
prepared for electrology, it's been an hour.
At an hour, EMLA is at it's peak and usually

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:07.410
EMLA will last about 30 anywhere to 45 minutes.
So, now I'm going to prep up. My hands have

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:13.720
been sterilized. I'm going to use my gloves.
I put my gloves on and then I'm going to clean

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.520
her face with some alcohol. First I'm going
to get the major part of this EMLA off and

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:26.240
then I'm going to clean the skin and get her
prepped and ready to go. I'm going to remove

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.490
the EMLA. Now this has been taped on the skin
so I've got to be real gentle about the removal.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.920
And I'm only going to be do a segment at a
time because I don't want to expose the rest

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.900
of this to the air. I want to have that working
when I get to it because I'm only going to

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.200
be able to cover a certain area and then when
I work into this next area, I want that to

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:55.670
be numb. So what I'm going to do is just clean
off the large portion of this product, being

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.740
careful not to get it up her nose and on her
lips. And then I use alcohol and a cotton

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:11.170
swab to sterilize the skin because we want
to work on a clean surface. We don't want

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.480
any infection or any problems. So now we have
her prepared to do electrology treatment.
