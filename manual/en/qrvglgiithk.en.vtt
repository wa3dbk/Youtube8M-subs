00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:06.438
Useful weather information   
   depends upon the generation

00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:09.074
of accurate forecasts and   
   their timely distribution.

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.542
It is then the responsibility 
   of the person on the ground

00:00:11.643 --> 00:00:13.778
to take the time to listen   
    to and have the knowledge

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:16.815
and skills to comprehend    
        the information.

00:00:16.916 --> 00:00:19.017
This information, along    
   with personal observations

00:00:19.118 --> 00:00:21.586
and local knowledge      
      can then be applied.

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:23.121
So how do you interpret    
         the information

00:00:23.222 --> 00:00:24.823
in a fire weather forecast?

00:00:24.924 --> 00:00:26.991
How is it different when you  
 read it versus listening to it

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:28.960
over the radio, and      
       how do you give it

00:00:29.061 --> 00:00:30.929
or receive it in a briefing?

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.797
Rick Ochoa works for      
       predictive Services

00:00:32.898 --> 00:00:34.699
at the National Interagency  
          Fire Center.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.036
He has written many      
     fire weather forecasts.

00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:39.871
We hope he can help you    
    to interpret the content

00:00:39.972 --> 00:00:44.175
of the forecasts you see,   
   hear and deliver every day.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.440
The main components of a Fire 
   Weather Forecast are first:

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:48.440
THE HEADLINES.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.880
The headlirning could be a Red Flag Warning

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.880
a Fire Weather Watch;     
     something real critical  for the firefighters

00:00:55.988 --> 00:00:59.224
And if I can explain what   
     a Red Flag Warning is,

00:00:59.325 --> 00:01:01.892
a Red Flag Warning       
        is a combination

00:01:01.994 --> 00:01:06.631
of critical fire weather,   
  such as winds, dry lightning,

00:01:06.732 --> 00:01:08.533
in combination with dry fuels.

00:01:08.634 --> 00:01:12.570
These warnings and watches are 
provided for firefighter safety.

00:01:12.671 --> 00:01:16.508
A warning, a Red Flag Warning 
   means those conditions are

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:18.543
either occurring or eminent.

00:01:18.644 --> 00:01:21.979
A Fire Weather Watch means   
 that those conditions may occur

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.883
in the near future; in     
    the next 12 to 48 hours.

00:01:25.984 --> 00:01:30.555
The good warning or good watch 
 has both a geographic location,

00:01:30.656 --> 00:01:33.291
such as the Boise       
        National Forest,

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:36.927
in addition to a particular  
    fire weather zone number.

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:40.465
The WEATHER DISCUSSION will  
talk about the synoptic features

00:01:40.566 --> 00:01:43.434
such as: cold fronts,     
      high pressure ridges,

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:47.705
low pressure troughs, and so on, 
  that's producing the weather.

00:01:47.806 --> 00:01:53.311
A lot of times these forecasts 
 are very detailed and very long

00:01:53.412 --> 00:01:55.746
and it's important for the   
    listener to try and pull

00:01:55.847 --> 00:01:58.583
out what are the        
     important things like:

00:01:58.684 --> 00:02:02.654
cold fronts are very important,
    any kind of wind shifts,

00:02:02.754 --> 00:02:07.392
thunderstorms, turning hotter, 
turning drier, things like that.

00:02:07.493 --> 00:02:09.860
So you should really      
          be listening

00:02:09.961 --> 00:02:12.397
for those weather features   
      that are really going

00:02:12.498 --> 00:02:16.201
to affect the conditions    
          on your fire.

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:18.836
The first element in a Fire  
   Weather Forecast is the SKY

00:02:18.937 --> 00:02:22.006
WEATHER: and that'll be the sky
 conditions, whether it's cloudy

00:02:22.107 --> 00:02:25.310
or clear or partly cloudy,   
   and a weather element like,

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:29.980
thunderstorms, rain showers,  
     fog, things like that.

00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:33.951
So pay particular attention to 
 those things that are critical

00:02:34.052 --> 00:02:35.787
such as thunderstorms.

00:02:35.888 --> 00:02:39.023
The next element is TEMPERATURE:
   and it'll give you a range

00:02:39.124 --> 00:02:42.259
of temperatures for your    
  particular fire weather area.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.196
And it'll often times give you 
   a trend, whether it's going

00:02:45.297 --> 00:02:49.133
to be five degrees warmer,   
 five degrees cooler, and so on.

00:02:49.234 --> 00:02:52.303
The next one is HUMIDITY:   
      it'll give you again,

00:02:52.404 --> 00:02:55.707
a range of humidity      
   values, along with a trend.

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:59.077
And after that is the WIND: with
 the winds you'll get a variety,

00:02:59.177 --> 00:03:01.345
you'll get slope valley winds,

00:03:01.446 --> 00:03:04.415
ridge top winds,        
       twenty-foot winds.

00:03:04.516 --> 00:03:09.621
And twenty-foot winds are   
     those winds twenty feet

00:03:09.722 --> 00:03:12.523
So, if you're dealing with   
    an area with just grass,

00:03:12.625 --> 00:03:13.658
it's going to be twenty feet.

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:15.392
If you're dealing in timber,

00:03:15.494 --> 00:03:19.364
it's twenty above the average 
   tops of those trees there.

00:03:19.465 --> 00:03:21.600
Obviously, if you're      
     on a ridge top you want

00:03:21.701 --> 00:03:22.800
to listen for those winds.

00:03:22.901 --> 00:03:25.169
If you're down in the valley, 
    pay particular attention

00:03:25.271 --> 00:03:27.572
to those slope and valley winds.

00:03:27.673 --> 00:03:32.844
The HAINES INDEX is a index that
combines stability and moisture.

00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:37.915
And the values range from   
      2 to 6, 6 being High.

00:03:38.016 --> 00:03:42.387
And so this index does not   
    include things like wind

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:45.557
or other factors like that;  
    it's strictly a moisture

00:03:45.658 --> 00:03:49.294
and stability of that     
 atmosphere close to the ground.

00:03:49.395 --> 00:03:52.864
So again, what I'd be listening
for there is if there's a Haines

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:55.600
of 5 or 6, Moderate or High,

00:03:55.701 --> 00:03:57.969
those are the times I'd    
   really be concerned about.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.600
If it's a 2, 3 or 4, typically 
   those are the lower ranges

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.760
typically there's not going to be an issue

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:06.740
with stability or moisture.

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:11.682
LAL, LIGHTNING ACTIVITY    
   LEVEL talk about the number

00:04:11.783 --> 00:04:14.652
of lightning strikes you're  
going to have over a given area.

00:04:14.753 --> 00:04:19.057
They range from 1, which is  
    no thunder storms to a 6,

00:04:19.158 --> 00:04:22.426
which is numerous       
  thunderstorms, typically dry.

00:04:22.527 --> 00:04:28.466
So again, I'd be listening for,
 you know, values like 3, 4, 5, 6

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:30.601
those are the  ones that are going

00:04:30.702 --> 00:04:32.403
to contain more thunderstorms.

00:04:32.504 --> 00:04:33.838
In addition to the       
         thunderstorms,

00:04:33.939 --> 00:04:36.241
listen very closely as     
    to whether they're going

00:04:36.342 --> 00:04:41.012
to be wet thunderstorms / dry 
   thunderstorms or a mixture.

00:04:41.113 --> 00:04:44.448
The MIXING HEIGHT basically  
      tells the firefighter

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.284
that lower atmosphere.

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:48.219
What is the depth of that   
     atmosphere that's going

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.487
to be well mixed?

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:53.120
Typically, in the afternoons  
      it'll be quite high;

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:55.260
it could be several      
         thousand feet.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:57.220
and at night typically those mixing layers,

00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.780
those mixing levels come down quite a bit;

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.700
they might just be       
        few hundred feet.

00:05:01.801 --> 00:05:05.169
That's important because the  
    higher the mixing height,

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:08.706
the greater the instability,  
  and so with that you're going

00:05:08.808 --> 00:05:12.644
to probably see more fire   
     activity, fire behavior

00:05:12.745 --> 00:05:14.479
with the greater mixing heights.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.081
TRANSPORT WINDS are important 
    because you want to know

00:05:17.182 --> 00:05:19.050
where that smoke's       
       going to be going.

00:05:19.151 --> 00:05:23.455
So that'll, the average    
  winds within that mixed layer

00:05:23.556 --> 00:05:27.325
as to whether their going to  
   be coming out of the south

00:05:27.426 --> 00:05:29.928
or So, if you have highive   
     you mixing heights

00:05:30.028 --> 00:05:33.598
and high transport winds, you're going  to have pretty good smoke dispersion

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:36.067
Low mixing height and low   
    winds are typically going

00:05:36.168 --> 00:05:37.702
to be smoke problems.

00:05:37.803 --> 00:05:39.838
The EXTENDED FORECAST:     
    There what I'd be looking

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:41.806
for is anything out      
        of the ordinary:

00:05:41.907 --> 00:05:43.608
Are there going to       
        be thunderstorms?

00:05:43.709 --> 00:05:45.710
Are there going to       
        be strong winds?

00:05:45.811 --> 00:05:48.546
Get an idea about  
  whether it's going to be warmer or drier

00:05:48.647 --> 00:05:50.982
A lot of times the       
 to be tmost interesting

00:05:50.984 --> 00:05:53.551
and most significant weather  is going to be occuring

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:57.800
in the extended period so pay close attention to that.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.800
Fire weather forecasts are   
   full of useful information

00:06:01.893 --> 00:06:04.262
and are readily available   
   throughout the fire season.

00:06:04.363 --> 00:06:07.265
The next exercise is intended 
    to provide an opportunity

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:09.033
to translate a fire      
        weather forecast

00:06:09.134 --> 00:06:11.135
into the form of a briefing.

00:06:11.236 --> 00:06:13.171
Your facilitator will     
    now set up the exercise.
