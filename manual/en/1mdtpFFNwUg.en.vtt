00:00:10.386 --> 00:00:10.706
&gt;&gt; Greg Shamitaw: Hello.

00:00:11.586 --> 00:00:12.776
My name is Greg Shamitaw [phonetic].

00:00:13.196 --> 00:00:14.776
Welcome to the International Space Station.

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:18.956
This is my crewmate, Box [phonetic], and
we're sitting here pondering our next move

00:00:19.036 --> 00:00:20.956
for the Earth versus Space chess match.

00:00:21.646 --> 00:00:24.606
We've been up here a week already
on a shuttle flight STS134.

00:00:24.606 --> 00:00:28.056
It's all going really, really
well, we're having a great time.

00:00:29.836 --> 00:00:33.256
&gt;&gt; Greg Johnson: Hello everyone, I'm Greg
Johnson [phonetic], otherwise known as Box.

00:00:34.316 --> 00:00:39.906
Thanks for following our mission so far, and --
and this very fun and challenging chess match.

00:00:40.646 --> 00:00:43.796
We've been working hard up here to
install some critical spare equipment

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:50.636
for the International Space Station, and also
this 2 billion dollar cosmic particle detector

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:54.446
that may revolutionize the way
scientists understand our universe.

00:00:55.136 --> 00:00:57.756
We've also done a lot of
robotics and space walks,

00:00:57.846 --> 00:00:59.336
Taz [phonetic] just did one the other day.

00:00:59.856 --> 00:01:03.806
And we're basically setting up the space
station for when the space shuttle retires.

00:01:05.356 --> 00:01:08.256
&gt;&gt; Greg Shamitaw: When we've had some free
time we've also really enjoyed playing chess

00:01:08.336 --> 00:01:09.026
with all of you.

00:01:09.846 --> 00:01:11.726
This has been a really good
game so far, don't you think?

00:01:12.306 --> 00:01:12.686
&gt;&gt; Greg Johnson: Oh yeah.

00:01:13.556 --> 00:01:17.496
But one of the great things about chess is it
brings people together from all walks of life --

00:01:18.056 --> 00:01:22.006
people from different cultures,
different language, different countries.

00:01:22.926 --> 00:01:26.166
Building bridges between people is
an important part of what we do here

00:01:26.166 --> 00:01:29.636
on the International Space
Station, with 16 member nations

00:01:29.686 --> 00:01:31.306
that have contributed to the building of it.

00:01:32.006 --> 00:01:35.706
Right now we have a crew of 12, representing
at least four different countries.

00:01:37.096 --> 00:01:39.626
&gt;&gt; Greg Shamitaw: The other great thing
about chess is that it challenges your mind,

00:01:40.086 --> 00:01:44.066
and it inspires kids in ways that'll make
them great problem solvers in the future.

00:01:44.776 --> 00:01:48.286
From here, the view of our world is absolutely
breathtaking, but there are challenges.

00:01:49.186 --> 00:01:52.556
Bringing people together with critical
thinking skills to solve the world's problems,

00:01:53.216 --> 00:01:55.206
this is the extension of
what a simple game of chess

00:01:55.266 --> 00:01:57.186
like this can actually represent for our future.

00:01:59.346 --> 00:02:01.356
&gt;&gt; Greg Johnson: So thanks
to everyone for participating

00:02:01.356 --> 00:02:03.336
in our Earth versus Space chess match.

00:02:04.056 --> 00:02:08.516
Good luck trying to catch up though,
we're going 17,500 miles an hour.

00:02:09.136 --> 00:02:11.876
That's speed chess like you've
never seen before.

00:02:12.686 --> 00:02:23.276
&gt;&gt; Greg Shamitaw: And thanks to the US Chess
Federation and NASA for sponsoring our game.

00:02:23.936 --> 00:02:26.846
&gt;&gt; It's your move.

00:02:27.426 --> 00:02:27.493
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:02:27.993 --> 00:02:32.040
