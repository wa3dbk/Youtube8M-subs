00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.583
(upbeat music)

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:07.378
- [John White] Welcome back to Southwest
Yard and Garden, I'm John White.

00:00:07.378 --> 00:00:09.750
With me today is Virginia Podmenik.

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.230
And Virginia is a master
gardener here in Dona Ana County.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:14.768
Virginia, happy holidays.

00:00:14.768 --> 00:00:16.300
- [Virgina Podmenik] Happy holidays to you too John.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.111
- Looks like you brought quite a colorful

00:00:18.111 --> 00:00:19.371
basket here with ya.

00:00:19.371 --> 00:00:21.780
- Well I bought some dried flowers

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.250
that I have kind of
collected from my garden.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.170
I like to use them in
arrangements over the winter

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.630
when the real ones, the
fresh ones aren't available.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.080
I thought maybe we could
talk about the plants

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:34.720
and how they grow.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.709
First I brought was the Mexican Sage,

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:40.178
which still has the smell of sage.

00:00:40.178 --> 00:00:41.038
- Oh yes.

00:00:41.038 --> 00:00:42.920
- And it does fill the house nicely

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.091
and it has a pretty purple flower.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.360
- Now the salvia leucantha
has a gorgeous flower on it.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:55.929
It's grown quite popular,
easy to find in the nurseries,

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:00.034
and can get quite tall, can
put quite a bit of growth on it.

00:01:00.034 --> 00:01:03.186
So, it can get pretty lanky and grows well

00:01:03.186 --> 00:01:07.377
in full sun location as
well as a partial shade.

00:01:07.377 --> 00:01:09.425
The flower, of course, is much better

00:01:09.425 --> 00:01:11.474
in the full sun location,

00:01:11.474 --> 00:01:13.087
requires a little bit of extra water

00:01:13.087 --> 00:01:15.438
but it is a excellent plant

00:01:15.438 --> 00:01:17.438
that gets kind of woody after awhile.

00:01:17.438 --> 00:01:19.928
Sometimes it needs to be,
you know, a little frost

00:01:19.928 --> 00:01:23.446
back and it'll come back out the next year,

00:01:23.446 --> 00:01:26.786
but it is a great plant, it's used a lot.

00:01:26.786 --> 00:01:29.568
It's a beautiful, colorful plant.

00:01:29.568 --> 00:01:31.738
- Ours is about six, seven feet tall

00:01:31.738 --> 00:01:33.837
and it dies back to nothing and you wonder

00:01:33.837 --> 00:01:37.196
how it's gonna come up
but it does it every year.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.880
I brought some linaria, penny plant.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.520
It's a bi-annual, it's a--
and it's just a small flower

00:01:45.528 --> 00:01:47.729
the first year, you have
to wait til the second year

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.139
to get these flat paper
cases, but it looks nice

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:53.078
in arrangements too.

00:01:53.078 --> 00:01:57.115
- This is the seed pod on it,
and this plant is another one

00:01:57.115 --> 00:01:59.628
that does quite well in the area.

00:01:59.628 --> 00:02:01.327
In the Southern part of the state,

00:02:01.327 --> 00:02:03.847
we have very intense
sunlight. So a lot of times,

00:02:03.847 --> 00:02:08.180
having plants that are
in a little bit less

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.040
full exposure situation, the
plants actually do better

00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:15.447
'cause they still get a
good amount of sunlight,

00:02:15.447 --> 00:02:17.259
and yet they get a little protection from

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:21.380
the real hot part of the
day so the plants do great.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.494
These will last, you
know, basically forever

00:02:24.494 --> 00:02:26.843
and these are the seed pod again

00:02:26.843 --> 00:02:29.902
and as you put them up against
light you can see the seeds

00:02:29.902 --> 00:02:32.777
showing through them so
they are quite attractive

00:02:32.777 --> 00:02:35.504
for several different reasons so again,

00:02:35.504 --> 00:02:36.914
another good plant to grow.

00:02:36.914 --> 00:02:38.435
- Right, and on the packet like you say,

00:02:38.435 --> 00:02:41.094
it does say full sun but I
grow it in complete shade

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.013
and it does extremely well.

00:02:43.013 --> 00:02:45.944
I have a little cluster of lavender

00:02:45.944 --> 00:02:47.603
that I've picked from my garden.

00:02:47.603 --> 00:02:50.393
Again, something else that smells wonderful

00:02:50.393 --> 00:02:52.976
and looks nice in a little pot.

00:02:54.134 --> 00:02:56.225
- Now the lavender's
have gained quite a bit

00:02:56.225 --> 00:03:00.465
of popularity with all the
aromatherapy and different

00:03:00.465 --> 00:03:04.694
interest in that end of it. But,
it is a Mediterranean plant

00:03:04.694 --> 00:03:08.993
that should do well in
our part of the world,

00:03:08.993 --> 00:03:12.866
very similar type climate and
there's a lot of different

00:03:12.866 --> 00:03:17.387
lavenders that are grown
and I have seen some gardens

00:03:17.387 --> 00:03:20.495
where they have several of the
different lavenders in them,

00:03:20.495 --> 00:03:23.343
but they are, you know,
very, very fragrant

00:03:23.343 --> 00:03:25.951
and give you a good long-lasting bloom,

00:03:25.951 --> 00:03:29.284
so they are a plant that should be grown

00:03:30.764 --> 00:03:33.705
in similar gardens and a good plant.

00:03:33.705 --> 00:03:35.094
- They don't take much water, do they?

00:03:35.094 --> 00:03:36.474
- No, they don't take much water,

00:03:36.474 --> 00:03:39.282
you can actually kill them
maybe with too much water.

00:03:39.282 --> 00:03:40.115
- Right.

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:43.205
A few pomegranates.

00:03:43.205 --> 00:03:45.634
Some people eat them, I
like to just dry them.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.240
- Yeah, the pomegranates are great,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.160
'cause one, they do
produce an edibile fruit.

00:03:54.176 --> 00:03:56.930
The plant is a very good
plant, it can grow into

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.097
quite a large shrub, has the
beautiful red flowers on it.

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:05.738
It's a very good plant
because it's tolerant

00:04:05.738 --> 00:04:10.009
of very salty conditions
and can take a lot of abuse

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:13.570
and yet produces a very
pretty flower on it

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:15.826
and then the pomegranates themselves

00:04:15.826 --> 00:04:19.390
make nice dried fruit arrangements,

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:23.749
so these are good examples,
so you could keep those

00:04:23.749 --> 00:04:25.958
and keep reusing them.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:30.680
- I have the artichoke
pods which dry beautifully

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.500
for floral arrangements.

00:04:33.501 --> 00:04:36.980
- The Globe Artichoke,
which this comes from

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:39.132
has a beautiful flower on it, you know,

00:04:39.132 --> 00:04:42.528
thistle-like flower
with a kind of blueish,

00:04:42.528 --> 00:04:45.892
purplish flower on it. And
then, these are the seeds

00:04:45.892 --> 00:04:48.911
that you can pull out, but
it does make an excellent

00:04:48.911 --> 00:04:53.078
dried flower arrangement piece
so those are great to use.

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:58.358
- I have the twigs of the Red Dogwood.

00:04:58.358 --> 00:05:01.516
They leave these stems turn
a beautiful shade of red

00:05:01.516 --> 00:05:05.935
over the winter and they're
wonderful used in decorations.

00:05:05.935 --> 00:05:10.504
- Now the Red Twig Dogwood,
I know I've seen it used

00:05:10.504 --> 00:05:13.422
a lot more up North than it
has so much down South here

00:05:13.422 --> 00:05:16.339
but it's a plant that, as you said,

00:05:17.254 --> 00:05:19.345
is much more colorful
in it's dormant state

00:05:19.345 --> 00:05:22.595
with the red twigs on it and this plant

00:05:24.003 --> 00:05:26.644
would probably be happier in our situation

00:05:26.644 --> 00:05:29.888
than east or north type exposure so it's

00:05:29.888 --> 00:05:32.120
a little more protected.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:34.581
It probably will require
a little bit more water,

00:05:34.581 --> 00:05:40.700
but this is a good plant
also to use for it's color.

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.940
- And last we have some Gypsophilia,

00:05:43.942 --> 00:05:48.109
which is nice in floral
arrangements year-round really.

00:05:48.967 --> 00:05:52.382
- Well Gypsophilia is another
one that is easy to grow

00:05:52.382 --> 00:05:57.326
doesn't require much care and
gives you quite a spectacular

00:05:57.326 --> 00:05:59.351
flower and seed head production,

00:05:59.351 --> 00:06:02.140
so good for flower arrangements.

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:03.788
Well Virginia, thank you
very much for sharing

00:06:03.788 --> 00:06:05.947
part of your garden with us today.

00:06:05.947 --> 00:06:07.114
- My pleasure.
