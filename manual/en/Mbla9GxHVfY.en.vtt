00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.800
Hey guys Fourpaws here and today I've got
a quick tip for using your tower to manipulate

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.800
the minion line.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.030
I'm going to show you guys an alternative
method of last hitting under your turret and

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.349
then state how this will impact your lane
phase.

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.390
As always theres tons of context to when or
why you might apply what you see today into

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.050
your own games
so for the sake of keeping this video short

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.210
I'll try to be as concise as possible.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.560
In this first example, you can see me last
hitting the minions as soon as the towers

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:30.820
has weakend them up.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.360
This is how the vast majority of league players
last hit, especially those who don't consider

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.390
factors like minion control.

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.989
By doing this you will keep the minions under
your turret for roughly 14 seconds and then

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.730
your minions will start to push away.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.850
However in this second clip you can see me
choosing to slowly last hit under my turret.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.710
When I do this, I wait for my turret to begin
shooting the minion before I attack.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.399
Effectivly burning a tower attack, and extending
the lifespan of the enemy minions.

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.720
This holds the creep line under my turret
for an additional five seconds or so, and

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.000
if you can utilize this correctly those five
seconds will have a big impact.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.059
Here are some examples of when I choose to
slowly last hit and keep the minion's under

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.059
my turret.

00:01:06.059 --> 00:01:09.710
First of all, if I am losing lane or in a
matchup where the opponent can harass me often,

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.200
this allows for me to hug to my tower for
longer.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.110
So in example if you are playing a melee champion
against a champion with ranged harass such

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.440
as Teemo this can be beneficial to use.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.181
It suddenly becomes harder for teemo to zone
you away from minions and if he attemtps to

00:01:22.181 --> 00:01:24.680
poke you he may take an accidental tower shot.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.540
Alleviating this preassure will help you stay
in lane for longer and grab more cs.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.340
Last htiting slowly under your turret also
has an impact if the enemy jungler is camping

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.369
you or simply coming in for a gank.

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.810
Obviously you can always get tower dived,
but junglers are a lot less likely to attempt

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.159
a dive especially in the early levels.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.740
In this example if you are to hold your wave
under your turret the enemy jungler is wasting

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.350
their time coming to your line.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.900
And a final example of when I most commonly
use this trick is when my own jungler is comming

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.060
to visit top lane.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.469
So if we again use the concept of playing
a melee hero against a teemo.

00:01:56.469 --> 00:02:00.200
Those extra five seconds where Teemo is attempting
to harrass you under your turret is another

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.400
five seconds where he is over extended.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.560
This means that there is a bigger chance that
you and your jungler can connect onto him,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.340
land some cc and damage and either blow some
summoners or grab a kill.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.970
Now before i finish this video I would like
to quickly skim over the weaknesses of slowly

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.250
last hitting.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.910
Your turret will take more damage as the minions
are hitting it for longer.

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:21.330
This can build up a slow push for you, as
your minions will be clumped which often results

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.280
in them all targetting the same minion in
the next enemy minion wave.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.780
And some champions aren't too great at last
hitting under their turret early on, so if

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:30.810
you're playing someone like Swain you are
going to deny yourself CS by doing this.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.860
So I've given you guys quite a bit of food
for thought here.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.260
The more you attempt slow csing under your
turret the quicker you'll be able to identify

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.440
when you should utilize this and the effects
it will have on your lane.
