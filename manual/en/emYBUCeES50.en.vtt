presents

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.800
Hi dears, today I welcome you to my first hairstyle tutorial.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:17.800
As you can see, we are going to deal with a typically festival look.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.000
Since Opener and many other festivals are taking place soon, I hope you'll find it useful.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Here I have three festival hairbands propositions.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Two of them classic, with the third one being an ideal option for buns and all kinds of done-ups, on the side of your head as well.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I've decided to pick this one, as it perfectly matches my colourful kimono.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:53.000
The hairstyle that I'm going to show you is romantic and quite simple for your festival looks to be light and free.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We start with placing the band on your head, which isn't that easy after all, as you have to put it in a strategic position.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Remember to brush the hair away from under the band, as it will help you form the volume of the hairstyle later.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:20.000
When you're done, you can start gathering the strands starting from the front. You can arrange your fringe as you like.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Mine is always unruly.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I like it twisted.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:36.000
I use a hairpin to pin my hair down. I'm going to repeat it using bigger and bigger strands from both sides of my head.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
You have to make like a kind of a meat roll ;)

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Don't worry if it's not perfect in some place, as it's easy to adjust it in the end.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
You can also leave the hairstyle that way, but I think that I need the second part done as well.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.000
You can also leave the hairstyle that way, but I think that I need the second part done as well.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:01.000
The same rule works here as well- you take a strand, twist and pin it down separately.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Remember to make the strands bigger and bigger.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000
And girls, it's crucial that you use hairpins in your hair color.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:21.000
There's nothing worse than a golden haired girl with two black Xs in the middle of her forehead.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
It doesn't have to be perfect, remember that it's a festival look.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
A bit of an 'artistic mess' is needed as well.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
And we move to the last stage- the jewelry.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:39.000
As you can see, the earrings that I'm wearing now are a bit elegant, but as I lately went to Paris with Claire's,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I had a chance to get myself equipped with all kinds of festival accessories.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.500
So today I brought some to show you and we'll see- well, I choose these.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
My festival look, at least from here up, is ready.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Thanks for your attention and ask me in the comments for the tutorials that you would like to see

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
- the ones that you've seen on the blog, or occasional ones as well.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.500
Don't hesitate- we are going to execute everything step by step, and the same refers

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.000
to make-up tutorials, which will appear as well for sure.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Now the festival and freaky one says goodbye, and see you in the next tutorial!

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Don't be a sly old fox and give me a SUB! ;)
