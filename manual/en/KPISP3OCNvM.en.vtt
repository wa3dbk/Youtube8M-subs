00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.470
I guess I should admit right up front to being
a Pixar fan.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.270
I’m not usually into computer animation
at all, but...they do it really well.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:42.040
So for reasons that are obvious—uh, both
for my fanhood and my, uh, genetics—I fell

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.910
in love with Brave, their latest masterwork
of modern animation.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.160
I mention this as a disclaimer, but also to
cede a point on these licensed games I so

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.739
often slam into the ground.

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.800
I mean, when you actually like the source
material, maybe it’s easier to overlook

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.270
the flaws that are usually inherent to a licensed
game.

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:06.780
Did I like this game because it was good or
because Brave was good?

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.170
I’m not sure.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.260
I mean, all I can tell you is...if you liked
Brave, you’ll probably dig this game.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.160
And I’m pretty sure it’s because...it’s
actually not that bad.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:24.920
It’s Brave for the PlayStation 3.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.300
Brave immediately made a good first impression
with me simply with the way it tells Pixar’s

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.060
story...or more appropriately, the way it
doesn’t.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.899
Rather than just retell the film, the game
tells its own variation of the Brave story

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:40.260
by putting Merida on a quest.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.530
So Merida has to travel to eight different
lands to eradicate the blight caused by the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.429
cursed bear Mor'du.

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:51.989
His curse has actually resurrected creatures
of old, which Merida has to destroy.

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:57.380
And that works well because in the movie,
Merida is portrayed as this archer of unrivaled

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:06.920
skill...and the game actually gives her some
targets.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.099
Of course, as a kids game, Brave is pretty
simple.

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.650
Merida can hack and slash with her sword,
and she can fire arrows by shooting with the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.180
right analog stick.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.900
There are also a couple elements she can use,
like wind and fire, which alter the abilities

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.900
of her arrows.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.430
And different enemies are vulnerable to different
elements.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:30.620
Throw in the upgrades and different abilities
she can purchase, and you get a fairly deep

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.219
action game...at least, for a licensed action
game.

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:39.080
And more importantly, it was always fun...again...at
least, for a fan of the movie.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:43.760
I’m not convinced everyone who plays it
would have the same opinion, due to its obvious

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.840
simplicity.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.260
Nonetheless, Brave is an example of a movie
game done right.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.960
It’s not great, by any means, but for what
it is...it’s perfectly solid.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:03:00.770
In fact, my only complaint is that Merida’s
hair—which is this stunning feat of animation

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:04.719
in the movie—is just awful in the game.

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:13.829
But you know, bad hair day aside, it’s a
game fans of the movie should eat up like

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.140
a cursed cake.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:25.930
It’s Brave for the PlayStation 3.
