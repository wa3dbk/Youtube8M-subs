00:00:00.283 --> 00:00:01.824
- [Matt] So what do we got here?

00:00:01.824 --> 00:00:05.450
- [Bryan] This is the legendary
Durian, king of fruits.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:09.279
They are pretty fierce
looking on the outside.

00:00:09.279 --> 00:00:12.248
They smell like old garbage.

00:00:12.248 --> 00:00:14.409
Wanna see how it tastes?

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:15.950
- Yeah, I'm not uh, I don't know,

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:16.990
I'm a little worried about this.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.161
It doesn't uh ...

00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:23.194
It smells kind of like
funky cheese but uh--

00:00:23.194 --> 00:00:25.027
- Lets give it a shot.

00:00:25.923 --> 00:00:27.467
- We are on a mission.

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:32.268
I am basically the only
person to not try durian.

00:00:32.268 --> 00:00:33.674
And there's no time like the present.

00:00:33.674 --> 00:00:35.177
I'm feeling a little sick but I figure,

00:00:35.177 --> 00:00:36.391
you know, hey, why not?

00:00:36.391 --> 00:00:37.224
- [Blonde Man] Yeah.

00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:38.057
- Why not?

00:00:38.057 --> 00:00:38.899
- [Matt] Good luck pal.

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:40.672
- Durian, for those of you who don't know,

00:00:40.672 --> 00:00:45.672
it's Singapore's national fruit
and it smells like garbage.

00:00:45.672 --> 00:00:48.148
- Or feet, or rotten onions.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:50.131
It's known as the king of fruits.

00:00:50.131 --> 00:00:52.845
- [Chris] It uh...it just kind of attacks you.

00:00:52.845 --> 00:00:55.832
It kind of attacks your nose.

00:00:55.832 --> 00:00:57.598
- Oh, I'm so excited for this!

00:00:57.598 --> 00:01:00.334
(Chris laughs)

00:01:00.334 --> 00:01:01.417
- It's sharp.

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:03.974
It doesn't want to be eaten.

00:01:03.974 --> 00:01:04.807
(Matt laughs)

00:01:04.807 --> 00:01:08.974
Oh man, in the wild these
things must never get eaten.

00:01:13.287 --> 00:01:14.120
- [Woman] Okay.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.272
- Okay, okay here.

00:01:16.272 --> 00:01:18.047
It looks like stomach to me,

00:01:18.047 --> 00:01:21.089
like the stomach of a fruit.

00:01:21.089 --> 00:01:22.185
(person wolf whistles)

00:01:22.185 --> 00:01:24.075
(laughs)

00:01:24.075 --> 00:01:25.534
It smells very interesting.

00:01:25.534 --> 00:01:27.562
Okay, and then do I just
eat with my fingers?

00:01:27.562 --> 00:01:28.395
- [Woman] Yeah, yes.

00:01:28.395 --> 00:01:29.515
- King of fruits.
- Yeah.

00:01:29.515 --> 00:01:31.340
- Okay, and you like it?

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.173
You eat this?

00:01:32.173 --> 00:01:33.522
- (speaks in foreign language)

00:01:33.522 --> 00:01:35.272
- Okay, no, this guy!

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.087
Okay, so I just, like this and I eat a --

00:01:41.532 --> 00:01:44.532
- [Matt] Yeah, you eat a bite.

00:01:45.437 --> 00:01:47.167
(Chris Laughs loudly)

00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:50.167
(Matt laughs)

00:01:52.461 --> 00:01:53.978
- [Bryan] Oh God, oh God.

00:01:53.978 --> 00:01:55.061
(laughs)

00:01:55.061 --> 00:01:58.394
(high-pitched laughing)

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.077
- Oh God, it's horrible, ugh.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:08.882
- I don't know it's a,

00:02:10.007 --> 00:02:11.777
it's kinda sweet.

00:02:11.777 --> 00:02:13.860
- It tastes like a prune,

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:16.357
mixed with fish.

00:02:16.357 --> 00:02:19.357
(Matt laughs)

00:02:21.726 --> 00:02:25.393
I can't describe, it
is such a unique taste.

00:02:26.664 --> 00:02:28.635
- I don't know that you
could call that a fruit.

00:02:28.635 --> 00:02:30.585
It really tastes like old cheese.

00:02:30.585 --> 00:02:34.124
- It's like if you took
an old stinky cheese,

00:02:34.124 --> 00:02:35.824
wrapped it in garbage a little bit.

00:02:35.824 --> 00:02:40.456
- The combination of the texture
is this creamy rottenness.

00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:41.716
- I don't know it kinda works on you.

00:02:41.716 --> 00:02:43.471
It kinda grows on you a little bit.

00:02:43.471 --> 00:02:44.721
- Nah, I'm out.

00:02:44.721 --> 00:02:47.226
- I don't know, I'm not hatin' it.

00:02:47.226 --> 00:02:48.807
- I don't understand
why anybody would ever

00:02:48.807 --> 00:02:51.283
eat that on a regular basis though.

00:02:51.283 --> 00:02:53.004
Why would you choose to eat that?

00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:54.500
(Matt laughs)

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.260
My breath smells so good right now.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:57.858
- It's so bad.
(laughs)

00:02:57.858 --> 00:02:59.025
No, I'm done.

00:02:59.025 --> 00:02:59.858
- Okay.
