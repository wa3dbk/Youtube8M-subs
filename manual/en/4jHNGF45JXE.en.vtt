00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.299
whats up this is Ross with Tactics Boardshop and 
right now you're checking out the

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.900
sector nine barge complete, part of the
downhill division series

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.670
this is just a sick freeride board for
anybody who wants to go out and push out

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.119
some slides and have some fun

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.630
on some hills.  It has a total length of 36
inches

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.919
a with other 9.75 inches and a wheelbase

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.859
of 24 inches.  That's a fairly compact size

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:34.290
for a downhill freeride board with
the pre lively

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.450
and fun wheelbase so it can be very
responsive

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.560
not the best cruiser for pushing around
town because it is pretty stiff

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.630
and by yeah, if you're in the hills its going to be

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.030
plenty stable because it's got a nine ply
construction there

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.520
and it'll keep it nice and stiff and stable

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.920
but uhh the coolest thing about this
board I think

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.970
is the concave that's going on right
here

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.600
now if you're familiar with the Sector
Nine Daisy

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.759
that is now the Arrow, this is

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:10.369
basically the old Daisy mold so it's
a pretty mellow

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:15.020
rocker drop but has just enough of a rounded spoon shaped

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.719
and there to really give you something
to wedge your feet into

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.810
but it's not too extreme and isn't going like
push into your foot and feel funny I'm a

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.319
huge fan and a small and I spent a lot
of time on it

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:28.520
and it does on the main differences

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.009
from this and the Daisy is where the
trucks are mounted

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.920
so on the old days in the truck to be
mounted about here would be your back

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.409
truck

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.079
these are mounted in a little farther so
it is a little bit

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:45.039
on that drop just getting in the truck a
little more wedge making a little more

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.299
responsive in the front

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:51.869
and but also get your foot closer to the
trucks when they're right in that rocket

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.159
pocket I was talking about

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:57.459
which is really sweet and mild AZ before
the main Daisy came out I used to do the

00:01:57.459 --> 00:01:59.100
same thing rendering back in

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.090
and it feels really good

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.110
yeah and you got that kick tail on there
which is pretty sweet Ste

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.429
extra maneuverability their I'm and you
can get some more tricks

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.630
pretty wide their see a play around well
funny with a rectangular shape but you

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.410
know it's got that whoever shape you
want

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.660
and it does have the going at 10 inch

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:23.380
charger two trucks on it I'm pretty sick
all around trucks they're great for

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.459
carving if you want to set him up loose

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:29.190
you know you're trying to push around
town but if you wanna throw an extra

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.260
like a barrel bushing in there to be a
lot stiffer a lot more stable for your

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:33.570
free ride down how

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.930
you never hear I deferred I know but it
does I'm pretty sure we'll Mesa keep

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:39.330
that in mind it's not be super stable
for going

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.200
who fast and wheels on there are the
sector nine

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.850
65 mil mere barb all wheels in just a
sec free ride we owe

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.630
on the coming ATA so they're a little
bit %uh faster on the slide then the top

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:55.160
shelf

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:59.070
they're gonna feel very similar and then
you come with a stone ground contact

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:02.070
at so yes live really good

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.269
right out the box great for a beginner
for that reason

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:08.700
saw setup is great for beginners who
want to learn how to slide his yacht

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.459
funny space and you move in

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.220
and its Kenny response to find more with
planning a concave there

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.549
and that's about it if you have any more
questions please drop those in the box

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:21.860
below and I'll be happy to help you out

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:25.380
