[Indiscernible text from television clips]
&gt;&gt; TV ANNOUNCER: And what would you say to

00:00:26.341 --> 00:00:30.090
those that argue that robotics is the reason
for a sharp increase in unemployment over

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.170
the last 8 years.
&gt;&gt; IOANNIS IOANNOU: What if we lived in a

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.010
world that failed to meet the climate change
challenge?

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.170
The world has witnessed unprecedented levels
of economic growth.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.699
We observe a lot of overuse, or even negligence
toward the natural resources. We are hitting

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:52.879
a boundary.
&gt;&gt; SIMONA BOTTI: What if we have too much

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:58.330
information? What if the increasing access
to information and the decreasing cost of

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:01.969
information is going to make consumers worse
off?

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.920
&gt;&gt; ANDREW SCOTT: What if everyone lived to
100?

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:10.650
More than fifty percent of the children born
in the western world have a life expectancy

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.100
in excess of 100. Something that companies,
governments and societies in general are going

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.759
to have to respond to in the next 20 to 30
years.

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.659
&gt;&gt; RAJESH CHANDY: The innovative companies,
no matter how large or small, seem to share

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:29.820
something really simple: the extent to which
senior executives spend time thinking about

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.469
the future. What if every company in the world
had a culture of innovation?

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:40.380
&gt;&gt; JULIAN BIRKINSHAW: What if we could harness
the full emotional energy and capability of

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:48.080
the people who work for us? Rather than pushing
them toward quantitative rational analysis,

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.610
what could we get out of them on a more intuitive
or emotional level?

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.020
&gt;&gt; ANDREW LIEIERMAN: Fifty years ago, management
was still a pretty amateur affair. There was

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.070
very little understanding about that fact
that management needed to be learned. People

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:03.409
learned from experience; they learned on the
job.

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.950
What would happen if everyone had access to
business education?

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.909
&gt;&gt; TV ANNOUNCER: Our economy is the strongest
it has ever been.

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.569
&gt;&gt; TV ANNOUNCER: This comes with a huge responsibility
for businesses.
