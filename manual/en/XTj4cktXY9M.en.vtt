Stay focus on the road...

00:00:53.923 --> 00:00:54.940
Hello

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.842
I'm looking after 2 bikers

00:00:57.842 --> 00:00:59.914
one with a yellow bike...

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.049
You understand French ?

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.698
Yes !

00:01:01.698 --> 00:01:04.463
Did you see 2 motorbikes with one yellow ?

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.329
One is just passed at high speed

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:07.324
This way ?

00:01:07.324 --> 00:01:09.927
He is not expected to ride fast...

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:12.213
He was fast !

00:01:12.213 --> 00:01:12.996
They were two ?

00:01:12.996 --> 00:01:14.286
No, just one !

00:01:14.297 --> 00:01:15.896
ok Thanks

00:01:15.896 --> 00:01:17.323
But you have your GPS ?

00:01:17.323 --> 00:01:19.600
Ah ah it will not help me to find him (the GPS)

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.575
We saw just one ^^

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.428
Ok Thanks, have a nice day !

00:01:43.735 --> 00:01:54.082
Engine checks...

00:03:26.751 --> 00:03:29.283
You enjoy the Biker Spirit ? :-)

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:31.725

00:04:43.769 --> 00:04:46.250

00:04:46.489 --> 00:04:48.181

00:04:48.181 --> 00:04:48.633

00:04:48.821 --> 00:04:50.135
