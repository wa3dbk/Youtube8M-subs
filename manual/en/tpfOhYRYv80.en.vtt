00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.100
SNAKES: But what about my money?
JOHNNY: What money?

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.740
SNAKES: AC said you have some dough for me.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.640
JOHNNY: Is that a fact? How much do I owe you?!

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.860
SNAKES: AC said 10%.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.020
JOHNNY: Too bad, AC ain't in charge no more.
 SNAKES: What do you mean?

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.480
JOHNNY: He's upstairs taking a bath.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.620
He'll call you when he gets out.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.780
Hey, I tell you what I'm
gonna give you, Snakes.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:59.960
I'm gonna give you to the count of 10 to get your ugly, yellow, no good keister off my property
before I pump your guts full of lead.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.780
Alright, Johnny, I'm sorry.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.860

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.780
I don't know who's in there but
somebody just got blown away.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.320
Somebody beat us to the job,
they're in there. Two of 'em.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:43.440
There was arguing,
one of them blew the other one away.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.660
-Who?
-(SOFTLY) I don't know!

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.740
I thought I recognized one of their voices.
And I know I've heard that name "Snakes" before.

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:55.100
Snakes? Snakes. Snakes.
I don't know no Snakes.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.460
Snakes. Let's get outta here.
