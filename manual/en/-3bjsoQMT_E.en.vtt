00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:17.640
But what is most amazing is that we go through everything in one family: crises, tests, some joint lessons, we have to raise children,

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.240
to become better, cleaner – this is a task of a higher level.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.500
And (finding) the second half is the next level,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:39.740
the level of the intelligence.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.420
Intelligence is something that makes us attend seminars, this kind of festivals.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.220
When I begin to understand: maybe it’s not all about my partner,

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.800
maybe there is my part of responsibility in the fact that our relationship didn’t work out?

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.360
The intelligence also does two things

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:15.300
well, in fact, it does a lot of things. But the intelligence chooses what is useful for development

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.100
and throws away something that is not.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:31.140
The mind feeds on impressions, but the intelligence feeds on knowledge.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:40.360
It is interesting that for the intelligence, purpose and sense are very important.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:46.560
At the intellectual level, a person does not usually reflect, his one purpose and only sense is to satisfy his feelings.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.520
The world has an amazing task – to form us. The world is a huge school,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.080
a school of life.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.920
So, on the platform of intelligence, a person has the meaning.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:04.420
We say: “Find the second half.” And what for?

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:12.000
We all have already understood why we are looking for a second half being on the platform of the mind and body, right?

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.860
For enjoyment.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:24.760
Tell me please, raise yours hands those, who want to be simply used as a tool for enjoyment?

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.780
No! No!

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.920
Indeed, we can certainly deliver joy, pleasure, and so on to somebody.

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:39.060
But if you are just used as an operational machine...

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.500
Do you remember there were such machines for soda?

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:45.700
You even didn’t insert three coins there, just banged on it, right?

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.680
One time, another hit, so that soda comes out at the end.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.860
If soda is not coming it’s a very huge disappointment.

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.100
And so many people treat each other like a three-coined soda machine.

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.940
And I’m sure that many of you have already experienced this feeling,

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.200
this pain,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.240
and many have already split up.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:14.400
Because you felt this usage of each other.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.940
Because no one wants to be used.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:29.560
And on the platform of intelligence, a person begins to ask himself questions: “What for? What is the meaning?”

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:40.740
We really do not understand the meaning of our being, we have not disclosed our mission, have not opened our heart, have not become truly happy.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:50.660
Then the emptiness appears in the heart, and we become extra picky to the other.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:56.420
“You are my second half, why did not you make me happy?”

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:08.820
On the platform of intelligence, we begin to understand what is the sense of this second half.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:21.760
This is a very interesting thing that we can learn to love when we are next to those to whom we can say kind words,

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.640
who need to be supported,

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:40.100
those who are in trouble now, and we can help them somehow. If we are surrounded by such people who need us,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.680
there is a great meaning in this.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.360
If we unravel it

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:54.520
and become such kind of persons, people next to us will start to grow, blossom, become better.

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.040
Therefore, if we begin to change ourselves

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:06.680
this way we’ll have a special feeling to the person who is next to us.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:15.040
This feeling is the most important platform on which everything else is built.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.080
Without this, it is not possible.

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:23.680
It is not possible to find the second half, it is not possible to get along with anyone, it is not possible to become better.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:30.820
Nothing is possible without this one feeling, which is called… how?

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:36.060
No, not love! My dears, love is at the back of beyond...

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.200
Thanks! Quite right!

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:46.800
Gratitude ... The greatness of a man is determined by his gratitude.

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:54.600
The human’s intelligence works only when you are grateful.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:00.820
And you know, it's interesting that the intelligence knows that gratitude is a human quality.

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:04.500
We teach a child: “What do you have to say to mom?”

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.760
Yes? So we understand that it is important. And we always say thank you to each other,

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:17.660
because we consider ourselves decent people. Why? We have an understanding that a decent person is a grateful person.

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:23.060
But what is most interesting is that gratitude is a heart feature.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:27.440
Today we talked so much about the heart.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.940
And if you have close relatives in your life,

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.800
there is the second half, there are children ...

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:52.460
The only platform with which everything begins to unfold, unpack, reveal the hidden meaning, the depth begins to unfold only when the heart is grateful.

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.460
The intelligence is ‘awakes’ by gratitude.

00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:03.620
And of course, we have intelligence. But the most amazing thing is that we can now trace with you what’s the mind, what’s the intelligence inside us.

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.620
And who thinks all these thoughts? Who understands this?

00:07:07.620 --> 00:07:11.960
“It is now when my intelligence has woken up, it has come through.”

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:21.520
Quite right, in fact I am the consciousness.

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:25.120
And this is a soul.

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.960
It’s interesting that people are arguing about the soul.

00:07:27.960 --> 00:07:30.620
They say: “I do not know whether the soul exists or not.”

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:35.580
When you ask: “Do you have consciousness?” Answer is: “Yes, I have a intelligence.”

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:40.640
Though it is ‘unconscious’ for now, but there is consciousness.

00:07:40.680 --> 00:07:43.540
Sometimes some glimpses occur in the intelligence.

00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:52.380
And consciousness is a part of the Superconsciousness.
