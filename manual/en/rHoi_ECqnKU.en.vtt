00:00:01.567 --> 00:00:07.467
(♪♪♪)

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:13.667
Winsor &amp; Newton
Water Mixable Oil Colours

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:15.433
perform just like
conventional oil colours

00:00:15.433 --> 00:00:17.500
except you can use water
to clean them up.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.433
The reason you can do that is
because it's been

00:00:19.433 --> 00:00:21.533
chemically modified
to be able to accept the water

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:22.433
for cleanup.

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:23.967
It's still in these
tubes of paint,

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:26.000
just pigment and linseed oil,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.600
so you can still
go through all the techniques

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:28.467
that you normally would,

00:00:28.467 --> 00:00:29.500
but the great thing
about it is

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.267
if you have some sort of
sensitivity to solvents

00:00:31.267 --> 00:00:33.000
or you just want
the ease of cleanup,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.700
or like myself I go out

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.167
and paint in
landscape sometimes,

00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:37.967
I don't want to have to
take solvent with me.

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:40.100
This is a great way
to avoid that

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.367
and move forward
with your oil painting,

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:44.467
and they also dry
by oxidation

00:00:44.467 --> 00:00:46.167
just like
conventional oil colours.

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:48.600
That means that the paint
needs to come into contact

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.367
with air to lock into place
and form a stable paint film,

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:54.400
so you want to make sure
that you don't thin out

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.200
your paint with too much
water or too much thinner

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.167
because it's going to
separate the pigment there,

00:01:00.167 --> 00:01:01.267
too far apart,

00:01:01.267 --> 00:01:03.567
and it can lead to
cracking and instability,

00:01:03.567 --> 00:01:04.900
and in the same way
you don't want to add

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.300
too much oil to the mix either.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.700
Too much oil in your mediums
is going to cause the paint

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.000
to bind up in
what we call alligatoring.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.033
It's also not stable and it
doesn't look too good either,

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:14.467
so you want to
be careful with that.

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:15.867
now there's 11 mediums
in the range.

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:18.033
Two of them I have here though
are the more popular ones,

00:01:18.033 --> 00:01:20.133
Linseed Oil, and Stand Oil.

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.333
I'm going to use a little bit
of Stand Oil right now.

00:01:22.333 --> 00:01:24.533
Pour some of this
on the palette.

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.567
It's got a very
honey-like consistency.

00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:27.867
I like Stand Oil.

00:01:27.867 --> 00:01:30.733
It's a little bit more yellowing
than the Linseed Oil,

00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:34.100
both will provide a gloss,
both will improve flow.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.033
I'm going to take a little bit
of the Ultramarine here,

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:41.700
and you want to use only
as much oil as you need,

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.500
only as much medium as you
need to get the paint to flow.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.400
Again, you don't
want to use too much.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.300
And look at that,
it just gets it to flow,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.200
but it's got a nice
nice feel to it.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.733
The brush strokes
level nicely

00:01:53.733 --> 00:01:55.100
so if I want to
use it for glazing,

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:56.100
that's wonderful,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.767
and that's one of the things
that I always liked about it

00:01:57.767 --> 00:01:59.433
is it's got
a great feel to it,

00:01:59.433 --> 00:02:03.033
you really need to feel it
to see what's happening,

00:02:03.033 --> 00:02:06.400
and I'm going to take
water here of course,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.233
and clean that up.

00:02:09.233 --> 00:02:11.567
Wipe off my paintbrush,
just a little bit more,

00:02:11.567 --> 00:02:12.167
and I can do that,

00:02:12.167 --> 00:02:14.033
and I also have
thinner here too.

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:14.767
You might wonder

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:17.067
well, why would
I need an artistan thinner,

00:02:17.067 --> 00:02:19.167
a water mixable thinner
if Ive got water,

00:02:19.167 --> 00:02:20.633
it seems to not
make any sense,

00:02:20.633 --> 00:02:22.033
but there's
a good reason for that.

00:02:22.033 --> 00:02:24.967
Water evaporates more
quickly than the thinner does,

00:02:24.967 --> 00:02:27.433
so you'll have longer
open working time with that,

00:02:27.433 --> 00:02:28.733
and also what's
going to happen

00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:30.633
is when you introduce water

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:33.867
into the paint film,
light refracts off of water

00:02:33.867 --> 00:02:35.100
differently than
other surfaces,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.833
and what's going to happen,

00:02:35.833 --> 00:02:37.500
it's going to appear
a little bit lighter

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.100
than straight out of the tube
without water in that,

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.033
but that's okay.

00:02:41.033 --> 00:02:42.733
It's going to evaporate,

00:02:42.733 --> 00:02:44.000
the water's going to
evaporate from the paint film

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.533
in about a week or two
and it's going to return

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:47.633
back its normal colour
and it's normal sheen,

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:48.800
so you don't have to
worry about that,

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.333
but it's just something
to be aware of.

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:52.233
And we've also got
varnishes over here,

00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:53.967
so you can go through
the whole entire process

00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:55.667
of painting through varnishing

00:02:55.667 --> 00:02:57.800
with water cleanup

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.833
and we've got
a Matt, a Satin,

00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:00.867
and a Gloss finish
over there

00:03:00.867 --> 00:03:03.367
and you'll notice that the Matt
and the Satin

00:03:03.367 --> 00:03:04.333
look a little bit cloudy.

00:03:04.333 --> 00:03:05.767
That's 'cause they have
matting agents in them

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:07.833
to knock down the sheen,
knock down the gloss,

00:03:07.833 --> 00:03:10.133
so you want to stir them up
before you apply them

00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:11.667
to your paint film,

00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:13.200
and the reason you don't
want to shake them--

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:13.967
be careful of that--

00:03:13.967 --> 00:03:15.733
is because you can introduce
bubbles to the paint film,

00:03:15.733 --> 00:03:17.333
that's not good for
your varnish layer,

00:03:17.333 --> 00:03:19.433
and the really important
thing with varnishing,

00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:21.800
you still need to wait
6-12 months

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.267
to varnish the painting.

00:03:23.267 --> 00:03:26.033
Again, it's like
a conventional oil,

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:28.067
except you have the ability
to clean up with water,

00:03:28.067 --> 00:03:29.900
so again, it's a wonderful
thing to be able to do,

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.567
it's easy, works nicely,

00:03:31.567 --> 00:03:32.900
and you can avoid
the solvents

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.667
if that's something
that you want to do.

00:03:35.667 --> 00:03:37.333
And also, brushes.

00:03:37.333 --> 00:03:39.633
Keep in mind that if you're
going to use a brush with this,

00:03:39.633 --> 00:03:40.733
or when you use
a brush with this,

00:03:40.733 --> 00:03:42.067
you want to use
a synthetic brush.

00:03:42.067 --> 00:03:44.533
Hog hair or natural hair,

00:03:44.533 --> 00:03:46.700
when it comes into
contact with water,

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:47.933
it's sort of like
your own hair.

00:03:47.933 --> 00:03:49.933
Too much humidity
gives you a bad hair day,

00:03:49.933 --> 00:03:51.933
you can have a bad hair day
for your brush as well,

00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:54.333
so when you use a synthetic,
they're more apt to

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:57.633
handle water better
and not lose their shape.

00:03:57.633 --> 00:04:03.567
