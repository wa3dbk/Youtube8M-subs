00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:10.370
Have you ever wondered about the benefits
of the various vitamins out there? If so,

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:16.480
search no more, I'm here to help. I'm Isabelle
Simon, your personal and workplace wellness

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.809
consultant, and today we're going to learn
the benefits of Vitamin B. First of all, keep

00:00:22.809 --> 00:00:30.860
in mind that there is not just one type of
Vitamin B. There is actually, Vitamin B1,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:42.650
B2, B3, B5, B6, B12, B15 and B17. So, what
do all these do unto your body? They help

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:49.100
with your digestion. They help with the growth
of your cells. We have trillions of cells

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.100
in the body; brain cells, stomach cells, hair
cells, skin cells. You name it. So, it is

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.470
important for all those cells to grow properly
for your body to function properly. They also

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:07.670
help with your digestion, and they help with
sleep patterns as well, and they help build

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:15.590
muscles. Now, Vitamin B12, and you out there,
who are either vegans or vegetarians may be

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:23.979
deficient in this particular vitamin because
B12 is only found in animal protein, namely,

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:31.119
eggs, fish and meat. So, if you're out there,
vegan or vegetarian, you may want to supplement

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:38.430
for that particular one. But for all the other
vitamins, vitamin B's out there, it's very

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:46.770
simple; fruits and vegetable, all the color
of the palette you can think of, will contain

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.619
two or more of the Vitamin B's and that is
as simple as that. And as we say in French,

00:01:53.619 --> 00:02:00.369
bon appetite. I'm Isabelle Simon, your personal
and workplace wellness consultant. And remember,

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.950
good health begins with good nutrition.
