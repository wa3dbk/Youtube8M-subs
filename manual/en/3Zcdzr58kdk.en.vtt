Steve: Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.980
Today we’re going to show you how to change
the defrost timer on your refrigerator.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.170
It’s really easy job.

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:11.170
All we’re going to need is a quarter inch
nut driver and a flat blade screwdriver.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:12.339
Let me show you how we do it.

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:18.949
Now the first step in this repair should be
to disconnect the power, simply unplug the

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:20.600
cord from the receptacle.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:30.689
And we’ll up the fresh food door, and we
will remove the knob from the cold control,

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:41.920
then we’ll pull down on the light cover,
hinge it upwards and lift it out of the way.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.620
And I find this a little easier to remove
the light bulb as well, so simply unscrewed

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.210
light bulb and set that aside.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.870
Next we’re going to remove single quarter
inch hex head screw; it’s just about in

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:00.750
the center and it holds the air inlet assembly
on to the control housing.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:11.490
Remove that one screw, and we’ll rotate
the housing outward, use a little caution

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.780
on that, because it has a diaphone end piece
on it that we don’t want to damage, we’ll

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.770
set that aside.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.810
Next we’re going to remove one more quarter
inch hex head screw which is right at the

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.700
top that holds that controller housing in
place.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:40.160
Once you remove that screw, you can tilt it
forward and lift up on it, and there is a

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:44.240
metal tab that engages a slot in the back
panel.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.439
Once that’s disconnected, you can rotate
it forward and then disconnect the wire harness.

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:58.479
There is two locking tabs on the side, simple
depress those and unplug it.

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.939
Now we can set this on work surface and we
can replace the defrost timer.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.999
Now that we have the control housing out where
we can work on it, we’re next going to remove

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:18.250
the two quarter inch screws that hold the
timer to the housing and we’ll flip it over

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:24.790
and then we can pull the timer out of the
housing.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:31.560
And there is a four pin connecter that attaches
to the defrost timer, you may find those a

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:38.120
little tight, so just take a flat blade screw
driver and insert it between the connector

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:41.690
and the timer and just pry it off.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:50.281
Discard the old timer and take the new one,
plug the harness into it, make sure it’s

00:02:50.281 --> 00:03:06.300
seated firmly, and locate that timer in proper
position in the housing, and we’ll start

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:24.240
one of the screws, and 
locate the opening for the other screw, align

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:37.110
that up, now the defrost timer has a little
dial on it there that will only turn in a

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.580
clockwise direction with a flat blade screwdriver,
if you turn it carefully rotate it so far

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.970
and then you will hear a live click that’s
the beginning of the defrost cycle, rotate

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.590
it a little bit further past that another
notch and it’s back out of the defrost cycle.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.520
So when we put this in the refrigerator it
will have just pass the defrost cycle and

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:59.540
the refrigerator will cool.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.150
Now we ready to reinstall the housing.

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:08.210
How to reinstall the housing, we want to locate
that tab and slot portion up on the right

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:14.930
hand side here, and then screw it through
the top flange in to the back panel.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:26.039
First thing is we’ll connect the wire harness,
make sure that locked into place, put the

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:50.180
tab into the back cabinet, then reinstall
the screw.

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:54.939
Next we’ll carefully reinstall the air diffuser,
making sure we don’t damage that [indiscernible]

00:04:54.939 --> 00:05:02.449
[00:04:54] position it into the opening end
of the freezer first, and this V portion will

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:07.570
board around the narrowed end of the control
housing, so we have to carefully fit that

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:11.689
on there as well.

00:05:11.689 --> 00:05:25.759
And reinstall the screw that holds those two
pieces together, reinstall the light bulb,

00:05:25.759 --> 00:05:37.669
and the cover, and hook the top on first,
let it hang and we’ll just pull down slightly

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:51.090
on the horizontal portion at the bottom and
let it hook in and then reinstall the knob.

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.669
Now we’re ready to reconnect the power and
our repair is complete.

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:57.840
We told you it was an easy job.

00:05:57.840 --> 00:05:59.979
Thanks for watching, and good luck with your
repair.
