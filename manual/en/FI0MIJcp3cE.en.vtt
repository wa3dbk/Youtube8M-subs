00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:01.800
- Hey guys!

00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.420
Happy April Fools day!

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.320
Guess what? Today I'm gonna fool some people with a little trick.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.000
A little prank that I put together.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:12.460
And I hope that you guys will like it.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.720
Hopefully we can capture some really funny reactions to this.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.120
So over here I have John, our toilet

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.680
And underneath it, look can you see anything?

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.560
Can you tell?

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.580
Does it look like anything's been done to that toilet?

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:26.780
Perfectly good toilet.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.860
Watch this.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.400
Look at that scary spider.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.900
I just rigged up this little thing right here.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.960
Some cardboard, duct tape and dental floss to go underneath that.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.340
Its raised a little bit but you can barely tell .

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.660
And anyways I've got my spider.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.560
So when somebody comes in to go potty, they're gonna lift this up.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.840
-AHHHHHHHHHHHH!

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.200
Then I'm gonna try and capture their reaction when the kids get home from school and maybe Christina will even fall for it.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.460
We'll just have to see. Stay tuned.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.280
Best Toilet Prank! ( Kid Friendly Prank )

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.360
- [ Josh ] Why don't you go in and go potty before you go get brother and sister?

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.500
- [ Christina ] Oh!

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.380
- [ Christina ] Oh!

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.540
( Laughing )

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.040
- I need help.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:34.860
- [ Josh ] What's that?

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:36.300
- Mom!

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.020
- [ Josh ] You're okay!

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.520
William.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.800
William.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:47.640
Willliam.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:49.500
- Look its a spider.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.720
- [ Josh ] Bubba, its a fake spider.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.120
It's a fake spider. Were you scared?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.880
He's backed up into the corner. ( laughing )

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:13.500
- He is two years old I think that was a little scary for a two year old, Josh.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.180
- He's not gonna want to go to the bathroom ever again!

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.040
- [ Christina ] Just as we got him potty trained!

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.380
- [ Josh ] William, April Fools Day! Its a joke.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.240
Look I know its a fake, its a toy spider.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:27.360
( Laughing )

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.160
Was that a funny joke?

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.860
- Em hmm.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.780
- Give me knuckles, buddy.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.640
He still doesn't know what to think about it.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.340
I love you.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.840

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.860
- Bye.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:54.380
It's go time.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.760
- [ Josh ] Can you go in and go potty first?

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:02.500
Did you have a good day at school?

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.520

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.040
- Oh yeah we were doing something earlier with it.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.940

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:00.400
Like I was about to go to the bathroom but then I opened the lid.

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:01.760
I was like oh my gosh!

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.900

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.340

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.080
I took the spider out.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:09.900
K mom.

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.840
- Hey.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.140
You're so mean to children.

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.080
This is gonna be child punishment.

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.120
- You know what? They both saw the camera.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.520
I'm like just go to the bathroom, just go to the bathroom!

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:20.440
- I told you!

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.200
- I'm going to go and get my neighbor friends.

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:27.820
And then I'm going to say, hey the leprechaun peed in our toilet.

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:32.440
And then they're gonna come over and we're gonna stand outside the door.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.460
And then when they open it, we're gonna scream April Fools Day!

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:44.080
- Come on!

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.880
Go and open the that.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:47.420
- [ Christina ] Tayden don't stand in the doorway please.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:49.200
- [ Tayden ] No just the little one. Just the front one..

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.140

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.520
- [ Christina ] Hey Macy go home and tell your mom to come look.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.600
Don't tell her what it is.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.680

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.200
