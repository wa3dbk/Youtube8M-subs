00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.200
OK.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.131
Got a microwave door here that's hard to latch.

00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:17.131
Wanted to show you how to get this going.

00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:18.131
It's hard to open.

00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:22.070
So if I pull on it I can open it.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:33.839
But on this side here is the mechanism and
pushing the door here causes it to push up

00:00:33.839 --> 00:00:34.839
inside here.

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:39.100
As you can see it pushes up the bottom one.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.149
So basically all I am going to do is spray
a little food grade silicone spray right inside

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.980
that first deal where the lever is.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:01:04.649
And this will dry and I will clean off both
of the peg posts right here and that should

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:12.880
restore our microwave to open nice and easy
with one push.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.960
The silicone is one hundred percent silicone
so it will dry and maintain it's lube, be

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:18.960
safe for use.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.439
But you want to let it dry completely before
using the microwave again.

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:30.210
Anyway that's how you fix a sticking door.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.750
It only takes a little bit to get it going.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.780
We're all fixed here so wait twenty four hours
before using it.

00:01:37.780 --> 00:02:08.359
Good to go.
