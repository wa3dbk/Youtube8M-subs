00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.129
 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.180
 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.360
I decided and to come to IUP

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.420
because I did an open house here and

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:13.889
everybody is just so nice and they

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.570
basically welcomed me as if I was already a student

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.500
and I just love that.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.600
I chose IUP after
doing research into a couple different

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.910
culinary schools

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.210
and the hands-on approach taken here at
the school

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.519
as well as the great externship offers

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:31.900
really made me decide on coming here. 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.900
our mission here at IUP Academy of Culinary Arts 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.050
is to train

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.530
culinarians with the skill and the
knowledge to become

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:44.670
chefs, pastry chefs, and managers in food and beverage directors

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.449
The faculty is awesome. I have gotten to
know each one of them very well

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:52.600
and I consider each one of them my friend.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.600
I think the faculty

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.559
provides excellent instruction. Everything is
very thorough, very in-depth.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:00:58.989
 The faculty here at IUP

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.430
are really, really strong. They're outstanding chefs

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.810
and outstanding instructors
and faculty.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.740
They come here and they don't leave here usually unless they're going to retire

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.210
The strengths of our faculty have that
industry experience

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.729
combined with their delivery of
education.

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:19.780
They truly do care like how far you go

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.409
and they want everyone of us to
succeed

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:26.520
The small class sizes benefit

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.310
I believe benefits students because
we're actually doing all the work.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.270
We're watching the chefs do it, we're
learning how to do it, and then we're

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:34.500
actually making everything.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:38.070
The program is preparing me each day

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.000
for what I should expect in the industry.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Our externship is at the end of our

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.810
programs and the reason for that is this:
so that the employers

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.700
and this student can make a decision to
stay on for permanent employment.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.380
The students have to research where they
want to go. It's not just, you know, and they

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.189
find the placement. We're not just putting
them out there.

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:04.659
The chefs and the human resource people that come here to IUP to hire and interview

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:05.599
our students

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:09.099
are coming from some of the best
resorts and properties

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.000
in the world, not just in the nation.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.610
 I did my externship at Vanilla Pastry Studio in the region square of Pittsburgh.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.959
After I had completed my externship,
I was offered a full-time position

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.000
and I am still currently working there.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Coming here to IUP made me

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.560
look at food differently. It made me
appreciate food

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.060
a lot more.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.500
Our students are focused. They're

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:34.400
motivated. They're self-disciplined. They're

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:37.420
passionate about what they're doing. We want our
students to

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.609
eat, sleep, drink food 24 hours a day while they're here.

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:46.680
It definitely surpassed my expectation and I'm
really glad I came

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.230
and I can honestly say that I
love

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:51.460
this industry

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.510
and that IUP prepared me for it.
