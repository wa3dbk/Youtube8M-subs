00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:24.590
atherosclerosis is a life-threatening
disease

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:28.200
that may have begun to develop during
childhood

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.730
this condition is a process in which deposits of fatty material,

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.330
call plaque, build up inside the walls
of arteries

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.690
reducing, or completely blocking, blood flow.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.420
although the exact causes of atherosclerosis are not clear

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.980
many scientists think it begins with
damage to the inner wall of an artery,

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.989
called the endothelium. Substances
traveling in the blood,

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.280
such as cholesterol, fats, and cellular
waste products,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.940
keenly inside the damaged area and the
arterial wall when chemical reactions

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.100
occurring within the build-up of
material

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:09.660
cause cholesterol molecules oxidized
this initiates an inflammatory response

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.130
in which the ended delial cells at the
damage side

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.140
release chemicals that signal call for
help

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.670
on in response monocytes bloodstream

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.800
travel to the damage site ruled
stimulation from

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.009
oxidized cholesterol converge the
monocytes

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.860
into macrophages who the macrophages

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.550
eat and digest the cholesterol molecules
all

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.500
as a result of this process the
macrophages change into bone cells

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.580
which accumulate to form plaque for

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.020
as the black increases in size the
arterial wall

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.170
thickens and hardens on

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.600
on and

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.869
at the same time smooth muscle cells
within the arterial wall

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.869
begin to multiply the

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.090
and

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.700
most the smooth muscle cells moved to
the service at the plaque

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.370
the cells contribute to the formation

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.500
affirmed by Bruce Campbell covering the
plaque

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.900
then surely the passageway through the
artery near

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:38.730
this enough to reduce blood flow and the
amount of oxygen received other organs

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:39.670
it supplies

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:42.950
on overtime the cat may erode

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.569
and break open releasing plaque into the
bloodstream

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.790
the plaque can flow downstream

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.000
and contribute to the whole nation to
like which can stop like

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.400
as a result limited blood supplies
available to the area surrounding the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.890
partially blocked artery

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.349
degrading and potentially killing the
neighboring tissue
