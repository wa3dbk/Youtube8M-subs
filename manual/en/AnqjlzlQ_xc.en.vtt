00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:12.309
 

00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:15.290
"Hi, my name is Julie Bonn. I'm 24 years old, and"

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.970
"I had a liver transplant when I was 12
years old."

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.820
"I just started to become sick- flu-like
symptoms. I was throwing up and"

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.349
not feeling well, really tired. I was
perfectly healthy before that, so"

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.550
"we didn't have any suspicion that
anything big was going on."

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.140
"After about two weeks I started to
become jaundice, or yellow in my skin and"

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.860
"eyes."

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.769
"And so my primary care doctor was doing all sorts of tests, blood draws, and"

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.770
"testing everything you can think of. Everything came back negative so"

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.750
"couple weeks later he sent me down to
Cincinnati Children's to see the"

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.180
"gastroenterologist. They did a regular
physical and"

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.940
"checked things out. They were concerned but didn't really say too much at the time and"

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.969
"said, you know, if this, this, or this
happens, then call us. And"

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:06.390
"the next day my hands and feet were
starting to retain water,"

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.460
"so they said come to the hospital right
away. We're gonna admit you."

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.259
"And then the next day I had a surgical
biopsy because my liver"

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:17.299
"wasn't making clotting factors to clot my blood. I"

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.070
"had the surgical biopsy and they diagnosed me with seven days to live."

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.780
"So right after that I was listed on
the"

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:29.850
"national waiting list as status 1A,
which is the highest you can get,"

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:34.040
"and were waiting for a liver. Luckily I
only had to wait"

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.060
"about a day, and the very next day they
found me a liver that matched my blood"

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.560
"type,"

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.159
"and that evening I had my transplant."

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.560
"One thing I learned is to always be nice
to everyone."

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.549
"I really follow the golden rule of treat
others how you want to be treated,"

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.659
"partly because I could have lost my life"

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.320
"within a matter of a month. And I didn't want to leave this world"

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.159
"being known as not a nice person. So that's something I learned in 8th grade."

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.259
"I always wanted to be a doctor since I
was"

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.259
"probably eight or nine years old, wanted
to be a brain hurts surgeon."

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.290
"Then, after this all happened,"

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.360
"it could have been a horrible experience, you know, the whole""

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.370
"tremendous liver transplant journey is
not a very positive one usually."

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:26.440
"But for me, overall, it was a very
positive experience and I think it was"

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.030
"all because the doctors and nurses and"

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.090
"fellows here. And because in them, that
definitely inspired me to go into"

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:37.480
"Pediatric Gastroenterology and worked
with"

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.440
"future children that will need liver
transplants. I look at it from a"

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.510
"patient's side"

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.730
"of how would they feel going through
this? And what's most important to the"

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.060
"patient? And just"

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:52.680
"more the non-medical aspects of medicine."

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.290
"And that's- a lot of doctors, I think,
forget that."
