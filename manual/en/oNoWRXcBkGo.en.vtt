I really want to get into motorcycling; I absolutely love the idea of it.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:18.088
I am here because I am going to college next year and I 
 need a more convenient, cheaper way of getting to and from really.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.360
I found about this experience by doing a web 
 search and came across the Get On website.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.520
So I booked a free ride online, really easy 
 to do, so yeah, I am here.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.720
The most important bit of kit when you are riding is your cycling helmet.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.520
You just have to put that on, and then again, your 
 helmet and gloves are on the rack behind you. Fantastic.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:43.360
So over here, on the right hand bar you have this lever, which is your 
 front break, and just behind that we find the throttle or the accelerator.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.360
This lever over here, on the left hand bar, that is your clutch lever.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:56.720
Ok then Kevin, so automatic bike, nice and simple, only three controls to concern you 
 today.  We have the throttle, the front break and the back break, ok?

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:03.240
Just bring it forwards to my hand when you are ready, keep 
 your head up, looking ahead, looking ahead, there we go.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.800
That’s it, and as you come back to me, it’s throttle off, bit 
 of front break, bit of rear break, clutch in, yeah? Yeah! Excellent!

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.400
Let your foot come up naturally good, and throttle off, little bit of 
 front, little bit of back, let foot down, excellent! Fantastic! Thank you!

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:24.600
That is good, and turning your head to look around the 
 bend. I can see that smile underneath your helmet there!

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.720
I can still see that smile

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.240
That was brilliant, I really want to do that again!

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.360
How good was that, all right? That was wicked! Yeah?

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.080
That was brilliant, I hope you have enjoyed it and we 
 hope to see you again for bit of further training.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.120
It was absolutely brilliant, loved it to bits.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.740
I can definitely see myself getting a bike, passing my test.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.500
I can just see myself cruising around London.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.760
I have got more freedom, more freedom to do what I want, when I 
 want to do it, I am not tied down to public transport.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.640
I absolutely loved it, great experience, recommend it definitely.
