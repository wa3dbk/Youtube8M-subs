Hi, I'm Michelle Renee from the Michelle Renee
Makeup Artist Group here in Tampa, Florida.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:14.559
On behalf of Expert Village, I'm here to show
you how to apply makeup for men. We've gone

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:19.780
through our day time look. I'm just gonna
show you a quick few easy steps to make it

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:26.060
looks cool like a rock star. Now we can keep
what ever makeup we've had on throughout the

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:36.449
day. You could go in and add a little bit
more bronzer. I'm gonna use a bronzer with

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:44.179
a tab bit of shimmer. Normally you would not
want to use shimmer in the day but at night

00:00:44.179 --> 00:00:52.739
for fun I think it's good. So we added a little
bit of shimmer. This just enhances Logan's

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:09.420
brow bone. Then with a simple pencil I'm gonna
wine the inner rim of Logan's eyes. I'm not

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.530
gonna do the top, I'm just gonna do the inner
rim. Throughout the day when you're dancing

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:22.190
the rim will seek down and it'll look like
a nice faded out emphasized eye. How you do

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:27.860
this? Make sure, I like to make sure that
the point is not sharp, it's a little bit

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:36.970
rounded. I'm gonna slightly pull down the
eye, I'm gonna start from the corner and just

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:48.670
work my way towards the inside of the eye.
Gives him a little bit more emphasize on the

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:58.461
eye. Makes him look like a rock star. If you'd
like you can go in and at the corner use a

00:01:58.461 --> 00:02:07.979
little bit on the outside.
And that's just pamping up for going out.
