00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.500
Ionic Bond.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.300
Sodium Chloride.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.500
Ionic bond is the transfer of electrons from a metallic atom to a non-metallic atom.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.700
Let me take Sodium Chloride as an example.

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.000
Sodium.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:22.000
Atomic number of Sodium is 11 and its electronic configuration is 2,8,1.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.000
Sodium has an extra electron in its outer shell.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.900
Chlorine.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:57.500
Atomic number of Chlorine is 17 and its electronic configuration is 2,8,7.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Chlorine has 7 electrons in its outermost shell.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:26.000
Chlorine needs 1 electron to complete its outermost shell.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:49.300
When sodium reacts with chlorine, sodium donates electron to chlorine.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.100
Sodium becomes a positively charged ion.

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.500
Chlorine accepts an electron from sodium.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.400
Chlorine becomes a negatively charged ion.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:32.500
Oppositely charged sodium and chloride ions are held by a strong electrostatic force of attraction known as Ionic Bond.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.500
Sodium Chloride.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000
The End.
