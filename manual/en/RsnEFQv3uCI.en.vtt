00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:09.870
This is a video for the origami crane.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.710
The first step for the traditional origami
crane is a diagonal fold.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.300
We're
going to start with the color-side up, and

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.090
then go ahead and fold the
bottom corner up to the top corner.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:24.620
Make sure that it's nice and lined up
so it's very precise.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.631
We're not trying to go super-fast, just trying
to get

00:00:27.631 --> 00:00:30.640
it exactly on that spot.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:35.930
Then slide your finger down, out to the corner,
and then out to the other corner.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:39.370
Open it back up, and then we're going to
do the other diagonal fold.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.800
Again, take the bottom and bring it up.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.000
Everything nice and lined up, just like that.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Open it back up.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.160
You should
have a nice '+' with your creases.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.360
Flip the paper over, and now we're going to
do two book folds.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.280
We're going
to take the bottom edge and bring it up to

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.440
the top edge.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.480
Make sure it's not
askew or off to the side, at all, try and

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.790
get it nice and even across the
top.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.210
Once you do, crease down, just like that.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:20.100
Then open it up and do the
other book fold as well, just like that.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.789
Once you have that last one, go ahead and
leave that crease down, and pick

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:23.869
up the model a little bit.

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.659
What we're going to do is if you pinch right
here and right here, near the top of the corners,

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.799
what we're going to do is
we're going to rotate the model up, just like

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:35.799
this.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:37.700
You see how we're
getting all 4 corners of the paper are going

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.380
to come up and touch each
other, right at the top.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.439
Then you see how we've got these extra flaps,
we

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.389
can squash those flaps down.

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:47.979
This doesn't use any new creases.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.189
We haven't
made anything new.

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.979
This is just using all of the folds that we
already have

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:58.329
to create what's called a square base or a
preliminary base.

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.939
The important
thing about the orientation of the base is

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:04.390
to make sure that these flaps
that we have open here, they have to be towards

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.390
you.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.340
Get them, and make
sure that they're not up at the top, but that

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.429
those extra flaps are pointed
towards you.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.620
Not off to the side, but right down at you.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.540
Next, we're going to do two kite folds.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:21.770
We're going to take these 2 bottom
edges that lead down to the open flap, and

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.740
we're going to fold them into
the middle of the paper, just right on that

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:28.860
middle line, right all the way
down.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.700
We'll do it on the left-hand side and also
on the right-hand side,

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.360
just like that.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:41.720
Then once we've done both of those, go ahead
and fold down

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.860
this top triangle, right here.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.810
It's going to go all the way across this
line.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.080
That's the crease line that we're going to
use.

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.950
We fold that triangle
down, just like that.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.830
Next, flip the whole thing over with this.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.400
Make sure that this triangle
flap is on the bottom, underneath.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.880
We're going to do those 2 kite folds;
we're going to do those again on this side,

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:11.400
just like that.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.040
Once you've
done those 2 kite folds, go ahead and open

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:17.680
those back up.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.620
Those are what we
call preliminary folds.

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.620
We're going to use those creases to use another
fold later.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.230
What's going to happen is we're going to take
one flap of paper, just one.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:32.790
There's a couple of different spots there,
but just open up one flap of

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:33.790
paper.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:36.960
What we want to do is we want to flatten it
out and pick it up as

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:38.670
high as we can.

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.010
When we pick it up pretty high, what's going
to happen is

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.960
these 2 outside flaps are going to want to
work their way into the center.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.240
We've already made that kite fold.

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:53.290
When we folded this over, we already
created that fold right in there.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.260
Go ahead and let the paper do that.

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.260
We're
going to pick the paper up all the way up

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.260
to the top and pull in these 2
edges.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:10.290
This is called a petal fold, just like this.

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:16.100
You see how that
flattens out nicely.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:22.069
Next, flip the paper over, and we do the same
thing here.

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:25.250
Open up that
triangle, open up these 2 flaps, fold this

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.400
guy back down.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:30.600
We're going to
pick up this panel right here and do another

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.600
petal fold.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.600
Pick it all the
way up to the top.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:40.940
It should match the one behind it, just like
that.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:42.690
This
is called the crane base.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:44.900
Once we have the crane base, make sure that
you have these 2 slits right

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.780
here at the bottom; these are going to be
our tail and our head.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.410
What we're
going to do is we're going to do 2 kite folds.

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:53.710
We're going to thin this
again.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.860
Go ahead and take these 2 edges and bring
those into the middle.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.600
Make sure that the edges are pointing down,
towards here.

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.930
Don't fold them
where the go up like that.

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:11.430
They're down towards the openings on the left
side and the right side.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.730
Flip it over, and do it one more time.

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:18.020
We've got these 2 flaps.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.190
What we're going to do is we're going to fold
them

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:27.300
both up as far as they'll go and out to the
side at whatever angle you

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.300
want.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:30.810
If you want the head to be a little bit closer,
reaching a little bit

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.080
forward or you want the tail to be a little
farther back.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.850
Whatever angle
you want, go ahead and fold them up and fold

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:36.850
them back down.

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:38.790
We're going to
use that crease that we made to do what's

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:40.320
called an inside reverse fold.

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.390
An
inside reverse fold is instead of taking this

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.720
flap in front, or even if we
were to fold it behind, we're going to open

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.370
this panel up right here.

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.040
There's 2 panels right there, open them up,
and we're going to fold this in

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:53.040
the middle of them.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.540
We're going to bring it up inside the middle.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:59.470
What
happens is this back spine of the paper right

00:05:59.470 --> 00:06:03.100
here is going to reverse its
crease.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:09.139
It's switched around, and you see how it's
gone in the middle of

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:10.530
the paper.

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:11.530
It's an inside reverse fold.

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:13.840
We're going to do that on both
sides.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.520
Try to do it on the creases we just made.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:19.490
When we folded this up,
try to use those creases.

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:25.480
Once we do that, you can figure out which
side you want to be the head and

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.480
which side you want to be the tail.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.860
I'm going to use this guy for the head.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:31.190
What's going to happen is I'm going to make
another inside reverse fold.

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:37.630
Just open it up and fold the beak down, like
that.

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:43.630
Again, that's been
folded on the inside of the paper, like that.

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:48.490
Fold down each of the wings.

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:50.810
That is the origami crane.
