00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hello everyone

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.000
I bought a pressure cooker the other day

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.000
However, there was no opportunity to use. 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.100
I went to the supermarket today

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.000
I found a pork with cartilage that
 be rare sold in this region

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:24.500
I thought I'd try to make "Nankotsu Soki"
 of Okinawan cuisine

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:26.000
By the pressure cooker

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:34.000
First of all, a pork with cartilage is boiled
 using full hot water in an ordinary pan

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.000
Now, water was boiled

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.000
I will boil pork with cartilage

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.500
About 5 minutes

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
To skim the scum

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.500
5 minutes passed
Is complete

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.000
It is once washed with water

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Now I put in a pressure cooker to clean material

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.200
In the pot has a bonito broth

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Put the material from and close the lid 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.500
Cook for about 20 minutes

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.300
It will lower the heat, if it becomes high-pressure

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Since it pressurized for 20 minutes, put out the fire 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.000
It cools until pressure falls 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.600
Since it got cool and pressure fell, i will it opens

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.700
Did it become soft?

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.150
I will remove the fat on the surface

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:21.000
I will seasoned because fat was removed

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Soy sauce

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.000
Awamori

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.800
So Okinawan cuisine,use the Awamori 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.000
Sugar at the end

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.000
Heated

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:45.800
No need pressure

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.800
put out the fire

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.500
Looks yummy

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
It is now complete

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.000
Then I wait to cool slowly

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Nankotsu Soki has been completed

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.000
Eat

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.800
Springy

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.000
Yummy!

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.500
Yummy! This is

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.000
Part of the cartilage

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:24.600
Soft

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.500
I want to put this in Okinawa Soba

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
This is nice

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.000
I was able to make very delicious.
