00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.760
One of our favorite desserts is our Praline Pumpkin Cheesecake.

00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:11.320
It's a perfect dessert for any holiday and it is very easy to make.

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:35.020
We're going to begin by crushing our ginger snaps.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.200
The ginger snaps that I'm using are actually a recipe that you can find on our website.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.340
They are absolutely delicious! So you  are just going to mix the crushed ginger snaps with the butter

00:00:47.340 --> 00:01:00.560
and then press it into your springform. Just like this.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:08.380
And we're going to place this in the oven for about 9 minutes at 325 degrees.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.240
For the cheesecake batter itself, we are going to start off with room temperature cream cheese.

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.140
This will allow us to mix the batter minimally.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:25.780
Minimally mixing the cheesecake batter results in a smooth and creamy textured cheesecake. Vey important.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:34.600
I scraped the bowl, the cream cheese is smooth and I'm going to add both sugars.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:48.220
Mix it back on slow. I scraped the bowl once again. It's time to add to the add the eggs, one at a time.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.320
Once the first egg is incorporated, add the next and continue the same way.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:07.320
Now that everything is combined, we are adding the spices, the vanilla, then add the pumpkin.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.560
And then mix it on low speed.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:31.860
To obtain a smooth and creamy textured cheesecake, it is very important to bake it correctly and what I like to do is bake the cheesecake in a water bath.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.440
I simply take either a roasting pan or a deep jelly roll pan, take about 3-4 sheets of aluminum foil, all laid on top of another

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:50.060
and then place your spring form pan right into this. Surround it with aluminum foil

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.660
and then right at the oven we are going to pour water into this.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.740
This will create a water bath. Very easy to do. Always gives you great results.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:14.820
This cheesecake will take approximately 2 hours to bake, and when the center no longer trembles like this one, it is a sign of doneness.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.820
We are ready to take it out of the oven.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.360
Now that the cheesecake has been in the refrigerator for 4 hours or better yet you can leave it in overnight,

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:27.920
we're going to make the praline topping. Very easy to do.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:38.080
Simply melt butter, heavy cream, salt and sugar.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.240
We're going to stir this to a boil.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:56.947
And now that this has cooked for 3 minutes, we are going to add vanilla

00:03:56.947 --> 00:03:59.674
and the pecans.

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:15.196
And now that the pecans have cooled for about 2 minutes, we're going to drop them directly onto our cheesecake.

00:04:18.453 --> 00:04:20.453
Isn't this decadent?

00:04:23.376 --> 00:04:31.109
The homemade gingersnap crust, the creamy pumpkin cheesecake, and the slightly salty pecans make a delicious dessert.

00:04:31.109 --> 00:04:33.109
Perfect for any holiday!
