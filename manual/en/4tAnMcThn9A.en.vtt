00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.450
 Congratulations for all of you who finished High school (Tawjihi) 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.750
what ever grades you got , believe me this is 
 one of the best moments in your life

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.450
Seriously ... take it from me :D  

00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:16.805
But ... this doesn't mean that the past 12 years are worthwhile 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.850
you better grab them and phewwwww out of the window 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.000
well ... !! general knowledge you may keep

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:25.230
1× 10 = a Fight  , Eiffel tower in France 
 .
(Ps: × in Arabic has the same meaning as HIT)

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.000
these things are good to have 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.600
for chit chat ,  you'll have a few things 
 to talk about when ever you're with people.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.400
but now you have to prepare your self for 
 a new period filled with  

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.850
Mines 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.470
Booby traps 

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.000
Meteor showers from all around 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.150
Simply because now you are (Smurfs)
(Ps: read description below 
 , smurfs are fresh Uni students )

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.720
so because you are Smurfs this year , it 
 would be nice to get some  

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.350
tips and advice from some one who have 
 been there and done that  

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.900
and i will give you 10 tips ... not one , 10  :p

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.500
Tip # 1 : Anxiety

00:00:49.017 --> 00:00:51.037
Don't think others will know that's you're new this year 

00:00:51.075 --> 00:00:53.475
from what you're wearing or how you look ! 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.000
Appearance might give you away 

00:00:55.025 --> 00:00:57.075
 but the anxiety you have all over you faces is the main reason

00:00:57.092 --> 00:00:59.092
Having you eyes wandering everywhere , looking worried 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.470
Where to go ? what to do ? where 
 am i ? what have i done !

00:01:01.525 --> 00:01:03.525
Yes ! this is how other students will know that

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.850
 you're a first year student in university. Sanafer ( Smurfs)

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.550
So stop worrying too much . 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.950
Tip #2 : Directions 

00:01:08.992 --> 00:01:11.992
Do not ever ask for directions , where can i 
 find this lecture ?! where is this building ?!

00:01:12.058 --> 00:01:13.258
 Simply because they will send you to 

00:01:13.317 --> 00:01:14.317
Mars !   to Honolulu !

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.400
Madagascar !

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.950
and definitely you won't get to the building or your lecture in time 

00:01:18.008 --> 00:01:20.608
the solution is , after you register and get your schedule 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.950
with all the lectures , Faculties, Class numbers , right ?! 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.550
take your schedule and go for a tour 
 , consider it a touristic one :P

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.600
Now if you Already know some one in the same university ! 

00:01:28.642 --> 00:01:29.692
Then you're lucky 

00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:31.733
but if you don't know any body who goes there 

00:01:31.792 --> 00:01:33.942
fake being on the phone and go around the campus 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.020
and look for all your classes , this one's 
 here , the other one is there 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.050
and you'll be good to go when you classes actually start :D

00:01:39.017 --> 00:01:40.520
Tip # 3 : Cocaine 

00:01:40.991 --> 00:01:42.990
 ,,,ohhh , Caffeine  

00:01:43.283 --> 00:01:44.880
i meant Coffeeeeeeee .... 

00:01:44.967 --> 00:01:46.820
Now you'll tell me you're still used to school

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.400
Waking up early , Good energy 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.450
and you want have problems , and won't be that tired !!

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:51.770
That's total rubbish 

00:01:51.783 --> 00:01:53.430
cause you'll need time to get to you Uni , and get back 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.940
and run to class when you're late 

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:57.510
and you be like ( Damn , it's already 8:00 
 , the professor won't let me in )

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.050
and the professor is boring and you'll be falling a sleep .

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:01.330
you'll reach to a point where you have Zero energy 

00:02:01.983 --> 00:02:02.980
So...  

00:02:03.013 --> 00:02:04.710
Get Some Coffee  :D

00:02:04.783 --> 00:02:06.780
Tip # 4 : Titles 

00:02:06.825 --> 00:02:09.720
The person giving the lecture is called Professor not teacher.

00:02:09.857 --> 00:02:11.960
and you're going to a lecture not a (hesa = school class).

00:02:12.108 --> 00:02:14.910
so practice saying the new vocabulary to avoid embarrassment :P 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.700
and the most important thing is that the University 
 professor is not like the school teacher 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.200
because the teacher would have givin you 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.650
 10 out of 10 , or a 20 out 
 of 20 in school if you earned it 

00:02:23.281 --> 00:02:25.280
But ... your new professor on the other hand 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.350
 might simply FAIL you if he didn't like your face

00:02:29.008 --> 00:02:31.010
Tip # 5 : Shoes 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.100
Well ... forget about the heals 

00:02:33.175 --> 00:02:35.580
Let's be honest , and drop wearing heals to university 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.750
This high and running all around campus ?!! 

00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:40.230
specially the first semester or even the first year 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.450
it's impossible to have all your lectures in the same building or faculty 

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.700
you'll be running every where just to make it in time 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.750
and you won't make it in High heals Girls 

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:47.800
As for you guys

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.470
 well

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.900
 Pointy Cockroach Killing shoes 

00:02:49.912 --> 00:02:50.910
won't do you well either  :P

00:02:50.958 --> 00:02:52.960
So .. what's wrong with sneakers  ?!!

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
They are one the most important inventions of human kind. 

00:02:55.012 --> 00:02:55.810
seriously !  

00:02:56.017 --> 00:02:58.020
Tip # 6 : Socializing 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.600
and i don't mean the course .
(Ps: Ejtema3eiat 
 , means Social studies too ) 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.350
Communicate 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:02.180
 Interact 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.250
There's real human beings around you by the way 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.270
you get to a lecture with students , males 
 and females , there's the professor too 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and one more thing !! ....

00:03:10.041 --> 00:03:12.040
please don't update your Facebook statues at the door of each lecture !!

00:03:12.217 --> 00:03:15.220
(Going to Faculty of Economics for my accounting lecture ) !!!

00:03:17.958 --> 00:03:19.960
Tip #7 :

00:03:20.458 --> 00:03:21.460
:P

00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:23.470
Tip #7 : Economy 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.500
It's really important to economize a bit because 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.050
University is expensive , life is expensive 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:28.200
Your Transportation expenses  

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.350
your pocket money , University's payments

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.400
and your parents (or you) paying for all of this 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:34.300
So it' would be nice to get introduced 
 to the Cafeteria in your university 

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.400
No need to eat you lunch from McDonald's ever break you get !

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:39.900
Or you can do as i did while studying 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
our friend was the man Standing next to my faculty with his cart 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.500
he'd make you the best meal ever .

00:03:44.592 --> 00:03:45.590
Huge piece of bread ( Kaek )

00:03:45.833 --> 00:03:46.830
With Sesame :D

00:03:47.075 --> 00:03:48.080
Cheese 

00:03:48.133 --> 00:03:49.130
Thyme and Tomato's 

00:03:49.233 --> 00:03:51.730
it cost us 15 piasters , but we ate our full :D 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.350
We used to call it (Galoota ) 
(Ps: 
 it some how means Yukky lol )

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.950
It was a Galoota but it was really gooooooooood 

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.350
Tip # 8 : Friends 

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:00.800
It is not a must to keep the person who 
 sat next to you in the first lecture 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.000
as friend for the rest of your years in College 

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:04.450
You will change

00:04:04.533 --> 00:04:05.930
your personality will develop

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.500
the way you think will also change 

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.350
so it's not a bad thing to change friends too 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.400
evolve your self's a long with the people you know 

00:04:12.075 --> 00:04:14.580
Tip # 9 : the Note Book

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.900
It's one of the basic methods in hooking up someone 

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.900
Used by both Males &amp;amp; Females 

00:04:20.066 --> 00:04:23.070
Simply you might get your note book back the next day 

00:04:23.133 --> 00:04:25.130
with a love letter in the back :P

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:27.750
 Girls !! there's no need for all the contacts

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.900
mobile number , Email, Facebook account .  .. etc 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.100
to be written in the back of your note book 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.300
If you want to give it to someone , do it you self

00:04:35.467 --> 00:04:37.470
but don't make it available for everyone to see.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.350
Guys too , though you might not have as much problem 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:40.950
with that as girls do.

00:04:41.075 --> 00:04:42.280
But on the other Hand 

00:04:42.317 --> 00:04:44.920
Not every single person who asks for your note 
 book is trying to hook up 

00:04:45.067 --> 00:04:47.070
So as a solution , if he asks for your note book 

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:50.120
Go with him to the Book shop , photo copy it 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000
don't' forget to make him pay for it of course :P 

00:04:53.083 --> 00:04:54.580
and case is solved  :D

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:56.850
Tip #10 : Time 

00:04:56.991 --> 00:04:58.990
Time is a very important thing 

00:04:59.908 --> 00:05:01.910
(i forgot what i wanted to say :P )

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I know that you had enough studying 

00:05:04.058 --> 00:05:06.560
and you don't want any restrictions and want to live your life  

00:05:06.617 --> 00:05:08.020
and all these things in your head

00:05:08.083 --> 00:05:10.080
But , you should keep in mind 

00:05:10.158 --> 00:05:12.660
If you fail a course , it's going to be you repeating it 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.250
and the person paying for the course again.. is your Father 

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:17.700
So . it's a good idea to avoid problems 

00:05:17.983 --> 00:05:20.280
In short , live your life as you 
 like ,but at least go to classes

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:21.850
Don't skip attending 

00:05:21.966 --> 00:05:24.370
Try at least to study the exams , even if 
 it was on the night of the exam.

00:05:24.425 --> 00:05:26.420
it's ok , as long as you actually opened you books

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:27.950
 and get an idea of what's inside them 

00:05:28.008 --> 00:05:30.210
and there's no need to spend all your time following girls around

00:05:30.283 --> 00:05:32.480
Give time for the girl , Time for 
 studying ,time for home and family 

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.100
and ... no need for 14 girlfriends in the same time 

00:05:35.158 --> 00:05:37.160
Take it one at a time :P
