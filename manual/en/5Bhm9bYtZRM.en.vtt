Todd R.:
<i>THE MOST IMPORTANT THING</i>

00:00:05.133 --> 00:00:08.200
<i>IN THIS WHOLE PROJECT,
AND TO ME, IS MY FAMILY.</i>

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.734
<i>WE GOT INVOLVED</i>

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:12.467
IN THE ENERGY UPGRADE
CALIFORNIA PROGRAM INDIRECTLY,

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:15.100
SO THE WHOLE PROCESS STARTED
WITH SOME HEALTH ISSUES

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.200
THAT MY WIFE
WAS EXPERIENCING.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.033
SHE WAS HAVING--
IT SEEMED LIKE

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:20.767
THEY WERE CHRONIC
SINUS INFECTIONS.

00:00:20.767 --> 00:00:24.233
REALIZED THAT WE HAD JUST
A HORRIBLY INEFFICIENT

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.600
AND PROBLEMATIC
AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.767
<i>WE MOVED HERE IN DECEMBER,
AND THE HOUSE WAS COLD,</i>

00:00:29.767 --> 00:00:31.467
AND SUDDENLY
THE AIR WOULD TURN ON

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:33.600
AND IT WOULD JUST
BLAST HOT AIR

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.233
THROUGHOUT THE HOUSE.

00:00:35.233 --> 00:00:37.100
THE HOUSE WOULD GET TOO HOT.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.066
AND THEN,
THE AIR WOULD TURN OFF,

00:00:39.066 --> 00:00:41.100
AND AFTER 15 MINUTES
THE HOUSE WAS COLD AGAIN.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.567
AND I WENT AROUND PUTTING

00:00:42.567 --> 00:00:44.367
THERMOMETERS IN DIFFERENT
CORNERS OF THE HOUSE,

00:00:44.367 --> 00:00:47.133
AND I TELL YOU--
THERE WERE CORNERS

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.000
WHERE THE HOUSE
WAS 55 DEGREES,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.700
EVEN THOUGH, YOU KNOW,
THE THERMOSTAT SAID 70.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.700
Male Announcer: <i>MAYBE YOU
HAVE A ROOM THAT'S TOO HOT,</i>

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.700
<i>OR A ROOM
THAT'S TOO COLD,</i>

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.500
<i>OR YOU SUFFER FROM ALLERGIES</i>

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.400
<i>AND YOU WANT
TO REDUCE DUST.</i>

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.300
<i>WHEN YOU HAVE AN INEFFICIENT
HOME ENERGY SYSTEM,</i>

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.000
<i>YOUR HOME
IS LESS COMFORTABLE</i>

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.367
<i>AND IT COULD BE
COSTING YOU MONEY.</i>

00:01:07.367 --> 00:01:10.100
<i>AND WHILE THERE ARE A FEW AREAS
YOU MAY KNOW OF</i>

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.133
<i>THAT CAN HELP IMPROVE
YOUR HOME'S EFFICIENCY,</i>

00:01:12.133 --> 00:01:14.467
<i>THERE ARE THINGS
YOU MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT</i>

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:16.467
<i>THAT CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE.</i>

00:01:16.467 --> 00:01:19.600
<i>ENERGY UPGRADE CALIFORNIA
TAKES A "WHOLE HOUSE" APPROACH,</i>

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.500
<i>REWARDING YOU
FOR MAKING MULTIPLE UPGRADES</i>

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.734
<i>THAT WORK TOGETHER TO IMPROVE
YOUR HOME'S EFFICIENCY.</i>

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:25.500
<i>AND THE GREATER
THE IMPROVEMENT,</i>

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.500
<i>THE GREATER THE POTENTIAL
SAVINGS AND INCENTIVES.</i>

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.500
<i>AT ENERGYUPGRADECA.ORG,</i>

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.000
<i>YOU CAN FIND
A PARTICIPATING CONTRACTOR</i>

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.467
<i>IN YOUR AREA
WHO IS SPECIALLY TRAINED</i>

00:01:36.467 --> 00:01:38.367
<i>TO IDENTIFY ENERGY LEAKS
IN YOUR HOME</i>

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:40.333
<i>WITH A WHOLE-HOUSE
ASSESSMENT.</i>

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:42.767
<i>THEY'LL MEASURE YOUR HOME'S
ENERGY EFFICIENCY</i>

00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:46.100
<i>AND HELP FIND THE UPGRADES
THAT CAN SAVE YOU THE MOST.</i>

00:01:47.734 --> 00:01:50.033
<i>ONE OF THE THINGS
I DIDN'T EXPECT FROM THIS</i>

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:52.300
IS THAT MY HOUSE
IS SO COMFORTABLE NOW.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.166
USUALLY THE TEMPERATURE
DOESN'T DROP BELOW 68,

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:57.667
IT DOESN'T GO ABOVE 74,

00:01:57.667 --> 00:02:00.300
BECAUSE THE HOUSE IS JUST
SO WELL INSULATED NOW.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.467
FOR US, A WHOLE-HOUSE
ASSESSMENT

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:05.767
INCLUDED LOOKING AT IT
FROM TOP TO BOTTOM--

00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:08.367
EVERYTHING FROM
THE INSULATION IN THE ATTIC

00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:11.100
TO THE WAY THAT
THE FLOOR WAS SEALED

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:14.066
<i>UNDER THE RAISED-FLOOR
PORTION OF THE HOUSE.</i>

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:16.433
BUT IT'S REALLY TAKING A LOOK
AT EVERYTHING IN YOUR HOUSE

00:02:16.433 --> 00:02:18.333
AND DETERMINING

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.767
HOW IT CAN POSSIBLY
BE MADE MORE EFFICIENT.
