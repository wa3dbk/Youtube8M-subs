WENDY WILLIAMS: How you doing?

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:02.530
I'm Wendy.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.600
WENDY'S DOG: And I'm
Wendy's dog.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:06.340
WENDY WILLIAMS: And we're here
to tell you about the word

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:07.240

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.320
what a veterinarian is.

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:22.860
WENDY'S DOG: Why?

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.240

veterinarian is a doctor who

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.220
takes care of animals
and helps them

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:30.303
stay strong and healthy.

00:00:30.303 --> 00:00:34.012

you call an animal doctor?

00:00:34.012 --> 00:00:35.230

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.460

helpful, you know that?

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:03.730

00:01:17.865 --> 00:01:18.945
CHICKEN: Good idea!

00:01:18.945 --> 00:01:22.040
A veterinarian, why didn't
I think of that?

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.982
I'm such a bird brain.

00:01:23.982 --> 00:01:24.630
Ooh, itchy!

make that face?

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.518
