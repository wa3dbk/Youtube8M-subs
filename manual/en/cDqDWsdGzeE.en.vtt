00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.100
JAMIE GOTCH: Subatomic
Studios started as a

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.440
small group of us.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.580
We met through a carpool.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.330
LEONARDO A MONTENEGRO: And we
became friends and realized

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.880
that we shared a passion
common for games and

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.070
development in general.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.880
JAMIE GOTCH: And we felt that
with our creative background,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.759
our artistic background, and our
engineering talent, we are

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.850
able to build a game that would
work well on mobile and

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.530
that would appeal to
a lot of people.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.260
LEONARDO A MONTENEGRO: In
Fieldrunners 1, when it first

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.470
got launched, no one knew
what to expect.

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.890
It was a new hardware.

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.810
It was a marketing growth.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.700
And nobody really had any
huge expectations.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.340
JAMIE GOTCH: We were actually
surprised with the number of

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.550
feedback we received.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.670
It was overwhelming.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.560
And our fans constantly ask
for more and more content.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.530
So Fieldrunners 2 offers all the
features and things that

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.440
we wanted to have in the first
game, but we just didn't have

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:08.550
the time or money.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:10.590
There is an actual depth
to the scene.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.930
And that actually adds a
whole new element of

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.430
gameplay to the game.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.150
It changes strategies
dramatically and creates a

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:19.770
whole new way of looking
at maze building.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.670
SERGEI GOURSKI: Most people
look at our game, and they

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.290
think it's a 2D game.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.810
In reality, all of the assets
are actually 3D models.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.220
JAMIE GOTCH: And it's an actual
3D engine under the

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.570
hood so that we can leverage
any kind of 3D depth in the

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.530
scene that we would like.

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.030
We knew from the very beginning
that we wanted to

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.890
use 3ds Max as our tool
of choice for

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.590
developing our assets.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:44.260
SERGEI GOURSKI: 3ds
Max has grown as a

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.610
package in a lot of ways.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.660
It has acquired a lot of
features that were first

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.440
plug-ins, like Biped, CAT,
and then integrated them

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:54.620
seamlessly.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.040
We were able to use Biped to
animate almost every single

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.500
character that we have
in game right now.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.190
The ability to simply reuse some
of the animations and add

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.445
layers and tweak them
a little bit, add

00:02:06.445 --> 00:02:08.020
a variety in animation.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.150
And the CAT animation system was
very useful for animating

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.740
all the creatures and quadrupeds
in the game.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.910
It is a very, very intuitive
and easy to use system.

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.600
It kind of knows what
you're trying to do.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.080
It even has a built-in system
for just getting you started

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.690
with an animation, like a
very rough animation.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.280
Something that an animator would
have to go in there and

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.440
mock out ahead of time, it
just does it for you.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.920
Here you go.

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.480
I know what you're
trying to do.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.060
I'm going to save
you some time.

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.980
JAMIE GOTCH: Autodesk products
like 3ds Max, I personally

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.660
believe, are underused in the
mobile space at the moment.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.465
I think when people go to set
out to build a mobile game,

00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:49.890
they're looking at building a
game in a very short period of

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.510
time and on a very
limited budget.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.230
I think what a lot of people
underestimate is the amount of

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.130
time and money that it saves
to actually use 3ds Max.

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.090
It very quickly pays for itself,
and the time that you

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:08.350
save in development and workflow
is significant.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.380
Each of our units can consist
of dozens to hundreds of

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:13.780
frames of animation.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.440
That would've been extremely
difficult for us to achieve by

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:18.550
hand-painting means.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.360
With 3ds Max, we can
iterate very

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.250
rapidly on our game assets.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.520
LEONARDO A MONTENEGRO: It's just
the flexibility that you

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.750
have in making changes,
like sweeping changes.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.460
With the workflow that we have,
if we need to tweak the

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:35.010
frames, add a few here, or cut
it down just so we can reduce

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:36.710
the size, we do it.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.020
JAMIE GOTCH: And we're able to
build a bunch of different

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:43.050
scripts for 3ds Max that allows
us to have this very

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.710
customizable workflow.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:47.450
SERGEI GOURSKI: This becomes an
automated process once it's

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.790
configured, and at any point
we need to change these

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.420
assets, the artists merely
have to go in, tweak the

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.640
model, and hit that Render
button and walk away, and the

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:00.160
unit is updated.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:02.110
JAMIE GOTCH: Because we're
limited by all the different

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.430
resolutions of the different
devices, 3ds Max allows the

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.950
engineers to very quickly tweak
these animations to fit

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.130
the memory needs of the device,
the memory needs of

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.270
the platform.

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:16.790
DERRICK BARTH: So we were able
to find it just by being able

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.260
to quickly export just the
animations we wanted.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.000
We were able to cut down to size
usually by 30% to 40% to

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.100
50%, which, when you're dealing
with a difference of

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.620
kilobytes, make a big difference
in the game.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:29.730
It's hugely beneficial.

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.810
It's all about quality and
speed of execution.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.930
SERGEI GOURSKI: This marketplace
evolves so fast,

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.130
you've got to make a game
in nine months.

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.010
Otherwise, it's going
to be history.

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:44.080
So as a company, we've evolved
to create games faster.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:48.010
And Autodesk has made that
job a lot easier for us.
