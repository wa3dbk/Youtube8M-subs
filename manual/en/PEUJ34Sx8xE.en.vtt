00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.330
In this segment, you will learn about end,
corner, rise and dip posts. You will learn how to

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.890
install these posts by hand.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.849
Or with the use of a hydraulic post driver. You'll 
also learn the proper size and

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.110
depth needed to make your installation
secure.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:33.320
Start with installation of all end, corner,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.400
dip and rise posts, which should be wooden
posts.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.120
End posts are used at gate openings or the
end of your fence where buildings or

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.890
other obstacles provide an existing
boundary.

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.440
Corner posts are set at corners.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:49.579
Dip and rise posts are set where there
are major dips or rises in your terrain,

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:53.539
requiring additional support for the
tension of the high tensile wire.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.949
End, corner, dip and rise posts will
support the guidewire used to align the

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.269
remaining line posts.

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.250
So, they must be installed first. You can
either handset posts

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.990
or use a hydraulic post driver.
Installation will vary slightly

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.650
depending on the method you choose.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.250
Driven posts require a tractor or truck
mounted hydraulic post driver.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.799
We recommend this method if possible, as
it provides nearly ten times the pullout

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:19.580
resistance of a handset post.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:23.390
You may choose to hire a local fence
installer to set your posts,

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:28.110
or rent the driver yourself. Proper
operation and safety precautions

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.530
should be mastered before using this
potentially dangerous equipment.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.380
Pre-driling a small pilot hole in the
ground with a 4-inch rock auger,

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.130
can ease post driving in hard rocky soil
conditions.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.180
Driven posts always go into the ground
small end first,

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.260
for the least amount of soil disruption
and greater holding power.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.790
Offset posts from plumb about two to
three inches.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.180
Offset away from the direction the wire
will pull. This prevents the posts from

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.030
pulling over center when tension is
applied to the wires.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.250
You may also handset corner and end posts
but must take

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.670
extra steps to prevent pullout.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.970
When hand-setting posts, the large end goes
in the ground first,

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.190
for greater stability.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.150
First, dig an inverse bell-shape at the
base of the whole,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.820
making sure it is at least 42 inches
deep. Place the post in the hole,

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:20.930
and tightly tamp about eight-inches of
 dry concrete mix around the bottom.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.020
Overtime, the soils moisture will cause
the concrete mix to setup and securely

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.140
anchor posts.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.620
You can add water to speed up the
process.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.400
End and corner posts are at least eight
feet long,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.830
and generally six inches in diameter.
They should be buried at least 42 inches

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:37.470
deep

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.090
and set with a 2- to 3-inch pre-loaded
lean. These will go at each fence corner

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.030
and major dips or rises in the terrain.
