00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.000
In this clip, we're going to talk about the
proper service procedure to retrofit your

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.830
vehicles air conditioning system from R-twelve
to one thirty-four A and recharge the system.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.870
In this step, we're going to talk about the
final service procedures for finishing up

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:23.010
our air conditioning retrofit and service
job. What I have here, is my low side fitting.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:31.850
It has a small gasket on the inside. I'm going
to screw that down onto the service port.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.539
This provides a weather seal and keeps moisture
and contaminants from getting in the fitting.

00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:43.199
The very last thing you're going to want to
do, is fill out the retrofit tag. It will

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.719
have blanks on there and it's going to want
some specific information as far as your name,

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:54.559
the date you serviced it, the possible company
you work for, your address, the refrigerant,

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.600
the amount installed and the type of lubricant.
You're going to want to place this glamor

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.500
tag in a conspicuous location on the vehicle.
A good spot for this one would be here on

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:13.719
the evaporator core box. However, it has insulation
on it and my sticker won't stick to it. The

00:01:13.719 --> 00:01:18.689
next most conspicuous spot I can think of
is going to be right here. What I'm going

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.630
to do, is take a little bit of rubbing alcohol
and clean the dirt off of it so I can get

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:40.210
a good stick out of my sticker. And, go ahead
and apply it. Just going to take and peel

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:47.499
the sticker off like any other sticker. And,
apply it. This will let any service technician

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:52.429
that works on it in the future, or you can
remind you what has been done to the vehicle

00:01:52.429 --> 00:02:01.149
that is altered from it's original factory
design. That is the proper way to seal up

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:06.950
your low side service port, fill out your
service sticker and apply it to the vehicle.
