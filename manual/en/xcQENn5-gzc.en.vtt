Hi everyone, welcome back to another episode of Honeysuckle Catering

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.309
today we're at the Blended Recipes studio and I'm going to show you how to make a Blended Recipe

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.579
the Peppermint Mocha Smoothie

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:17.449
i love this drink but it's only offered at coffee shops seasonally

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:19.120
I'm going to show you how to make it so

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.029
you can have it all year round. Let's get started. You're going to need

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:28.420
1 teaspoon of peppermint extract, 2 shots of espresso

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:32.480
1 tablespoon of cocoa powder, be sure to use sweetened cocoa powder for

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.300
this recipe. 1 cup of vanilla soy ice cream

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.370
1 cup of vanilla soy milk

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.260
or regular milk, if you like

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.110
and a cup of ice

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.330
combine all your ingredients into the blender and mix it well

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.610
until it's frothy

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.170
and there you have it, your

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:21.950
peppermint mocha coffee shake

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:28.950
let's give it a try!

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:32.450
creamy, peppermint-y, delicious!
