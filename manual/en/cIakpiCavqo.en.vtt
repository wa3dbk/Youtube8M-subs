00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.596
Hi! Today we're going to make some scrapbook paper 

00:00:03.596 --> 00:00:10.596
to create nice projects like this one

00:00:14.877 --> 00:00:21.587
we're going to start by applying some water to the cardboard

00:00:21.587 --> 00:00:28.587
I'm using a very thick brush to go faster

00:00:35.297 --> 00:00:36.467
now

00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:39.237
using purple watercolor

00:00:39.237 --> 00:00:40.737
we'll drop

00:00:40.737 --> 00:00:43.407
some small drops

00:00:43.407 --> 00:00:45.457
on the cardboard

00:00:45.457 --> 00:00:48.027
I'm using right now 

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:49.187
a thin 

00:00:49.187 --> 00:00:50.377
brush

00:00:50.377 --> 00:00:54.797
distribute the purple drops all around the cardboard

00:00:54.797 --> 00:01:01.797
rinse your brush and do the same using magenta or pink watercolor

00:01:07.307 --> 00:01:09.007
now apply cyan or light blue

00:01:09.007 --> 00:01:16.007
using the same technique

00:01:43.757 --> 00:01:48.337
if you want to intensify some colors, this is the right moment to do it

00:01:48.337 --> 00:01:55.337
applying more watercolor

00:02:10.536 --> 00:02:16.276
now adding some water with your brush you can blur 

00:02:16.276 --> 00:02:18.456
the areas that you think 

00:02:18.456 --> 00:02:25.456
are too strong

00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:37.887
remember that when it dries 

00:02:37.887 --> 00:02:44.887
colors become lighter

00:02:54.336 --> 00:02:56.677
as soon as you think you like it

00:02:56.677 --> 00:03:01.446
the paper is done

00:03:01.446 --> 00:03:05.016
let's start now next paper

00:03:05.016 --> 00:03:07.036
we'll start again

00:03:07.036 --> 00:03:09.006
applying some water

00:03:09.006 --> 00:03:14.156
using the same colors

00:03:14.156 --> 00:03:15.167
we'll start applying purple watercolor 

00:03:15.167 --> 00:03:16.116
using a thick round brush

00:03:16.116 --> 00:03:22.016
let's apply also some magenta and cyan spots

00:03:22.016 --> 00:03:29.016
always rinsing the brush between colors

00:03:31.686 --> 00:03:34.467
have fun while doing this 

00:03:34.467 --> 00:03:37.026
remember that there's not a wrong or right

00:03:37.026 --> 00:03:44.026
 way to do it

00:03:54.706 --> 00:03:59.536
as soon as you finish applying this colors it'll be done 

00:03:59.536 --> 00:04:03.877
watercolor will do the rest of the work for you

00:04:03.877 --> 00:04:07.246
once dry and flat, the scrapbook paper is ready to use

00:04:07.246 --> 00:04:12.076
