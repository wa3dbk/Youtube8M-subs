00:00:04.088 --> 00:00:07.519
Here is an idea I found on YouTube

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:08.689
...

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:13.538
cause I was looking for lizard traps because I made one out of a tissue box and it did not work out

00:00:13.538 --> 00:00:14.808
...

00:00:14.808 --> 00:00:18.558
but I think this will all work pretty
good. Basically what you do is get a 

00:00:18.558 --> 00:00:21.358
water bottle

00:00:21.358 --> 00:00:24.059
or soda bottle whatever

00:00:24.059 --> 00:00:27.438
you cut the top off

00:00:27.438 --> 00:00:29.828
and uh...

00:00:29.828 --> 00:00:32.049
See all the holes in it and stuff

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:33.918
so this is the top

00:00:33.918 --> 00:00:36.879
well basically said at the white insists
the top

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.289
and uh... so there's no holes in the top
but but the holes not for air from

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:46.039
lizards because of your clinic through
the snow on top

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:49.169
that's the only way because it's not
like it sealed airtight

00:00:49.169 --> 00:00:50.769
would basically

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:56.219
there was an ambulance and basically if
pushes down in there like that

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.189
and and

00:00:59.189 --> 00:01:03.889
calls it

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:07.629
tx will push it down and there are like
that right

00:01:07.629 --> 00:01:10.349
and and instead of down

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:11.769
uh...

00:01:11.769 --> 00:01:16.369
he put bugs in it and stuff right and so
basically it's clear so the losers

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:17.799
vacancy

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:20.239
in all the books and stuff there would
be in there

00:01:20.239 --> 00:01:24.049
and so they get attracted to it
obviously because of that right

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:24.998
and so

00:01:24.998 --> 00:01:25.989
uh...

00:01:25.989 --> 00:01:28.759
they'll try to find their way and
eventually they'll find a way and

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:30.349
through this whole

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:33.549
uh... and when they go in

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.608
read the books or whatever to do

00:01:35.608 --> 00:01:37.209
right over in here

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:40.749
and then dot com try to come out but
they'll come out try to come out

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:44.658
throughout all these little holes and
also try to come out

00:01:44.658 --> 00:01:46.829
uh... the where it came in

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.669
but they won't figure out

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:55.619
most of them won't figure out to come
back up through the anger right sulk

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:59.359
uh... this is kind of a multi-purpose
thing to soar put holes in it because

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:04.209
i'm basically building a minnow trap is
what i saw some that look on like this

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:05.909
as a metal traps

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.829
and uh... it's almost the same exact
concept

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.089
um...

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:15.619
basically you put this down to the water
it sinks because of all the holes

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:19.008
reports of bread or somethin or whatever
the elite

00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:23.068
and uh... sinks down any handouts women

00:02:23.068 --> 00:02:24.338
somewhere in

00:02:24.338 --> 00:02:27.158
but they won't think to come up that
whole again

00:02:27.158 --> 00:02:30.468
dancing trapped revenue know since i was
thinking

00:02:30.468 --> 00:02:32.268
about my buddy josh

00:02:32.268 --> 00:02:33.638
uh...

00:02:33.638 --> 00:02:35.828
uh... i was thinking if he's gonna do

00:02:35.828 --> 00:02:38.548
it contrasted black soldier flight

00:02:38.548 --> 00:02:39.858
compost her

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:44.908
uh... i know some people might think
it's cool to get fish for it but

00:02:44.908 --> 00:02:49.179
free food for and your chickens probably
fish to do it i don't know if they get a

00:02:49.179 --> 00:02:53.068
fishing fleet well why don't know about

00:02:53.068 --> 00:02:54.338
but i was thinkin

00:02:54.338 --> 00:02:57.289
you could feed the

00:02:57.289 --> 00:02:59.518
blacks all lives the fish

00:02:59.518 --> 00:03:03.558
uh... and also uh... i don't know how
made was that you have learned about the
