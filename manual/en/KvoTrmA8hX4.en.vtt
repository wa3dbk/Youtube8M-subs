hi I'm Peg from Sony and I'm here to
show you how to connect a Bluetooth

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:17.039
enabled device to your Sony Vaio computer

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.899
for my demonstration I'm using the Vpceb

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:25.579
each Vaio computer is slightly different
and the operating system you are using

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:31.009
could be a factor so be sure to check
the owner's manual or visit us at

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.469
esupport.Sony.com

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:38.390
for specific instructions on your model and operating system

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:44.420
also not all computers have an internal Bluetooth adapter

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.760
let's go ahead and get started

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:54.490
click on the Vaio smart network icon in the lower right taskbar

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:59.900
verify that the internal Bluetooth adapters is set to on

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.700
right click on the Bluetooth icon and choose open settings

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.440
in the options tab

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.230
make sure you checked the box next to allow Bluetooth devices to find this computer

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.960
all the boxes within the bluetooth setting option tab should be checked

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.020
if they aren't

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.450
go ahead and check them all

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.920
now verify that the Bluetooth device is turned on and charged properly

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.510
you may have to refer to the owner's manual of the device for proper operation

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.440
click on Bluetooth device

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.110
choose Add a device

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.170
in the Select a device screen click on the device you want to add

00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.360
if a Bluetooth device requires pairing a prompt box will appear to pair the necessary devices

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.160
locate the device to be paired and select pair

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.039
if an authentication is required a dialog box will appear

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.839
enter the passkey in the appropriate field

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:23.730
the Bluetooth device setup is now complete and the device should be disaplyed in the Bluetooth settings window

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:28.329
please keep in mind that some Bluetooth
devices can be a little complicated

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:32.319
so you should refer to the owner's manual of those devices for further instructions

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:35.980
