Hi this is Julie with Beadaholique.com and I'm going to show you how to make the

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.659
Lock and Key earring set

00:00:13.659 --> 00:00:17.289
I've already gone ahead and made one and I'll show you how to make the other

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.420
and this comes as a complete kit

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.390
from Beadaholique.com

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.380
so what you'll have in your kit is two earring hooks

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.600
you'll have two of these great lock stampings in an antique silver

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:31.060
plate

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.239
you'll get two 4mm jump rings and two of these antique silver plated key

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.890
charms and they look great on both sides

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.330
so that is your kit ingredient and then in terms of the tools you'll need for this

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:48.100
kit is two pairs of pliers which will allow you to open your jump

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.200
ring and the earring hook

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.020
it can either be a chain nose plier and a round nose plier, two pairs of chain nose

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.840
pliers

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:00.090
whatever you used to grip that jump ring and be able to open it up

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.230
It's really very simple and makes a great quick and easy earring

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:06.450
we're going to grip our

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.390
jump ring on the side with the slit of the jump ring facing upwards

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.000
take our other pair of pliers

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.219
and twist the jump ring over

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:21.030
pushing the sides away from each other. You never wanna pull a jump ring open

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.749
Link it

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:25.930
through the link at the top of the key charm

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.920
and the little hole at the base

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.740
of our lock stamping

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.470
twist the jump ring back into place

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.350
now for the earring hook

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.650
versus going to carefully

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.270
do the same thing, pretend that this is a
jump ring

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.210
twist it apart again we're not pulling it open

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.410
and then this is great because it actually fits over that top little decorative

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.189
ball

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.350
and then just

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.250
twist it back into place just to secure it

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.170
and you have

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.900
your earring set.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:01.900
