00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:09.610
Today we are going to make a microphone stand
out of a lamp.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.700
As I am planning to use “Zoom H1” mic
for the stand it makes it even easier.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:23.259
All we need is a lam, hot shoe screw or an
ordinary screw and a “T” shape bracket.

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:30.700
Let’s keep only what we need.
There is not much to explain as it’s very

00:00:30.700 --> 00:02:24.300
simple.
And that’s how you make your microphone

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.330
stand out of a lamp.
