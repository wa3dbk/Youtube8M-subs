[President Christina H. Paxson]
Brown’s 250th anniversary has truly been a global celebration.

00:00:36.623 --> 00:00:44.823
Tens of thousands of alumni, students, parents, friends and community members have embraced the invitation to be a part of this

00:00:44.923 --> 00:00:53.223
significant occasion. Through exhibits and tours and events and labs and demonstrations, offered on campus and on every continent, we have

00:00:53.323 --> 00:01:02.281
reflected on our past, considered the University of today and challenged ourselves to imagine Brown’s future. We have showcased the

00:01:02.381 --> 00:01:07.840
diversity that thrives in the Brown community and defines the Brown experience.
