We are all famous to a few people. 
 (MUSIC)

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.660
What? What is it?

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.910
Is that? Is that the camera? 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.340
Don you’re waking me up to make a sex tape? (SIGHS) Asshole. 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.940
Fuck.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.300
Pick a lane douchebag. 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.870
You got the camera on, Mike? 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.120
Mike?

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.050
You wanna be a big director, you gotta turn the camera on, right? You got me in focus and shit? 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.010
What? Come on, fucking relax. I’m busting your balls.  I know you got me in focus. You just want me to like start?  

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.460
Like, uh.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.950
This is Don Grigioni talking to you live.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:08.120
Yeah, no, not like that.
(PHONE VIBRATES)

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.590
Your Aunt Annie calling to check up to see if I am where I say I am. 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.580
Hey, babe. Yeah, I'm in the car with Mike right now, he's even videotaping me. Yeah, that camera. Of course I changed the tape. 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:23.580
Yeah, what's up with Virginia, now? Not my mother, my mother-IN-LAW. She just bitching about the nursing-- 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:32.830
yes, the assisted living that I pay for -- We pay for. You what?  No, you bit her? … Unfucking-believable

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.170
Where's she staying out of the light? ... MOVE IN WITH US? 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.380
If that's her, you take it and you call me right back. Love you, too.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:48.380
Your Aunt Annie really fucked up. (SIGHS)

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:54.619
It's hard enough with two of us like this, but me, Annie, and her mom? Not the plan.&nbsp;

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.460
I didn't even want Annie like this, then I got hungry and...

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.040
Well, you know what, not anymore, I got my own supplies. Our own supplies.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.800
Just as long as the work keeps rolling in.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.629
Look, I'm gonna be like 20 minutes. Tops.  Don’t follow me.

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:11.950
There's a gun in the glove compartment, just in case.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.109
Shitty neighborhood.

00:02:14.109 --> 00:02:18.109
(DOOR SLAMS)     (JARS CLINK TOGETHER)

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.109
(TWO GUNSHOTS)

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:29.400
Gotta love mixing business and grocery shopping. My fucking mother-in-law better not drink a lot.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.299
(WATER RUSHES) (FOOD SIZZLES) 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:41.070
I'm not gonna have a fake conversation for your little documentary, reality, whatever-the-hell-it-is after we’ve already

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.599
 talked about it. This whole thing is your fault. … Oh, how is it my fault?

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.159
You bit me.

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.769
Yeah, because I love you and if I'm gonna to live forever I want it to be with you. … You are so full of shit. 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:52.030
You know I don't believe that. Neither does God, 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:57.980
or Jesus or even your own little nephew, Mikey. Right Mikey?  Hey, hey you know leave him out of it.  He’s busy. 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.929
Where’s she gonna sleep?  Guest room.  That's my office. My computer's in there.

00:03:01.929 --> 00:03:07.309
Watching porn on a computer does not make
that room an office. … Where am I gonna make phone calls? … Garage. 

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:10.439
Forever? …&nbsp;We can always move. … Yeah, at night.

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:13.480
Maybe you wanted to talk to me before you decided to bite her?

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.569
Did you ask before you bit me? … … No. 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:24.099
You were sayin’?

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:31.099
Thank you God, for this food. Amen. 
(UTENSILS SCRAPING PLATES)

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:37.199
It's a sin to waste food. I like to sit down and feel like I'm having a meal, okay?

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:39.370
Just sayin’.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.459
I don’t see you complaining about losing weight.

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:48.089
Man, I miss meatballs, you know, huge meatballs with gravy, I could care less about the pasta.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.399
I miss cake, chocolate cake.  Eh, maybe I just miss chocolate.

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:54.620
You know, I miss garlic too. Yeah, I miss garlic.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.829
I do not miss you eating garlic. This one turns into a garlic&nbsp;fart&nbsp;factory.

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:05.640
That’s true, but worth it. See, we can eat food, just gives us the runs for like a couple days which is not worth it.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.900
Hey, do we have to talk about BM.s? 
BMs? 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:09.939
Bowel movements. 

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.979
But my&nbsp;garlic farts&nbsp;are okay?

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:15.389
Welcome to my new fucking office.

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:18.199
One day, he starts blocking windows and he won’t say why.

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:19.349
I got shot.

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.139
I think he’s losing his mind.

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.199
And then I did the whole light at the end of the tunnel thing.

00:04:24.199 --> 00:04:25.419
Heard voices.

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:29.810
Then, he comes from work, says he found an ad on-line and that was that.

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.389
Annoying voices...

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:33.620
relatives' voices...

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.129
Never asked me what I thought.

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:37.199
Like he was just buying a car or something.

00:04:37.199 --> 00:04:38.930
Voices of, uh,

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:41.119
"business associates."

00:04:41.119 --> 00:04:43.649
So, I chose this,

00:04:43.649 --> 00:04:45.830
you know, live forever, hopefully.

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:48.160
Most of my business is done at night.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.729
It’s a good fit.

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.539
I have put up with a lot of shit in this marriage. 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:55.739
And you know your uncle and you know I'm right, Mikey.

00:04:55.739 --> 00:04:59.460
I thought it would be good for our marriage.  I could relax because there'd be more wives. 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:01.199
They wouldn’t live forever.

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:02.820
So, if I'm gonna live forever, 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.470
I want my mother to live forever 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.809
so I can complain about Don.

00:05:06.809 --> 00:05:08.419
Now I got a wife 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:10.610
and a mother-in-law

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.789
that are gonna live with me, for eternity. 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:21.789
Fucking great.
(MUSIC)

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:29.199
Don, why don’t you go show Rob the new office?

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.199
I’d love to.

00:05:32.199 --> 00:06:32.189
(MUSIC)

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:35.630
We don’t bite people because we’re not fucking animals.
