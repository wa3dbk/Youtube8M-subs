Hello everyone, so here we are with a really fun little game, it's called Team Awesome.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.480
Really, really nice graphics,

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.490
and the idea, it's kind of like a comic book style
game and 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.780
the idea is you're

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:17.169
given superpowers by this falling meterorite and you have to complete each level and to

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:21.310
unlock the next level you have to complete these various

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.680
challenges like training but you only get a certain amount of

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:26.970
time to actually complete each level.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.699
Once the time is up, the time is up so if you've got coins and if you hold on the screen

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:36.380
you can then cause yourself to fly. It's all about timing, this game.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.060
You don't want to hit those red crystals but if there are blue crystals around they're worth

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:40.960
bonus points.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.720
And the idea is to get the highest score you can on each level before you move on to 

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.060
the next one, and obviously completing
these challenges as well.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.770
The graphics are absolutely gorgeous and you look there...

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.510
smashing through walls and so on, just really nicely done. As you kind of get further

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:01.080
through the game you unlock new superheroes and there's also bad guys as well

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.340
but just a really fun little free game. It's a nice twist on the 

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.790
endless runner style

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.250
games that we've seen previously

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.290
where you can keep redoing each level over and over again until you get the high score or

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:17.650
complete all of the challenges, so there you go.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.450
I have to do it again. Now, I'm going to give you a tip. If you're a little bit short on cash, 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.850
you can actually tap

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:28.230
on yourself and you'll give yourself a couple of extra coins.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:32.580
Useful when you're just trying to get up to the next level as it were, to purchase

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.900
various boosts.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.000
To actually unlock each level you need to have
enough coins

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.130
so it's important to grab all of these
coins as well as hitting the challenges

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.670
if you can for bonus points.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.619
Obviously, you want to get as many points as you can on each level.

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.409
It's all about timing as you can see
really timing exactly when you're flying

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.130
when you're going on the ground.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:02.550
Which of these bits you're going to hit. If you actually hit

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.370
some of the mob guys

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.150
the you actually gain sort of additional height. Watch this.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.649
You see I get popped up into the air immediately, useful for grabbing those but 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.569
Team Awesome, it really is just a great little colourful game, good for kids and good for 

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.609
adults too, for a little diversion this weekend.

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:20.769
Well worth it. Up on the Play Store now.
