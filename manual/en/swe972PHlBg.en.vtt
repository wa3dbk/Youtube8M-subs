What is multitabling in online poker and how
does it affect the winrate?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.700
Ok, so you are playing online poker on a single
table for months now, proving yourself that

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:24.910
you can beat the game. Great! Assuming you
are an average winner and playing at 6-max

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:31.119
No-Limit tables, your winrate comes down to
3 Big Bets per 100 hands, which is the equivalent

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:37.570
of 6 big blinds per 100 hands.
Right, what does that mean? By playing at

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.850
25 dollar tables, you make 1.5 dollar per
100 hands.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:48.820
Speaking of hands, about a hundred hands are
dealt in the span of one hour. Therefore,

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.140
it's safe to assume that you are truly making
a buck and a half per hour playing at 25 dollar

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:02.140
6-max no limit tables. Ok, that's a start.
And that's where multitabling comes in.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.950
By adding tables to your screen, you effectively
increase the number of hands you play per

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.900
hour. Each table wins you a dollar and a half
for each hour of actual play. By now playing

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:20.070
4 tables simultaneously, you make 6 dollars
per hour! Heck, if you add 4 more, you increase

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.070
your initial winrate eight-fold!
Well, unfortunately, that's not how it goes.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:33.710
Compare playing at a single table with playing
at 8 tables at once. You need to act faster

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.390
but more significantly, think faster! You
are now much more prone to making mistakes

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.409
and neglecting to take notes of the opponents.
Your reads are now suffering and you don't

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.180
remember exactly how villains are playing
against you.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:55.470
It's not that rare to miss hands either.
Miss hands, really? You would never timed

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.000
out holding Aces when playing a single table,
but now... it can happen. And even worse,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.909
it is one of the things that will make you
tilt; that is lose your temper and calmness

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:13.909
and play more aggressively than normal. Obviously,
that won't be good for your bankroll.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:22.150
The added pressure that multitabling creates,
will hurt your winrate. It is inevitable that

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:28.019
you will no longer win 6 big blinds per 100
hands. But if you are winning at a rate of

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:33.980
3 big blinds per 100 hands when playing at
4 tables, you are still winning more than

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.749
before!
Think about it for a second. 1 dollar and

00:02:37.749 --> 00:02:42.639
a half ended up in your account per hour when
you were beating the game at 6 big blinds

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:49.639
per hour on a single table. Now you are winning
75 cents from each table, given your winrate

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.389
is halved.
With 4 tables on your screen though, that

00:02:54.389 --> 00:03:01.219
equals to 3 dollar per hour! By quadrupling
the number of tables you are playing, your

00:03:01.219 --> 00:03:07.400
hourly winrate in blinds' terms suffers,
but in the end your hourly winrate in dollar

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.879
terms doubled! And we don't put blinds in
our pockets, but money!

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.749
There are more advantages of you being capable
of playing at many tables simultaneously.

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:23.779
The first that comes to mind is collecting
more loyalty points per hour, which can be

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:29.199
redeemed for money or can buy you a ticket
to a big tournament. Additionally, the poker

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:35.629
room considers you now a loyal customer, rewarding
you with less rake the more you play. That

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:41.709
of course will further benefit your winrate,
as you save on costs.

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.129
Be careful though if you decide to add more
tables and multitable. Add one table at a

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:52.909
time and only add more when you are feeling
comfortable. Also, check out your winrate

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:57.449
and make sure it's profitable for you to
multitable. What is the point after all to

00:03:57.449 --> 00:04:02.719
add 4 more tables, if you are going to win
less for each hour you play? You'd better

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:07.499
stick to the number of tables you are playing
your A game and improve your skills, than

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:13.469
forcing yourself to play at more tables.
Besides, everyone can open and sit down at

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:19.689
more tables in online poker. But can everyone
win when playing poker? Focus on improving

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:22.620
your game and multitabling will come naturally.
