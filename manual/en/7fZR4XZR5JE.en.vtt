00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.280
Top brushes aren't new. Top brushes are sometimes scary.

00:00:23.719 --> 00:00:26.719
Depends on whether you're new to the business or been 
 in the business for a long time. 

00:00:27.977 --> 00:00:30.977
Old timers remember when it was a good cleaning piece 
 of equipment when it was all bristle. 

00:00:31.922 --> 00:00:35.922
When it became cloth they remember it as a piece 
 that would tear off a visor a windshield wiper

00:00:35.788 --> 00:00:37.788
 or hood ornaments or anythign it could get its hands on. 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.840
The new innovations now with the foam materials 
 make the top brush much better. 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.120
The best cleaning ones use top close cell foam.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:56.980
quiet ones use a piece of foam that 
 is much thicker, much different in complexity.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.600
Sometimes it doesn't clean as well and it doesn't last as long. 

00:01:01.623 --> 00:01:06.623
So having our Top Brush out there which was a very good 
 cleaning piece with material that lasted a long,long time. 

00:01:08.153 --> 00:01:10.153
the downside was the noise level.  

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:14.870
So this year it was to try and get rid of 
 the noise and improve the performance of that brush. 

00:01:15.781 --> 00:01:17.781
Because the customer demand is still there  

00:01:17.375 --> 00:01:19.375
and we just wanted to make them a bettter piece of equipment 

00:01:18.942 --> 00:01:22.942
that they can be proud of and be very confident running 
 on every vehicle that runs through the wash. 

00:01:25.107 --> 00:01:31.107
I again went right back to my friends at Neoglide 
 and I said we gotta create a better brish

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:38.709
I think when we work with them, and we developed the Ninja brush 
 which was a real safe soft alternative to the Poodle brush,

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:42.180
where people didn't want an acutal bristle touching the car anywhere.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.720
They did a great job. and we created this backwardly curved brush 

00:01:48.304 --> 00:01:50.300
that would reach into the wheels and clean the wheels real well. 

00:01:51.073 --> 00:01:53.070
Durable , long-lasting, it was great! 

00:01:54.834 --> 00:01:59.830
I said I think this is gonna be the ticket we gotta 
 make this much bigger and put it on a top brush.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.260
He made it for me in a design 
 in the largest mold he had. 

00:02:06.171 --> 00:02:11.170
And, it was too small. And it was even more complex 
 I wanted it to be like the Ninja. 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.180
To have that backward curve. 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.560
because I believe the backward curve would make it so that 
 it wouldn't grab a wiper, wouldn't grab a mirror

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
or an antenna. and be very smooth and he 
 kept saying it's too hard to do.

00:02:23.543 --> 00:02:25.540
And, I said no it's not. It's not that 
 hard to do. Just gotta do it. 

00:02:27.435 --> 00:02:29.440
The first one we built we tested it with the short diameter 

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:33.480
it cleaned real well it just didn't reach the bottom of the car.

00:02:35.925 --> 00:02:37.920
He said, I don't know if I can make a mold big enough. 

00:02:38.511 --> 00:02:41.510
He's relentless and he didn't stop and he went 
 and worked with the foam people 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.560
They built a much bigger mold. 

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:50.000
To test that the cloth would work first they  actually welded 
 the foam together to make me the diameter I wanted. 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.360
That brush has been running now a little over 8 months 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.640
Damage free every car - not a wiper not a hood ornament - nothing!

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Just very smooth. Cleaning is incredible. And the noise level 
 has to be cut by at least 50-60%.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.480
You actually almost don't hear it in the vehicle against the 
 noise level  of the other equipment running. 

00:03:08.761 --> 00:03:10.760
It's that nice. 

00:03:14.612 --> 00:03:16.610
Again the nice part about the top brush 
 is #1 how quiet we made it

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.600
without giving up any of the cleaning power.

00:03:19.523 --> 00:03:22.020
With the foam on the windshield you can 
 actually see how the cloth criss crosses

00:03:23.494 --> 00:03:26.690
and wiggles back and forth and just covers every inch of that windshield. 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.890
The eyebrow as well. 

00:03:29.737 --> 00:03:31.740
The extended pieces actually hit the back sides of the mirrors.

00:03:32.976 --> 00:03:34.980
helps clean the mirrors well. 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:44.040
Watchin it go over the roof , the sun roof , you can actually 
 see the same thing where you just know you're gettin 100% coverage.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.360
you're not leaving anything exposed. Or leaving dirt on the vehicle. 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.920
They did some cool things in the way they 
 cut the cloth in the die. 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.360
the little serrated edge. 

00:03:54.919 --> 00:03:56.920
gives it some real nice bite on the surface. 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:01.740
It's gonna revolutionize our top brush. It's gonna make 
 it the best top brush on the market.

00:04:04.584 --> 00:04:06.580
It's now available as standard equipment on our rollover. 

00:04:07.458 --> 00:04:12.460
and it will be the #1 way we want to sell 
 it for our top brushes for the tunnels. 

00:04:13.388 --> 00:04:17.390
You're gonna love this piece. If you have one again 
 . We'll build you a shaft. It's retrofittable. 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:20.220
Just take the old shaft out and drop this 
 new shaft in and hook it up. 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:22.920
The other part, much lighter. 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:27.840
Before one person couldn't carry the two boxes of neoglide 
 it took to make up a top brush. 

00:04:29.244 --> 00:04:33.240
Today when this bursh gets delivered mounted on the shaft we 
 can actually have one person hold this in place. 

00:04:35.122 --> 00:04:37.120
up in the air while they're putting the bolts and hardware to it. 

00:04:37.734 --> 00:04:42.730
The guys were shocked they saw it come in on a palet all big 
 and bushy as it is and they said, it's got to be heavier!

00:04:37.734 --> 00:04:42.730
The guys were shocked they saw it come in on a plaet as 
 big and bushy as it is they said, "it must be heavier!"

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:46.040
We grabbed the palet and we picked up the whole palet 
 and piece together and they said, how can that be?

00:04:48.026 --> 00:04:51.030
the less risk of damage.the happier the customer is.The cleaner the car is. 

00:04:48.157 --> 00:04:50.160
So the lighter it is the more control we have. 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:54.520
and that's what it's all about. 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.440
Again, retrofittable, easy to use, 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.400
all ya gotta do is call Sonny's Direct.com or go on line 

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.760
and you'll be able to get a hold of one of our 
 sales representatives and they'll get you one to put in.
