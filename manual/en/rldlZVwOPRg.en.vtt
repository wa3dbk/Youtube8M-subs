00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:08.940
HTC HD7.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.730
Expected October 2010.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.950
Another Windows Phone 7 handset announced
today, the HTC HD7 comes with a very large

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.820
4.3" 480 x 800 pixel touchscreen and powerful
underpinnings that should make it a very attractive

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.360
handset for power users.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:35.090
In the UK, the HD7 will be exclusive to the
O2 network, and in the US, the HD7 will be

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.720
exclusively available on the T-Mobile network,
although we don't know what arrangements there

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:43.050
are in other parts of the world, but carriers
will be pleased to have this particular phone

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.900
in their line-up.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.760
Most Windows Phone 7 handsets have a very
similar specification, the HD7 comes with

00:00:52.760 --> 00:01:00.970
a 1GHZ Qualcomm Snapdragon processor and 512MB
RAM, 16GB of internal memory, a 5 megapixel

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:09.760
digital camera with HD video recording capabilities,
WiFi and 3.5G support.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.390
Windows Phone 7 is like no other mobile phone
operating system, and it is far too early

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.510
to tell if it will be popular with consumers.
It certainly looks and feels very different

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.580
from the iPhone, and one target market is
likely to be people who don't want to be part

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.370
of the "me too" crowd.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:33.400
One of the closest rivals to this phone will
be from HTC itself - the HTC Desire HD offers

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:39.150
a very similar phone running Android instead
of Windows. Both Samsung and LG are also heavily

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:46.909
committed to the Windows Phone 7 platform,
so expect plenty of competition.

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:55.490
The HTC HD7 measures 122 x 68 x 11mm and weighs
164 grams, almost the same size the Desire

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:03.190
HD and about 20% bigger than a standard touchscreen
smartphone. The battery is a 1230 mAh cell,

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:10.679
which quite a bit smaller than some other
rival Windows Phone 7 handsets.

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:15.960
The HTC HD7 should be available from 21st
October in the UK, exclusively on the O2 network,

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:22.360
and the phone will be free on a £40/month
tariff or £379 for pay-as-you-go customers,

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:26.450
and it should be available on T-Mobile USA
perhaps a little later.
