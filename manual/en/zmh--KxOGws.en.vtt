Hi. This is Marty from Blue Lightning TV.
Do you know that Photoshop ships with a ready-made

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:20.960
rainbow? In case you don't, it's called "Russell's
Rainbow" and I'll show you where to access

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.859
it and a quick, effective way to add it to
your outdoor photos. This is an update to

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.039
a tutorial I did on an earlier version of Photoshop. 

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.020
Open a photo you'd like to add a rainbow to. 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.980
I downloaded this one and the
others from Shutterstock.com. 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.360
The first step is to click the New Layer icon to make a new layer. 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.120
In this empty layer we'll create our

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:56.289
rainbow. Open your Gradient Tool, open your
gradient thumbnails and click the gear icon

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:04.509
to open your list of gradient presets. Click
"Special Effects". When you see this window,

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:09.969
click "Append" to add the Special Effects
preset to the current gradient thumbnails.

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.000
Click the last icon, which is "Russells
Rainbow". Click the "Radial Gradient" icon,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.829
which will give us the arc of the rainbow.
Go to the lower, right corner of your document

00:01:23.829 --> 00:01:29.630
and press and hold Shift as you drag across
the line to approximately where you want the

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.229
outside of your rainbow to end. Then, release.
Pressing Shift, kept the line perfectly horizontal

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:42.469
as you dragged it across. If you want the
rainbow to arc on the opposite side, just

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.669
drag the gradient line from the lower, left
across to the right. 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.360
Go to Filter, Blur and Gaussian Blur.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.140
I'll blur it 50 pixels, however,
depending on the resolution of your photo, you

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:03.509
may want to use a different blur amount.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.740
To make the rainbow blend into the sky better,

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.330
we need to do a few more adjustments. First,
change its blend to "Screen" its

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.900
and reduce opacity between 50 to 70%. 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.460
Since rainbows
gradually disappear as they the closer to

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:32.180
the ground, we'll make our rainbow do that,
as well. Click the Layer Mask icon to make

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:39.960
a layer mask next to the rainbow. Open your
gradient thumbnails and click the "Black,

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:48.560
White" gradient. Click the "Linear Gradient"
icon, go to the bottom of your document, press

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:54.060
and hold Shift and drag up the gradient line
to the top. Then, release. 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.020

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.380
Thanks for watching!
