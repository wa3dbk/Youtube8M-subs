00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:04.460
Okay. Youtubers and Microcurrent fans. 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:12.880
I have my mom's FaceMaster 
and as promised, I'm going to give my review. 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.280
I just turned this on. 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.240
I am in the eye region 
and I crank it all the way up. 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.620
Because for me -- whoa, it's too high. 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.200
Just curious.  

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.440
I'm going to reduce it by about half
 and see if that helped. 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:34.980
I'm still feeling a lot of current 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.660
and when it radiates up my scalp like that 
I wonder if it's true Microcurrent.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.500
Because I never get that sensation 
 with my Jade Microcurrent but let's see. 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:56.620
Then for me, the proof is it happens
 the next day, it's how does my skin look?

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.540
Although I woke up this morning, 
I washed off my Nerium AD 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.840
and my skin's looking better, 
I think than it has in my entire adult life. 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.300
But what happens with microcurrent 
is if it is too high,

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.300
it actually depletes the skin. 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.960
Anything over 500 micro amps 
is going to put the skin into fight off mode.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.280
It's basically trying to, it'll accept 
the current and the muscle will lift 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.040
but it won't be producing anymore 
like collagen production.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.240
It starts to plummet.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.140
I'm sorry about the light in here. 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.840
I've got the window shades open, 
the lights on but it's just a dark room.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:49.600
Anyway, I'm going to do this one eye 
and then we will see what happens here. 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.140
She's a big proponent of holding -- 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.400
this just feels really intense to me 
for some reason 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:11.220
which is not a good sign. 
I'm not sure but it says microcurrent.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:19.860
My mom was also saying that 
this is majorly intense. 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.700
I never get this intensity on my Jade. 
Even if I turned up on high 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:31.900
you feel it but it doesn't have this weird 
wonky pulse-sy thing going on.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.180
Anyway, she advocates holding for 10 seconds. 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.480
The problem with that is anybody over 50,
 you hold for 10 seconds,

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.200
it's like doing three little crunches.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.600
If you're trying to bring in the abdominals,
 you've got to do all these little exercises 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.460
in different ways of bringing in
 those muscles. 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.860
One 10-second hold is not going to do anything 
and even though it's electronic, 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:13.580
it's just hold, hold, hold, hold, hold. 
That's all I got to say and that's what happens.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.260
I don't want to make this tutorial 
forever in a day. 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.560
I can tell you that it feels odd to me. 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:31.620
My mom did give me a about a 10 second -- 
I'm going to do a cheek here.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.620
She gave me about a 10 second tutorial 
on how to use this. 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:45.840
I do like the wands I must say 
but the sensation to me is strong 

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.980
and that's not always great.
 You really shouldn't be able to feel it.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.980
I'm going to turn it more down. 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.600
You shouldn't be able to feel it 
with Microcurrent. 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.960
When you do feel it, it usually means
 it's not true Microcurrent.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:08.080
I'll get the current is not low enough. 

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.520
Anyway, I don't know if you're seeing this. 

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.600
My mom is saying, "Yeah, you can do it every day 
from now into eternity and you only look good 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:24.040
after you've done it solid for weeks and weeks.", 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.760
and I'm like, "Because you're not holding 
long enough. It's the holding, the holding, 

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.820
you really have to hold, hold, hold."

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.380
I'm going to finish this treatment 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:35.940
and I will come back and tell you 
what I thought. 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.240
[laughs] Hold.
