00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:08.440
This is Jim Luke again. This lesson is about
something we call the shuffle; we’ll get

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:14.039
to the shuffle but first we are going to talk
about the train. The train or the Choogle

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:42.310
is a little bit like this.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:50.090
Now, that little train thing is really a breathing
exercise, first of all. And what it also does

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.011
it teaches you timing. Now if you are going
to learn to play that you can start out real

00:00:55.011 --> 00:00:59.670
slow with it, and let’s just break down
the elements and then play them slowly. The

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.691
first thing that happens is you have your
pucker is one, two, three and four draw and

00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:13.619
blow. You are hitting your tongue with the
roof of the mouth to get the separation. Remember

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.350
to keep your lips real loose on the harmonica
to get the best tone. Now once you’ve done

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.860
that; got the harp to your face and you’re
going back and forth here you learn to ultimately

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:36.069
speed it up as you go along. So

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:39.990
now you are moving along quick so what do
we do next? Now we have to blow the whistle.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:51.270
So

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:58.549
you pucker up a little bit; shove the harmonica
up and draw go wah oo wah. That’s the whistle

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:04.560
and that’s a little bit about how to play
the train. So try it out for yourself and

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.270
start Choogling.
