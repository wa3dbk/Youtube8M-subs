00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.149
Hey everybody!  It's time to talk about something tasty.

00:00:12.134 --> 00:00:14.134
Speaking of tasty, beer comes to mind.

00:00:14.443 --> 00:00:16.443
So I would like to introduce to you the next beer.

00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:19.881
The next beer is going to be another Hitachino Nest beer.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.650
Normally, when people think of ginger ale they immediately think 
 of the soda you can buy at stores.

00:00:33.297 --> 00:00:36.297
Except for this beer they actually used real ginger!

00:00:36.713 --> 00:00:38.713
Pretty strange, huh?

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.940
But this is where they put in a little Japanese-ness (wa).

00:00:43.131 --> 00:00:45.131
If you see in the back here...

00:00:45.952 --> 00:00:51.952
...it says that they put ginger roots into the 
 kettle, adding a little spice to the beer.

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:56.129
Then the sweetness (from the malts) and bitterness from the hops mix in together.

00:00:56.842 --> 00:00:58.842
So it's a pretty interesting beer.

00:01:00.084 --> 00:01:02.084
If you read here on the back...

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.430
The ABV is 7%, so it's a bit bigger than the typical beer.

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.950
Oh, it's over here.

00:01:11.959 --> 00:01:13.959
I'm gonna go and open the beer.

00:01:14.664 --> 00:01:20.664
This has been in the fridge for so long, 
 I'm pretty happy to finally drink it.

00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:26.126
That was kind of a strange smell...

00:01:26.541 --> 00:01:32.541
Not really a bad kind of smell, just strange.

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:36.929
So let's first look at the look at the color of the beer.

00:01:37.477 --> 00:01:44.480
It kind of looks like the Japanese Classic Ale 
 that I reviewed from my last video.

00:01:45.535 --> 00:01:48.540
It's orange and is cloudy.

00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:52.720
You can't see through it.

00:01:53.964 --> 00:01:57.960
Well, let me check the aroma of the beer.

00:02:04.668 --> 00:02:09.670
Rather than ginger, it smells like there are some 
 other kinds of spices in the beer.

00:02:09.238 --> 00:02:17.240
Like in a Belgian style beer with various ingredients of spices.

00:02:17.327 --> 00:02:24.330
Also, when you pour it in a glass like this, 
 you can stir it up you do with wine...

00:02:24.554 --> 00:02:33.550
All these bubbles form up here which help you 
 to smell the aroma of the beer.

00:02:35.156 --> 00:02:40.160
It's similar to how a pumpkin ale smells.

00:02:40.737 --> 00:02:43.740
I'm kind of excited to try this beer :)

00:02:43.878 --> 00:02:45.880
Well, why don't I dive right in.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Kind of an unusual taste.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.500
It tastes like how it smells.

00:03:01.434 --> 00:03:03.430
Does that make sense?

00:03:03.832 --> 00:03:09.830
Just like how the beer smells, the taste matches it.

00:03:13.167 --> 00:03:22.170
Like they have in America, it's very similar to the taste of 
 a pumpkin ale.  I think because of the spice.

00:03:22.004 --> 00:03:28.000
But rather than spices, this has ginger in it.

00:03:27.888 --> 00:03:35.890
So the spiciness from the ginger and the sweetness of 
 the beer gives it that, sort of, illusion.

00:03:35.667 --> 00:03:40.670
Rather than mouthfeel, the flavor itself is pretty thick.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.530
So compared to typical beers it's pretty different.

00:03:44.978 --> 00:03:45.980
Oh ya!

00:03:46.162 --> 00:03:49.160
I just happen to have dinner.

00:03:49.217 --> 00:03:52.220
I'm having American style sushi.............I'm sorry.

00:03:53.535 --> 00:03:58.540
It's alright.  I'm thankful that I can buy sushi here.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.980
Anyways, it happen to come with ginger!

00:04:03.647 --> 00:04:06.950
So I can try a little pairing here.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
First, I will try the ginger.

00:04:10.683 --> 00:04:13.680
Excuse me for using my fingers.

00:04:16.464 --> 00:04:20.460
Next, I will pair it with the beer.

00:04:26.973 --> 00:04:33.970
It's like the spiciness from the ginger I 
 had and the ginger in here matched.

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:40.970
It's not bad.  I'm gonna give it another try.

00:04:40.242 --> 00:04:42.240
Ginger....

00:04:41.774 --> 00:04:43.770
Excuse me for my poor manners.

00:04:43.691 --> 00:04:48.690
But afterall, it IS my channel.  So, Eh-yanka (Osaka 
 dialect for IT'S OK and WHO CARES combined).

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000
Oh, I don't think it doesn't work.

00:05:00.945 --> 00:05:05.940
It actually works.  I'm surprised!

00:05:07.966 --> 00:05:11.970
If you can buy this there in Japan, definitely give it a try.

00:05:12.912 --> 00:05:14.910
Where's the bottle?  Oh it's here.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:27.720
You won't be able to buy this at a normal store, but if you go to 
 a beer specialty store, you would find it.  Definitely give it a try!

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.500
I don't think it's a bad beer at 
 all.  In fact, it's pretty good.

00:05:34.019 --> 00:05:38.020
Just like the last Japanese Classic Ale, I think they're at the same level.

00:05:39.834 --> 00:05:42.830
Thank you for watching again.

00:05:43.213 --> 00:05:47.210
I will see you in the next beer blog.
