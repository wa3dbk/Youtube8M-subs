Hey everyone, I'm Tara Stiles and welcome
to the Livestrong Woman channel.

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:21.249
So today, I'm going to show you how to make
snicker doodles.

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:24.519
And snicker doodles, for me, has a really
happy place in my heart.

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:28.579
My aunt Sharon and my cousin Sheila and I
used to get together, every time I went over

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:29.899
to their house, and made these.

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:32.870
So this is a more non-dairy version.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.989
So we're gonna give it a try and see how it
goes.

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.120
So we'll use some pastry flour or almond flour,
that should work too.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.289
Some corn starch.

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:41.670
Gonna have some butter.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.320
I've got this Earth Balance butter.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:50.190
Gonna have some sugar, some almond milk, some
vanilla extract, some cinnamon, and some baking

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.190
powder.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.410
And then to make it all snicker doodle-y,
we're gonna have some sugar and cinnamon to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:55.410
roll it in.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.149
So first thing we do is we take our flour,
get it in there.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.890
And we take our corn starch, put that in there
too.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.730
And our baking powder.

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.750
So all of these dry ingredients together.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.860
And we're just gonna combine these with a
spoon.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.320
So get these all combined.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.860
Nice little stir.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.130
Alright-y.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.620
So that's looking pretty even there.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:26.570
And I set this aside, and we're gonna get
to our butter now.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.400
So we're gonna have our bigger dish.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.580
And you're gonna need a whisk or a fork.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.110
If you have very aggressive fork patterns,
you can do that too.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.710
Or beater or too.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.710
But I've softened this up a little bit, so
this should be pretty easy to combine.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.420
So we got our butter, and let's see if we
can kinda get in there and mush it up a bit.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.300
And we're gonna add our sugar to the mix.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.470
So here we go.

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:05.380
Kinda just get in there with your beaters,
your fork, and get everything all situated.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.119
You might need some attention, especially
if you're not using a beater.

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.780
You can do this with a fork, I'm sure, or
your hands if you get really into it.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.840
So this is actually working.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:20.660
There we go.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.480
So you'll see when it starts to look combined
because it's just the butter connecting and

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.530
mushing together with the sugar.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.750
We are combining.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.210
Alright, so we've combined our butter and
our sugar.

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:39.600
And once that's all smooth, you can toss in
your almond milk and your vanilla extract.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.500
And combine again.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.210
So we're combining the sugar, the butter,
the almond milk, and the vanilla extract.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:54.960
And then we're going to combine in the rest
of our dry ingredients -- so the flour, corn

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.960
starch, and the baking powder.

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:05.920
So kinda just combine this together.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.690
It's kinda better without a beater because
you get an arm workout too.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.970
So we're gonna keep going with this.

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.970
Don't stop too soon.

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:26.850
You wanna keep going until it's all combined
and it really starts to look like cookie batter,

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.230
no flour left.

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:34.890
Have faith, it'll work out -- as long as you
follow the ingredients in the recipe.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.480
Okay, so this is working out.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.510
Getting a nice little, you know, bicep-tricep-action
going on here.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.130
Okay, so this is looking pretty darn good.

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:50.520
Alright, so now is the really, really fun
part.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:55.540
You going to get some sugar and put some cinnamon
in the bowl, mix it up.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.850
And this is the part that my cousin Sheila
and I would always love to do -- was make

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.920
little balls out of this, because you get
to roll it with your hand, and that's really

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.130
fun.

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.770
And then we got to do this part, which was
dump it in here.

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.250
I know why I never got to do that part, because
that's the hard part.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.069
If you we're a little kid, maybe it would
be more frustrating.

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.820
But, okay, so there we go.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.819
Just like aunt Sharon used to make, or she
still does.

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:25.560
I just don't get to go home as often, unfortunately.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.080
And there we go.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.559
So these are going to be amazing.

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:37.020
We'll roll them up, get them in there.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.990
Okay, so our snicker doodles are ready to
go in the oven at 350 degrees for about 15

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.990
to 20 minutes.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.229
Make sure you check on them to see how they're
doing.

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:48.490
Okay, here we go.

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.490
Okay, so we're ready for our snicker doodles.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:51.830
Let's check them out.

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:57.099
Alright-y, here we go.

00:04:57.099 --> 00:04:58.780
And they look pretty darn good.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.729
Oh my goodness.

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:01.729
These came out great.

00:05:01.729 --> 00:05:04.520
I think my aunt Sharon would be really proud.

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.660
So let's see if we can give one a taste.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.790
Make sure you let your snicker doodles cool
a little bit.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.389
So we'll blow on it.

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.240
So good.

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.000
Really, really good.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.759
See you later.
