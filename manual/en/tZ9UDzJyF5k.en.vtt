00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:08.683
Should I learn Java or C++ for games?

00:00:08.683 --> 00:00:11.423
I can't figure out which is better.

00:00:11.423 --> 00:00:15.262
Java wins hands down for web development and
web based games.

00:00:15.262 --> 00:00:20.143
I’m thinking of more than creating, cute
but addictive Flash games.

00:00:20.143 --> 00:00:23.943
C++ is better for embedded applications.

00:00:23.943 --> 00:00:29.272
If you write the game in Java, you or the
operating system will use C++ to control the

00:00:29.272 --> 00:00:31.023
audio and video.

00:00:31.023 --> 00:00:32.133
Why?

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:38.403
C++ is regularly used for audio drivers, controlling
a video card and otherwise generating the

00:00:38.403 --> 00:00:40.773
sound and feel of a game.

00:00:40.773 --> 00:00:43.003
C++ is hard.

00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:45.363
Java is popular with newbies.

00:00:45.363 --> 00:00:48.343
Much to the detriment of the users.

00:00:48.343 --> 00:00:52.243
Java code is easy to maintain, which is also
known as fix.

00:00:52.243 --> 00:00:56.822
That’s what you get for a programming language
eight out of ten programmers would recommend

00:00:56.822 --> 00:00:58.403
teaching kids.

00:00:58.403 --> 00:01:03.662
I heard that C++ has a lot more functionality,
but that is only because it has been around

00:01:03.662 --> 00:01:06.213
for thirty or so years.

00:01:06.213 --> 00:01:07.732
Java has better libraries.

00:01:07.732 --> 00:01:12.223
That’s one reason why it is popular with
new programmers.

00:01:12.223 --> 00:01:17.043
They can easily rely on libraries to find
code modules instead of having to write their

00:01:17.043 --> 00:01:18.043
own.

00:01:18.043 --> 00:01:21.653
And Java is good for embedding scripts in
a larger application.

00:01:21.653 --> 00:01:25.953
Yeah, using C++ to control the hardware.

00:01:25.953 --> 00:01:32.253
Some of the top 3D games are written in C++
because C++ is faster than Java and is the

00:01:32.253 --> 00:01:36.022
only way the graphics can keep up with the
game player.

00:01:36.022 --> 00:01:37.843
So what do I do?

00:01:37.843 --> 00:01:41.853
Learn Java because it is easier and can get
you into coding.

00:01:41.853 --> 00:01:48.853
Learn C++ over time to get better game performance
and, eventually, development of high end games.

00:01:48.853 --> 00:01:53.503
Or I could learn JavaScript and Flash for
those cute, addictive games you see for free

00:01:53.503 --> 00:01:55.132
or a dollar a download.

00:01:55.132 --> 00:02:00.053
You’ll live in your parents basement coding
games instead of playing them.

00:02:00.053 --> 00:02:03.783
Learn Java or C++ or both to actually make
a living in gaming.
