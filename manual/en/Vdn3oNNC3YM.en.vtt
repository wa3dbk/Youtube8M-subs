00:00:24.265 --> 00:00:27.652
Lots of little details on the windows and live music.

00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:28.790
You can't beat that.

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:29.915
(live acoustic guitar music)

00:00:29.915 --> 00:00:34.187

(live acoustic guitar music)

00:00:42.246 --> 00:00:43.905
And the floating homes are so cute.

00:00:43.905 --> 00:00:47.097
You can actually only see them from the water.

00:00:47.097 --> 00:00:52.150
(live acoustic guitar music)

00:00:54.254 --> 00:00:56.654

00:00:56.654 --> 00:00:59.722

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.414
They have slow roasted sirloin beef

00:01:06.414 --> 00:01:08.714
and fresh British Columbia salmon.

00:01:08.714 --> 00:01:11.921
Time to dig in, looks so good.

00:01:11.921 --> 00:01:14.122
Mmm, I love it.

00:01:14.122 --> 00:01:16.012
What's great is they have an all you can eat buffet

00:01:16.012 --> 00:01:18.299
and there's plenty to choose from for desert.

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.555
Don't mind if I do.

00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:21.945

Stanley Park, let's go check out the wheelhouse

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:27.462
and meet the captain.

00:01:27.462 --> 00:01:28.715
Hello.

00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:31.182
- One of the most beautiful aspects of Vancouver

00:01:31.182 --> 00:01:35.298
is from the water and you cannot see that on a street corner

00:01:35.298 --> 00:01:37.423
and you cannot see that from a hotel room.

00:01:37.423 --> 00:01:40.465
- I feel like a real captain, ahoy.

00:01:40.465 --> 00:01:42.053
- Seeing Vancouver from the boat

00:01:42.053 --> 00:01:43.621
was a totally different experience

00:01:43.621 --> 00:01:45.769
and I can't wait to do it again.

00:01:45.769 --> 00:01:48.369
- The music was great, the food was delicious,

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.471
and the views were spectacular.

00:01:50.471 --> 00:01:53.550
Rain or shine, this was just such a magical way

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.662
to see Vancouver.
