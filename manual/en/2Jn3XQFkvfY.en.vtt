Hi this is Julie with Beadaholique.com and today I want to bring your attention

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.960
to a product that is available on the
market called Anti-Tarnish Pads and we

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.000
get a lot of questions here at Beadaholique.com
about

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.650
jewelry tarnishing particularly silver
jewelry and why it happens and what you

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.039
can do about it

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.989
jewelry tarnishes for a lot of different
reasons it can depend upon the different

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.669
lotions you have on, body oils, perfumes,
the amount of time you're wearing a piece,

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.780
its exposure to the air. There's a whole
different factors but there is something that

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.770
can help to slow down the tarnishing process

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:41.870
as these paper tabs

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.530
so what they do is they absorb moisture and other atmospheric

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.510
dangers which are gonna lead to your
jewelry becoming tarnished

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.630
they come in a couple different sizes. We
have these long sheets. We have these little one inch

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.350
squares and with the one inch squares you get
twenty of them

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:59.480
and what you'll do is you'll take one

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.210
and you're going to put it into a sealed
container. I have a zip lock bag here it

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:09.410
It could be a box, it could be any type of sealed
airtight container

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.610
and you just drop your piece of
silver jewelry in with it

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.930
get rid of the air

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.620
and seal it up

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.710
and one little tab is going to last
for about six months and cover

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.690
approximately thirty cubic inches of air
which is about a three inch box

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.350
so once you've done this you're just
gonna go ahead put it in your drawer or some

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.340
dark safe place not exposed to the light
and just when you wanna wear it you

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.090
just pull it out and then when you're
done you put it back in. When you're not

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.420
using you tabs make sure you put them in
an air tight until you're ready to use

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.260
them

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:49.380
and one final important quick note is
that these paper tabs are non-toxic and

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.870
they do not have any chemical residues
so they're safe to use

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:57.000
A little product here if you're having a lot of
troubles with your jewelry tarnishing

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.899
just keep this in mind and that there
is something out there for you to use

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.619
that's quick and easy and inexpensive. That
really does help to prevent the tarnishing
