00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.130
So Eric we're talking about practicing the
presence of God, experiencing His presence.

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:20.150
And you mentioned that one of the major issues
is distractions.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:21.150
Yes.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.250
How do we get rid of distractions in prayer?

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.840
I use two "R" words, remove and refuse.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.779
I remove my attention from everything and
give it to Him.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.370
And then I sustain it there by refusing entrance
of other attentions.

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.760
And so that really helps me a lot as a thing
that I like to do that really helps me when

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.900
I have a thought come up.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.059
I say, "Shh" and it really helps.

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:48.549
One of the most powerful things the Holy Spirit
ever said to me in prayer was, "Shh."

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.430
Because I had all these things going on.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.660
You see, there's stillness that's external;
then there's also stillness that's internal.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.760
Stillness that's external is removing yourself
from the noise of life, while stillness that's

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.120
internal is removing yourself from the internal
noise of your own mind, and your own anxieties

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.510
and things like this.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:07.510
And how do you do that?

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.930
I mean let's say you're going through a very
difficult time.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.170
Maybe there's financial pressure or whatever.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.620
How, how do you keep those things from just
pressing in and barging in?

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:18.620
Right.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.410
I think David is the one that we look at for,
for key devotional keys, or bullet points.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.140
"To you, oh God, I lift up my soul."

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.080
"I will lift up mine eyes to the hills."

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.580
It's pulling your attention away from the
things that are here and giving your attention

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.660
to Him.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.790
That's why he says, "I lift up mine eyes,"
away from the Earth.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.080
And this is what has to happen.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.940
A lot of times our eyes are here at ourselves.

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.460
We have to remove them from ourselves and
the Earth and look unto God.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.210
Lord, I choose to look at you.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.210
This is the issue.

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.620
And once a man begins to look at the beauty
of the Lord he's blinded to all the distractions

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.690
of self and this life.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:57.450
So that's how a man does it: remove and refuse.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.870
Remove your attention and refuse the entrance
of attention.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.560
And look unto Jesus, the author and the finisher
of your faith.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.100
You make this sound really easy.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.100
Yeah.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.100
Is it, is it easy for you?

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.140
Well it is very easy.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.220
I think the only difficulty is thinking that
it's not easy.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.810
Yeah, so it's, it's very easy.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.770
I mean Jesus says, "You know, my yoke is easy,
you know my burden is light."

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:22.700
The thing that makes it so difficult is that
we have thought it's more than what it really

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:23.700
is.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.670
It really is just simply looking to Him.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.090
Just as I look to you right now, I'm giving
my attention to you, it's the same way.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:32.230
Even as I talk to you I can have my attention
upon Jesus.

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.200
A man can be in a meeting, listening to the
meeting and totally present but at the same

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:37.209
time looking at Jesus.

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.640
As a matter of fact the soul was made to do
everything while looking at Jesus.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.220
A lot of people think, "I've got a lot of
stuff going on and I've got a lot of things

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.760
I have to do, and because of this there's
no way I can give my attention to God."

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.700
They fail to realize that the soul is made
by God to look at God, and be empowered by

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.400
God, to please God and glorify Him in the
Earth.

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.660
So this is the issue: I can look at Jesus;
it's very easy.

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.130
And I can -- I can keep my gaze upon Him,
and from there receive or extract strength

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.040
to be able to live my life.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.310
We have a saying, a popular saying that somebody
can -- is so heavily minded that they're no

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:11.530
earthly good.

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.860
What I hear you saying is the more heavenly
minded the more earthly good?

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.980
Yeah because everything's enriched by God,
by His presence.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.980
And empowered.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.980
Powered, yeah.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.530
But how, you know, I've never asked you this
before, so I may be putting you on the spot

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.140
here but what you're saying is very good in
theory, right?

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.209
And that's what most people are going to say:
"Yeah, that sounds really good, theologically

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.120
sound, makes sense."

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:38.879
"Except when I'm going through something really
difficult, and the theory has to be put into

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.629
practice then it doesn't work so smoothly."

00:03:43.629 --> 00:03:48.910
Have you had to put this into practice in
your own life during a season of turmoil or

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.120
where the pressures of life really were trying
to overwhelm you?

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.760
Yeah, as a matter of fact I find that the
most difficulties in this life have to do

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:59.440
with how self-centered I am, and how self-conscious
I am.

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.970
So it gets harder and harder the more pressures
of life try to make you look at yourself and

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:06.780
look at this life.

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:14.420
But when you can pull yourself away from those
things, in exact proportion to the difficulty,

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.100
He will give you comfort.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.209
And that's, that's where He shines brightest
is when it's darkest.

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:24.830
So what I hear you saying is when, when we're
in those seasons of difficulty and darkness

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:29.020
and pressure the temptation is to put our
focus on those things.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.479
But actually the more we put our focus on
them the more difficult they become.

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:33.500
Yes, definitely.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.360
But what you're saying is the thing that seems
counterintuitive, which is taking our attention

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.449
off of them, putting it on Jesus makes the
burden lighter.

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:40.449
Right.

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:44.499
And makes even going through the trial easier
as we focus on Him.

00:04:44.499 --> 00:04:46.370
Yeah, most definitely, yes.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.139
And that's what Jesus is showing us when He
says, "Salvation."

00:04:49.139 --> 00:04:51.539
David calls God actually "Salvation".

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:53.479
Several times he says, "You are my salvation."

00:04:53.479 --> 00:04:55.270
Other times he says, "My salvation."

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.020
He actually names Him "Salvation."

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:03.719
Salvation is being delivered out of a life
that does not have His presence.

00:05:03.719 --> 00:05:05.139
That's what salvation is.

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:07.129
He's called us to Himself.

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:11.539
So really what God has given to us through
the shedding of His blood is a reconciliation.

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:16.830
The ripping of the veil and entrance into
Himself, so that man can dwell there and live

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.830
there.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.360
And so this is what salvation actually is.

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.159
And if He does -- if He does not have the
power to deliver us out from the oppressions

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:29.729
of this life then what is salvation if it
is not delivered out from a life apart from

00:05:29.729 --> 00:05:33.119
His presence and into a life that lives with
his presence?
