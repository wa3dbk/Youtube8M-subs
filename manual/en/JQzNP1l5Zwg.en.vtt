them when they can at that point it was

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:37.009
like an embarrassing thing at a
standstill ballot to early and a member

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:41.409
of doubt the needs like that uh... today
still on the other hand it can also be

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:42.550
an insecurity

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.860
to me i wouldn't read for the

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.840

there's only so long you cannot look at
something doesn't need to legal

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.160

about them making that decision and

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:21.099
obviously being responsible category may
not like the reared like new

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:25.150
