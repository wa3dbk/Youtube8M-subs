00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:12.700
Merry Christmas and Happy Holidays Food Tubers.
It's DJ BBQ here and winter time, snow, cold,

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:22.000
cold to the bone. Everybody's ill man it just
sucks. You know what? Screw that man! There's

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.000
parts of this world where it's like sunny
man!

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.349
The southern hemisphere. Australasia, our antipodean brethren. You
guys have got the sun, you guys have got the

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:35.190
BBQ's out, so we're going to throw a BBQ pool
party in your honour. We're going to do a

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.859
coke ham with winterslaw. It's going to be
radonkulous.

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:44.059
Ah director, I need my suntan lotion, thank
you very. You know what screw it! Santa Claus

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:50.710
doesn't need suntan lotion I've got chucklebutt
and I have a ham! Let's do this whoo!!

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.999
Four kilos, unsmoked gammon joint and now
we're just going to think Christmassy thoughts,

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:04.000
starting with cinammon. One, two, beautiful
cloves. Three dried chillies. Excuse me while

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.770
I dance, ha ha! Get in there guys sorry. And
then we'll have some star anise. Whoo!

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.770
We've also got some lovely thyme, so we're
going to throw some nice woody stalks in there.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.220
A bay leaf.
Now, what else screams Christmas guys? Clementines,

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.130
good call! Let's chop a clementine and throw
one side there and another there. Coca Cola.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.710
Let's go. You basically want to cover it up.
Don't freak out, that we're putting coke on

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.270
this ham. Sometime when you do this to your
gammon joint you use water to get the salts

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.380
out. We're kind of doing the same thing but
we're adding all these beautiful flavours

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.880
from the coca cola, it's going to be awesome.
I do this every year around Christmas time

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.870
So now we're going to cover the gammon with
some aluminium foil. Now if you're in chillier

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:56.280
climates you can do the same recipe on your
stove, finish it off in the oven.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.390
But we're celebrating our summer barbecue
pool party. So we're going to do it on the

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.100
grill here. We're going to give it two and
a half to three hours. Now what am I going

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.100
to do with all that time?

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.800
Whoo hoo! Good times man. Let's check her

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.060
out. So this joint has had two and half, three
hours on the barbecue. The coca cola has evaporated

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.939
and infused itself into that gammon joint
which is no longer gammon, it is now ham!

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:36.959
And she looks gorgeous. This Christmas ham
is like the best present ever and we need

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:42.700
to decorate it with some awesome flavour.
And that flavour is going to be marmalade.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:47.519
So we're going to heat it up on the barbecue
so it'll be really easy to glaze. So this

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.310
is the rind. We don't want the rind. We just
want the fat, so we'll just get rid of this

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.650
bit here.
We've got the rind off, now we're going to

00:02:53.650 --> 00:03:00.650
score into the fat because I want to get sharp,
sugary marmalade into the meat. Man I love

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.900
Christmas! How good does this look! Christmas
isn't Christmas without like some cloves right?

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.799
More Christmassy flavour, goodness. I'm making
a mess, I've got a year to clean this up.

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:17.680
I'm Santa Claus dude. I write the naughty
list. Our ham is beautifully decorated, it's

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:23.079
time to get her back on the barbecue. So we're
going to through it here on the indirect side.

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:28.299
I've got some beautiful mi skeet wood chips.
I've got some chunks of cherry wood in there

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:33.719
because what the wood smoke does is that it
gives meat that beautiful mahogany colour.

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:38.129
The ham needs about another 25 to 30 minutes
at a hot heat, which gives us time to make

00:03:38.129 --> 00:03:43.829
our winter slaw. And like Santa Claus needs
Rudolph, I need a side to go with my Christmas

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.680
ham. So let's do this!
We start with cabbage, I'm going to use a

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.939
quarter of this bad boy. So I'm going to chop
this up nice and thin. I want some colour

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:57.430
to of with that so I'm going to use some red
cabbage. Next up it's carrots turn. Boom,

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.430
they go on. Next a beetroot. It's striped
beetroot. Done!

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.299
We're going to throw an apple into the mix,
fennel. Join the party dudes. We've got mayonnaise,

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:17.700
two heaping spoonful's of that. Boom! We're
going to do one heaping spoonful of yoghurt.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:24.000
I'm always thinking mustard and ham, so I'm
going to go with a teaspoon of English mustard. We're going to

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.930
throw a splash of cider vinegar in that and
then some olive oil. Season her with some

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:36.930
freshly cracked pepper and some sea salt.
Spring onions and pomegranate. bad pomegranate!

00:04:37.319 --> 00:04:44.319
And coriander. We're going to get all these
flavours to hang out. Ah that is good! And

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:51.560
we have got the perfect sweet tasting side
to go with our coke ham. Can I please get

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:58.360
some angels to sing? Here we go!
How food does that look? Ah man that marmalade

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:05.319
is caramelised the fat layer. This is perfectly
cooked. My mouth is watering and I'm sure

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:10.840
you're is too!
Look, before we dig in man, have you guys subscribed

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:17.840
to food tube? If you haven't, why not? Santa
Claus says subscribe to food tube, it's free!

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.370
The lovely bit s of caramel and sugar from
the coke have soaked into that gammon joint.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:30.370
The marmalade and a bit of sweet smoke, and
a lovely crunchy slaw! Man I'm drooling here,

00:05:30.479 --> 00:05:40.200
apologies man! Aww. That it so good and then
our coleslaw! That's summer Christmas right

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.720
