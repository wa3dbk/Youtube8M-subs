Hey guys, Jess here WoW Update!

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:09.730
This episode has been sponsored by Blizzard.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.370
Patch 5.4 has just dropped, so we wanted to
bundle up all the info we have into one nice

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.670
and tidy bundle, just for you.

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.199
First up, just wanted to mention that the
WoWDB Modelviewer is about to get reworked!

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.710
So if you're sick of seeing armor set previews
on the human male, you'll seen be able to

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.210
preview them on different races as well - the
new version is in beta, but you can click

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.340
the link to MMO-Champ in the description below
to try it out for yourself.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.280
Now onto the 5.4 info - starting with some
info about how Valor and Justice points will

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:41.750
work in the new patch.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.421
Both Valor Points and Justice points will
be kept when patch 5.4 goes live - Valor points

00:00:46.421 --> 00:00:48.899
will not be reset or rolled down to Justice
points.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.840
However, Accumulated Conquest Points will
be converted to Honor Points.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.239
Also, Justice points will now be used to purchase
items that formerly cost Valor, excluding

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.359
the Shado-Pan Assault items.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.270
There will be no new Valor gear added but
you can use Valor to upgrade your gear or

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.949
to purchase Timeless Coins.

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.120
The heirlooms that drop from Garrosh will
function between levels 90 and 100.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.420
The first heirloom weapon that drops for you
will be for your current loot spec, but afterwards

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.670
it will be random.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.830
These weapons are not available in LFR difficulty
level.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.509
In order to queue for Siege of Orgrimmar LFR,
players must have an item level of 496 or

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.509
better.

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:25.790
the drop rate of loot from kills and bonus
rolls has been increased for Mogu'shan Vaults,

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:30.360
Heart of Fear, Terrace of Endless Spring,
and Throne of Thunder on Raid Finder difficulty.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.810
The chance for awarding loot from using a
bonus roll has been increased for Throne of

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.150
Thunder on Normal difficulty.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.770
Epic quality gems will NOT be available in
5.4

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.619
Base Resilience was increased to 72% from
65% and Battle Fatigue was increased to 55%,

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:46.630
up from 45%.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:52.619
PvE gear will be scaled down to 496 in Battlegrounds,
Rated Battlegrounds, and Arenas with the cap

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.790
increasing by 1 every week.

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:59.729
Conquest point amounts from winning random
battleground have been increased by 50%.

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.700
Arena teams no longer exist, so you can play
with any of your friends.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.360
Each player will have a personal rating that
increase or decrease based on victories and

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.810
defeats against other rated opponents.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.519
Opponents will be selected based on the average
Match Making Rating of the party.

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.510
This means that the Arena ladder is now region
wide.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.579
You can queue for multiple LFR wings at once,
and LFR now has the Call to Arms feature that

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.139
gives a
reward to a badly needed role

00:02:24.139 --> 00:02:28.019
Ordos is the new "hard" world boss, and you
need the new legendary cloak to access him

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.490
Celestials are the easy world boss, there
are 4, you can kill all 4 every week, but

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.690
you only get loot from the first kill.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.040
Patch 5.4 will connect low population realms
into groups to form a single Connected Realm.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.180
Players from the other realms will be treated
as if they were on your realm, so you can

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.880
trade, raid, and join guilds with the other
players.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.049
This gives all the benefits of server merges
without having to give up your character or

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:52.320
guild names, and faction balance will be taken
into account as much as possible.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:55.660
The patch will also add a new Flexible Raid
Diffuclty.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:59.489
- Bring anywhere from 10 to 25 people to your
raid and the difficulty will automatically

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:03.100
scale, and it works with battletags, so you
can bring friends from other realms.

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:08.579
It has a separate lockout from Raid Finder
and Normal, allowing you to do all three difficulties.

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.229
Another new feature is proving grounds, a
way for players to practice new specs and

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:16.820
get better at their current spec in an environment
that doesn't inconvenience other players.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.739
There are four difficulties: Bronze, Silver,
Gold, and Endless.

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.889
Endless just keeps getting harder every wave
and your highest Endless score is stored as

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:27.269
a statistic.

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:32.209
DPS must kill of the enemy mobs in the time
allotted while dealing with different PvE

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:34.549
mechanics such as kiting and stuns.

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:38.110
Tanks must protect a single healer NPC while
dealing with different PvE mechanics like

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.600
knockbacks and fire, and healers must keep
a party of NPCs alive while dealing with different

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:43.970
PvE mechanics like dispelling.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:47.340
Some of the NPCs even like to stand in the
fire!

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.700
Moving on to armor - MMO-Champ posted previews
of the Tier 16 and Season 14 armor sets, so

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.419
we'll link those in the description - also
we got a look at the Dark Shaman cosmetic

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:01.120
armor set - it drops off mobs in Flex, Normal,
and Heroic difficulty settings of Siege of

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.120
Orgrimmar.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:06.519
Garrosh has a new model - it has a lot of
bones and facial animation tha tcould be similar

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.239
to what we see in new character models,a nd
provides a nice test case to see if players

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.400
would want their Orc character to look lik
ethat.

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:16.440
MMO-Champion put together a handly little
Legendary Cloak Guide - if you're already

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.850
caught up on the quest line, you can get your
cloak in an hour or so your first raid night

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.170
by using this guide!

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:26.660
There are also tons of Timeless Isle guides
posted on MMO-Champ - there are guides for

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:30.030
chests, events and rare spawns, vanity items,
and more!

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.290
Additionally, 5.4 adds Speaker Gulan - he
sells you a Censer of Eteranl Agony, which

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:39.540
allows you to become hostile to all players
including your faction, and kill them for

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.720
Bloody Coins, which are used to purchase several
items, including a mount.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.220
As for World Changes, the Vale of Eternal
Blossoms has been drained dry of any water,

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:51.160
and corruption has spread across most of the
Vale.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:55.460
This damage included the destruction of the
Golden Pagoda, so you won't be able to do

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.870
the Golden Lotus daily quests anymore.

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:02.520
Moonfang is a new boss added to teh Darkmoon
Faire in patch 5.4 - he drops a new mount,

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.880
pet, transmog weapon, and a few novelty items.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:10.170
The latest dev interviews posted on MMO-Champ
had some interesting information, for instance

00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:14.480
the new character models are apparentlya bout
20 or 25% done.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.450
And finally, we just wanted to show off for
you guys a couple of the awesome new mounts,

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.500
battle pets, and cosmetic glyphs in 5.4.

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:23.660
You can check the posts on MMO-Champion for
the full list of videos and images of the

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:29.950
new content, but here are some of the coolest
looking ones, such as the Sky Golem Mount

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:32.560
and the Kor'Kron Juggernaut

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.130
That's all we have for you this time, but
as always be sure to subscribe to Curse and

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:37.210

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.210

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:39.000
Enjoy the game.
