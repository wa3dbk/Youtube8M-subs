00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.120
So your third graders get ready to start school.
Let's see what they need to know. Hi! I'm

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.341
Debbie Noah and I'm here to hopefully help
you, give you some tips. For your third grader,

00:00:09.341 --> 00:00:14.940
to have a positive, smooth first day of school.
Most third graders, usually by the time they're

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.410
in third grade. They know the lay of the land.
However, your attitude and how you approach

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.590
things. Will certainly help them have a great
first day. Talking positively about school,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.070
talking about what's going to happen. They're
pretty much, going to know, what's what. But

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.980
they're still going to have a new schedule,
they're going to have new teachers. So that's

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.190
real important to just talk about it, a little
bit. Start the week before, in getting them

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.489
in their night time routine. Get them in bed
early. They're not going to want to. But you

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:48.120
better make them do it in getting up early.
Practice that for about a week. I promise

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.031
you, it's going to make your life a lot easier
on that first day. Going and buying supplies.

00:00:53.031 --> 00:00:58.329
There's lots of opportunities for buying school
supplies. You go to the school's website,

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.210
they'll tell you what third graders need.
You can go to the school office, they have

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.280
a list. You can go to your local stores, they
usually have a list. But my personal favor

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:13.130
is buying the school supplies that are pre-packaged.
Many schools these days, offer this to families.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.890
They have everything that each grade needs,
inside here. It saves you fifty trips to the

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.150
store. And it just makes life a lot easier.
Because it has everything in here, teacher

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:29.630
has requested. Of course, a good hefty backpack
is important. By the time they're in third

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.810
grade, a lot of them like to buy their lunch.
But still they probably need a lunch box.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.420
Just in case they don't want to buy their
lunch. They're going to need things like a

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.780
good binder, spiral note books. Pocket folders,
the usual glue, pencils and supplies like

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.250
that. It's very important that you talk to
your third grader about, third grade's going

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.890
to be harder. It's a pretty hard grade. They
need to be ready for it and meet the challenge.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:01.759
Don't forget to go meet the teacher now. It's
very important, even for third graders. I'm

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:05.689
Debbie Noah and I know your third grader's
going to have a super first day of school.
