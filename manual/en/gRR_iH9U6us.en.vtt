00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:07.950
now this believe it or not is a new
version the VW Polo

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.950
don't feel too bad if you can't tell the differences from out here though 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.090
most of them are tucked away inside or out of site

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:22.710
some of the most important changes are to
the Polo's

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.700
engine line-up, Volkswagen has now
brought in a host of small

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.810
efficient petrol engines and two of these are the

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.650
one-litre versions that you get in the
even smaller Volkswagen

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:38.130
Up city car. As you'd expect these
engines are only really best

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.590
if you're going to be spending most your time driving
around town.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:45.830
They do get up to speed on the motorway and are quite happy once they've got there but

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:48.980
getting that does take quite a bit at a
time and effort

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.739
so if you wanna go a higher-speed a little
bit more often

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.570
then you better off with the engine
that's in this car and that is the 1.2

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.420
petrol engine. Now this is the eighty-nine
brake horsepower version

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.640
it's a bit of a strange one; there's nothing wrong with the engine per se, it's just that

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.650
Volkswagen's gonna replace it before too
long with a turbocharged one-litre

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:08.480
petrol

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.890
in the meantime, this engine is smooth, it's
efficient and it's quite happy

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.030
to overtake with more than one person on-board

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.330
now it's fair to say that the Polo has
never really,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.799
in any of its versions being that
dynamic a car to drive.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.229
Now Volkswagen has looked to address
that with this car and they've lowered the

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:28.619
suspension by a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:32.780
few millimeters and it's does actually help
a bit; it's made it a little bit more composed

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.920
going around corners.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.930
Unfortunately, when you lower suspension, it can
have an adverse effect

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:42.439
on the right and that is what's happened
here. It's just that little bit more jittery

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:43.670
than it was before.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.609
In any case the steering is still a
little bit vague to be honest, a bit numb,

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:49.109
so

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.299
never gonna be that much of a sharp,
responsive, hot-hatch.

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.670
But one thing that is absolutely
brilliant

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.810
for a small car, because you don't normally  get much in the way of sound deadening

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.770
in cars like this, is the noise on the
move, there's just barely any of it. There's not

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.979
much the way road noise, wind noise

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.750
and it's just really relaxed in here.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.250
Now if there's one thing that will really
sell the Polo to people

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.390
that is this cabin. It just feels so much
more grown-up and posh then all of its  rivals

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.310
and that is thanks

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.210
mainly to all these really lovely feeling
materials around here, they just feel so

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.950
soft and

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.810
so much better than the ones you get in the likes of the Fiesta but

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.620
even better than that, is this
touchscreen.

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.630
Now on the basic version you get a you more simple

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.530
five-inch screen and that's a little bit
slower to respond, a bit fiddly when it

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.510
comes to pressing some of the smaller
buttons

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:45.440
but from SE trim in and above, you get this
six-and-a-half

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.670
inch screen, which is just so much better
than anything else that Ford

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.150
Vauxhall and the like have produced so far. It is

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.690
responsive, it's quick, it's the latest
version that VW have put any their

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.400
cars and it's

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.150
absolutely brilliant. It's also really easy
to get comfy in the cabin

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.750
every single Polo, even the cheapest one,
has a steering wheel that goes

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.140
up and down, and in and out, and it also
has a driver's seat that goes

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.280
up and down as well, so know matter how
tall or short you are, you should be able

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.049
to find a

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.400
decent driving position. It's also very easy to see

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:23.959
out to this car; there's good visibility
all-round and the car's boxy shape

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:24.950
actually works

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:28.430
in its favour here. There's no funny sticking out bits that you

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.550
can't see out over all round, so you should be able to park it very easy as well.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:38.000
And while the front of the car is good in terms of space, the back is

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.019
not quite so good, I mean it's all right.

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:46.000
As a fully grown adult, I've got an okay amount of head room but when it comes to 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.370
leg room it's

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.849
average at best and just not as
much as you get in

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:55.290
equivalent rival cars. If you've got slightly
smaller passengers though, you'll be absolutely

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.870
fine

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.310
this door opens wide enough that it is
perfectly easy

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:03.560
to get in and out without any trouble. And
the boot

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.640
like the back of the cabin, is only really average at best.

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:10.500
That's not the biggest in the class in
terms of size but it is a nice

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.360
even shape, there's nothing really particularly clever about it though.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:19.700
You do get, only on SE models and above
however, this adjustable floor, which hides

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:20.320
away

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.340
a decent under floor storage area.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:27.200
Folding the seats isn't the simplest
procedure either, actually that's not strictly true, you can just

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.419
can just drop them

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:32.200
in one, quick movement, but if you
do, you don't get a totally

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:36.210
flat loading bay. If you want that then
first of all you've got to flip

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.740
the seat-bases up and then...

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.669
drop the back part, so it's not really a one
handed manoeuvre. 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.529
Now the Polo is actually cheaper, pound for pound, than direct rivals like

00:04:49.529 --> 00:04:54.439
say, the Fiesta. And on paper it's maybe not quite as cheap to run but

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:58.749
on our real world fuel economy test, the Polo performed better

00:04:58.749 --> 00:05:02.919
than many of its other rivals. Click here
for more information on that.

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:07.449
Now entry-level models do come with a
fair bit of kit; you get DAB digital

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:11.909
radio, Bluetooth and a USB connection but
personally we would step up to the

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:15.549
SE trim, and that brings things like air-conditioning, fifteen-inch

00:05:15.549 --> 00:05:18.719
alloy wheels, that adjustable boot floor
and that

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:22.869
larger touchscreen. If you go for SE Design, then the additions are,

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:26.759
as the name implies, a bit more cosmetic.
You get things like front sport seats

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:31.479
and bigger alloy wheels again. SEL
however is where the toys really start

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:34.449
come in. You get things like parking
sensors, cruise control

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:40.109
and a front armrest. The Polo came about
halfway down in our latest JD Power

00:05:40.109 --> 00:05:43.099
customer satisfaction survey but
Volkswagen as a brand

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:46.139
did pretty well with quality models
right spot the top.

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.179
Click here for more information on that.

00:05:49.179 --> 00:05:53.439
In the latest Euro NCAP crash tests
the Polo did particularly well

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:57.739
it earned the full five-stars and a load of
praise for its protection of adults

00:05:57.739 --> 00:06:01.439
and child passengers alike. Now there are

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:06.289
two main issues with the Polo: it's not
exactly riotous fun to drive

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:09.429
and it's not the most practical car
when it comes to

00:06:09.429 --> 00:06:13.939
the back seats and the boot but for most
people on a day-to-day basis that really

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:15.159
want and for that matter

00:06:15.159 --> 00:06:18.619
shouldn't be a problem. In so many other
ways

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:23.889
it is a fantastic little car. It has
got a cabin that blows the opposition

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.679
absolutely out the water, it's quite
affordable to buy

00:06:26.679 --> 00:06:30.479
and to run and it will hold on to its
value really well so

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:33.879
it'll be worth a decent amount when you
come sell it in a few years time.

00:06:33.879 --> 00:06:37.319
It is one of the absolute best small
cars

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:42.049
out there. So while you're here, you want to check-out the rest of our videos, including that one of
