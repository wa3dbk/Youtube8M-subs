00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.620
SMG's are boring when compared with other
weapon categories in CS:GO. Despite there

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.030
being 6 of them altogether they all operate
in a surprisingly similar way.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.450
The benefits of using them are that they're
cheap, generally have a fast fire-rate and,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:18.440
with the exception of the P90, offer a double
kill award of $600. The downside is that they

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.940
don't do much damage and are rather inaccurate.
The first-shot accuracy is actually rather

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:28.430
similar between them. I fired 50 shots from
each, 1 second apart from a distance of 1024

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.000
units. The accurate clump in the middle is
from the M4A4, just to show you how they compare

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.510
with a full-blown rifle. They all have different
values which you can see below their names.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:42.350
The smaller, the better. In practice, it's
only the MP7 which is noticeably better than

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.909
the rest, but even then it won't guarantee
you a precise shot, even at just 1024 units.

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:51.050
In practice, this is roughly the distance
from A site to short A.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.719
But, as a wise man once said, if you're trying
to snipe with an SMG then you're doing it

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.260
wrong. These are close-quarters weapons, designed
to mow down a number of unarmoured opponents

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.971
from up-close. In the next part of this video
I'll be looking at clip size, fire-rate, spray

00:01:04.971 --> 00:01:08.689
pattern and inaccuracy since these are the
four most important factors when you're trying

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:12.730
to pump the enemies full of lead.
Here you can see the magazine-sizes, along

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:16.520
with the fire-rate and how long you can spray
for before you reach the end of your magazine.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.439
Or clip. Or whatever. It's clear that the
Bizon and P90 are the spammiest. Even the

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:26.820
relatively slow-firing UMP-45 fires as fast
as proper rifles, such as the M4A4.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.289
Let's test the recoil patterns. Without inaccuracy,
they look a bit like this. Try to compensate

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.061
for this pattern when you're playing. With
inaccuracy, it looks more like this. There

00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:42.010
are no winners, but the best is the MP7 and
the worst is the P90. That being said, with

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:47.119
any SMG you WILL miss people a lot even if
you do fully compensate for spray. My best

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.159
advice with SMGs is to get as close as possible
and you'll level the playing field against

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:57.030
more heavily equipped opponents. Unlike the
rifles, SMGs are designed to be sprayed. The

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.259
first shot isn't that much more precise than
the rest of them so if you're going to shoot

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.079
then you might as well shoot a lot since they
all have the same sort of chance of hitting

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.670
their target. Their recoil patterns may be
complicated but learning them will make you

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.780
into a lethal bullet-spewing machine.
Inaccuracy whilst moving is a little more

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.750
complicated. Statistically, the MP7 becomes
the hardest to control and the MP9 the easiest

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.960
by quite a large margin, to the point where
jumping and spraying is a viable close-range

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.530
tactic. This relies on you memorising the
spray pattern and fully compensating for it,

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.630
which is difficult with these weapons. I fired
5 full magazines from each gun into a wall

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.590
and will leave the results here for you to
make your own mind up about them. The P90

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.470
and Bizon obviously fire a lot more shots
than the others due to their larger magazine

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.430
capacity. Bear in mind that in-game you won't
get more than 3 magazines out of either of

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.940
these weapons... not that you'll need it.
From this comparison I'm just going to say

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.560
that all of the SMGs display a large amount
of spread relative to the position of the

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.400
crosshair and I'd advise you to practice on
deathmatch with your SMG of choice before

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.860
trying it out in proper matches.
If you're running and gunning the number of

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.770
bullets may be more important their the accuracy.
The Bizon and P90 balance large magazine size

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.800
with an average moving accuracy. The Mac-10,
UMP 45 and MP7 seem much more accurate on

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:13.550
ladders than other SMGs, should you ever get
caught in nuke's vents.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:18.860
Now it's time to look at damage. There are
3 factors to consider here: base damage, armour

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.750
penetration and damage drop-off.
Base-damage, for most SMGs, is lower than

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.170
proper rifles, though not by that much when
you consider the price difference. The UMP-45,

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.000
despite costing just $1,200, does 35 base
damage which is higher than all rifles but

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.570
the AK47!
SMGs used to have lower armour penetration

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.730
than rifles but a recent update has made them
almost identical to more expensive weapons

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.650
in this regard. I'll let this excel sheet
explain the figures.

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:48.930
Drop-off is yet another reason why SMGs are
useless at range. Unlike rifles, which have

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:54.250
a damage drop-off of around 3% for every 500
units travelled, SMGs lose anywhere between

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.750
14 and 20%! This quickly adds up as the distance
increases. So don't use these weapons as a

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.550
sniper. Even if you somehow hit, you'll do
all of 10 damage. You can see this from the

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:09.240
excel sheet.
Now for the good news. When running with these

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.920
weapons you're fast. The MP9, Mac-10 and Bizon
let you run at 240 units a second, which is

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:21.730
the same as pistols. The P90 and UMP-45 are
230 and the MP7 is 220, which is the same

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.610
as the slowest CT rifle but still faster than
the terrorist ones.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.680
Here is how the reload times compare. The
MP9 is short, with the P90 and UMP45's taking

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.290
the longest. It's worth mentioning the MP9's
equip bug, where it takes an extra 0.35 seconds

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.530
after the animation of equipping the weapon
is over before you can fire it. This may be

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.930
fixed at some point. Or not.
And finally, here are the distances at which

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.450
the weapons can land one-hit kill headshots
on unarmoured enemies. This will only be useful

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.770
in early rounds but it certainly shows one
of the key differences between SMGs and rifles.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:59.930
The UMP45 bridges the gap and is why I feel
it does a good job as a cheap rifle substitute-

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:05.100
at close ranges it does even more damage than
the FAMAS, but it quickly drops off with distance.

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.550
Only the AK-47 in this list can land one-hit
headshots against armoured opponents.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:15.180
So in conclusion, SMGs are a high-risk high-reward
strategy. They are generally used in anti-ecos

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.700
but once the opponents have armour, their
effectiveness is reduced, though a recent

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:23.450
patch has upped their damage against armour
by 10%. The P90 received a smaller boost but

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.590
it already had a higher value than the others.
These changes could have a profound effect

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:31.860
on the SMG's use in CS:GO.
The Mac-10 is a cheap way for terrorists to

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:36.630
hop on the automatic bandwagon. It's powerful
up close but suffers from the general weaknesses

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:40.700
that SMGs have.
The MP9 is the CT's Mac-10, with unmatched

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:45.570
running and jumping accuracy and short reload
time. Aside from these factors, the Mac-10

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.930
is the superior weapon in a number of ways.
Your play-style will determine which of these

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.770
two SMGs you'll play best with.
The UMP-45 is closest to the rifles. It only

00:05:54.770 --> 00:06:00.280
has a magazine of 25 rounds and a low fire-rate,
but deals good damage and is decent against

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:04.580
armour. Against unarmoured you can get an
insta-headshot kill from a moderate range.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.220
If your team buys but you're low on money,
you can pick up a UMP-45 and armour for less

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:18.180
than the cost of a single FAMAS.
The MP7 is good. It's like getting the best

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:22.890
house on a bad street. It mixes good damage
and fire-rate with accuracy beyond any other

00:06:22.890 --> 00:06:29.590
SMG, but it still pales in comparison to rifles
and at $1,700 it's expensive. The recent 10%

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.400
increase against armour may make it more viable-
I'd say to give it a chance and to see how

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.630
it performs. Compared with say, a galil, it
requires a different play-style and it may

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.060
suit some people better.
The Bizon is a spray-and-pray weapon. You're

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:47.990
guaranteed a stupid number of '81 damage in
7 shots' from it as it's the joint worst SMG

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.790
for use against armour. That being said, you
have 5 seconds to play with as you spam the

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:56.910
enemies. Manage to survive for that long and
you'll almost guarantee yourself the crown

00:06:56.910 --> 00:07:01.770
of ASSIST MASTER for the game.
The P90 is classed as an SMG but is closer

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:06.560
to the rifles in terms of price and effectiveness.
Even if you have enough money for a proper

00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.810
rifle, you may still be better off with this
weapon and a couple of grenades depending

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:15.840
on your situation. It has a terrifying rate
of fire and an armour PENETRATION value of

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:21.389
69% lolol, which is close to that of the FAMAS.
When used by the right man in the right place

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:25.660
it can make all the difference in the world.
It's the rusher's choice.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:29.461
Thanks to Slothsquadron for the help in making
this video as comprehensive as it is. Not

00:07:29.461 --> 00:07:33.781
so much thanks to Valve for continually changing
the stats and figures. Use this video before

00:07:33.781 --> 00:07:33.800
it is rendered obsolete!
