Come across this cave in the remote Kimberley
region. Ahh, I don’t know that those noises

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.330
are coming out of the cave. We are a good
300 km from the nearest civilization. Going

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:29.250
in for a closer look, come on. Oh you can
hear those noises, like banging on a rock.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:46.260
Oh there is grunting noises. I have heard
stories by the camp fire of a cave man who

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:53.340
lives in here.
This could be him.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:29.290
Something in there.
Quick come over here look, look.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.720
Fella calm down, it’s alright. Look there
he is.

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:53.960
Calm down, look, look. Fire, fire, fire.
Calm down, calm down, look, look, fire.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:20.780
It’s got to be first contact, he hasn’t
seen people in years. Maybe even decades.

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:29.980
Not really sure what period he comes from.
Maybe it’s Homo Sapien, maybe homo erectus.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.700
By the size of his muscles, he’s obviously
had the ability to pump rocks.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:03:01.560
Man, Jase, Jase, Jase, it’s alright buddy
we will take you come, come home, cappuccino,

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:08.560
coffee, cappuccino. Good boy.
