00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.430
Welcome this week to Team Wild's Gear.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.680
Now we've come up to Garlands today

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.370
to test out the new Browning shotgun.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:46.130
Now

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.930
Browning have been making shotguns for as
long as i can remember.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.960
So when they said tha the new 725
is packed with features.

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.620
We decided to get hold of one and have a look for ourselves.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.499
Here it is, the Browning 725.

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:08.140
So Browning have made some pretty big claims about this new shotgun and its new features. So

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:15.140
let's just go and have a look see what it can do.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.290
Now from the outset

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.980
this gun looks like a lot of the other guns in the Browning range.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:25.830
But the 725's have been fitted with a backboard vector pro barrels.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.060
Now these are designed to improve swing, aerodynamics and balance.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.509
As well as being long-lasting and durable.t6
As well as being long lasting and durable.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.500
There's also a new improved trigger
mechanism which gives a shoots greater

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.390
feel when he's taking the shot. The limited movement within the trigger mechanism makes

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.040
it lighter, shorter and faster.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.510
The 725 also has a new low
action frame.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.930
Which is longer and more compact.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.860
Making it quicker to aim reduce the muzzle flip and

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.430
making it more comfortable for the shooter also.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.630
Now

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.369
the DS invector chokes

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:11.089
are also pretty special.

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:16.339
Being longer at 80 ml and being fitted with a double gas sealing system

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:19.809
Not only do they prevent gases escaping back into the barrel.But they create a more

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:25.069
concentrated uniform stock pattern .All of
the 725 range also come fitted

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.529
with a standard.

00:02:26.529 --> 00:02:28.309
The influx recoil pad.

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:32.639
Now this is designed in such a way that it
pushes recoil awayand down from the shooters

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:34.129
cheek.

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:41.129
It also comes with three spaces so that you can lengthen or shorten the size of stock.

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:50.489
So, it has some pretty big claims Browning it made on the new features on their gun.

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.689
Lets see how it shoots!

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:00.349
So, what  better target for a Team Wild Varminator to have a go at.

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:03.339
Thank the bolting rabbit. Pull.

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:12.379
Pull

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:21.349
So, its certainly good fun.

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.209
I've managed to get a few rabbits.

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.120
And the inflex recoil pad really does do its job.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.539
We call this the bolting rabbit, I'm not so sure. Dennis...

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:34.769
I think it's more like the bolting kangaroo some of these.

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:41.769
I'm trying ti make them stay all right. Dennis is very kindly working the button for us today. Good day!

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:49.289
Right lets do some more.

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:10.039
Well I've enjoyed that its been good its been fun I've actually managed to hit a few as well.

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:12.489
uh... which is surprising. Wildy will have a few comments on that.

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:14.689
The gun handles really well.

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:16.739
The balance of it is great.

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:19.419
A lot of guns can be top heavy and a lot of guns I've used when you're shooting stuff

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.690
like this rabbits, when your level will come and pull you forward.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.340
Whereas this,

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:28.999
its there and you can step back into it, step forward into it.

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:32.009
And you can swing very freely.

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:36.250
A lot of those targets were coming out and catching me out. They were coming along and going straight up in the air.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.810
But i didn't have any problems going from the ground to  getting up there on them.

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.370
So yeah very fast handling gun.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:45.489
Very low recoil.

00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:48.560
And I really enjoyed it.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:55.050
I think I'll be having one of thses in the cabinet soon.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.020
Okay so we're going to to have to head off now because this young lad wants to have a go on it.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.479
What's your name buddy?  Brody Wollard... Brody Wollard. You do a bit of shooting quite a bit of shooting do ya? Yeah I do quite a bit yeah.

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:06.789
You any good? Yeah I think I'm all right.

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:09.349
Yeah, yeah all right for a kid like yeah.

00:05:09.349 --> 00:05:10.539
Okay

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.719
lets see what you can do buddy.

00:05:12.719 --> 00:05:19.719
Pull.

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:33.339
Right we're off.
