Hi! My name is Stacy. Today I am going to
show you how to make a pig puppet using household

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:20.510
items. You will need a brown lunch sack, pink
construction paper, glue, scissors and a marker.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.260
First you will need to make sure that your
bag has the flap open so there will be a puppet

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:42.469
when you put your hand inside. You will need
to make your ears, nose and the arms. Iâ€™m

00:00:42.469 --> 00:01:02.910
going to make triangles for the ears, circle
for the nose and for the arms and then you

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:35.650
cut them out. Next you will want to draw your
eyes on the bag, then glue your nose and you

00:01:35.650 --> 00:02:20.650
can make little nostrils on it with your marker
and then glue the ears on the top of your

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:44.310
bag and last glue your arms and here is your
pig puppet using household items.
