00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello, my name's Mark, and this is my Qashqai.
I live in East London with my wife, teenage

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.100
daughter, and attack dog Fang. So it's definitely
a family car. I commute into the office

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:20.000
on public transport so my wife uses the car about 20 minutes each way. On
weekends, we tend to use the car for socializing,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.000
shopping, and occasionally trips out to watch
some sports or take in an event, and every

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.900
now and again, a trip up the motorway to see
family back up north.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.500
So what do I look for in a car? Well, I'm
no petrol head, and my boy racer days are

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
well behind me. So speed and performance are
certainly not high on the list. I read somewhere

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.000
recently that the average traffic speed in
London is slower now that it was in the days

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.000
of horse and carriage, and I can quite easily
believe that. I certainly know that speed

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:57.800
limits are enthusiastically enforced around here and it can take a while to get anywhere. So comfort really is top of my list.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.700
Okay so this is the Qashqai 1.2 D-I-G-T Techno.
This model comes with all the toys. So it's

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:13.330
leather seats, leather trim, electrically
adjusted and heated seats in the front, and

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:20.330
it comes with a touch screen multimedia system,
onboard Sat Nav, electric parking brake, climate

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.350
control, and even robot parking. So there's
a self parking system that will get you into

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:33.450
parallel or bays if you've got a tight spot.
Okay, so we've had the car about four months

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.450
now. We've done just under 3,000 miles, and
the onboard trip computer tells me we're getting

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:49.289
around 35.5 miles per gallon.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:54.380
So how is it to drive? Well, it feels quite
sure-footed on those big alloy wheels. The

00:01:54.380 --> 00:02:00.469
power steering is positive and precise and
overall I find it feels, for its size, quite

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:06.109
nimble.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.100
All right. Driving across and around London
can be quite daunting if you haven't any knowledge,

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.790
and it can be a bit of an unforgiving environment
if you don't know exactly where you're going.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.790
So a decent Sat Nav is almost essential these
days. I find the onboard unit very good. It's

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.580
very clear, easy to read, and in fact, I was
up near Brick Lane the other day, a lot of

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:44.550
very narrow, twisty lanes up there. It got
me through that city, no problem at all. So

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.020
yeah, very pleased with it.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:51.510
As well as the normal stuff like cruise control,
you've also got additional safety features

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.830
like blind spot warning. So you got an amber
light just by the wing mirror if somebody's

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.580
coming up behind you, and lane departure warning
lights. So if you cross a white line without

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:07.980
indicating, it will give you a little beep
to let you know that you've done that.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:14.980
So parking's a breeze

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.000
 Just like that. Okay so
the automatic parking, a bit of a gimmick,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:01.280
but great fun to sit and watch. What I do
find though, is that the all around sensors

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:06.260
and the camera make parking an absolute breeze.
Get you in and out of anywhere without any problems whatsoever

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:15.200
Okay so the boot is quiet spacious. You can
adapt it using these things here to take different

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.000
kinds of loads. Personally, I think the default
one is brilliant. It's just the right height

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:23.700
to get your shopping in and out really quickly and you can be in and out of Lidls before anyone has even seen you.      

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:31.000
Just a couple minor things
The wing mirrors don't fold in automatically when you lock the car which they did on the Ford Focus that we used to have.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:37.700
and some of the voice controls aren't quite as comprehensive as the Ford Focus.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:51.760
But overall, I really like it, I think it is a great car for a family that do mostly urban motoring, it's definitely recommended, its brilliant.
