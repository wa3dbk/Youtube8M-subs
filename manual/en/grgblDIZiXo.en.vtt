00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.760
[Darris McNeely] You ever hear the phrase,
“Money is the root of all evil”? How about,

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:12.380
“Spare the rod and spoil the child”? Here’s
another phrase: “Cleanliness is next to

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.320
godliness.” You know, people say these things
and many times people think they’re quoting

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.550
the Bible. But you know, you’re not. None
of these phrases, and a lot of other phrases,

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.409
that people will use in everyday speech are
not found in the Bible. There’s a lot of

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:34.090
sayings like that. There’s also a lot of
religious beliefs and traditions and ideas

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.640
and beliefs that people hold that are not
found in the Bible.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.630
On Beyond Today, we talk about Christmas and
its pagan roots and how God has not taught

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.739
us to do that, how it’s not the birthday
of Christ. Easter, other beliefs that people

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.070
have, and traditions in various religions
– they’re not found in the Bible. There’s

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:57.519
a lot that we need to understand about the
Bible.&nbsp;And as we’ve begun this series on

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:04.809
BT Dailys about how to understand the Bible,
here’s point number two, key number two,

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:13.070
that is important for us to understand. And
it’s this: keep an open mind as you begin

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:19.670
to read through, familiarize yourself and
study the scriptures. Also be willing to admit

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.000
that you might be wrong about a cherished
belief, an idea, perception perhaps that you

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.631
have about the Bible, and hold that to the
side as you begin to read through it. And

00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:37.920
be able to understand that you might be corrected
and that you could be wrong. And if, as you

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.369
read through the scriptures you find that
you discover something that contradicts what

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.470
you believe or have thought about the Bible
– as I said, keep an open mind, but you’re

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.570
going to also run up against the question
of, what are you going to do about it?

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.310
What are you going to do about discovering
something that God says to do that you haven’t

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:00.450
been doing? And if God convicts your heart,
that you should do it, you have a choice to

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.010
make. It’s a fascinating discovery and journey
that you do as you begin to go through the

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:12.120
Bible. Would you change? Well, if you would,
as you begin to read the scriptures, let me

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.540
tell you, you would be far ahead of many other
people who read the Bible and just put it

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.030
aside then and say, “Oh, it’s a nice book,
it’s a nice thought, nice piece of literature,”

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.170
but go on with their life, and are not convicted
and moved by it. But if you admit that you

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.260
may be wrong, if you keep that open mind and
then begin to change, you will be taking a

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:37.580
step far greater than you could ever imagine,
and that will put you ahead.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.379
There’s a scripture, and an example, in
the Bible that I think is a byword for us.

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:47.750
We’ve talked about it on Beyond Today before,
of a group of people who searched the scriptures

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.930
and kept the Bible in their mind in terms
of what they understood. It’s in Acts chapter

00:02:52.930 --> 00:03:01.049
17, as the apostle Paul was visiting with
a group of people in a city called Berea.&nbsp;And

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:06.440
as he came to this group of people, he found,
it says, that “they were more open-minded”

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.520
than another group back up the road in Thessalonica
and they listened eagerly to Paul’s message.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.129
He goes on to say that “they searched the
scriptures day after day to see if Paul and

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:23.230
Silas were teaching the truth.” Acts 17:11.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.330
Searching the scriptures daily, keeping an
open mind, proving whether or not what anyone

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:34.132
says about the Bible, the scriptures, is true
– it’s a hallmark of a Berean. And it

00:03:34.132 --> 00:03:42.159
can be a saying or a hallmark for you and
for I as we read the Bible, seek God’s understanding,

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:47.989
and seek to prove what it is that we believe
and what is there and what might be commonly

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:52.330
understood or misunderstood in today’s world.
It’s a key to understanding the Bible – keep

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.430
an open mind.
