00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:20.300
We’re going to discuss some knife methods.
In spite of being an extremely sharp knife,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.080
a knife normally has to have either a thrust
or a draw to make a severe cut. This is considerably

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.840
sharp, but pressing straight down, at most
I’m going to get a fine hairline scratch,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.800
like you would with a razor. If an opponent
has a knife in their palm, the back of the

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.771
hand will not open up. If I try and grab the
blade, and pull the knife anyway I’m going

00:00:41.771 --> 00:00:46.579
to be losing some fingers. If I keep the knife
from thrusting or drawing by grasping the

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.160
wrist, and I push against the blade so the
handle is pushing against his fingers, even

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.750
if it’s against a bigger attacker I can
free that knife. and Bring a straight stab

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:00.261
on me. I’m evading first, smacking this
out. His leverage is minimized when the arm

00:01:00.261 --> 00:01:04.479
is out. Just like you can lift the bucket
of water here; lifting in here is considerably

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.100
more difficult. I want the arm out there as
I do this to this arm. As that occurs, I bring

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:14.420
my body in for maximal leverage my own. I
pop this back out, strike the opponent, and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:23.831
I have got the weapon. Once again, I’m smacking
this away, the hand slaps sideways to the

00:01:23.831 --> 00:01:29.600
blade, presses down, and again I can use the
handle to strike the opponent or simply toss

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.820
the knife. One more time, I’ll show what
not to do. If he brings this at me and I simply

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.050
grab the blade, I’m going to be bleeding
severely, because there is nothing to give

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:46.560
me a better grip. As soon he withdraws having
a textured grip, I’ll be bleeding or losing

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.660
fingers. It’s important that before I even
grasp the blade…this is to help to hinder

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:58.510
his movement and minimize that, and this presses
down. There are combat methods; we’re going

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:08.019
to show the basic to strike with a knife and
then exit. With knife positions, what’s

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:15.520
called the sabre position, it was with knife
extended blade forward. That’s a reverse

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.090
grip, this is called the pick grip. We’re
going to show the defense against the pick

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.950
drip. The block I’m going to use is actually
a dragon jaw block. I overlap the thumb of

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.140
the opposite hand. It’s important to have
this position. Here, the impact is may break

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.430
my thumbs. Further apart it’s going to slip
through. I need it here. I’m not actually

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.420
going to stop the knife; I’m going to redirect
it. I’m going to demonstrate something not

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:43.731
to do first. Go ahead and bring it down like
a stab. If I block here and stop, he can cut

00:02:43.731 --> 00:02:50.070
up my arm. Go ahead and bring that stab down
again. As I block I step aside, bringing this

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:57.700
knee in to center to take the wind, come over
break the arm, I can disarm. Again, I’m

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.819
moving to the side, I’m blocking the arm
like this, but not stopping it. Continuing

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:08.910
the motion, hitting with the knee, grab, put
my weight here to break the elbow, and can

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.070
take the knife, if it hasn’t already flown
out.
