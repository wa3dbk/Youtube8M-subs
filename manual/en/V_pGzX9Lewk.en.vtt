00:00:00.561 --> 00:00:02.060
Right here-- actually
interestingly,

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.490
right in the UNH
logo, we see signs

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.650
of-- so these
plugged holes here--

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.720
are occupied by
trap nesting bees.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.490
I read about bee
hotels in the past.

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.823
And I always wanted to make one.

00:00:12.823 --> 00:00:16.990
They're a nice way to increase
habitat for native pollinators.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.990
So me and Cathy Neal-- she's
in Cooperative Extension--

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.450
came together and built this
out of mostly found materials.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.760
So we can assume thousands
of bees can live in there.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.550
Every hole is a
habitat for something.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.000
We have thousands of sticks,
and drill holes, and crevices.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.090
So they can find
nooks and crannies

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.690
that we can't even see.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:36.290
So there's a
national-- and really,

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:38.850
a global concern for
pollinators in decline.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.830
We know that they provide
a $2 billion a year

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:44.480
pollination service for
all agricultural crops.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.450
So if we don't have pollinators,
really, the national food

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.740
supply is also at risk.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.230
We're looking at the
natural habits of bees.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:56.060
So we're looking at meadow
sites, kind of organic farms

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.580
like here at Woodman, and
then also conventional farming

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.480
practices at some of the other
agriculture experiment station

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.520
farms, where they use
some of the pesticides

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.290
and the neonicotinoids, which
are the prime target for some

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.420
of the bee declines.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.820
The grad students are doing
more of the behavioral work,

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:10.410
right now.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.868
But the undergrads are really
leading this bee biodiversity

00:01:12.868 --> 00:01:13.950
initiative.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.440
We sweep each patch of
flowers for five minutes.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.360
And the goal is to do it across
as many flower species as

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.910
possible, just to get as
many bee species as possible.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.630
Because some are specialists
to particular flowers.

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.840
Right off the bat,
you think bees,

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.730
and you think blackmail
black and yellow.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:38.090
There's so many types of bees,
and so many different colors--

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.910
but in particular, bright,
bright green metallic bees,

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.140
which I had no idea existed.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.140
The group we study mostly
are the small carpenter bee.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.284
That's the Genus Ceratina.

00:01:47.284 --> 00:01:49.450
And so they all live in all
the dead, broken sticks.

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.740
The other bees are
the trap-nesting bees

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:53.790
or the megachilid bees.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:54.950
A lot of the work
we're doing this summer

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.140
is just to establish
what is the native bee?

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.820
And what species are here
compared to other states?

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.430
Native bees have a sting.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.800
The ovipositor is the
female reproductive organ.

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.540
So all females have a sting.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.991
But native bees are largely
solitary, or very weakly

00:02:08.991 --> 00:02:09.490
social.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.450
So they don't form
very large groups.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.865
And so really, if you leave them
alone, they're not aggressive.

00:02:15.865 --> 00:02:17.990
I think in 10 years, I've
been stung once by them--

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:20.960
and I probably deserved it!

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.800
So increasing potential
habitat will only

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.770
increase pollinator populations.

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.450
So we're hoping--
this is just one.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.380
And we hope to set up
many more, and inspire

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:29.760
people to also set up their own.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.440
Any person can put any scale
of this in their backyard,

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.800
and increase pollinators
for their own gardens

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.320
and their own green spaces.
