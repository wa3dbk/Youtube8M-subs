hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.780
welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.179
we're going to make another sweet

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.770
from Rajasthan it's called muthia ke ladoo because we're going to make muthia's

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.560
of flour and then we're going to fry them and then going to make awesome ladoos, to make the

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.199
dough for the muthia's here I've got wheat
flour, besan and some sooji that is

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.130
semolina

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.300
I'm going to mix all the three together
you know more of wheat flour and little bit

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.860
less of you know for one cup of wheat flour, half cup of besan that

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.760
is chickpea flour and then half cup of
Sooji, add ghee

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.899
ok first mix this sprinkle little water and make it into a dough

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.039
this is kind of a short crust dough because once you fry this dough

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:03.359
you should be able to you know break it
into little pieces

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.619
this is still crumbly but by pressing it
you will be able to make this into a

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:08.369
dumpling

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:13.260
after that a dent with the fingers like this ok so that you know there's a

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:19.020
nice hollow and when you fry you know
they will come out evenly cooked on all

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.770
sides

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.759
okay just make sure you can make it like
this

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:29.100
ok if you want you can also make them
flat like this and fry

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.380
this is not the shape required but by
tradition they used to make this like this you know

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.119
while making the dough I have added ghee you know do not try to add oil, dalda

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.759
or anything to make this you have to
use ghee even for frying this

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.799
we're going to use ghee but to do not heat the ghee too much and cook them till they're

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.189
nicely golden in color on a slow flame

00:01:53.939 --> 00:02:01.079
so after you fry them you will be able
to break them very easily but we're

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.939
going to make it into a powder

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.439
so we're going to put this in the pestle and make it into a

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:09.640
nice powder

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.150
In another kadai take some ghee we're
going to add jaggery because ghee is hot

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.770
once you add the jaggery it'll melt you
don't need to add any moisture water or

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.530
anything into this you can see how this
jaggery is melting away once the jaggery

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.580
is all melting

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.170
switch off the flame add the powder of
this muthia's in this

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:39.310
you know if you can want to flavor it with
cardamom powder you can but it's not

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:40.120
necessary

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.250
mix all of this and keep it aside after
which we going to make this awesome

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.250
ladoos you can also add some nuts

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:55.330
I've got here sliced pistachio and sliced badam after you mix the jaggery

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.670
and you add this nuts you can make them into nice ladoos

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:05.709
ok just roll them in the poppy seed you
know not too much of coating just

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.310
little bit so that they coat little bit on the poppy seed

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.489
