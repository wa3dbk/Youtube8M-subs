00:00:00.233 --> 00:00:02.566
Voiceover: Let's stick with
this idea, the simplification,

00:00:02.566 --> 00:00:04.966
that there's a gene for eye color,

00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:06.967
and it only comes with two variants.

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:09.166
It has the dominant variant,

00:00:09.166 --> 00:00:11.367
which codes for brown eye color,

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:15.500
and it has the recessive variant,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.833
which codes for blue eye color.

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:21.233
So if either one of your
alleles is this capital B,

00:00:21.233 --> 00:00:22.433
you're going to have brown eyes,

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:24.367
the only way to have blue
eyes is to have a lower case,

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:29.100
is to be homozygous for
the recessive allele.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.833
Now let's say that in a population,

00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:32.500
it's a large population, one that meets

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.500
all the Hardy-Weinberg
Equilibrium assumptions,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.900
let's say that you were to
observe that nine percent

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.833
of this population has blue eyes.

00:00:43.833 --> 00:00:45.300
So now we're talking about the phenotype.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.633
You can actually observe
that they have blue eyes.

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:52.700
Based on this, can we figure out p,

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:56.300
which is the frequency
of the dominant allele.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.833
Can we figure this out?

00:00:57.833 --> 00:01:01.433
And can we figure out q,
which is the frequency

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:04.833
of the recessive allele, can
we figure that out as well?

00:01:04.833 --> 00:01:06.300
I would encourage you to pause this video

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.433
and based on what we saw of
the Hardy-Weinberg Equation,

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:14.330
can we figure these things
out, given this information?

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.366
Well let's revisit the
Hardy-Weinberg equation.

00:01:16.366 --> 00:01:18.100
We've worked it out in a previous video,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.366
but I'll rewrite it right now.

00:01:20.366 --> 00:01:23.633
It says, the allele frequency for

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:27.233
the dominant allele frequency squared,

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:30.166
plus two times the
dominant allele frequency

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:32.767
times the recessive allele frequency,

00:01:32.767 --> 00:01:35.566
plus the recessive
allele frequency squared,

00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:36.967
is equal to one.

00:01:36.967 --> 00:01:38.766
And we saw that this
just comes from the idea

00:01:38.766 --> 00:01:41.366
that p plus q is going to be equal to one.

00:01:41.366 --> 00:01:42.766
There is a 100 percent chance,
if you were to randomly

00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:47.300
pick a gene, that it's
one of these two variants.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.833
Now when we say nine
percent has blue eyes,

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:51.166
what does that mean?

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:52.966
Well the only way to have blue eyes

00:01:52.966 --> 00:01:57.700
is if your genotype is
homozygous recessive.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.330
Because if you have a capital B in here

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.567
then you're going to have brown eyes.

00:02:00.567 --> 00:02:04.167
So we can say that nine
percent also has this genotype.

00:02:04.167 --> 00:02:06.166
Or you can say that the
frequency in the population

00:02:06.166 --> 00:02:09.330
of this genotype is nine percent.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.863
But we've already seen, that's exactly

00:02:11.863 --> 00:02:13.833
what this term right over here is.

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:15.700
That's this q squared term.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.966
This is the probability,
one way to think about it,

00:02:17.966 --> 00:02:21.500
of getting, q of course is the frequency

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.100
of the recessive allele,
now you could view this

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.449
as the probability of getting
two of the recessive alleles.

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:32.566
In your population, it's
going to be nine percent.

00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:37.700
So we could say q squared
is equal to nine percent.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.766
Or another way to think about it,

00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:46.909
this term over here is
nine percent, or 0.09.

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:48.766
Nine percent has this genotype,

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:50.966
that's what this tells us right over here.

00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:52.633
So then we can solve for q.

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:56.100
If q squared, I'll write
it as a decimal, 0.09,

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.634
that means that q is going to be

00:02:57.634 --> 00:03:04.300
the square root of 0.09,
which is equal to 0.3.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.566
Just like that, we were able to figure out

00:03:06.566 --> 00:03:09.166
the allele frequency of
the recessive allele.

00:03:09.166 --> 00:03:13.165
And I could write that as a
percentage, 0.3 or 30 percent,

00:03:13.165 --> 00:03:15.834
if you were looking at the
genes in the population,

00:03:15.834 --> 00:03:20.233
30 percent express our code for

00:03:20.233 --> 00:03:25.033
the recessive allele, or
the recessive variant.

00:03:25.033 --> 00:03:26.433
Based on that, we can figure out

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:28.833
what percentage code for
the dominant variant.

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:30.966
The rest of the genes must code

00:03:30.966 --> 00:03:32.033
for the dominant one, because we're

00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:33.366
assuming there's only two of them.

00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:35.166
P plus q equals 100 percent,

00:03:35.166 --> 00:03:37.766
or p plus q is equal to one.

00:03:37.766 --> 00:03:41.500
So this must be 70 percent.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.869
So just based on that, we can kind of

00:03:43.869 --> 00:03:44.966
dig a little bit deeper here.

00:03:44.966 --> 00:03:46.500
So what is p squared?

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.633
P squared is going to be 70
percent squared, or 0.7 squared.

00:03:51.633 --> 00:03:57.900
So this right over here is
0.7 squared, which is 0.49.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:00.966
So one way to think about
it is, based on this,

00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:02.566
and once again, it's a simple equation,

00:04:02.566 --> 00:04:04.100
but these really neat ideas are starting

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.700
to pop out of it based
on just this information.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.300
We're now able to say that 49 percent

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.756
of the population is
going to have a genotype

00:04:12.756 --> 00:04:17.033
of capital B, they're going
to be homozygous dominant.

00:04:17.033 --> 00:04:19.500
And then we can figure
out this right over here.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.807
Two times p times q, that's going to be

00:04:22.807 --> 00:04:32.489
two times 0.7, times 0.3.

00:04:32.489 --> 00:04:36.833
So let's see, that's going
to be two times 0.21,

00:04:36.833 --> 00:04:42.166
so this right over here
is going to be 0.42.

00:04:42.166 --> 00:04:44.700
Or another way to think
about it is, 42 percent

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.233
of this population is going to have

00:04:46.233 --> 00:04:49.300
the genotype upper case
B and lower case b.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.833
And you see they all add up.

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:54.366
49 percent plus 42 percent is 91 percent,

00:04:54.366 --> 00:04:58.976
plus nine percent all
adds up to 100 percent.

00:04:58.976 --> 00:05:00.566
So you get a little bit
of information here,

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:02.766
and based on what we know
about allele frequencies,

00:05:02.766 --> 00:05:04.567
making a few assumptions,
we're able to get

00:05:04.567 --> 00:05:07.633
a lot more knowledge
about this population.

00:05:07.633 --> 00:05:10.463
And this is actually
very useful in real life,

00:05:10.463 --> 00:05:13.966
when people think about,
say, a recessive allele

00:05:13.966 --> 00:05:16.499
that might cause some type of a disease,

00:05:16.499 --> 00:05:20.166
based on the incidents of that disease,

00:05:20.166 --> 00:05:21.366
people can start to think about,

00:05:21.366 --> 00:05:23.900
"What percentage of the
population is a carrier?"

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.233
Say they're heterzygotes for that disease.

00:05:26.233 --> 00:05:29.482
So this is actually very
useful in real life.
