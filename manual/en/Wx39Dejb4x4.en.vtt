Hello my name is Tabitha...

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.371
and I'm from Hertfordshire 

00:00:04.404 --> 00:00:06.006
I'd like to know about italian fashion

00:00:06.039 --> 00:00:08.141
and the way you dress your clothes in stylish 

00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:08.975
So I'd like someone 

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:10.276
to teach me the way you dress

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.347
Hi Tabitha, my name is Chiara

00:00:14.381 --> 00:00:15.215
I live in Milano...

00:00:15.281 --> 00:00:17.117
and I'm a costume designer and stylist

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.885
We can explore a new look 

00:00:18.952 --> 00:00:20.487
in an italian way for you

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:47.814
Hey, Tabitha!

00:00:47.847 --> 00:00:49.082
Finally!

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:50.917
 Hello

00:00:52.752 --> 00:00:53.920
So, Tabitha...

00:00:53.953 --> 00:00:56.056
what about this trip to Italy?

00:00:56.122 --> 00:00:56.956
Is it the first time for you? 

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.857
Yes, Yes.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:58.925
- Yes? And for you Susan?
- Yes.

00:00:58.992 --> 00:00:59.592
Fashion capital

00:00:59.626 --> 00:01:01.294
- Milano is the fashion capital
- Yes

00:01:01.361 --> 00:01:02.228
Would you like a coffee?

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:03.363
Espresso

00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:06.499
But, are you studying about fashion?

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.135
Yeah, I'm studying fashion at MA university

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:11.971
What is your personal fashion imagination?

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:14.741
I think clothes say who you are

00:01:14.808 --> 00:01:17.177
Fashion reveals the soul

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.045
of the person who dress it

00:01:19.079 --> 00:01:20.046
And you, Susan?

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.414
Why are you here?

00:01:21.448 --> 00:01:22.982
We always have such fun

00:01:23.016 --> 00:01:24.884
We have a girly time together

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:26.119
 This what I do, as a mother 

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:28.755
just tend to live for my daughter 

00:01:28.788 --> 00:01:30.056
I want to show you...

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.759
the world of fashion in Milano

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:35.161
I'm curios to see your reaction

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:38.565
about the underground fashion 

00:01:38.598 --> 00:01:39.833
in this city

00:01:39.866 --> 00:01:40.633
  Can we go?

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:41.935
Yes, I'm really curious  

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:43.436

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:06.159

00:02:06.192 --> 00:02:07.760
