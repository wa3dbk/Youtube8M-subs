Hey guys Maxine here and I have in front
of me the Seidio Active HTC Thunderbolt

00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:12.513
Rubberized Hard Case on Silicone with
the additional holster that comes with it.

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:15.249
Now this holster is a standard
holster as you can see here.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:19.104
It does have the belt clip on the
back which swivels and rotates.

00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:25.276
You can carry your Thunderbolt
either horizontally or vertically on to your belt.

00:00:26.194 --> 00:00:32.335
So standard belt clip and this will lock
your case in place and allow you to

00:00:32.502 --> 00:00:37.874
unhinge it from the holster itself so I
will be giving a demonstration with actual

00:00:37.974 --> 00:00:41.577
case inside but first just a
quick overview of the case.

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:50.738
This case is a 1 mm thick case with
the silicone and the plastic on it so it

00:00:50.838 --> 00:00:56.710
is pretty lightweight and the keys raises
the camera away from any flat surface to

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.246
protect the lens which is
a really nice feature.

00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:05.737
It is easy to put on.
You remove your case, thanks to the top

00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:11.576
and bottom pieces of the case itself here
so you just remove the hard plastic shell

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.478
and then the silicone will come right off.

00:01:13.762 --> 00:01:19.669
So all your ports and your buttons are
still accessible and protected using the

00:01:19.802 --> 00:01:23.006
case and the edges of the case don't interfere
with any of the buttons or the

00:01:23.172 --> 00:01:27.043
keyboard or your touch screens.
And that is really great especially

00:01:27.143 --> 00:01:30.580
because precision cut outs are really
important for cases like this.

00:01:30.997 --> 00:01:35.903
Now as you can see here this will
be compatible with the holster all it comes

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.744
with and that all you have to do is slide
the case in, snap it in and it is now in

00:01:43.878 --> 00:01:48.182
place and ready to go.
Now when you want to release your phone

00:01:48.282 --> 00:01:52.704
all you can do is press on this little
button and it will release your HTC

00:01:52.904 --> 00:01:57.909
