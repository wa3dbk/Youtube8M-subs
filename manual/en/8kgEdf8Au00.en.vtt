00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.380
I broke my driver side mirror while getting out of garage

00:00:22.724 --> 00:00:24.164
Ordered a pair on line

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.800
The mirrors look good. Black in color. Paint to match your car

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:43.494
Before you begin, make sure you have enough room to keep the door open till you are done. Don't close the door once you pry open the inside plastic cover, If you do you will break the plastic cover.

00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:53.255
Have the tools ready before starting. you need a small flat head screw driver/pry bar and a 11mm socket/wrench.

00:01:00.473 --> 00:01:07.473
Be gentle when you pull the cover off. The cover is held inside 2 holes at the bottom with plastic tabs. They break easily when you pull it with force. Try to pull it up a little and out.

00:01:26.462 --> 00:01:28.622
Push the tab and pull the plug out

00:01:33.413 --> 00:01:38.133
Unscrew  the nuts with a 11 mm socket and ratchet. I didn't have one handy.

00:01:55.669 --> 00:02:12.500
Once you have the 3 nuts off, you can easily pull the broken mirror assembly out of the door

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:52.755
Put the new mirror into the door. Align the 3 screws into the holes from out side and put on the nuts from inside and tighten with hand

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Tighten (just enough)  the nuts with a socket to hold the light weight mirror.

00:03:14.954 --> 00:03:19.514
Put the inside plastic cover into the holes and push to fix to the door

00:03:19.514 --> 00:03:22.274
We are done. Test mirror adjustment with the power button

00:03:27.435 --> 00:03:34.435
I haven't painted my mirror. I have a black one on left and silver on right, I am ok with it. I may change the one on right in future as I have a pair.
