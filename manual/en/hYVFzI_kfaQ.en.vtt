00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:05.700
Now that I've taught you in Catering 101 some
tips on cutting some fresh fruits, we're going

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.400
to combine them all and make a beautiful fresh
fruit salad. You can use it for entertaining

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.900
or just to feed your family at home. I like
to start with the brightest colors on the

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.070
bottom, whatever I have the most of. I have
a lot of this beautiful papaya, so I'm going

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.789
to put this as the bed of my fruit salad.
I'll put lots of it out there, and this will

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:31.720
be the base. I'm basically making a well with
it. In the inside, I think I'm going to add

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:40.079
the brightness of these beautiful, beautiful
juicy pineapples. They're going to be my inside

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:47.620
and there'll be a reason why in a second and
I'll show you. Now along the outside edges,

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:54.049
I'm going to put some of these really pretty
although like colored orange wedges, so that

00:00:54.049 --> 00:01:00.590
you can see how pretty they are. Almost like
a little display. There we go. And some of

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:09.320
the chunks just to sprinkle on there. To that
 , I'm going to add some pretty grapes along

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:23.799
the outside edge and some of these beautiful
sliced green apples. Lots of colors and lots

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:32.490
of textures. I'm going to add a few strawberries,
which I've already rinsed and just scatter

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.880
them around. If you have a little more time,
I like to lop off the tops and slice them.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.000
But this is just a really pretty colorful
display for folks to just pick through and

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.380
grab what they want. Next I'm going to put
a little garnish. Remember our beautiful pomegranates.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:57.950
I'm going to sprinkle some seeds along the
outside and the top. Beautiful. And our bananas

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.369
which we know have a very quick shelf life.
They're going to be on the top so people can

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:10.380
grab them first while they're still so pretty.
Then the crowning finish if you reserved your

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:17.160
pineapple top, it'll be the king of the hill.
Fresh fruit platter. Enjoy it
