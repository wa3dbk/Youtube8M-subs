00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.640
Today we are going to show you part number
8351D from Master Lock.

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:10.940
This is their Smart Bracket Universal U-Lock
and Cable Lock carrier bracket.

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.420
One bracket comes with each of these, and
it is fairly simple onto install onto a bike.

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:18.870
You simply just put it on the frame, you slide
your lock in through the mechanism there,

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.480
and we will show you how all that is done
momentarily.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.300
But first we are going to show you how this
actually operates.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.130
Now, as you can see here, the brackets go
in through the back here.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.490
You can see, this is where you tighten them
up with a flathead screwdriver, like so.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.980
Righty tighty, lefty loosey.

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:41.140
After you remove this from the bracket itself,
this is what you will be fitting the locking

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.230
mechanism through.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.730
Like this, it operates with flathead screws,
which allow you to open it as wide as you

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:49.550
need to for whatever you need to.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.399
Now, just on a quick note here, it comes with
two of these top parts here, one for 12-mm

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.880
diameter and smaller or the larger 13-mm diameter
and larger.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.760
But for our purposes today we will only be
needing the 12.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.139
We are just going to attach a common bike
lock.

00:01:05.139 --> 00:01:06.270
I will show you how it works.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.409
Okay now I am going to go ahead and put this
on our bike.

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.509
Usually pick a nice clean area of the frame.

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:13.009
We are going to use this area here.

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.969
You simply slide it around and make sure you
do not go over the cable.

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:21.479
And then simply put it into the slots back,
on the back side here, as we showed earlier,

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.560
and then tighten down with these two screws
here.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.909
It is just about tightened as far as we can
go.

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.759
At this point it is probably good to adjust
it kind of where you want it to be.

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.670
And notice the excess, here.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.749
At this point you would actually be slicing
this off.

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:40.529
Take a pair of scissors, a shears, whatever
you can find to cut these pieces off to make

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:44.259
sure it is always secure to your bike, and
your bike alone.

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:49.700
Now we are going to go ahead and show you
what this portion does, here.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.549
To get this off, you simply just push up and
it slides right off.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.259
I will show you how to tighten this down and
what you can put inside of it.

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:01.039
Okay, now that we have gotten everything tightened
up, you tighten up the lock, using these screws

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:02.450
here.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.990
Just use a regular flathead screwdriver like
before.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:12.740
And then you just slide the lock into place
until you hear it click, and everything is

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.510
all set to go.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:20.799
And there you have it for part number 8351D
from Master Lock, their Smart Bracket Universal

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:22.720
U-Lock and Cable Lock carrier bracket.
