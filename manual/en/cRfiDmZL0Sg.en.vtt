Hi I'm Cheryl Najafi with Everyday Dishes

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:06.800
and today we're gonna do an easy one skillet shrimp and quinoa dish.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:10.340
[ Upbeat Music ]

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.640
Place a large four to five quart sauce pan or skillet over medium heat and melt three table spoons of butter

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:21.100
then add 1 cup of onion and two cups of
chopped celery.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.520
Cook for three to four minutes until onion has began to soften.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.100
Add three cloves of pressed garlic

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.620
and let it bloom in the pan for no longer than about 30 seconds

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.720
you don't want to over cook your garlic.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.740
Add two cups of uncooked quinoa and stir to combine everything.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.220
Cook for 1 minute toasting the quinoa

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.020
then pour four cups of chicken broth into the pan.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.080
Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat to low

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.780
then add one teaspoon of oregano, a teaspoon of thyme, a teaspoon of paprika

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.480
three tablespoons of tomato paste and one teaspoon of salt.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.100
Stir to combine and then cover and let
simmer for 15 minutes.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.400
After the quinoa has simmered for about
15 minutes remove the lid and stir

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.420
add one pound of uncooked tail-on shrimp to the top of the quinoa.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.620
The shrimp will probably cover the entire top of the dish

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:18.200
so you may have to nestle a few of them into the mixture, but trust me they'll all fit.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.640
Replace the lid then allow the shrimp to simmer for about three to four minutes until they are cooked through

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.380
they'll turn nice and pink.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.880
Remove the lid and test the quinoa for doneness.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:30.960
Now, you'll know the quinoa is done when it's soft

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.420
but it still pops in your mouth a bit when you eat it.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.000
Remove the skillet from the heat.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.780
Now stir in a half a teaspoon of garlic powder and a half a teaspoon of red pepper flakes

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.000
into three tablespoons of melted butter.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.360
Drizzle the butter over the shrimp.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:50.500
Now spritz the quinoa and shrimp with half of a fresh lemon

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.740
and garnish with fresh parsley and serve
immediately.

This dish is so beautiful you can actually take the pan right to the table

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.140
and because we've steamed the raw shrimp

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.600
they are so delicate and flavorful.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.460
