Flipping Houses | For Fun and Profit

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:08.960
Flipping houses has come to be somewhat of
a slang term in real estate investing used

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.810
to refer to any type of deal (i.e. wholesale,
rehab, mortgage assignment, etc.) that is

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:16.110
done in a quick manner.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.161
For the purpose of this writing I am going
to focus on the ‘true’ flipping house

00:00:20.161 --> 00:00:22.700
strategy also known as fix and flipping.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.300
A fix and flip usually involves the buying
of a distressed property, fixing it up, and

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.570
then selling it for a profit.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.160
Flipping houses is usually a short-term real
estate investment strategy that involves a

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.840
quick turn-around and quick money.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:44.750
Flipping Houses | The Steps

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:48.580
There are 6 major steps when it comes to flipping
houses.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.960
In the following posts we will get into more
detail on each of these steps, but here is

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.140
a general outline of what you will need to
do to complete a fix and flip.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.630
Find the deal – You will likely look through
many deals before you find the right one.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.580
You will be looking for a house that has equity
and is priced low.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:17.610
Remember in real estate investing, you make
your money when you buy the house.

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.220
Evaluate the deal – You must do your due
diligence before you actually purchase the

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:23.390
property.

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:29.140
Make sure to look into the location and market,
after repair value, cost for repairs, time

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:37.490
for repairs, deed restrictions, liens, and
title issues.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.189
Fund the deal – There are many ways to fund
your purchase when flipping houses, but the

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:48.549
most common ways are private money and hard
money loans.

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.060
Fix the house – When flipping houses you
are not looking to tear it down to the studs

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.680
and make it the nicest house in the neighborhood,
you just want to get it up to par with the

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:59.580
rest of the neighborhood.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:07.720
Typically carpet, caulk, paint, and landscaping
will get you there.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.260
Market the house – You can choose to list
the home with a REALTOR or sell the home ‘by

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.260
owner.’

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:23.069
Each option has it’s own advantages and
disadvantages so evaluate your selection carefully.

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:26.730
Sell and profit - If you have done your job
correctly your home will sell quickly and

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.160
you can move onto your next deal.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.309
Flipping Houses | Conclusion

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:36.139
Flipping houses is one of the sexiest of all
the real estate investing strategies, but

00:02:36.139 --> 00:02:41.230
don’t let the glamor and hype of the T.V.
shows and other programs fool you.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.290
There is a lot of research and work involved
with a fix and flip, and many beginning investors

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:51.560
have quickly found themselves in over their
heads on their first, second, and even tenth

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.069
deal.

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.700
My biggest advice for any investor looking
to get into flipping houses is to educate

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.900
yourself, find a deal with big margins (stay
away from the low equity deals until you have

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.069
more experience), and work with someone with
experience if possible.

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:15.379
