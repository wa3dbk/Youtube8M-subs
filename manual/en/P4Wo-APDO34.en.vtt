00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Hey guys Welcome back to the Hype! Lets get

00:00:34.219 --> 00:00:38.879
ready for another Kingdom Hearts Theory from
HMK! Kingdom Hearts is well known for have

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.239
many mysterious characters and secrets, some
with motives and actions that still have yet

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:48.149
to be explained, one of those glaring examples
is Xemnas, leader of Organization XIII and

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.120
Xehanort�s Nobody.
Although he is seen as one the most dangerous

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.739
villains in the Kingdom Hearts series, he
has shown to harbor a secret agenda that is

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.249
connected to Aqua and Ventus is someway that
may point at a redeeming side to the Superior

00:00:59.249 --> 00:01:02.100
of the In between.
Another side to Xemnas can truly show that

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.590
he isn�t entirely Evil and that his motives
may be influenced by 2 entities where he would

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.900
be caught in between, which can coincide with
his nature as a Nobody.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.790
The Theory is that Xemnas longs to reunite
to with Ventus, and Aqua, a feeling that is

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.040
channeled through Terra. A multitude of recent
facts have pointed to this Conclusion, and

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.400
once I�m through you may see Xemnas in a
totally different Light.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.620
Now we need to understand the beginnings of
Xemnas and his connection to Terra, Xehanort

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:32.670
and the others. In Birth By Sleep, Master
Xehanort removed his Heart and took over Terra�s

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.960
Body and Heart, Terra�s Mind was then left
over in Terra�s Armor.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.310
After landing in the radiant Garden from the
X-Blade�s destruction Terra Xehanort battles

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.950
Aqua and falls into the Realm of Darkness,
Aqua saves him be flying her armor and Keyblade

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.350
back to the realm of Light but Terra Xehanort
loses all his memories and is taken in by

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.580
Ansem the Wise and becomes Apprentice Xehanort.
Along the line Apprentice Xehanort wishes

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.830
to seek Kingdom Hearts, Takes on the name
Ansem and discards his body. his Body the

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:08.360
goes on the Become Xemnas, So Xemnas is technically
the Body of Terra originally, but that should

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.379
be a given.
Xemnas then enshrines Aqua�s armor in a

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:16.769
room he built that is known as the Chamber
of Repose, there he visits the armor, calling

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.870
it friend and would have conversations with
it for hours each visit. Later it is revealed

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.870
that Xemnas� intentions for Setting up a
based in Castle Oblivion is to find the Chamber

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.239
of Waking, in which Ventus� Body rested.
But why is he doing all of this? Isn�t he

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.159
a Nobody, Xehanort�s Nobody in fact! Well
this is partially true but the reasoning why

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.359
he is doing all of this is actually quite
clear once you put on the pieces where the

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.099
lay.
First off in Dream Drop Distance it revealed

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.739
that Nobodies can restore their Hearts over
time, which is the truth within the lie that

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:52.680
Nobodies don�t have hearts for their entire
existence. And Xemnas being the oldest Nobody,

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.239
it stands the reason he restored his heart
long before any other nobody. Remember this

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.790
because it is important.
Now the Heart is a powerful entity, it has

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.749
the power to weaken or strengthen us. But
it also has been revealed to have the power

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:09.709
to lead us and speak to our being, guiding
us without explanation. When a heart speaks

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.590
it is nearly impossible to ignore it�s decisions.
In both Dream Drop Distance and RE:Coded it

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:19.590
is reveal that despite losing one�s own
memory, the existence of the memory itself

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:26.590
and catalysts are forever etched into ones
Heart. Specifically these instances.

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:04.019
With the case of Xemnas, this is what spurred
him to create the Organization 13 and his

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:07.790
focus on the recusant�s sigil. This was
commanded through the motives that were etched

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:12.040
into Xehanort�s Heart, and though it resides
within Ansem it still has shown to have power

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:17.340
over Xemna�s Heart, however�.Xehanort�s
heart isn�t alone and may not be only heart

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.810
affecting Xemnas.
At the end of BBS it revealed that Xehanort�s

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:25.030
and Terra�s Heart have been united and has
been struggling for years now. So with the

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.630
memories of Terra�s friends etched into
Terra�s Heart,

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:34.440
this is what has been leading Xemnas to feverishly
search for his friend Ventus, and is the reason

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.370
why he hold�s Aqua�s Armor so dear.
This shown to be true in Re:COM and RE:coded

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:47.370
as a Heart has the capacity to remember the
fact that you knew those who you have forgotten.

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:13.600
This angle would prove that Xemnas� being,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.170
and his heart are pushing him to find Ventus,
to reunite with his �Friend� and with

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:23.060
Aqua�s armor. Going even further Xemnas
may ever already remember Ventus somehow,

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.750
although very vaguely as when Roxas goes into
a coma in 358/2 Days, Xemnas says to himself

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:34.310
as he watches over Roxas, �So Sleep has
taken you yet again�� referencing Ventus�

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:37.600
unfortunate destiny and Roxas� resemblance
to him.

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.680
Actual memories of Aqua and Ventus however
are unfortunately lock within the Lingering

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:46.400
will. This can prove why Xemnas considers
Aqua�s armor the friend, not knowing exactly

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:51.200
who wore it, as the heart tells him that he
had dear friends, but without the memory he

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.410
doesn�t know exactly who they are, what
the look like etc.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:01.940
Another clue to this Is how Xemnas even found
castle oblivion, remember CO is a transformed

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.880
Land of Depature, and the fact that Xehanort
harbors not only Terra�s Heart but Eraqus�

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.500
heart as well, Xemnas may have been lead to
find it by all of their hearts, but for a

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.980
different reason each heart.
So it may be possible that beneath that cold

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.880
and seemingly unfeeling exterior, Xemnas is
a very conflicted and tortured man.

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:24.530
Obviously he must follow the path laid out
for him as Xehanort�s Nobody, Commander

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:29.770
of the Organization and Future Seeker of Darkness
a path that is dictated by Xehanort�s Heart,

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.370
but at the same time, Terra�s Heart is telling
him to find Ventus, and Aqua as Terra�s

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:39.020
last words that one they he would set things
right for them. Xemnas is carrying out both

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:43.670
of those wills that have confused gamers and
the organization for years!

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:48.320
In Conclusion, I theorized that Xemnas�
heart and being not only carry traits of Xehanort

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:53.520
and Terra on the outside but also have conflicting
feelings on the inside as well. Though he

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.360
may be one of Kingdom Hearts most dastardly
Villains, he seems to the capacity to harbor

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.220
a compassionate side as well.
I hoped you enjoyed this Kingdom Hearts Theory!

00:07:03.220 --> 00:07:07.580
Do You think may have some Just hidden motives
that is brought forth by Terra�s Heart,
