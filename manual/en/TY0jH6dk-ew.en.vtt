00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.902
Audience Member: Good
morning, Mr. President.

00:00:02.902 --> 00:00:04.371
I'm from Botswana.

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:06.606
I just wanted to find out
how committed

00:00:06.606 --> 00:00:10.810
is the U.S. to assisting Africa
in closing gender

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:12.912
inequalities, which
are contributing

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:15.915
to gender-based violence,
which it threatens

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:19.552
the achievement of many
Millennium Development goals,

00:00:19.552 --> 00:00:22.088
such as access
to universal education,

00:00:22.088 --> 00:00:23.957
eradicating HIV and AIDS.

00:00:24.758 --> 00:00:29.095
The President: Well,
listen, you will

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:34.167
not find anybody more committed
than I am to this issue,

00:00:34.167 --> 00:00:35.201
and let me tell you why.

00:00:37.937 --> 00:00:39.906
First of all, I was
mentioning earlier,

00:00:39.906 --> 00:00:43.676
if you look comparatively at
countries around

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:47.380
the world, what societies
succeed, which ones don't,

00:00:47.747 --> 00:00:53.586
one of the single-best
measures of whether

00:00:53.586 --> 00:00:56.623
a country succeeds or not is
how it treats its women.

00:00:56.623 --> 00:01:03.062
(applause)

00:01:03.062 --> 00:01:04.230
And if you
think about

00:01:04.230 --> 00:01:08.368
it, it makes sense, because,
first of all,

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:12.038
women are half your population.

00:01:12.038 --> 00:01:16.800
So if you have a team --
we just finished

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.600
the World Cup, right -- if you
have a soccer team --

00:01:21.714 --> 00:01:23.883
what you all call a football
team --

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:31.157
and you go out and the other
side has a full team

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.326
and you send out half your team,

00:01:33.326 --> 00:01:37.831
how are you going to do? You will not do as well.

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:45.505
If you are not empowering
half of your population

00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:48.007
that means you have
half as few possible

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:51.478
scientists, half as few
possible engineers.

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:59.586
You are crippling your own
development unnecessarily.

00:01:59.586 --> 00:02:01.120
So that's point
number one.

00:02:01.721 --> 00:02:06.326
Point number two is if you
educate and empower

00:02:06.326 --> 00:02:12.565
and respect a mother, then
you are educating

00:02:12.565 --> 00:02:19.506
the children, right?

00:02:19.506 --> 00:02:24.143
So with a man, you educate
him, yeah, it's okay.

00:02:24.143 --> 00:02:26.346
(laughter)

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:28.414
A woman, you
educate her, and suddenly

00:02:28.414 --> 00:02:34.354
you've got an entire
village, an entire region,

00:02:34.354 --> 00:02:36.956
an entire country suddenly
is becoming educated.

00:02:38.024 --> 00:02:41.528
So this is an absolute
priority for us.

00:02:41.528 --> 00:02:47.834
And we'll be discussing
this with the heads

00:02:47.834 --> 00:02:51.237
of state and government
that we see next week.

00:02:51.237 --> 00:02:56.476
And we've seen some
progress on some fronts,

00:02:56.476 --> 00:03:00.914
but this is where
sometimes traditions

00:03:00.914 --> 00:03:01.915
can get in the way.

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:06.419
And as many of you know,
my father was from Kenya,

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.990
and -- (applause) --

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.991
that's the Kenyan contingent.

00:03:11.991 --> 00:03:15.595
(laughter)

00:03:15.595 --> 00:03:17.597
But I think
what applies to Kenya

00:03:17.597 --> 00:03:20.567
is true and applies to many
of the countries in Africa

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:22.802
-- and this is not unique
to Africa, we see this

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:30.109
in other parts of the world
-- some of the old ways

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:35.014
of gender relations might
have made sense

00:03:35.014 --> 00:03:38.017
in a particular setting.

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:42.622
So in Kenya, for example,
in the Luo tribe,

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:44.624
polygamy existed.

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:47.927
It was based on the idea
that women had their

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:51.798
own compounds, they had their
own land,

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:57.804
and so they were empowered in
that area to be self-sufficient.

00:03:59.906 --> 00:04:02.775
And then urbanization
happened; suddenly

00:04:02.775 --> 00:04:09.749
the men may be traveling to the
city and suddenly there

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.386
is another family in the city
and the women

00:04:13.386 --> 00:04:16.255
who were left back in the
villages may not be empowered

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:18.758
in the same way.

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:22.462
So what worked then might
not work today --

00:04:22.462 --> 00:04:23.830
in fact, does not work today.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.365
And if you seek to --

00:04:25.365 --> 00:04:30.737
if you try to duplicate
traditions that were based

00:04:30.737 --> 00:04:34.140
on an entirely different economy
and an entirely different

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.244
society and entirely different
expectations, well,

00:04:38.244 --> 00:04:41.414
that's going to break down.

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:42.415
It's not going to work.

00:04:43.216 --> 00:04:49.055
So as a continent, you
have to update

00:04:49.055 --> 00:04:50.256
and create new traditions.

00:04:50.256 --> 00:04:52.258
And that's where
young people come in.

00:04:52.258 --> 00:04:54.260
You don't have to accept
what's the old ways

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:55.261
of doing things.

00:04:55.261 --> 00:04:57.797
You can respect the past
and respect traditions

00:04:57.797 --> 00:05:00.066
while while recognizing
they have

00:05:00.066 --> 00:05:03.136
to be adapted to a new age.

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:05.538
Now, I have to say there
are some traditions

00:05:05.538 --> 00:05:07.774
that just have to be gotten rid
of and there's

00:05:07.774 --> 00:05:09.475
no excuse for them.

00:05:09.475 --> 00:05:14.213
Female genital mutilation
-- I'm sorry, I don't

00:05:14.213 --> 00:05:16.683
consider that a tradition
worth hanging on to.

00:05:16.683 --> 00:05:17.817
(applause)

00:05:17.817 --> 00:05:23.356
I think that's
a tradition that

00:05:23.356 --> 00:05:27.627
is barbaric and should
be eliminated.

00:05:27.627 --> 00:05:33.399
Violence towards women --

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:35.535
I don't care for that tradition.

00:05:35.535 --> 00:05:38.137
I'm not interested in it.

00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:39.138
It needs to be eliminated.

00:05:39.138 --> 00:05:41.407
(applause)

00:05:41.407 --> 00:05:47.013
So part of the task is to
find what traditions

00:05:47.013 --> 00:05:49.282
are worth hanging on to and
what traditions

00:05:49.282 --> 00:05:52.085
you got to get rid of.

00:05:52.085 --> 00:05:54.620
I mean, there was a
tradition in medicine

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.758
that if you were sick,
they would bleed you.

00:05:58.758 --> 00:06:00.593
That's a bad tradition.

00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:01.894
And we discovered,

00:06:01.894 --> 00:06:05.665
let's try other things -- like medicine.

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:09.502
(laughter)

00:06:09.502 --> 00:06:12.872
So we don't
have to cling

00:06:12.872 --> 00:06:15.208
on to things that just don't work.

00:06:15.208 --> 00:06:19.312
And subjugating women does
not work,

00:06:19.312 --> 00:06:21.314
and the society will fail as a
consequence.

00:06:21.314 --> 00:06:22.315
(applause)

00:06:22.315 --> 00:06:24.951
So everything we do, every
program that we have --

00:06:24.951 --> 00:06:27.520
any education program
that we have, any health

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.392
program that we have, any
small business

00:06:33.392 --> 00:06:35.428
or economic development program
that we have,

00:06:35.428 --> 00:06:41.734
we will write into it a gender
equality component to it.

00:06:41.734 --> 00:06:44.470
This is not just going
to be some side note.

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:48.241
This will be part of
everything that we do.

00:06:49.542 --> 00:06:51.544
And the last point I'm
going to make --

00:06:51.544 --> 00:06:58.050
in order for this to be
successful, all the men here

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:02.855
have to be just as committed to
empowering women

00:07:02.855 --> 00:07:03.856
as the women are.

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:04.957
(applause)

00:07:04.957 --> 00:07:05.725
That's
important.

00:07:05.725 --> 00:07:07.393
(applause)

00:07:07.393 --> 00:07:15.768
So don't think that this
is just a job for women,

00:07:16.035 --> 00:07:17.236
to worry about
women's issues.

00:07:17.236 --> 00:07:18.571
The men have to
worry about it.

00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:22.441
And if you're a strong
man, you should

00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:23.843
not feel threatened by
strong women.

00:07:23.843 --> 00:07:24.944
(applause)
