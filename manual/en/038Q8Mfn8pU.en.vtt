00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.010
(heart beat)

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.140
- So one of the questions patients rumble

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.080
through their head is,
what if I do nothing

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.940
if I've been diagnosed?

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.580
So when you've been diagnosed
with heart valve disease,

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.510
and you've been told
you need heart surgery.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.750
A lot of people are very scared,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.890
and think maybe I just
won't have the surgery.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.790
I'm afraid, which is very common,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.500
but the statistics and the research shows

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.070
for aortic stenosis, as an example,

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.140
that half the patients diagnosed

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.100
with severe aortic stenosis,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.180
who have an onset of symptoms,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:57.620
will die

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.340
within only a two year period

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.350
unless they get treated.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.290
So that's a very important
piece of information

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.680
for those folks evaluating whether or not

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.940
I'm going to have this operation.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.200
The real tough part
about heart valve disease

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.360
is that this is a structrual
issue, there's no medicine

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.640
that you can take that's
going to ultimately cure

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.270
your disease, and I
know as humans we're all

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.740
looking for that easy
fix or the quick fix.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.610
Unfortunately, with heart
valve disease if you choose

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.820
to go down the path of ignorance,

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.480
meaning you ignore it.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.150
The research suggests that
it's a very dangerous path.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.630
When you hear that you've been diagnosed

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.460
with heart valve disease,
your world stops.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.270
You get isolated, you have
fear, you're confused.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.820
I can tell you, looking
back on it, seven years ago,

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.630
I am beyond thankful

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:04.460
for what that experience
brought into my life.
