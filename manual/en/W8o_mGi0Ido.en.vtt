00:00:41.777 --> 00:00:46.608
About a year ago the first pictures of a camouflaged higher V40 surfaced. 

00:00:47.279 --> 00:00:55.543
So that should be the XC40 ,we thought. But no, it was this car: the V40 Cross Country.

00:00:55.972 --> 00:01:08.374
Not a real SUV, but 4 cm higher with a bodykit: new mirrors, sideskirts, roofrails etc. 

00:00:01.896 --> 00:01:14.626
So a little more tought look. that is the idea. Is it capable?

00:01:14.626 --> 00:01:20.360
Well, this version has 4WD, but that is only an option on the T5-version. 

00:01:30.016 --> 00:01:37.830
So, had this car any use besides the V40? What should we do with it?

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:49.724
Maybe we should compare it with an R-design version. It looks different and people are willing to buy that. 

00:01:51.715 --> 00:02:01.494
Of course this version had value because of the 4WD. On these icy roads, that speaks for itself.

00:02:02.331 --> 00:02:08.745
But the T5 4WD costs a lot of money compared to the D2 or T3. On others markets the T5 will be the only version.

00:02:10.646 --> 00:02:13.766
In The Netherlands however, most version will have light engines with 2WD. 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:28.278
Technically this is just equal to a V40. Dashboard the same, minus this hill descent button here. 

00:02:30.388 --> 00:02:39.145
The drive is very similair aswell. A little more bodyroll, but nothing bad. So nice and tight suspension.

00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:47.764
I got to experience the steering a little more, and it is better than I thought, but not as good as it should be.

00:02:49.841 --> 00:02:58.949
The balance of the car however is really very nice. The way the car reacts to throttle response and so on.

00:03:16.683 --> 00:03:27.037
 Th 4WD is a Haldex system. So power to the rear when you loose traction on the front wheels. 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:34.479
Nowadays that goes really fast and the system works really nice. 

00:03:36.572 --> 00:03:43.187
If you hit the throttle on slippery surface, the rear will move. Nice to play with.

00:03:44.459 --> 00:03:50.970
Of course, this never is a real off-roader. It cannot keep power on both left en right wheels with a locked diff. 

00:03:51.362 --> 00:03:53.777
Yesterday I had a little accident on ended up in a ditch. Nothing bad...

00:03:55.557 --> 00:03:59.360
Unfortunately we have no video of it. There is no video right? --"right!"

00:04:15.589 --> 00:04:21.547
You must be real stupid to get off the road like that....

00:04:28.097 --> 00:04:31.488
It costs about 2.000 euro more than a comparable V40. 

00:04:34.128 --> 00:04:42.088
So who will buy it? People who like the looks and want a higher seat. 

00:04:43.233 --> 00:04:47.964
That'll be more important than off-road qualities.

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:57.174
So this car will have it's use, but I would just buy a normal one and save 2 grand. 

00:05:06.224 --> 00:05:12.782
+4WD works great, still great car to drive - 4WD only for T5, not much value over normal V40.
