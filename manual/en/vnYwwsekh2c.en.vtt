00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:10.960
One of the best ways of keeping your coated
dog in a nice coat is frequent brushing. So

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.390
this dog here that we are working with had
a bath about 2 weeks ago. She was all brushed

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:25.300
out for a show about 7 days ago. So if I want
to maintain that in her, I need to do frequent

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.910
brushing. The more frequent brushing, the
less problems you are going to have to deal

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:40.539
with mats. So if I am doing frequent brushing
on her, good girl, you can see that it is

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:52.210
fairly easy for me to bring this pin brush
right through her coat. So this is just maintenance

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.730
brushing and if you do frequent maintenance
brushing, you are really not going to have

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:11.370
to deal with mats. If you bring your dog to
the groomer's for regular brushing, you still

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:17.640
ought to do frequent brushing at home to keep
up on the work that your groomer has done.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.830
That way when you bring your dog back to the
groomer, the groomer is not going to have

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.950
to deal with a lot of mats. They don't have
the same amount of time that you would have

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.580
to work through the mats. So if you bring
a matted dog to a groomer, they are going

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.910
to pull right through those, it's going to
much less comfortable much less pleasant experience

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:44.610
for your dog. If you have frequent brushing
session with yuour dog in between your more

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:51.770
regular grooming stages or your dog's appointment
to a groomer, then the coat will be nicely

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.150
maintained and the dog will be mat free and
comfortable. It is also a way of finding out

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:06.140
whether your dog has any debris stuck in their
coat such as leaves, twigs if you frequent

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:13.730
the woods. Make sure your dog does not have
any parasites, ticks or fleas or anything

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.499
else that might be unusual in your dog's coat
or on the skin.
