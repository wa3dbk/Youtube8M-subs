Well we are just trying to redo the eyes and
only we add this coils in later. We are going

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:21.949
to start melting everything up. Then with
anything that you have this good tip no, the

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:41.150
rubber razor doesn't give so much marks and
its very easy to control. Then always make

00:00:41.150 --> 00:01:20.200
shape here, I have to melt all this off. Melt
all this part in there. The nose if you want

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:41.340
to make a bigger nose you just make a bigger
nose. Well now we are just melting up all

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:56.100
this and next we are going to put this into
the sun structure. We will probably be cut

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:08.299
the shape or the round shape or maybe not
because we didn't do much damage yet.
