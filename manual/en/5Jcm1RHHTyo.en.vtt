00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.190
RUNNING.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.190
SWIMMING.

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.190
RUNNING.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.190
SWIMMING.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:05.190
RUNNING!

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.190
Run off.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:13.019
I've got a video to do.

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.560
Sup guys, Trace here.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.340
Thanks for watching DNews today.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.200
In High School, I was on the track and cross
country teams, but I was ALSO on the swim

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:26.200
team.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.610
Running is exercise.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:28.610
Swimming is too.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:31.350
They're both exercise, and they're both great
in their own way.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.149
But, which is BETTER?

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.789
ITS TIME FOR A SCIENCE THROWDOWN.

00:00:35.789 --> 00:00:40.039
Let's tackle the benefits: Running is easy,
most people have two legs and can probably

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:41.629
walk and run -- if imperfectly.

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:44.480
It’s great cardiovascular exercise.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:49.339
Running USA, the major running and foot racing
advocacy organization, says 30 million people

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.819
took to the streets at least 50 times per
person in 2012.

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:58.739
People who run or jog regularly, even for
a 5 to 10 minutes a day are healthier than

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.320
non-runners, and have a 45% lower cardiovascular
mortality.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.150
Running can build bone density and runners
have later-onset age-related disability and

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.290
3 years added to their lives in comparison
to non-runners.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.980
Swimming has a little higher learning curve.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:16.110
You might have to take swimming lessons, for
one.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.040
But once you've gotten past that hurdle, the
benefits are clear.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.090
Swimming is ALSO great cardiovascular exercise.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.070
A 2008 peer-reviewed study in the International
Journal of Aquatic Research and Education

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.570
followed over 40,000 men for 13 years and
found lower mortality rates than people who

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.230
were sedentary, walkers, and runners.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.990
Resistance training is better than pure cardio
for building bone density and muscle; and

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.540
swimming has resistance, if small.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:50.110
In fact, the butterfly is considered the single
most taxing movement in sports -- it's more

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.080
difficult than bicycling 14 miles per hour
(23kph), or running a 10 minute mile.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.820
Calories burned for either running or swimming
vary depending on your weight and the difficulty

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:59.820
level.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:04.080
Though overall the journal of the American
Statistical Association found swimmers will

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.970
burn 25 percent more calories, but runners
can usually go for longer.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.480
Running's biggest drawback is impact problems,
right?

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.720
It's an impact sport, my Dad always said!

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.280
Maybe not!

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.010
A 21-year-long Stanford study of 1,000 runners
and non-runners found joint problems were

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.090
found equally across both groups.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.600
Minimalist or barefoot running and thick running
shoes also battle within running culture,

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:36.550
but in a comprehensive study of shoes versus
no shoes found the problem was people.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.780
If we're used to running with shoes, and try
barefoot we hurt ourselves; and the opposite

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.780
is true too.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.100
So fight about if you want, but if you do
it right, the science seems to say they're

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.100
both fine,.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:49.330
Long-distance intensive running can cause
health problems -- we've talked about it on

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.010
DNews before..

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.530
Swimming has an obvious drawback; drowning.

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.790
It does happen, though it's pretty damn rare.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.390
Chlorine in swimming pools isn't great for
your skin, but its there to kill disease-causing

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.390
contaminants.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.730
But kids’ over-exposure to chlorine can
reduce testosterone and infant over-exposure

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.490
cause respiratory problems.

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:12.090
This is after hundreds of hours in a pool
environment; so maybe not something everyone

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.130
should be concerned about.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:18.280
It can also be alleviated by swimming in a
lake, ocean, or a saltwater pool.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.940
It seems pretty much a tie to me.

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.459
Overall, both swimming and running promote
cardiovascular health, as long as you don't

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.100
overdo it, and you get the proper training.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.730
With both swimming and running make sure you
talk to someone about proper technique if

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.730
you want to do it right.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:35.660
Just because you can doesn't mean you know
how to do it properly.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:38.520
So which do YOU think is better?

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.819
Why don't you tell us?

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.160
I like both.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.650
Exercise is hard, but so is Going Off Grid.

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:50.120
It's not for everyone.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.030
Going off grid explores the lives of those
who choose a different path.

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:57.170
This pro-snowboarder lives in a tiny house
in Northern California.

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:17.720
The whole thing is only 225 square feet.
