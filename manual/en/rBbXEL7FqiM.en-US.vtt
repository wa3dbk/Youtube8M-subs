00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.280
In which fleet is this first class being used

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.040
On the Boeing 777 and little by little we will have on all Air France flights

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.120
You'll see her in October on flights to SÃ£o Paulo

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.200
In October you will be able to enjoy a good sleep at 10 thousand meters in a great bed

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:40.160
And with total privacy, because when the curtains close you stay inside your cocoon

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.065
It's like a suite

00:02:42.065 --> 00:02:49.185
And a suite, but we do not call it a suite because all the competitors have a suite

00:02:49.185 --> 00:02:56.145
But at Air France we only say "La Premiere" which gives a French touch because it is "La maison Air France"

00:02:56.531 --> 00:03:00.071
It is very fashionable, it is very touch French

00:03:00.571 --> 00:03:06.091
It's La Premiere Suite, but we avoid saying suite

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:17.640
We had the Caravelle, the Constellation and then the Concorde, and everything here reminds us of the Concorde

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:26.080
Because it is very chic, the beige color reminds the interior of the Concorde, we commissioned uniforms beige

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:37.000
So in the first class we want the people who flew at the Concorde to remember how exclusive it was

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:43.440
Will the commissariat's uniform change?

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:52.320
he curators are dedicated and trained for "La Premiere", it is really a specific training

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:59.520
They are volunteers and the only thing different is that they wear a red neckerchief

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:04.320
Can say in French

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.120
"Foulard Rouge" (red scarf)

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.960
Which is the same as the ground staff to the stewards

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:19.920
We all have the same uniform, the difference is that if you have wings, you are a commissioner

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:28.240
Earth people do not have the wing, and here when you have two [berimbelas], it means you're a cabin chief

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.360
And if you have only one, you are the flight attendant

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.680
I understand, the ground personnel wear the same uniform but do not have the wings

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.160
Neither the berimbelas, but the uniform is the same

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:48.040
And the red scarf is the touch "Premiere"
