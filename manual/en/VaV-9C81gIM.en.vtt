Hi, I'm chef tony matassa, today were checking
out Dcs Gas grills, now DCS has different

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.980
sizes and configurations of grills, the one
we have here today is their 36 inch model,

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.720
let's have a look inside.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.320
The cooking grids measure 32 ¼ inches wide
by 20 ¼ inches deep and can comfortably grill

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.309
up to 24, four inch round hamburgers at a
time.

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.170
The cooking grids are made of solid 304 cast
stainless steel, and they are actually reversible

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.489
depending on your cooking needs. Use this
side for things like vegetables and other

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.210
delicate food items, the larger surface area
allows for maximum caramelization. The other

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.769
side of the grids are shaped like a “w”
, which allows grease to be channeled down

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:59.489
to the grease managment system, keeping it
away from the flames. This side of the grids

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.330
work great for searing things like steak.
Now below the cooking grids, we are now looking

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.880
at the heart of this cooking system. DCS's
Radiant ceramic rods cover, basically the

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:15.299
entire grilling area. These ceramic rods radiate
the heat from the burners underneath them,

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.479
providing a very evenly heated grilling surface.
The rods are hollow in the center, adding

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.549
a little extra insulation power, which spreads
out the heat coming from the flames, headed

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.600
up towards the grilling surface. The ceramic
rods are held conveniently in these stainless

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.580
steel trays, making them easy to clean by
simply flipping the tray over and turning

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:39.939
the grill on high and you’re able to burn
off any of the debris that may have accumulated.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:45.479
Under the radiant rod trays, you will find
DCS's stainless steel U-shaped burners. Each

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:51.840
burner produces an impressive 25,000 BTU's
of cooking power. Directly underneath the

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.579
burners, DCS has a heat shield which directs
the heat directly up towards the cooking surface,

00:01:58.579 --> 00:02:03.039
maximizing grilling efficiency.
For adding wood fired flavor, DCS features

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:10.450
a full depth slide out smoker box with a dedicated
3,500 BTU smoker box burner. The lid of the

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.590
smoker box is perforated, which allows your
wood chips to smolder a little longer, instead

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:20.221
of just burning up. The inside is fully welded,
allowing for the option of adding something

00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:23.450
like wine to infuse flavor and moisture into
your food.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.550
Each burner is lit with with it’s own push
and turn electronic spark ignition, and DCS

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:35.130
also includes flash tubes for secondary ignition.
For added versatility, the DCS has a 14,000

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.750
BTU rear infrared burner. Rotisserie motor
that is heavy duty, and capable of turning

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:47.280
up to 50 pounds.. it also features a Smart
Beam light, which has a 40 watt halogen and

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.300
is great for illuminating the whole cooking
area for nighttime grilling.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.770
Other nice features include a removable warming
rack for extra grill real estate, and a full

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.420
width slide out drip pan with a smaller pan
inside of it to allow for emptying debris

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.440
without removing the whole drip pan

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.440
Now we’ll perform our XRF test on DCS’
gas grill.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:14.900
The outside and inside of the grill hood tested
to be 304 stainless steel. The control panel

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:24.530
and drip pan also tested to be 304. The cooking
grids, ceramic tray frames, smoker box, burners,

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.060
heat deflectors, and fire box all tested to
be 304 stainless as well.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.480
