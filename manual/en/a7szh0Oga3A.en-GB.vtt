[Music]

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:13.680
Heather: Hey guys! This is Heather from healthyeatingstartshere.com.
Okay, I got all my teas out because I wanted

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.920
to talk about a question that I’ve gotten
from a bunch of you; is tea healthy. And I

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.850
gave you my quick answer which is yes, but
I wanted to elaborate a little bit and get

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.240
into the different types of tea and how they
compare, how they compare to other things

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.250
as well like coffee.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.649
So the main thing that people think about
tea and whether it’s healthy or not is caffeine

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:41.159
and what level of caffeine it has. So caffeine
does have some downsides; it is a stimulant

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:46.949
and it artificially stimulates your body which
is not usually a good thing. It has been shown

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.329
to be helpful before exercise, in small doses;
you don’t need a ton of it but it helps

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.109
for performance and certain people who are
looking for really high level of performance

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.230
in their exercise or athletics.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.799
But it’s also shown to be a diuretic which
means it flushes water out of your system.

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:09.430
Now Michael Greger had a really awesome article
on Care2 very recently. So I’ll post a link

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:19.210
to that and basically what he showed was that
tea when compared to water had about the same

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:26.240
diuretic effect. I mean they excreted the
same amount of urine, no matter which way.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:33.720
So it’s mostly the water that was producing
the diuretic effect for that. In any case,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.820
when you have it in small doses like over
a day, if you drink a few cups of tea then

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:47.440
the effects are minimal on the diuretic because
you are also getting water in with the tea.

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:53.140
Okay, so pluses and minuses to caffeine, but
the main thing is that tea has a really level

00:01:53.140 --> 00:02:00.560
of antioxidants. So getting those outweighs
the effects of the caffeine, as long as you

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:06.909
are not having a crazy amount and as long
as you mostly drink green or herbal teas and

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:08.450
black tea sometimes.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.000
Okay, so that brings me to the level of caffeine
in different types of tea. So black tea has

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.060
the most caffeine and Earl Grey is the type
of black tea. So those of you who drink Earl

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.220
Grey, just be aware it does have the highest
tea level of caffeine but it has about half

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:28.780
the level of coffee.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:34.760
I read something that said that by weight,
dry tea has more caffeine than dry coffee

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:41.099
beans but when they get infused into the water,
coffee imparts more caffeine to the water

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:48.939
than tea does. So again, black tea has about
half the amount of caffeine as coffee.

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:53.520
And you can get black tea in the bags or you
can get it loose, which is kind of fun; you

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.060
can put it in a little metal ball and infuse
it into your teapot. You can also get black

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.409
tea that is decaffeinated so that’s another
option, although I don’t know about the

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:10.739
process for decaffeinating tea. Sometimes
they use chemicals and that’s not that great.

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:18.000
I probably take the caffeine over the chemicals
depending on the process. Okay and then green

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.909
tea, you can also get in bags or you can get
loose. Green tea has about half of the caffeine

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:31.890
of black tea. So about a quarter of the caffeine
of coffee and it is green, but it’s kind

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.950
of a dark green because it’s dried. And
another big difference between green tea and

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.570
black tea is that they come from the same
plant, the tea plant.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:52.209
But green tea is not oxidized as much as black
tea. So the green tea has more antioxidants

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.599
left in it. So more benefits in green tea,
plus less caffeine. So that’s usually my

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:05.020
choice; that or an herbal tea which has no
caffeine. It’s made from different plants.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.550
So it can be made from pretty much anything.
This one is rose hips and some type of dried

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:14.640
fruit, I actually forgot, but it smells really
good.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.190
So it has no caffeine because it’s not made
from the tea plant. And usually those are

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:25.811
mixed; there are other kinds of herbal teas,
like Rooibos is one of my favorites. This

00:04:25.811 --> 00:04:33.170
one is Rooibos mixed with some calendula flowers
and orange peel and some other nice flavors,

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:36.450
but you can get it straight and it’s just
a red thing.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:46.820
It’s a South African tea, no caffeine and
also tons of antioxidants in Rooibos tea and

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:52.500
Honeybush is another one. This is a Honeybush,
Honeybush looks like green tea, it’s fairly

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:58.060
similar, it’s green. And this is green tea
mixed with cinnamon, cloves, pepper, and cardamom

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.880
to make like a chai which is so tasty.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.940
So those are benefits to tea overall is the
antioxidants that they provide but there are

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.890
also specific teas that you can use for specific
purposes. So if you think of caffeine and

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:18.520
coffee as waking you up at night, you probably
don’t want to be drinking that, but there

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:25.000
are other teas that you can use to help calm
you down and bring you down to a nice mental

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.940
space for you to get to sleep.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.170
And usually, people think of chamomile but
there’s also catnip and when I looked up

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:35.700
recently, it’s Hops flower, which I haven’t
tried but apparently it’s very good for

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:41.800
helping calm you down and get you down to
sleep. And then for stress relief, there are

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:48.120
some specific medicinal herbs that you can
use and I am talking about three in particular;

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:55.360
one is Valerian root. You can find these if
you go to an herbal shop, Valerian root, Schizandra

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:01.830
which is an aromatic herb and very, very good
for stress relief, calming the nerves all

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:02.830
that kind of stuff.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.300
And another called Suma which I haven’t
seen but again, Phil tell me, this is very

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:14.640
good. And for your immune system, you can
get specific teas to help boost your immunity.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.970
Echinacea is one that most people think of.
Ginger is also really good. I love to make

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:26.490
a tea, just in the morning, I just put hot
water and a few very slim, very thin slices

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:31.490
of fresh ginger root in a tea and just let
that sit and steep.

00:06:31.490 --> 00:06:37.780
Squeeze a lemon, really great for soothing
sour throat and then astragalus is one that

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.931
is also really good for the immune system,
a little more difficult to find, but this

00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:45.630
is another one that you’d have to go to
an herbal shop, usually to find. But I saw

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:52.750
recently a tea in a bag that had astragalus
as part of it. So you can see if it’s in

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:58.240
there and rose hips apparently are very effective
at boosting the immune system. So my herbal

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:02.670
fruity tea that I love over here will be good
for immunity.

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:08.340
Okay, that’s it for my rant on tea today.
I hope you all go and enjoy glass. You can

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:14.200
drink it hot or drink it cold, perfect in
the summer to make some ice tea. This is my

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:20.530
fruity rose hips tea. Delicious! Okay, enjoy
and I’ll see you guys next time.

00:07:20.530 --> 00:07:21.010
