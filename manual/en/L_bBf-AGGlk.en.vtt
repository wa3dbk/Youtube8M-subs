00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
[dance music]

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:06.380
[typing]

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.460
Extreme Boards &amp; Blades.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.300
Even for a value-priced game,

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:17.040
it's one of the single-most awful
PC titles I've ever reviewed.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.380
It should come as no surprise that it was
developed in six months on a shoestring budget

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.480
by a small team with little experience,

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.740
but even taking that into consideration,
the results were awful

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.620
and it was just an impressively broken,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.640
unplayable and even deceptively marketed game.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.860
But you know what?

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.500
People snapped it up anyway

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.960
and it eventually sold almost a half-million units

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.500
due to the lower price point,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.060
the fact that Tony Hawk's Pro Skater didn't exist yet,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.220
and a healthy dose of ignorance.

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.640
With this bizarre success, Activision
demanded the production of a sequel,

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.140
Boards &amp; Blades 2,

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.920
developed once again by Silverfish Studios

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.680
and published by Activision Value in 2001.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.300
You'll note there's no "Extreme" prefix in the title,

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.900
and as a far as I know, that's
because Headgames was rolled up

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.160
into the Activision Value label
in the year 2000, and as a result,

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.440
their "Extreme" series was pretty much discontinued.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.280
Or maybe it was euthanized
because games bearing its ugly logo

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.920
were immediately written off as
toxic waste by anyone with a brain.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.180
"The highly anticipated sequel"

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.380
"to the number one PC skateboarding game?"

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.600
NUMBER ONE!

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.800
Says WHO?!

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.860
[chuckles]

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.020
"Start with improved graphics,
more tricks, incredible gameplay"

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.500
"and WE MEAN GAMEPLAY!"

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.700
Okay, not only do I find the awkwardness
of that selling point downright palpable,

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.060
but considering the original had no gameplay at all,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.940
and its graphics barely existed,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.280
this means nothing.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.660
The rest of the blurbs and bullet points
are all just as fluffy and meaningless,

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:45.940
so I'm going to ignore them and dive into the game.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:50.080
Boards &amp; Blades 2 begins with some logo animations,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.460
the foregoes any kind of intro
video because it's pointless,

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.720
and drops you straight into the main menu

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.200
...which has somehow managed to be 37 times
uglier and tackier than the first game's,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.600
which is not a good sign.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.240
However, one good sign is that they've
learned in the controls department

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.680
as the hideously convoluted control scheme

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:11.380
has been replaced with one far more straightforward.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.460
You could "Go Skate" to go skate.

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.540
Go figure.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.440
There are four modes to choose from:

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.100
Free Ride, Two Timer, Get in Line, and Pro Session.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.580
Pick a mode like you would a fine booger,

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.780
and you'll be given the choice
of five suspects to play as.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.380
Although there's a bit of an imbalance here:

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.700
only one of them is wearing skates, so... okay.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.620
And I also have no idea what
the criminal theme is all about.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.160
Maybe they're saying skaters are criminal scum.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.160
Or maybe it's because they were arrested

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.900
due to their involvement in the first game,

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.660
which is indeed a felony.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:45.800
Finally, pick a level from the selection of six,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.740
or rather one, since that's all you get to begin with.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.880
Let's start with Free Ride mode,

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.640
which is a, you guessed it,

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.800
SOULFUL VOICE:
Free fly, baby.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.280
LGR:
Uh, wait, that's not practice mode.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.380
Close enough. This is a mode allowing you to practice

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.620
with the clunky player movement
and lackluster trick system.

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:08.100
Although, I've gotta say, this is a mighty
big improvement over the original game.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:11.780
And yeah, that's kind of like saying
being executed by firing squad

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:14.820
is better than being burned alive, but still, it's something.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:16.820
It's obvious that Silverfish Studios

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.200
learned their lesson by the time they made this game

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.540
because the skating actually
doesn't make me want to vomit.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.480
In fact, I'd say it's practically passable.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.540
You can actually make turns that feel like turns,

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.600
both on the ground and in the air,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.980
which makes pulling off moves a whole lot easier.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.680
But as is the case with most of this game,

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.680
for every upside there's a downside.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.900
And one big one here is that
actually landing tricks and not bailing

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.180
seems to be up to the hands of fate.

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.480
Or a random number generator, one of the two.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.380
Sometimes you'll stick a landing

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.000
that even Larisa Latynina covered
in Super Glue couldn't pull off,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.180
and other times you'll fall flat on your face

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.480
after executing a perfectly legit move.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.100
This is especially annoying in any of the
modes that keep track of your score to win,

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.120
which is 75% of them.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.360
The first of those is Two Timer mode.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.520
This is like Free Ride, except that you
have two players taking turns skating

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.720
to see who can get the highest
score before the timer runs out.

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.140
Whoever wins gets to brag about how
they received better random results

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.580
in regards to the landing physics. Woo-hoo.

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:21.580
The next mode is Get in Line,

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:24.280
which allows you to unlock new board customizations

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.260
if you complete a series of tricks

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.860
at a series of checkpoints.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:29.000
Seems simple enough.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.700
Except that you have a ridiculously
low amount of time to do this.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.260
The only way to get more time is to pull
off a successful trick at a checkpoint,

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.680
but the problem here is that
it doesn't count just any trick.

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.660
There's a list of tricks to pull off,

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:44.760
but good luck actually doing them that first try.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:48.380
And you have to do it first try because
there's not enough time otherwise.

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.320
Plain and simple, this mode sucks.

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:52.580
And I don't even care about unlocking new boards,

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.980
since you can just edit some bitmaps
in the game folder and make your own.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.020
In fact, it also gives you some
instructions on how to do this in the readme,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.400
as well as a link to download some software

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.160
to create your own levels in the Genesis3D Engine.

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.540
So that was nice of them.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:08.600
The final mode is Pro Session

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.460
and this is a career mode where you unlock new tracks

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:13.780
by grabbing enough points before time runs out.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.860
You also have a bunch of regenerating pickups to grab

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:20.500
which give you things like extra time,
extra speed and extra health,

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.500
the last of which is especially helpful

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.120
because you lose health every time you bail.

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.940
The main aggravation with this mode

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.260
is that even if you unlock the tracks with one character,

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:33.580
you'll have to do it all over again
with each of the other characters.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.700
And seeing as there is no discernible difference
between any of them, this is amazingly pointless.

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:43.160
Is it really too much to ask to be able to
stare at someone else's back for a while

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:46.200
on a new track without having to
do the whole campaign over again?

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.220
Maybe it's in the name of replayability,

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:50.500
but honestly, the game is so repetitive and bland

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:51.960
that I just can't be bothered.

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.520
Oh, yeah, and if you do earn enough
points to unlock the next level,

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.880
but run out of health due to, say,

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.580
the game randomly deciding not to let you land a trick,

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:03.160
then it fails the entire level anyway.

00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:04.520
What a pile of junk.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:07.240
And really, that's all for Boards &amp; Blades 2.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.640
I've got to say, I'm kinda glad they didn't
just reskin the first game and call it a day.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:14.620
You can tell some effort went
into making this a better game.

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:15.640
However,

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.100
how-FREAKING-ever,

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:19.680
this is still, by no means, a good game.

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.960
It's shambled out of the territory of

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.840
"so bad it's shocking,"

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.240
and into the land of

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.340
"Wow, this game is forgettable.
I think I'll use it as a drink coaster."

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:30.460
Not only that, but when the first game came out,

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:32.820
the Tony Hawk series wasn't even a thing.

00:06:32.820 --> 00:06:36.140
But by the time this was out,
there were three games in that series.

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:38.580
Also by Activision, strangely enough.

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:42.500
There was just no way this series could
ever hope to compete with that juggernaut,

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:44.940
and it's no surprise that there was no follow up.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.820
Of course, that didn't stop Silverfish Studios

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:49.160
from creating more games,

00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:51.420
as they went on to create such classics

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.920
as Muscle Car 2: American Spirit

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.860
and Country Justice: Revenge of the Rednecks.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.900
And you know, considering
how godawful those games are,

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.820
maybe I was a bit hasty in saying they
learned their lesson with Extreme Boards &amp; Blades.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:06.420
However, credit given where credit's due,

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.060
and there's some credit due here

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.420
because this game isn't a complete waste of time.

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:13.400
It's just a boring, irritating waste of time,

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:17.060
with a little bit of improvement over
the disaster that was the original.

00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:18.500
I can't say I recommend it,

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.480
but I can't say that I would
avoid it like the plague, either.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:25.460
I would, however, avoid like it like I would
someone trying to punch me in the face.

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:27.180
I would prefer it not to happen,

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.120
but if it does, it's not the end of the world,

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.880
and I'll heal.

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:34.560
