00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.480
What's your name?

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Joan.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.440
Your name is not Joan.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.940
You're smart too, 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.100
that's good.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.300
So...

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.680
If it's not delicate...

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.600
How much tonnage? Or would you say weight, sir?

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:18.415
I see you brought your lovely fiancée.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:19.340
Joan.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.540
Joan?

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.940
It was a code name.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:24.380
David, I like your short hair.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:25.840
Not that I didn't like it longer

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.340
or that I thought it was w-.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:28.800
It's good to see you.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:29.760
Likewise.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.680
Nevermind, it's fine.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.300
Sold! 

00:00:34.375 --> 00:00:35.075
I mean, bought.

00:00:41.423 --> 00:00:42.783
You're doing great!

00:00:43.354 --> 00:00:44.474
Sorry Kristoff!

00:00:44.474 --> 00:00:46.115
But you'll thank me later.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.220
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:49.274
Close your eyes.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.480
Is something wrong with your skin?

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.620
So beautiful!

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:57.540
And soft.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:59.700
You know I'm gonna spill something on it.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:00.600
Maybe only...

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:01.970
Clear beverages

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:02.870
 at the wedding.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.100
Elsa is gonna get out of that urn.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.060
And when she does, 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.200
she's gonna take back the kingdom

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.969
and kick you

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:11.834
and your brothers back to the Southern Isles

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.260
which sounds lovelier

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:14.855
than I bet it actually is!

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.240
Pirates are better than wizards.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.580
You can always give up

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:19.080
tomorrow.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.880
*disgusting tea*

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.620
Right.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.840
I am a young girl.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.700
and I'm missing my own wedding

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.629
to go to a strange land and track down...

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.400
Some secret mission things

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.820
Kristoff makes this look easy.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.740
What a funny-looking world!

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:47.240
Right?

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.620
And I sang with you!

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.800
Call me crazy, but I really don't want to face an evil wizard.

00:01:58.095 --> 00:01:59.295
I never said evil!

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.220
I mean, he is, but...

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:03.740
Because my brothers and I

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.920
spent Wednesday rolling around

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.180
on the money in the royal treasury.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.560
You rolled around in gold bars?

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:11.720
Weird.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:12.600
And ouch!

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.940
Holy cats!

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.440
That is cold.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.080
I needed the guards to think I sided with Ingrid,

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:19.340
I'm so sorry.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.600
Don't apologize, you were fantastic!

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.680
I believed every word,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.080
I was absolutely crushed.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.320
Because it's weird, and strange

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:27.340
her being here.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.440
And because I'm a good judge of character.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.660
Yeah, says the girl who agreed

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.880
to marry Hans 10 minutes

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.980
after you started talking to him.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:34.420
I was young and naïve.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.620
You met me in the next day.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.040
Younger.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.080
We have a deal!

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.095
Something about...

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.600
What?

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.440
Well over 200 pounds of gold.

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.360
She's scary. And powerful. 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.160
And smart, and scary.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.960
You already said scary.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.860
Oops.

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:00.940
I thought you were them.

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.760
If you see Ingrid,

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.835
use the secret signal.

00:03:04.314 --> 00:03:04.814
Wait.

00:03:04.814 --> 00:03:06.030
Do we have a secret signal?

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.480
It's not as bad as it looks,

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.960
except for the dankness,

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.460
and darkness

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.220
and the mice

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:10.760
who are cute

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.320
when they're not scurrying over your toes, but...

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:13.640
I have shoes.

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:16.989
We can't let anyone see us.

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.238
Ingrid could have eyes and ears everywhere.

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:21.280
Of course, not literally.

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.740
That would be gross.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:24.000
And unhygienic.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.600
Then when she comes down here,

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.734
I'll surprise her with the urn.

00:03:28.834 --> 00:03:30.754
Not like a party "surprise!"

00:03:30.754 --> 00:03:33.960
Something more dour to match the occasion, like,

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.140
"Surprise."

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:37.740
I know this isn't really you,

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:38.380
I know it.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.360
But it's still upsetting, so...

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.240
I'm just

00:03:41.275 --> 00:03:42.795
I'm gonna go see my sister.

00:03:42.795 --> 00:03:43.795
And you just stay here,

00:03:43.795 --> 00:03:44.435
handcuffed,

00:03:44.435 --> 00:03:45.460
where you can't hurt anybody

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:46.780
but me, with your words.
