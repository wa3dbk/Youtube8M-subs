00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.620
Hello, my name is Mark MacBayne, I am the
practice administrator for hematology oncology

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:10.040
at UCSF Medical Center, and I'm here today
to talk about how to become a doctor. The

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.580
first step in becoming a doctor is to go to
college. You must complete a four year degree

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.090
at a college or university in order to apply
to medical school. Typically, a person interested

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.739
in applying to medical school will major in
a science discipline such as biology. However,

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.569
this is not required, if you do not major
in a science however, you will need to take

00:00:28.569 --> 00:00:32.880
all of the science prerequisites during your
undergraduate career, being at least two years

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.160
of biology, two years of chemistry, a year
of physics, and a year of calculus. Medical

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.530
school is very competitive, and so you will
want to make sure that you maintain a strong

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.440
GPA, 3.7 or above, to be a strong candidate
for medical school. And towards the end of

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.870
your undergraduate career, you will need to
take what's known as the MCAT, or the Medical

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.670
College Admissions Test. This is a standardized
exam that is used by medical schools to evaluate

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:07.359
students for medical school entrance. They
use this along with your GPA. Upon being accepted

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:11.670
to a medical school, you will commit to an
additional four year course of study, the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.499
first two years of which are typically reserved
for didactic instruction in the health sciences,

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:19.649
and the second two years of which are typically
reserved for training and clinical skills.

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:24.840
After you've completed your four years of
medical school, you are a medical doctor.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.639
However, you're not quite ready for practice.
There are many specialties within medicine,

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:34.229
and it is after you have actually completed
your medical school education, that you actually

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.729
specialize. You do this by completing a residency
program. Residency programs range from three

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.289
or four to six or eight years, depending on
the particular specialty. If you want to specialize

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:51.740
in general medicine or pediatrics, it's typically
a three or four year residency, and if you

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:57.369
want to specialize in a surgical discipline,
it's six years of more. After you've completed

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:01.909
your residency, you may choose to do a fellowship,
which is an additional one to two years of

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:07.049
formal training, past your residency. At this
point you are ready to sit for the board exam,

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:14.160
in whatever specialty you've chosen, and after
being boarded as a specialist, you are ready

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.980
to practice in that area of medicine. This
is Mark MacBayne, practice administrator for

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:22.349
hematology oncology at UCSF Medical Center.
