00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.680
Hi guys!

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.680
Welcome back to my channel!

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.509
Today, I am going to do my night time skincare
routine.

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.180
So, I like to put on some music just because
I like to listen to it when I take my makeup

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.300
off because it is a lengthy process for me.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.730
My skincare routine is pretty lengthy.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.780
So, I’m going to take the Aveeno makeup
remover wipes and I’m going to take off

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.980
what I have.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:23.880
This makes it easier for cleansing later.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:37.550
I like to start off with my face first, and
then I’ll go on to my eyes and eye brows.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.100
After removing the makeup with the makeup
remover wipes, I’ll go in with my Cetaphil

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.170
cleanser and my Clarisonic.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.969
These two are my favorites!

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:47.559
All time favorites!

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:53.330
This is the Clarisonic Mia 2 and I basically
cleanse my face.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.559
I use this every single night.

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:57.239
I feel like it cleans my face perfectly!

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.430
Especially if I am wearing a lot of makeup.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.879
I’m using the regular brush that came with
it and that’s all I pretty much do here.

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:10.060
It’s a little too harsh for morning time,
but I do use it at night time.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.310
And by the way, I have my morning skincare
routine already up, so If you are interested

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:19.550
in seeing it, I’ll link it down below.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.080
I like to exfoliate my face once a week.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.320
I switch off between this product and my Kelly
West Microdermabrasion device.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.430
This week, I’m just using this one and I
just massage it all over my face.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:33.400
Again, 1 time a week I do this.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.680
I don’t do this often because I’ll damage
my skin more than help it, but it helps to

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:52.830
slough off any dead skin cells and kind of
helps with all of my serums and stuff.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.369
After that, I like to do a facial mask.

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:59.009
It could be a hydrating mask or it could be
something like this where it deeply cleans

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:00.110
my pores.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.909
This is the Aztec Healing clay with ACV.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.989
I do see a difference when using ACV that
is organic compared to the regular.

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.239
And all I do is mix it up.

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:19.079
I like mine a little more watery and I just
let this dry and it pulls out any oils or

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:23.249
anything that I missed during the steps that
I did.

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:30.549
But I basically let it dry and I go on social
media, dance around… just be me.

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:31.939
LOL!

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.920
Then I’ll follow up with a toner.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.680
This has Aloe in it, so it will calm my skin
form the dermabrasion I just did earlier.

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.549
It will also help with the redness.

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:49.739
And it makes my skin feel very refreshed.

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:55.319
After that, I do the oral routine and I’ll
skip over to the final steps.

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.709
I’ll take a blemish treatment if I’m going
through breakouts or if I’m feeling like

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.529
my skin is about to break out.

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:03.409
I’m using the clean and clear treatment.

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.819
This is the one that is non-drying.

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:10.540
I put that on before I put anything else on
because I want to target the blemish.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.459
I didn’t have a clip for this one, but I
use the Aveeno tone corrector and I’ll follow

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.349
up with a night eye cream.

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.159
This is from Redefine - the PM version.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:30.019
I put this in areas where I don’t want wrinkles.

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.930
I’ll go ahead and apply moisturizing lotion.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.590
I just use my daily one.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.839
I don’t feel like I need a special moisturizer
for night time.

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:43.209
And If I want to amp it up, I apply the Dermalogica
skin hydrating booster.

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:56.999
A few drops of that mixed in the moisturizer
and I apply this all over my face.

00:03:56.999 --> 00:04:01.029
For my lips, I like to slather on this Elizabeth
Arden 8 hour lip balm.

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:06.799
This makes my lips so much softer, smoother
and very hydrated and moisturized.
