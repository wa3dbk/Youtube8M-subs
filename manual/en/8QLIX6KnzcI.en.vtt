"Treating COPD with Diet"

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:09.210
120 COPD patients were
randomized into two groups.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.170
Half were told to boost their fruit
and vegetable consumption,

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.210
and the other half stayed
on their regular diet.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:17.510
The intervention group was told to
eat at least one more serving a day

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.420
of fruits or vegetables.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.239
And they did, and they did
for three years.

00:00:22.239 --> 00:00:26.189
More fruit, and more vegetables,
than control.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:28.910
Here’s the control group.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.119
Slowly but surely,
they got worse.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.310
That’s what happens in
COPD (emphysema);

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:39.310
you get worse, and worse,
and then you die.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:44.120
The group told to eat at least one more
measly serving of fruits or vegetables

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.340
every day started out the same,
but didn’t get worse.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.130
One year, two years, three years.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.830
In fact, if anything, it looks like their
lung function got a little better.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:59.440
That’s not supposed to happen;
you’re supposed to get worse.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.860
Could be the antioxidant
effect of fruits and vegetables;

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:09.060
could be the anti-inflammatory effect;
or, frankly, it may not directly be the

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.899
fruits and vegetables at all.

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.569
When you eat more of one thing,
you tend to eat less of another.

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:20.030
For example, the addition of
fruits and vegetables resulted in a

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:27.429
decreased consumption of meat,
which is known to be a pro-oxidant.

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.429
Either way, though,
there is now hope.

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:35.149
These findings suggest that a dietary
shift to higher-antioxidant food intake

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:38.340
may be associated with
improvement in lung function.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.209
And, in this respect, dietary
interventions might be considered in

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:44.840
COPD management.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.950
The tobacco industry viewed these
landmark findings a little differently.

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.789
Instead of adding fruits and vegetables
to one’s diet to treat emphysema,

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:59.439
wouldn’t it be simpler to just
add them to the cigarettes?

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.700
And voilà, the addition of
açaí berries to cigarettes

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.509
evidently had a protective effect
against emphysema in smoking mice.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.890
Next, they’re going to try
to add berries to meat.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.850
I can always count on
the journal Meat Science.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.750
Now, adding fruit extracts to burgers
was not without its glitches, though.

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.070
The blackberries literally dyed burger
patties with a distinct purplish color—

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:37.100
though infusing lamb carcasses with
kiwifruit juice before rigor mortis sets in

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.620
does evidently improve tenderness.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.860
And, it is possible to improve
the nutritional profile of frankfurters

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:49.590
with powdered grape seeds—
though there were complaints that

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.870
the grape seed particles were
visible in the final product.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.750
And if there’s one thing we know
about hot dog eaters,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.980
it’s that they’re picky about
what goes in their food.
