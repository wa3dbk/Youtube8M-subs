Desteni Interdimensional Interview: Fairies - Children see us (Siyala)

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.230
Hello

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:28.400
this is, Siyala and- I am a fairy

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.200
I am going to be speaking for 'all of us' together

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.620
and, tell you what we do and where we come from

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.410
well it's already been said

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.870
but, what we are doing in process in supporting human beings

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.540
well, we are of the earth

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.920
and we've been birthed as the expression of flowers

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.580
and

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.150
we are in and as oneness and equality

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:07.910
as you've referred to it, as Life

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:12.800
but we are that so it's strange, to say oneness and equality

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.130
because it's just who we are, we're Life

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.950
because we are of the earth and of the flowers

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:20.640
and

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.800
we assist human beings when we see that they're in separation with themselves

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:32.820
now understand that not many human beings understand separation

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.200
or even know what we are busy doing, but

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.480
one day, they will, why? because

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.640
we're preparing everyone, so that

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.070
when they start hearing us

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.990
or, hearing what it means to exist in oneness and equality

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:53.350
why they are here, who they are, where do they come from

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.060
and they hear of this process that has busy going on

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.340
they will look at their Life, and they will go: Oh! now I see

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.220
now I understand

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.660
what we found is interesting

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.480
the reason why- when we see manifesta-

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.540
when we see separation manifested within human beings and we

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.610
projected in your world to be experienced

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.040
so you are able to see, that you're existing in separation

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:24.860
it's the only way that you'll start- hearing what we are doing in process

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.160
first, and events have to occurred

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.760
you have to experience certain events

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.940
before afterwards you start realize and why you crated that event to be experienced

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.750
because remember we are you

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.260
we are not doing anything to anyone (no)

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.640
we are you, we are manifestation of you as one with you

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.280
and we are assisting you

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.640
no one can do anything onto another it's impossible

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.770
all that we are doing is we're assisting you

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:52.350
in the 'manifestation' of what it is you are creating

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.850
so that you are able to see what you're doing to yourself

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.230
and that's how we all assisting and supporting each other because

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.930
we're not able to do it for you

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.080
we're not able to hide what you're doing to yourself from you

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.760
because otherwise how are realize yourself, that would be impossible

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.050
so

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.560
we are, definitely, participating- oh!

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.710
there are two fairies for each human being on- in this world

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.280
with them, in every single moment

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.010
making sure, aligning manifesting that which and places where you separated yourself from

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:30.450
looking where and how when and where we're able to manifest such experiences

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.120
so you may understand what you're doing to yourself

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.900
what else?

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.990
so basically we are bringing everything out in the open

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.070
what's going on within, because I am certain human beings are tired

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.930
of all the emotional conflicts and things inside them 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:49.290
because they conserved it inside them yet

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.230
we placed it 'outside' so that you can experience it, and understand it

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.110
and then afterward realize it 'I am still here'

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.620
that's the one thing human beings feared, interesting

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.990
fear losing themselves when they go and experience something

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.550
so, that's the basic principle we're working with

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:08.630
to realize that no matter where you are, what you do what you experience

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:11.800
when you walk through it, and you find yourself on the other side

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.300
to see you're still here

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.680
so 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.600
this is Siyala, and this is what fairies are doing 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.950
in the world for human beings

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.600
until we see each others again, as who we are as Life

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:28.760
