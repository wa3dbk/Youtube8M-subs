CES 2009

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:12.170
You're right,
I should talk more.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.270
That was a really,
really nice intro there

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.370
from the robot.
What's going on,

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.100
It's Bauer, we're down here
on the CES 2009 floor

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:21.800
and we're standing here
with WowWee folks,

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.000
and this is Michael Rush
and they've got 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.900
a couple of new things
they're showing off.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.300
One of them being
 this new guy right here

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.970
and of course,
WowWee has been

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:32.900
a big company 
in terms of bringing  

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.400
like, robotics
into the house

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.330
and making it fun 
and I've like lusted

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.070
after the Rovio
since I've seen it.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.700
And this thing looks
really, really cool.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.600
I've been playing
with it 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.230
and it seems like 
one of the most fun toys

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.330
I've seen on the floor.
-His name is Joebot.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:50.800
He's not
your average Joe,

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.730
Sarah Palin would say,
Joe the plumber, perhaps.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.030
He's a beatboxer,
so basically 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:00:58.340
what he can do is...
You actually can 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.930
tap out a rhythm
on his body,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:02.000
he will sense it
and then will be

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.230
able to repeat it
and store it later.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.170
While we actually
came out 

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:07.070
with the original Robosapien
in 2004

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.930
so he's really
a next generation of that.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.160
He's got
a lot more content

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.840
built into him.
He can dance, walk.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.170
He's got games,
he tells jokes.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.670
And then 
there's also a battle mode

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.900
that you can put
him into, 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:20.670
that causes his 
IR hands

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:22.630
to detect objects
and if you have...

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.930
just a regular
TV remote,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.830
you can actually 
engage him in battle.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.300
I've got to say
he's a little rude.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:28.470
Because we're
sitting here

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.690
and having a conversation,
and he keeps

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.500
trying to interrupt us.
-Yeah, I think

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:32.770
we're triggering
his IR senses,

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:34.230
so every time
we move in front of him,

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.330
he's going to make
some sort of quip.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:36.940
But if you want
I can show you 

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.840
the beatbox mode here.
-Yeah, what kind of stuff

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.900
does he do? 
I want to see some action here.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:42.670
He just said,
"Tap out a rhythm

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.400
and I'll repeat the beat."
 So...

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.800
Let's put him
in the Battle mode.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.800
-Alright, watch out.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.500
He's going to start
firing at you.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.530
Oh, he's very aggressive.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.300
You can calm him down
with your TV remote.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:12.870
I was going to say,
it seems like 

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:14.770
a one-sided battle,
how do I fight back?

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.470
If I had a TV remote,
I'd have hand it off to you,

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.400
so you could 
cause him to simmer down here.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.740
He's coming at me
 there.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:24.800
Yeah, but he dances,
he has some of the more...

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.400
calm features.
-So you're able to...

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.330
via the TV remote,
I'd be able to blast back

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:33.000
at him,
and he'd react to that?

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.500
He'd be like,
"Ah, you hit me.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:36.130
Ah, you hit me again"
and then eventually

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.200
he'd play dead.
-Oh, that's incredibly cool.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:39.770
So when is this thing
going to be

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:41.500
hitting the market?
-This will be out

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:43.360
probably, summer in July
and it'll be

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:45.270
about $99.
-Right on, 

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.270
well, thanks for showing off.

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.400
You said it was a Joebot, right?
-Joebot.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.240
Nice to meet you
there, Joebot.

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.720
Thank you, bye.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.630
I appreciate it.
