00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.030
For many years the Tempo Run has been
considered as a linchpin around which a

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.909
lot of

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:17.149
top athletes training is done. And Tempo
running is often ill-defined as well

00:00:17.149 --> 00:00:21.529
and misunderstood because of the
different grasp of what Tempo Running

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:22.490
really is.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.300
Tempo running is often associated with
about 2.5 millimoles of

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.449
Lactate

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:31.789
but most people don't have access
to lactate measurement and so you have

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.450
to base it on velocity or on heart rate.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.760
And that two paces that that's most associated with

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.829
are your marathon pace,

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.900
and your heart marathon pace.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:47.240
Tempo running for shorter distances
like for 10k race like doing a

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.360
three mile run for a 6 mile race that
might be too much add to higher

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.250
intensity and then interval training is
a better idea.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.390
Similarly for a 5k runner

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.109
it takes quite a lot of time to recover
from say it 2k or a 3k run or a

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:05.339
2 mile run if you if you training for a
5 mile race

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.229
you might be better off doing 4
hundreds or 8 hundreds or 1

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.149
thousand meter repeats in that in in
that fashion

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:12.329
a little bit faster.

00:01:12.329 --> 00:01:15.350
So the Tempo run is associated more with a
heart marathon,

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.340
and the marathon.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.010
So if you would training for a marathon,
a Tempo run might be something like

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:23.879
a 9 miles or 8 miles at your
marathon pace.

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:27.449
And it's that shorter distance of what you're able to recover

00:01:27.449 --> 00:01:28.450
from that

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.829
a very quickly the day off
or even maybe two days after

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.389
and be able to get back to easy running
immediately and to be able to get back

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:41.049
to quality training within one or two
days. And so if you are not able to do

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:43.729
that then there's two ways to go with
that is due

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.320
shorter Tempo runs so as a marathon runner and you might only do a 6 mile Tempo run

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.090
or a 5 mile Tempo run

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.560
or to fractionalize your Tempo run, which
is something I find very very useful so

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.080
as a marathon runner you might wanna
run a 15 mile Tempo run which would

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.640
be ideal for your marathon distance but

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.049
takes a lot of emotional mental energy
and it takes a long time to recover from

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:03.600
that.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.980
So you might be able to fractionalize
that you might do something like four

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.390
or 5 x 5K

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.029
or 3 x 5 Mile

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:13.259
Alright. Makes a little easier to wrap your head
around with a short recovery in between

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:16.199
or maybe minutes and a half to three
minutes in between each

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:19.480
you get the neuromuscular benefit
of running at your race pace

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.510
and that makes the Tempo run much more
sensible. Also be you know be cautious

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.180
with how many Tempo runs you do. you
don't want to do a tempo run

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.840
of of some great distance a week or
two before your marathon you just won't

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:33.870
recover in time.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.490
So maybe three weeks before or two and half
weeks before you might do a fractionalize

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:39.470
Tempo run before marathon

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.019
or a half marathon.

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.610
Another thing to consider is is if
you're a ironman or a hop ironman athlete

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.230
and you want to train neuromuscularly correctly then you might

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.660
go up and do some Tempo runs

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.760
at your off the bike pace

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:56.739
but you wouldn't have preloaded that
with the bike.

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.939
Alright, So there's 2 ways to consider
that so brick workout, preload

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:01.700
that and then go out for a

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:05.500
a five mile run or 2 x 3 mile
even 3

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.450
x4 x  2 mile run something like
that

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.110
at your proposed race intensity but
sometimes it's okay to just go out there

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.170
fresh and run a Tempo run at the
pace that you you need to run off the

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.160
bike for because a lot of this is neuromuscular and not not necessarily about

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.280
your your central physiology but
remember that difference you know the

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.060
top ironman athlete might run  two hours forty five for the marathon and

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:33.350
they might be two twenty marathon
runners and to go out and do a Tempo run

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.220
at two twenty marathon pace is kinda
risky because it's pretty hard on the

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.210
legs to recover from that and so what
they might do is is they go go out and run at

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:45.270
two forty or two forty five marathon
pace and similarly if you're aiming at

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:46.569
four hour run

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.269
off the bike but you might only be you
know? half three hours thirty or three

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:53.079
hours twenty marathon runner.

00:03:53.079 --> 00:03:57.319
You might be suited to do slightly longer Tempo runs or more

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:58.099
chunks

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:00.820
at that at that iron man pace

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.900
on the run even though you have in
preloaded with the bike but with the

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.859
Tempo run

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:08.339
you might want to look at lactate but
considerably more in terms of the

00:04:08.339 --> 00:04:11.989
principle of specificity you're trying
to run for longer and longer periods of

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:12.670
time

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.430
and still be able to recover

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.499
at exactly the pace that you looking
for on race day.

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:21.589
So remember that so that will be
strongly impacted by heat and humidity

00:04:21.589 --> 00:04:24.949
alright.. where you might not be able to run
the exact pace but you might be able to

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.099
run the the intensity or if you are at
altitude

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:31.800
one of the things that I do on my Tempo
runs at altitudes is that i have my athletes

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.659
run slightly downhill

00:04:33.659 --> 00:04:36.649
and the reason why have them run down
hill is a so that they don't have the

00:04:36.649 --> 00:04:38.580
cardiovascular needs

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.069
that they would need at sea level

00:04:42.069 --> 00:04:46.090
alright? so in other words in altitude is hard to
get sufficient oxygen to be able to

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.800
maintain that kind of pace but if
they're running downhill they have the

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.110
advantage of gravity

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:54.110
but they get the neuromuscular benefits
by running downhill so try that next

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:55.289
time with your tempo run

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.069
absolutely essential type of work out
think carefully about the place that you're

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:03.590
going to run at and use it sparingly
because it has got some considerable

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:05.070
recovery requirements.
