00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.860
Hi, this is Jeanette Lee the Black Widow.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.020
Even as a champion there are certain things that we continue to practice to perfect our game.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.740
The biggest thing that we want is we want consistency.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:25.819
We know we can make the balls,

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:30.620
We know we've got hearts like champions and lines, but we want to be consistent.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:37.820
Get rid of those unforced errors and that means solidifying, perfecting, refining these systems that we have.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.900
We have pre shot routine.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.999
We have shooting system.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.780
We have pre match Routines.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.260
We have tournament match Routines.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.887
We have analytical systems.

00:00:45.887 --> 00:00:48.380
We have diamond systems you name it.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.260
So let's get that down.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:52.840
Today, I want to talk about the shooting system.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.690
That's basically "what do I do before every shot".

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:02.449
Actually let's say not the pre shot routine, but when I'm actually shooting the shot my shooting system.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.280
All right, here we go.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.240
I'm going to make a decision.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:09.340
I'm looking at this one ball.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.500
I want to make the one ball in that corner pocket.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.360
I want to hit it with a high ball come across it's tangent line.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.080
Hook forward get right around this 13 ball.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:19.710
Okay

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.600
So once I do that,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.400
I'm going to find my smallest target which is right there.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.910
Basically aiming.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.500
Once I've got that aim where my cue ball is going right into that ball.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.710
Get right behind it.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.320
I'm going to lock my chin on that.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.440
Now I visualize.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:44.740
Now I want you to pay attention to my eyes because it's going to go back and forth.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.189
Lots of eye movement.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:53.040
I'm looking at the cue ball, one ball, Hook, down, around, roll, stop.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.800
Here, boom, boom, boom, boom, the entire shot happening.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.740
I'm picturing it.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.660
So after visualizing, it's feeding my brain and my body information.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.720
About the speed of the shot, how much english if any to apply?

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.580
What I'm going to do what's going to have them just going to have a really good feel for it because I use my eyes back and forth I worked it, work it baby work it.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.180
That's what I did all right, so I got that aiming.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.469
now

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:24.300
Do a last double check.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.380
Now I'm going to get down

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.760
Here I go again.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.680
Eye movement.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:34.210
Looking making sure that my cue ball, before I even take any practice swings, zero it on that cue ball.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.940
Right into that target.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.630
Eye movement to make sure you're exactly where you want to be.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.300
Here I want a high ball.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.220
Make sure I'm dead in line.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.220
Now I'm going to take some nice practice swings.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.820
Stop pause at the cue ball.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.220
Eye movement.

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.720
Couple nice practice swings making sure these strokes are equal length.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.320
I don't want a short stroke, long stroke, short stroke.

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:03.640
Whatever you tend to finally hit it with that's the length of your practice swings.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.320
Each and every one, nice and even.

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.430
Okay

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.850
And the last thing is when you get ready to strike.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:15.910
It's just like a swing in golf.

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:21.340
Basketball swing, a football swing, tennis swing, baseball swing.

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:23.700
You want a nice low back swing.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.100
Pause, down, accelerate through.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.800
You're going to strike that cue ball right at the bottom of this swing.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.360
So this is my elbow, okay?

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.580
Just like this, shh right?

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.380
You're going to stop cue ball double check.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.929
Few practice swings right and then you're going to take a slow backswing pause,

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.230
and follow-through.

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.020
So we've done the work.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.449
We know where we need to hit.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.519
We know what it's supposed to look like.

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:55.940
We know what it's supposed to feel like.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:57.880
We use our eye movement.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.380
We've paused to make sure that our tip is exactly on the cue ball.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:09.920
Where we're not accidentally giving it left english accident because when we get down before we even take a single stroke we're making sure we're exactly.

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.220
Let's say I'm looking at a face exactly at 12 o'clock or at exactly at 11 o'clock wherever we want to hit it.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:25.140
We're going to make sure every stroke is not only even in length but that it's staying on its intended track going backward and on its intended track going forward.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.169
It's important every one of these details we practice for a lifetime.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:31.130
All right.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:32.580
So here I go again.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.040
I get down.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.180
Eye movement before I even take a swing pausing at the cue ball.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:43.060
Now I'm going to take some strokes.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:49.920
When we're ready pause one last time do I like it.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.220
Yes.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.740
Nice!!

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.700
So you know I first learned about this stuff from Gerry Bryce.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:06.200
He is one of my greatest mentors when it comes to learning and teaching the swing in the stroke.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.820
But again you never know too much about this.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.540
You have to it's all about muscle memory to get a feeling for that.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:20.500
And you will get rid of so many unforced errors and get a lot more consistent if you'll make sure that you work on this solid shooting system.

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:21.500
Thanks
