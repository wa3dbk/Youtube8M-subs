00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.890
Greetings fellow nerds.
Time to make another simple battery, today

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.580
will be the aluminum-air battery with household
materials.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.320
We start with about 60 grams of table salt
and add in 300 milliliters of water. Stir

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.150
it up until most of it dissolves.
If it doesn't completely dissolve that's fine.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.710
Now we get ourselves a couple of square feet
of aluminum foil.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.550
This will serve as our anode or negative electrode.
Bunch it up into a ball but don't pack it

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.430
too tightly yet.
Now get a needle or sharp rod and poke holes

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.760
through it.
The idea is that we don't want it to trap

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.720
air when we put it into the salt water.
Set that aside and now get some steel wool.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:50.030
Fluff it up a bit so it's slightly larger
than the mouth of the container you're using.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:54.320
This will serve as our cathode, or positive
electrode.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.300
Now get some wires with alligator clips and
attach them to each electrode material.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.180
Now stuff the aluminum into the bottom of
the salt water and pack it down.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:10.170
Next, get a paper towel and lay it over the
aluminum, this will serve a separator between

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.500
the electrodes.
Make sure that the aluminum is completely

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.260
covered as well as the metal part of the alligator
clip.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:23.440
Now stuff the steel wool on top.
And that is a simple aluminum air battery.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.640
What's happening is that the iron catalyzes
the reaction of oxygen with water to make

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.740
hydroxide while the aluminum reacts with the
hydroxide to form aluminum oxide.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.060
Overall the reactants are the aluminum metal
and the oxygen in the air.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.850
So let's check its output with this multimeter.
Connecting it up to the clips.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.770
We can see the voltage is around 0.23 volts
give or take.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.490
The current is pretty low at less than 20
milliamps.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.840
This is because we're using a crude homemade
setup.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:00.690
A more advanced cell uses aluminum metal alloys
and better chemicals for more voltage and

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:04.119
current.
But you can see the basic chemistry here.

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.700
In an upcoming video, I'm going to make a
much better zinc-air battery so please subscribe,

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.890
