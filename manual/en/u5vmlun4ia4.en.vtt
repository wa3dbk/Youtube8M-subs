00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Hi everyone!  This is Tony

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Welcome to Tony and Karen Kitchen

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Today I will show you how to make Chinese Roasted Pork

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
In traditional method

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
It requires using a layer of salt

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
But my method doesn't require that

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
But the roasted pork will remain crispy

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
And the taste is also great

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Let see how to make it

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Let see the ingredients first

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.000
To make the roasted pork

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You will need the meat tenderizer

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
In Hong Kong, you can get it from kitchen supply store

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
For oversea, you can use the one like mine

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
This kind of meat tenderizer is fine

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
When buying the pork belly

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Don't have choose the one with thick skin

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Like this one in the screen

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The thickness of the skin should be like that

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Don't buy pork with thick skin

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
If you know the butcher well

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Tell him that you are going to make roasted pork

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Ask him to give you best pork

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Now the water is boiled in the pan

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
We don't need lot of water

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
As we use it to cook the pork skin

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Once it is cooked, the skin will be firmed

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The skin size faces down

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Blanch the pork skin

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Wait until the skin is firmed

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
This step needs about 30 seconds

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We don't need to cook it through

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
If the skin is not firmed

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It is hard to puncture

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But if the skin is blanched

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It will be easier

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Now the skin is firmed

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
We dry it well with the kitchen towel

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Then use the meat tenderizer and puncture the skin

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Puncture everywhere on the skin

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Have to be dense

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
Now the skin is punctured lot of holes

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
You can see the small holes everywhere

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Use some force when puncturing

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
So it can puncture deeper

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
And it will dehydrate the skin better

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
And the skin will be crispy after cooked

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Beware the edge of the skin

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Puncturing with patience

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
As it will move when puncturing

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And it will be hard to puncture

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
So be patience puncture around the edge

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
It doesn't require a lot of force

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
It should feel like pressing a pattern

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Puncturing...just like that

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Puncturing through entire surface

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
And create a lot of small holes

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Maybe it is hard to see

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000
But once you touch it with your hand

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
If you can feel the surface has lot of small holes

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Then it is perfect

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Next step is to brush the white vinegar

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
You may wonder if the skin will taste sour

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Don't worry.  It won't as I have tried many times

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
It won't be sour.  It won't

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Next step is to combine the marinade

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000
Salt...light soy sauce...wine

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Put the combined marinade in a dish

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Then put the pork belly

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
Into the marinade

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Brush the marinade everywhere except the skin

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
At this stage

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Don't let the marinade touch the skin side

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000
Keep the pork skin as dry as possible

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000
Then refrigerate it for 3-6 hours

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.000
And you don't need to cover it

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000
The purpose to refrigerate...

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Is to dehydrate the skin

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Now I refrigerated it for 4 hours

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
If you have time

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.000
I recommend to refrigerate overnight

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000
Now it is ready to bake

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Let put it into the Halogen oven

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
And the marinade used

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000
The leftover can be discarded

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Put it on the rack and that's it

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Now it has baked for 40 minutes

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
You can see the skin is brown

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Let it cool down for 10 minutes before cut it

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.000
Otherwise the skin will fall off easily

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
It has cooled 10 minutes

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000
I can cut it and show it to you

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000
Let me try one pieces

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000
I am going to eat now...

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000
Listen carefully...

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
♪...♫...♪

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000
You can imagine how crispy it is

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000
Roasted pork is done

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
I hope you enjoy this video

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.000
