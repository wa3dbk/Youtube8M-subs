00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.040
We got our new deck finished last fall, and
as you see we got the post here

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.109
and then down below it we actually have the
pavers like this here the

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.560
concrete pad.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.550
And we pulled this one section out here, and
also did some

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.450
this gravel there from the concrete with everything
left over.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.450
So what I
wanted to do instead of planting grass, was

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.450
just do some sod.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.150
So I bought
some sod from a local garden store, and I'm

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.150
just going to use it here.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:25.660
I
wouldn't usually use sod but it's a pretty

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.410
small area, so it's not too bad
for about eight bucks.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.380
Have this all finished off in less than an
hour.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.890
What I'm going to do right now is pour out
all that gravel and then prep

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.380
the soil.

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.190
Then make sure it's all nice and wet, and
then I'll put the sod

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:42.190
on top.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.200
As you can see now, the spot where I put down
the sod, I scraped

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.120
all the rocks away using that shovel.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.130
I used a flat shovel which I thought
was good.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:51.990
Then again all these rocks, most of them are
left over from the

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.280
construction of the stamped concrete pad you
see to the right, and so

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.280
that's all going down.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:00:59.700
There's also some other rocks there, too,
I bought.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.650
What I'm actually going to do now is take
a rake to it, and sort of level

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.650
it off.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.220
It'd be nice if I had some extra dirt, but
I actually think there's

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.530
some high spots.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.780
I'll use that dirt to sort of fill in the
low spots and

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.840
also raking is good, too.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.090
Just before you put down the sod, just sort
of

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.550
prep the area a bit.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.900
I'm going to rake this, and actually found
a lot more

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:18.900
rocks there than I thought.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.380
There's quite a lot of rocks in that area,
but

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.380
that's OK.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.380
So I went and raked it.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.260
Then what I want to do before I actually water
that area and put the sod

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.600
down, I just wanted to make sure that the
sod would line up so it would be

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.590
the same height as the other stuff.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.030
What I'm seeing now is it's actually
it's going to be a bit lower, so I'm actually

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.130
going to put down some soil.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:37.380
I've got compost in the back that should be
great for this.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.890
I'm going to
put that down first and then make sure it's

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.390
all nice and level before I
proceed.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.240
So anyway, it's where we are right now and
you can see there's the

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.570
rake I used.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:49.600
While I'm prepping the area, I decided to
put this sod just in

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.659
the shade so the sun doesn't dry it out too
much.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:56.520
So it's right there so
just working on that site now.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.770
This is looking a lot better now.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.329
As you can see now or maybe you can't, it
may be a bit hard to tell, but

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:04.310
it's a lot better as far as it lining up.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.350
So what you want to do is you
want to have the sod right up against either

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.279
another piece of sod, or the
existing lawn.

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:12.629
You don't want it to overlap, but you want
to have it at the

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.049
same level.

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:15.049
So that's what I've done now.

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.950
Now I've sort of put it down now,
I can see there's a few low spots, so I'm

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.260
going to put a bit more soil on
there.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.659
Just to cover it off.

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:22.919
Then what I'm going to do is I'm just going
to

00:02:22.919 --> 00:02:27.239
water the bottom, the base part, get it nice
and moist, not really, really

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.450
muddy or anything but lots of water down there.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:31.909
Now I roll up the other piece of sod.

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.879
As you can see, it fits in really
nicely right there, and all I'm doing right

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.730
now is using this chip rock
knife and just cutting it down here with that.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.629
So that's pretty
straightforward, pretty easy to do.

00:02:42.629 --> 00:02:45.069
There's one spot right here that isn't
making a nice edge.

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.370
It doesn't line up really nicely with this
sod, so what

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.060
I've done is I've just used this edger, using
a knife or something, but

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.120
this is actually the perfect tool just to
get nice square, flat edges and

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.819
then that turf is just going to roll right
in there perfectly.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:00.599
I'll show
you rolling in you see it's right there, it

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:01.599
just flops in.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.870
It's going to
make it a bit leveler and then it's perfect,

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:08.049
and then again I just need to
cut a bit more of the turf off and then it's

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:09.049
done.

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:11.659
Then I'm going to give
it lots and lots of water.

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.481
One last thing before you water, what you
want to do is basically just tamp

00:03:14.481 --> 00:03:16.879
down the sod especially along the edges.

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.339
I just use my foot, you could an
actual tamper, but I sort of basically just

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:22.529
tamped it down with my foot.

00:03:22.529 --> 00:03:24.409
I
thought it was looking really great.

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:30.709
This is me now soaking the area to get
it all nice and wet and, of course, I'm going

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:33.530
to have to do this probably
every day for the next little while just to

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.110
make sure that it gets lots and
lots of water so those roots can start to

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:37.110
grow into the soil.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.110
Then we're
done.

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.969
This is about a week since I put the sod down.

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:45.480
As you can see, it's
actually looking quite good so I'm pretty

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.769
happy with that.

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:49.700
I noticed that
in one corner by the post it seemed to have

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.849
sunk down a bit, so I probably
should have put a bit more dirt there underneath,

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:57.189
but it's looking good and
I can just do some top dressing and sort of

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:58.189
pull that up a bit.

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:00.060
So anyway,
that's looking great.
