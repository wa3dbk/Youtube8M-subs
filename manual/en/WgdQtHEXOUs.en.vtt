00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:07.433
[music]

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.767
[music changes]

00:00:20.133 --> 00:00:22.833
we're going to take the EXP-1000HD

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.200
and we're going to run a test

00:00:24.767 --> 00:00:26.967
on a Class 8 truck with four batteries

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.567
the negative clamp will go to the battery negative

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.500
and the positive clamp will go the battery positive

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.633
the sign on screen comes up

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.167
EXP-1000

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:39.700
the HD version software

00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:41.933
going to select user number 1

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.967
we're going to do the full system test

00:00:44.567 --> 00:00:45.867
we're going to select truck

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:48.167
we've got four batteries in this vehicle

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:50.433
they are 12 volt

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:52.067
they are group 31s.

00:00:52.567 --> 00:00:55.033
and they're regular flooded automotive style batteries

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.233
they are rated in CCAs

00:00:57.467 --> 00:00:59.100
700 CCAs

00:00:59.933 --> 00:01:01.100
it's asking for temperature

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.533
typically you take the temperature directly off the batteries

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:05.033
[music changes]

00:01:05.067 --> 00:01:06.333
result comes up

00:01:06.367 --> 00:01:07.567
good pack

00:01:08.067 --> 00:01:09.933
now let's go ahead and do the rest of the test

00:01:09.967 --> 00:01:11.900
when the unit asks you to start the engine

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:14.333
[music]

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.600
we're going to go directly to the starter test

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:20.433
yes

00:01:21.733 --> 00:01:23.033
start the engine

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.933
[sfx: warning tones]

00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:34.600
[sfx: engine starts]

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.000
starting test results cranking normal

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:38.900
let's go to the next screen

00:01:39.767 --> 00:01:41.333
and the amp clamp is available

00:01:41.367 --> 00:01:42.567
we want to include it

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:44.733
attach the amp clamp to the tester

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:47.200
[sfx: engine running]

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:48.967
so we hit next

00:01:50.133 --> 00:01:51.533
now I've got a companion

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.600
who's holding the amp clamp

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:54.333
next to the alternator cable

00:01:54.567 --> 00:01:55.633
hit next

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.400
[sfx: engine running]

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.600
we're going put it around the positive cable

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:03.733
at the alternator now

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.267
as soon as that's completed

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:08.333
we'll go ahead and hit next

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:11.367
checking for alternator output

00:02:12.433 --> 00:02:13.600
all the vehicle loads are off

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.033
and the engine is at idle

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:16.133
so we'll hit next

00:02:16.167 --> 00:02:17.667
[sfx: engine running]

00:02:18.067 --> 00:02:19.933
it's asking for an increase in RPM

00:02:20.067 --> 00:02:22.367
we'll bring it up to about 1500 - 2000 RPM

00:02:22.867 --> 00:02:24.000
and we'll see the graph increase

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:26.767
as the AC ripple increases off the alternator

00:02:27.133 --> 00:02:29.033
RPM detected, back to idle

00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:30.667
we hit next

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.000
testing the alternator at idle

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:34.533
with all the loads off

00:02:35.033 --> 00:02:36.967
now it wants the high beam headlights on

00:02:37.367 --> 00:02:39.133
and I usually put my left foot on the brake pedal

00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:40.167
to add to loads

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.467
blower motor on high

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:43.233
and I'll hit next

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:46.500
we're checking at idle

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:49.967
now it's going to ask for increase RPM again

00:02:50.167 --> 00:02:52.967
we'll bring it up to that 1500 - 2000 RPM level

00:02:53.167 --> 00:02:54.867
we see that the ripple increases

00:02:55.633 --> 00:02:57.000
hold engine RPM

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.967
engine rev detected

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.167
idle engine

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:02.500
then we hit next

00:03:02.767 --> 00:03:06.800
[sfx: engine and blower running]

00:03:09.133 --> 00:03:10.133
at this point in time

00:03:10.167 --> 00:03:11.467
the testing is actually complete

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.300
and the instruction is to turn all loads

00:03:13.333 --> 00:03:14.333
and the engine off

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.967
[sfx: engine shutting down]

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.567
we'll select next

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:24.200
[music]

00:03:24.667 --> 00:03:27.333
we have no problems identified with the alternator

00:03:27.567 --> 00:03:29.500
let's go ahead and print these results

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.533
line up the IR port on the tool

00:03:32.767 --> 00:03:34.333
with the printer and I have to hit print

00:03:34.767 --> 00:03:36.400
you have to hold the tester

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:37.567
aligned with the printer

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.867
until the hour glass is gone from the screen

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:41.500
on the EXP-1000

00:03:41.667 --> 00:03:43.800
every EXP-1000 retains

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:45.533
the last test value

00:03:45.733 --> 00:03:46.767
in memory

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.100
[music]

00:03:49.767 --> 00:03:52.000
no further maintenance is required at this time

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.900
and a good preventive maintenance check

00:03:53.933 --> 00:03:55.067
has already been completed

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.767
this vehicle is good to go back on the road

00:03:57.033 --> 00:03:59.033
