00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.170
 

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.180
I start making guitars in the mid nineteen
eighties

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:18.230
about 1984, 86 I started I'm up to a
hundred and eighty two

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:22.230
I can get one done in a week because
it's not a hobby this shape is a new 1

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.679
I just

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.380
did on the fly here we started early we
brought in our wood

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.689
so many different types of wood a lot of
different woods will work well actually

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:30.990
we're using

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.820
box elder for a body which is new to me
cuz I've never seen it before

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.390
and we have neck made with hickory

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.140
and to do so it's an odd combination but it will work first thing we made was

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.330
the neck that we're almost up to the
finish on the neck

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.470
been chipping away at it over the last
couple days

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.880
it's a thing it takes longest as it's the
most meticulous it's the

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.100
the hardest part about it there's
basically a neck and a body

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.590
once neck was established made body and
then

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.670
shaped it out got it way it's supposed
to be

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.040
when we gave it all ready its glued
together in

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.540
and make it work really that's the next
stage tomorrow

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.160
its the things going to have to work and

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:19.190
we're going to make it work

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:25.229
 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.060
 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.000
somebody's gonna play it. I'm

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.120
terrible, I'm embarrassing I'm not been
the subject anybody to that

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.890
my days as a musician are over

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:41.890
my specially is  making other can
play

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.650
it will be exciting for me to watch somebody
pick it up and do whatever they do

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.710
its my job to make it

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.120
work making so they pick it up and go "wow"

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:03.120
 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.080
they are generally impressed which surprises
me to because

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.080
it's my job you know it's just what I do

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.230
 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.240
thats as my fix

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.400
making things from nothing

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:34.550
honestly I got lucky that I can make a living

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.870
 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.160
