00:00:07.358 --> 00:00:09.146
- Hey, it's ClayTrader at claytrader.com.

00:00:09.146 --> 00:00:10.551
In this video I wanna talk about

00:00:10.551 --> 00:00:12.722
probably one of the main questions I get,

00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:14.254
and it revolves around money.

00:00:14.254 --> 00:00:16.367
How much money do I need to start trading?

00:00:16.367 --> 00:00:17.505
What's a minimum amount you would think

00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:18.608
I would need to get started?

00:00:18.608 --> 00:00:20.048
Is this enough?

00:00:20.048 --> 00:00:22.962
I wanna do this, should I
have that amount of money?

00:00:22.962 --> 00:00:25.005
All sorts of questions
that revolve around,

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:27.850
at its simplest form,
how much money do I need

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:29.649
to make trading worth my time?

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.577
And I don't know, but I do have a guide

00:00:31.577 --> 00:00:32.529
and a way to look at things

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:33.980
that kinda puts things into perspective

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.522
and will let you answer that question.

00:00:36.522 --> 00:00:38.322
'Cause at the end of the
day it all boils down to

00:00:38.322 --> 00:00:40.714
what are your goals, what
are you trying to accomplish,

00:00:40.714 --> 00:00:42.626
what's your standard of living.

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:44.588
Some people need to
drive a super fancy car,

00:00:44.588 --> 00:00:46.504
others are perfectly fine with a bicycle.

00:00:46.504 --> 00:00:49.302
So there's lots of things
that go into the formation

00:00:49.302 --> 00:00:51.531
of how much money you need,

00:00:51.531 --> 00:00:54.759
but a very easy and very
simplistic way to look at it

00:00:54.759 --> 00:00:56.291
is what I wanna illustrate here.

00:00:56.291 --> 00:00:59.693
So let's first just say
that, for example's sake,

00:00:59.693 --> 00:01:01.360
that you have a goal

00:01:03.235 --> 00:01:05.568
and your goal is $100 a day.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:10.474
Now, I'm not saying that's
a good goal, a bad goal.

00:01:10.474 --> 00:01:13.504
This is just totally random
but your goal is $100 a day.

00:01:13.504 --> 00:01:15.188
In fact, click on the annotation

00:01:15.188 --> 00:01:16.186
that's up on the screen right now,

00:01:16.186 --> 00:01:17.835
that's a quick tip video I did

00:01:17.835 --> 00:01:20.679
about why trading goals
are actually pretty risky.

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:22.270
So check that out, but for example's sake,

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.778
let's just say you wanna make $100 a day.

00:01:24.778 --> 00:01:28.195
So let's look at a few different amounts.

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.293
So let's say that you're
wondering, you know, I got $100.

00:01:37.293 --> 00:01:41.972
Is $100 enough enough for
trading with that goal?

00:01:41.972 --> 00:01:45.555
Well, in order to get
you to your result...

00:01:47.986 --> 00:01:49.569
Which is what?
$100.

00:01:50.686 --> 00:01:55.435
You know, what sort of
percentages are you gonna need?

00:01:55.435 --> 00:01:59.352
Well, to make $100 using
$100 you need to what?

00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:02.122
You need to double your money.

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:06.185
Or in other words, you need 100% gain.

00:02:06.185 --> 00:02:07.927
So hopefully right then
and there you're thinking,

00:02:07.927 --> 00:02:10.702
well, you know, if I wanna make $100 a day

00:02:10.702 --> 00:02:13.918
and I only have $100, I'm
gonna have to be basically

00:02:13.918 --> 00:02:16.588
the best stock trader
ever known to mankind

00:02:16.588 --> 00:02:20.141
if I'm gonna go and get
100% gains every single day.

00:02:20.141 --> 00:02:23.206
So right there, you know, using $100

00:02:23.206 --> 00:02:26.956
and needing 100% to make $100, you know,

00:02:27.876 --> 00:02:30.323
probably you're seeing
the problem with that.

00:02:30.323 --> 00:02:33.906
But let's say, you know
what, I got $1,000.

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.473
And again, you want to try to make $100.

00:02:38.473 --> 00:02:41.457
So the question becomes what
percentage do I need to make

00:02:41.457 --> 00:02:44.371
on this $1,000 in order to make $100?

00:02:44.371 --> 00:02:48.288
Well, in this case, now you only need 10%.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.011
So by having a higher
amount you need less percent

00:02:54.011 --> 00:02:55.984
in order to make that same amount.

00:02:55.984 --> 00:03:00.361
So okay, but still, you
know, $100 a day using 1,000.

00:03:00.361 --> 00:03:01.194
You know, 10%?

00:03:01.194 --> 00:03:03.008
Well, I'm not gonna call this impossible.

00:03:03.008 --> 00:03:04.332
It's certainly much more realistic

00:03:04.332 --> 00:03:06.105
than this option up here at 100%.

00:03:06.105 --> 00:03:08.488
I mean, that just is,

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:09.947
I'm gonna use the word, that's impossible,

00:03:09.947 --> 00:03:12.350
nobody's gonna make 100% every single day.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.951
But 10%, okay, that's a
little bit more realistic.

00:03:14.951 --> 00:03:16.286
What happens if you're
sitting there saying,

00:03:16.286 --> 00:03:18.369
you know, I have $10,000?

00:03:21.161 --> 00:03:25.128
And again, we want the
end result to be 100.

00:03:25.128 --> 00:03:29.295
Well in this case, you need to
make 1% per day to make $100.

00:03:32.114 --> 00:03:34.947
Now to me, this is very realistic.

00:03:35.818 --> 00:03:38.070
But the key thing here is what?

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.243
The amount.

00:03:39.243 --> 00:03:42.738
So everything is dictated by the amount

00:03:42.738 --> 00:03:44.131
and then how much you wanna get.

00:03:44.131 --> 00:03:47.631
It's much easier to make $100 using 10,000

00:03:48.496 --> 00:03:50.787
than it is $100, and the reason for that

00:03:50.787 --> 00:03:54.943
is it all boils down to the percents here.

00:03:54.943 --> 00:03:59.123
To make $100 using $100, you need 100%.

00:03:59.123 --> 00:04:03.175
To make $100 using $10,000, you need 1%.

00:04:03.175 --> 00:04:06.916
Now am I saying that
you have to have 1,000

00:04:06.916 --> 00:04:08.116
or have to have 10,000?

00:04:08.116 --> 00:04:09.416
I'm not saying that at all.

00:04:09.416 --> 00:04:12.888
All I'm saying is that your expectations

00:04:12.888 --> 00:04:14.443
need to meet reality.

00:04:14.443 --> 00:04:17.189
And this is the reality of the situation.

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:19.580
Don't have $100 and say you know what,

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:23.852
I'm gonna have $100 and I'm
gonna be making $500 a week.

00:04:23.852 --> 00:04:26.418
Well, $500 a week, that
means you need to at least

00:04:26.418 --> 00:04:29.622
be getting on average 100% per day.

00:04:29.622 --> 00:04:31.909
So use this math, keep this math in mind

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:34.278
for when you put together your goals.

00:04:34.278 --> 00:04:36.774
When you put together
how much money do I need.

00:04:36.774 --> 00:04:37.958
Now, again, $100 today?

00:04:37.958 --> 00:04:40.640
Maybe you're looking at
this and you have 1,000.

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:42.834
You're saying well, you know, 10% a day.

00:04:42.834 --> 00:04:44.158
Maybe it shouldn't be $100 a day.

00:04:44.158 --> 00:04:48.325
Maybe it should be $100 per
week, or something else.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.947
So it's up to you to
determine what may make sense.

00:04:52.947 --> 00:04:56.697
But I would say that
$100 is just too little.

00:04:58.612 --> 00:05:01.695
My personal opinion is at least $500.

00:05:03.605 --> 00:05:05.496
There's different avenues
out there, you know,

00:05:05.496 --> 00:05:07.831
options, You can use less money.

00:05:07.831 --> 00:05:10.002
Stocks you usually need a little bit more.

00:05:10.002 --> 00:05:12.081
Then there's Forex and other things.

00:05:12.081 --> 00:05:15.924
But the point being you
need to think about in terms

00:05:15.924 --> 00:05:19.535
in how much percent do
I need to make $100?

00:05:19.535 --> 00:05:21.950
Ask yourself, judge things on this.

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:23.494
How much do I need to make $100?

00:05:23.494 --> 00:05:25.235
What percent do I need?

00:05:25.235 --> 00:05:26.940
And that's gonna tell you what you need.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.937
So if you're using $200, well, you know,

00:05:29.937 --> 00:05:33.989
you still would need 50%
return to get that $100.

00:05:33.989 --> 00:05:35.324
So that's still pretty rough.

00:05:35.324 --> 00:05:37.407
But look at it like this.

00:05:38.285 --> 00:05:40.212
For every $100 you have,

00:05:40.212 --> 00:05:43.544
it gets that much easier to make $100.

00:05:43.544 --> 00:05:45.263
That's the best way I
kinda can look at it.

00:05:45.263 --> 00:05:46.598
Again, I'll repeat it.

00:05:46.598 --> 00:05:50.464
For every $100 you have,
so the more $100 you have,

00:05:50.464 --> 00:05:53.726
it becomes easier to make $100.

00:05:53.726 --> 00:05:55.967
So keep this in mind.

00:05:55.967 --> 00:05:58.602
As you try to figure out, you
know, well how much do I need?

00:05:58.602 --> 00:06:01.226
Well, it all boils down
to these questions.

00:06:01.226 --> 00:06:02.492
Look at the math here.

00:06:02.492 --> 00:06:04.895
Think about the percentages
and just ask yourself,

00:06:04.895 --> 00:06:07.507
well, what percentage
would I need to make $100?

00:06:07.507 --> 00:06:10.700
And that'll kinda put you on
the path to where you wanna be.

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:12.976
