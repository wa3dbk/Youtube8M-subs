Welcome to the West Wing Week,

00:00:04.266 --> 00:00:07.567
your guide to everything that's
happening at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:00:07.567 --> 00:00:11.600
But first, a brief message from
the Secretary of Energy, Steven Chu.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.100
Secretary Chu:
Joining the discussion on my
Facebook page is no substitute

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.633
for a Ph.D. in physics.

00:00:17.633 --> 00:00:20.667
However, it's a lot
faster and cheaper.

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:24.834
So go to:
Facebook.com/Steven Chu.

00:00:24.834 --> 00:00:28.734
Narrator:
This week, April 23rd to
the 29th, for doing the math.

00:00:28.734 --> 00:00:34.800
(music playing)

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:36.967
Narrator:
On Friday, April 23rd
in the Rose Garden,

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:39.100
the President hosted a
naturalization ceremony for

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.467
members of the military.

00:00:40.467 --> 00:00:44.734
Janet Napolitano:
That I will
support and defend...

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:48.900
The Constitution and laws of
the United States of America.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:51.066
Narrator:
These 24 young men and
women earned American

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:53.467
citizenship by serving
in the armed forces.

00:00:53.467 --> 00:00:56.500
President Obama:
It is a great honor to serve
as your commander in chief.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.867
And it is my greatest pleasure
to be among the first to greet

00:00:59.867 --> 00:01:01.967
you as a fellow American.

00:01:01.967 --> 00:01:03.900
Narrator:
And on Sunday, April 25th,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.900
Vice-President Biden joined the
President at a memorial service

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.800
in West Virginia for the 29
miners lost in the tragedy of

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.433
the Upper Big Branch Mine.

00:01:12.433 --> 00:01:15.333
Vice President Biden:
The men we remember
today went into the

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:18.800
darkness so that we
could have light.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:25.567
They embraced a life of hard
work and a career full of peril.

00:01:25.567 --> 00:01:27.500
It was dangerous.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.633
It was dangerous work
and they knew it,

00:01:29.633 --> 00:01:31.700
but they never flinched.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.633
Narrator:
On Monday, April 26th, the
World Series Champion New

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:37.734
York Yankees visited the White
House for the 27th time,

00:01:37.734 --> 00:01:40.300
one for each of their
World Series victories.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.767
President Obama:
That attitude, that success,

00:01:42.767 --> 00:01:46.433
has always made the Yankees easy
to love, and let's face it,

00:01:46.433 --> 00:01:47.900
easy to hate, as well.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.300
(laughter)

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.633
Narrator:
On a rainy Monday evening,

00:01:50.633 --> 00:01:52.633
President Obama spoke at
the Presidential Summit on

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:55.900
Entrepreneurship to deepen
ties among business leaders,

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.567
foundations and entrepreneurs
around the world.

00:01:58.567 --> 00:02:03.667
President Obama:
Good evening, everyone.
And welcome to Washington.

00:02:03.667 --> 00:02:07.333
-- doing here to
promote opportunity.

00:02:07.333 --> 00:02:10.400
Ben Rhodes:
And builds connections
and networks.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.934
Narrator:
On Tuesday, April 27th,

00:02:12.934 --> 00:02:15.500
the President addressed the
first meeting of his Commission

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.800
on Fiscal Responsibility Reform.

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.000
The President created this
bipartisan panel to work on ways

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
to cut the deficit in both the
short term and the long term.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.834
President Obama:
In theory, there are few
issues on which there is more

00:02:27.834 --> 00:02:32.300
vigorous bipartisan agreement
than fiscal responsibility.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.600
But in practice, this
responsibility for the future

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.700
is often overwhelmed by
the politics of the moment.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.934
Narrator:
Later that day, the President
left for the Midwest

00:02:40.934 --> 00:02:43.600
to continue his White
House to Main Street tour,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.400
making several stops
in the heartland.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.633
He started at the Siemens
factory in Fort Madison, Iowa,

00:02:48.633 --> 00:02:50.533
where workers make
wind turbines,

00:02:50.533 --> 00:02:52.834
each of which is the
length of Air Force One.

00:02:52.834 --> 00:02:54.667
President Obama:
So, just in the last two
years you have tripled?

00:02:54.667 --> 00:02:58.200
Robert Gjuraj:
Yeah in 4 years
about 600 people.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.533
President Obama:
When people ask you what
was the Recovery Act about,

00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:04.467
what was the stimulus about;
it was about this, this plant.

00:03:04.467 --> 00:03:06.734
Narrator:
The President was so impressed
by the Siemens plant;

00:03:06.734 --> 00:03:09.367
he was still talking about it
over some rhubarb pie in Jerry's

00:03:09.367 --> 00:03:10.433
Family Restaurant.

00:03:10.433 --> 00:03:12.834
President Obama:
Two years ago we only
had 200 people there,

00:03:12.834 --> 00:03:14.700
now they got 600.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.934
In less than two years they
have tripled their work load.

00:03:16.934 --> 00:03:19.533
Narrator:
The President also
visited Mojo Organic,

00:03:19.533 --> 00:03:21.867
a small farm outside
Mount Pleasant, Iowa.

00:03:21.867 --> 00:03:22.767
Morgan Honnig:
This is my cold frame.

00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:24.500
I got this, the
money to build this.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:25.300
President Obama:
Can I peak in?

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:27.166
Morgan Honnig:
Yes, it's a little muddy
because of the rain.

00:03:27.166 --> 00:03:28.233
President Obama:
It's okay.

00:03:28.233 --> 00:03:30.367
Morgan Honnig:
So I got green beans
popping up in there.

00:03:30.367 --> 00:03:32.400
Narrator:
The President ended the
first day of his tour with

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.033
a town hall in Ottumwa, Iowa.

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:37.500
President Obama:
And these visits are
reminders that when

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.967
you get out into the heartland
and you talk to folks,

00:03:41.967 --> 00:03:46.467
there's a lot to learn
from rural America.

00:03:46.467 --> 00:03:48.300
Narrator:
On Wednesday, April 28th,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.734
President Obama continued the
White House to Main Street tour

00:03:50.734 --> 00:03:52.200
in Missouri and Illinois.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.233
He started with a visit to Poet
biorefining in Macon, Missouri,

00:03:55.233 --> 00:03:57.066
a biofuel production plant.

00:03:57.066 --> 00:03:59.767
The President then traveled to
the Schachtsiek family farm in

00:03:59.767 --> 00:04:03.300
Palmyra, Missouri, where the
topic of biofuels came up again,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.934
this time around
the kitchen table.

00:04:04.934 --> 00:04:06.233
President Obama:
What we've got to figure out is,

00:04:06.233 --> 00:04:08.266
how do we -- and this goes
to the point you were making,

00:04:08.266 --> 00:04:13.133
Walt, is how do we use what
we've got here, in an effective way.

00:04:13.133 --> 00:04:21.033
Because we've become so reliant on
our economy shipping in billions

00:04:21.033 --> 00:04:22.800
of dollars of oil every day?

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:24.834
Narrator:
Before heading back to
Washington Wednesday night,

00:04:24.834 --> 00:04:27.266
the President spoke to a
crowd in Quincy, Illinois,

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:29.266
to highlight the need
for Wall Street reform.

00:04:29.266 --> 00:04:30.967
President Obama:
We're going to get this done,

00:04:30.967 --> 00:04:33.934
and we're going to get it
done because you demand it.

00:04:33.934 --> 00:04:39.300
It's been two years since this
crisis, born on Wall Street,

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:42.567
slammed into Main Street
with its full fury.

00:04:42.567 --> 00:04:44.767
Narrator:
On Thursday, April 29th,

00:04:44.767 --> 00:04:47.567
with the White House flag flying
at half mast, the President,

00:04:47.567 --> 00:04:50.333
First Lady, the
Vice-President, and Dr. Biden,

00:04:50.333 --> 00:04:53.500
left for a memorial service
at the National Cathedral for

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.767
Dorothy Height.

00:04:54.767 --> 00:04:57.133
Dr. Height was a veteran
of the civil rights movement

00:04:57.133 --> 00:04:58.800
and an American hero.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:02.200
President Obama:
Let us honor her
life by changing this

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.967
country for the better, as long
as we are blessed to live.

00:05:06.967 --> 00:05:11.734
May God bless Dr. Dorothy Height and
the union that she made more perfect.

00:05:11.734 --> 00:05:12.700
(applause)

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:14.066
Narrator:
On Thursday afternoon,
President Obama,

00:05:14.066 --> 00:05:16.900
Dr. Biden and Secretary of
Education, Arnie Duncan,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.133
continued a tradition dating
back to Harry Truman when they

00:05:20.133 --> 00:05:23.400
welcomed Sarah Brown Wessling,
the 2010 Teacher of the Year,

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.433
to the White House.

00:05:24.433 --> 00:05:26.100
President Obama:
You are like, the
teacher of the year.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:27.000
Sarah Brown Wessling:
I know.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:27.967
President Obama:
That's a pretty big deal.

00:05:27.967 --> 00:05:29.000
Sarah Brown Wessling:
It is. It is.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.700
President Obama:
Very proud of you.

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:30.633
Sarah Brown Wessling:
Thank you.

00:05:30.633 --> 00:05:32.400
President Obama:
And we do this because
you're the key to our

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.300
success in the global economy,
preparing our kids to compete at

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.066
a time when a nation's most
valuable currency is the

00:05:40.066 --> 00:05:42.367
knowledge and skills
of its people.

00:05:42.367 --> 00:05:44.000

(cross talk)

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.700
Speaker:
It's hard to sit up there all day
long. With a bunch of ears of corn.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:03.800
President Obama:
Well, just long as no members of
Congress come by you know you're alright.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.000
(laughter)

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.300
Speaker:
Oh, they're an honest bunch.
