Hi everybody! Today we are going to show you all of our helmets!

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:23.080
First: our favorite brand when it comes to helmets: JW.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:30.620
This is Anna´s helmet, which is navy blue.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.420
As you can see it is a JW bling hat, but some of the stones have fallen off.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:50.680
We have received extra stones that we will glue back on the helmet.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:05.380
And here is my dear everyday helmet. Also a JW helmet, but this one is black without stones.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.940
This helmet is so comfy and fits our heads so good!

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.900
It stays on the head even if you turn it upside down and shake it ;)

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.020
The only negative thing about this helmet is that it is very hot, especially in the summer.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.180
Here is my competition helmet.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:43.380
Also a black JW, but in the bling hat version.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:55.100
When you buy JW helmets, consider the fact that they stretch quite much.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.480
So make sure not to buy a helmet that allready from the beginning is a bit big.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.240
If they are a little tight from the beginning, they will fit perfect after some use!

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:24.920
And finally we´re going to leave the brand JW.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:34.180
This is my OneK helmet that i bought this winter.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:43.940
It reminds us about JW in the fitting, and that´s why we like it so much.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:51.740
It´s also very good-looking. We really like that it´s shiny but still stylish.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:02.420
I´m very careful with this helmet, and therefore I don´t use it when I ride in the woods.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.900
A very good helmet tip for us with oval shaped heads!

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:36.060
This is Anna´s latest purchase: a Charles Owen Ayr8 Sparkly!

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:45.240
It is very comfy, and like our other helmets it fits us with oval heads.

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.360
I really like the glitter.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:06.080
With Swarowski it probably would have been "too much" but this glitter makes it stylish.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:29.380
The glitter is available in different sets. Anna has chosen the most discreete set.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.540
I would really want a brown helmet like this with brown/golden glitter!

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:50.420
Speaking swenglish ;)

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:25.060
We love our helmets and it´s fun to have a couple of different helmets to switch  between.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:36.240
That was our helmets. Feel free to comment which helmet that is your favorite and give us your tips!

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:41.000
