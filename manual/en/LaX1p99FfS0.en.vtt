It's very colorful and very delicious.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.380
Ginger dressing gives a very nice tangy flavor.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.100
This salad can be served as a light lunch.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.760
This recipe will serve 3-4.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:35.140
For the salad we need:

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.480
One 15 oz can of black eyed beans, washed and drained.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.840

and black eyed peas over medium heat.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:56.660

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.160

Stir fry this for about 2 minutes.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:30.540
I stir fried the potatoes and black eyed peas for about 2 minutes.

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.820
And now we have to wait till this cool off before we add

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:38.920
the tomatoes and bell pepper.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.220

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.680
