00:00:02.834 --> 00:00:04.467
President Obama:
It is a great pleasure
to have a chance to meet

00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:06.834
with Chancellor Merkel.

00:00:06.834 --> 00:00:10.567
Not only do I have great
personal admiration for her,

00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:16.667
but obviously the strong
alliance between our two

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:20.600
countries is one of the
cornerstones of prosperity

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.934
and peace not just in the
transatlantic relationship

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:25.667
but in the world.

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:30.500
And we are very proud of the
work that we've been doing

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.166
together -- as NATO allies, we
obviously have a lot to talk

00:00:36.166 --> 00:00:40.233
about with respect to
issues like Afghanistan;

00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:44.467
on economic issues,
as G20 members,

00:00:44.467 --> 00:00:47.133
but also as two of the
world's largest economies,

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.934
making sure that we can
continue with the balanced

00:00:49.934 --> 00:00:55.100
and sustainable growth
that all of us seek.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.734
So I'm looking forward to a
productive meeting not just here

00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:03.166
with Chancellor Merkel
but as part of the G20.

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:07.967
And I'm confident that, as a
consequence of the work that

00:01:07.967 --> 00:01:11.033
we have been doing and
will continue to do,

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:16.300
that we are going to be able
to put the world on a path

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.567
that ensures strong growth
and opportunity for both

00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:21.567
of our peoples.

00:01:21.567 --> 00:01:24.166
So it's wonderful
to see you again.

00:01:24.166 --> 00:02:04.066
Chancellor Merkel:
(speaking in German)

00:02:04.066 --> 00:02:05.266
Chancellor Merkel:
(as translated)
Well, I, too, am very glad to

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:07.734
have had the opportunity
to meet again.

00:02:07.734 --> 00:02:11.166
I think we personally haven't
met since the Toronto meetings,

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:14.200
so I think it's a very good
thing to yet again demonstrate

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.200
that we are willing to share
responsibility together and

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.934
to use this meeting here
to send a signal, really,

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:26.266
a good signal for
our global growth.

00:02:26.266 --> 00:02:29.500
We have worked well together and
continue to work well together

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.800
on a number of areas, and I
think in very crucial areas.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.800
And I think it's very necessary
to work together because only

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.233
together will we be able to
tackle the crucial problems in

00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:43.900
the world today -- problems
and issues such as Afghanistan,

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.667
the upcoming NATO
summit meeting,

00:02:45.667 --> 00:02:48.767
and also obviously this
meeting of the G20.

00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:51.567
So I am confident
that here, too,

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:54.700
we shall continue to share
responsibility and to work

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.133
well together.
