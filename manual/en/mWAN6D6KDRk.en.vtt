Hi, I’m Chef Tony Matassa with BBQGuys.com,
have you ever wanted to infuse your BBQ with

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.860
the flavor of your favorite beer?

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.140
Well today, I’ll show you how to do just
that by brining a pork shoulder, we’ll be

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.940
brining it to make pulled pork tacos that
we’ll top with a homemade slaw.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.619
Let’s get started by making the brine.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:33.090
In a sauce pan over medium heat, melt a little
butter and saute diced yellow onions until

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.550
they are caramalized.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.120
Next, pour in 16 ounces of water.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.870
Juice a fresh orange, and go ahead and throw
in the peel because it will infuse some great

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.839
citrus flavor.

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:52.940
Now add in 6 bay leaves, followed by the fresh
squeezed juice and peel of one lemon.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.010
I think IPA has some grapefruit flavor similarities,
so the lemon and orange will compliment the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:59.370
citrus notes in this beer.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.850
Here I have some fresh chopped sage.. and
rosemary.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.070
For a spicy kick, I like to add in some fresh
cracked black and white pepper.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.300
And now for the key components of any brine...granulated
sugar and kosher salt.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:20.800
I also like to add in a little honey to my
brine.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.330
Stir everything around until the sugar and
salt dissolves, then turn off your burner.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.010
Now you can add in the second 16 ounces of
water, preferably cold so that the brine cools

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:32.850
down faster.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.160
Now to complete this brine, grab 5 cans of
your favorite IPA, today I am using Tin Roof

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.570
Juke Joint from a local Baton Rouge brewery.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.770
Once the beer is incorporated, your brine
is ready to be used once it cools.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:56.760
Now we'll just set the pork shoulder in the
brine, and once it's sealed up in here.. it'll

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.790
be in here for a good 12 hours or so.. so
I'll put this in the refrigerator and then

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:05.440
we can begin making our slaw.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.530
I like to coat some pineapple in a little
butter and coconut sugar, then throw it on

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.430
the grill to caramelize the sugar.

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:16.349
Just dice up the pineapple and place it in
a large mixing bowl with shredded purple and

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.450
green cabbage.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.820
For a little extra color and crunch, add in
some (grated?) carrots.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:28.230
Keep the seasoning simple with some black
pepper and coarse salt to taste.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.470
Stir everything to incorporate.. and then
you guessed it.. it's time to pour in some

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.470
beer.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:41.100
I'm using the same beer I used in the brine
so that the flavor carries over to the slaw.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.650
Sweeten the slaw with some coconut sugar,
or brown sugar, and toss to coat.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:50.920
Finally, finish off the slaw with one to two
fresh squeezed limes.

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.370
Set the slaw in the fridge and let it marinate
until you are ready to serve.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:56.630
Alright, my Pork Shoulder has brined..

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.880
I have my Primo preheated for 225 with my
deflector plates in, and about 5 chunks of

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.630
cherry wood in there.. it’s time for us
to get the Pork Shoulder in.

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:11.230
We’ll check back in about 3 hours, when
the internal temperature of the pork hits

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.160
about 165 degrees F, were ready to wrap it
in foil for the rest of the cook so it doesnt

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.330
loose any extra moisture.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:26.959
Alright, so it’s been about 4 hours, and
the internal is at 165 degrees F. I’m going

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:34.400
to remove it, and wrap it in Pachament paper,
and then double wrap with heavy duty tin foil.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:40.230
Once wrapped, return it to the grill and let
it cruise at 225 until the internal temperature

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:49.020
of the roast hits 190 degrees F. The Pork
shoulder just hit 190, I will remove it,and..

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.680
this is the toughest part, you have to let
it rest for at least 30 minutes before pulling

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.250
it.

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:00.470
After resting, begin by unwrapping, be very
careful.. it will be extremely hot.

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:02.440
It's almost time to dig in!

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:09.490
Oh, wow... look at all those juices, this
is what you want to see, when the bone pulls

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:14.150
out clean like this.. you know it is going
to be tender!

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:18.600
The pork is still pretty hot, so I am using
bear claws to shred it easier.

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.870
This is going to taste great, the hardest
part is waiting to assemble the tacos..

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.000
I want to dive in right now!

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.230
Once shredded, pour in some barbecue sauce,
this is my homemade amber ale bbq sauce, i'll

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.599
post the link to that recipe if you want to
use it.

00:04:35.599 --> 00:04:39.780
I used amber ale from the tin roof Brewery,
here it is a local Baton Rouge brewery.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.930
Making your own bbq sauce is the perfect way
to finish a dish like this one, and now to

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:50.349
finish everything off, I think we will pour
a fresh brew!

00:04:50.349 --> 00:04:58.990
Here is how it looks plated, let’s dig in!

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:06.309
I have to be honest, that is almost too much
awesome in one..

00:05:06.309 --> 00:05:07.490
thing.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:10.360
A taco holds together all of the awesome,
right?

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:14.350
You have the grilled pineapple bringing a
little sweetness to counteract the bitterness

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:19.110
from the beer, the Tin Roof Juke Joint to
wash it down as a little palette cleanse,

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:22.639

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:26.560
