00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.349
I"m going to add a few shapes to the slide

00:00:08.349 --> 00:00:10.899
a rectangle

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:16.039
an isosceles triangle

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.199
a ring

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:27.150
a cube

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:33.410
a right arrow call out

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.950
and a circle pie

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.270
what i want to show with the shapes are
what libre office calls extra handles

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.250
some people refer to them as special
handles

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.259
a rectangle

00:00:48.259 --> 00:00:49.600
does not have any

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.110
extra handles

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.630
but our triangle

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:58.380
has one right here at the top

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.569
and we see a yellow circle

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:01.530
within

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.900
the blue square

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.989
and when are carol is over it

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.550
it becomes a hand

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:08.880
allows us to drag

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.160
and change our shape in this case a
triangle

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.760
from one side

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.030
to the other

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.510
or we can go back to middle

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.810
our ring

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.520
also has a special handle its right here on
left hand side if I move it to the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.570
right

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.350
are ring becomes thicker

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.210
if I move it to the left

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.460
the ring becomes thinner

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.800
out cube also has an extra handle

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.840
and moving that

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.170
makes our cube

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.410
thinner and longer or

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:48.340
taller and wider

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.270
our circle pi has actually got 2
extra handles

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.500
these handles can adjust

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:58.040
not only that width of the pie

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.030
but the direction it's pointing in
without going into rotation mode

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.020
which we can also change it that way

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:09.759
our right arrow call out

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:11.150
is actually get

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.680
three extra handles

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.499
this far left one changes the size of our
 box

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:18.620
this one in the middle

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.469
changes the height

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:24.259
of the area connecting the box to the arrow

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:26.999
and the length of the arrow itself

00:02:26.999 --> 00:02:30.259
where as this last one

00:02:30.259 --> 00:02:32.519
changes the width of the arrow

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.559
lots of our shapes have extra
handles you just need the play with them

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:37.859
to find out

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.379
what they do

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:41.829
one last shape i want to comment about

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.479
it's a circle pie that i added to my
custom toolbar in one of the first

00:02:45.479 --> 00:02:47.400
tutorials of the series

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.399
when I add that to my page

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:56.629
it's got a circle dashed line when i let
up my mouse

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.959
a little line from the center of the pie

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:01.329
to the edge

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.989
as single click in my fingers off the
mouse

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.209
and dragging it around so i can make

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:07.970
full-circle or

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.459
the size of the pie that i would like to
be

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:13.419
but once i click it again

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:18.519
it stays where it is it's different then
the circle pi from basic shapes which we

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:19.609
see here

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:22.089
this one gives us the 2 extra handles

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:24.799
this one that i added to my custom
toolbar

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:25.729
that one

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:27.779
does not give us any special handles

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.499
once we've created it

00:03:29.499 --> 00:03:33.430
that's what we have to work with

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.139
for this next part i'm going to turn it
on my styles

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:38.240
and i've created

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:40.119
some different colors styles

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:43.999
i'm going to create one now just to
remind us all of how i created all these

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:45.259
other ones

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:46.180
right-click

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.899
new

00:03:49.899 --> 00:03:51.839
area orange

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:56.719
and i'm going to click on the area tab

00:03:56.719 --> 00:03:57.650
and make this

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.049
chart ten

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.359
so now i'm going to make my rectangle

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:06.669
blue

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.009
my triangle green

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:10.139
my ring

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:11.139
red

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:14.279
and my cube yellow

00:04:14.279 --> 00:04:16.299
now what i want to show with this

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.430
is how when we move our shapes

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:19.969
over

00:04:19.969 --> 00:04:22.310
one another

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.879
they're actually

00:04:23.879 --> 00:04:26.699
are on their own layer

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.839
and we can see the cube is in front of
our ring

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:34.229
which is in front of are triangle which
is infront of our

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:35.790
rectangle

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.349
let's take a look at how the move a
shape to a different shape layer

00:04:40.349 --> 00:04:44.419
I right-click on the shape that i want to change
the layer of

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.850
and come down to arrange

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:51.249
here we've got the option to bring
in front meaning bringing front of

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:54.780
all of the shapes

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.469
now that i'm in front

00:04:57.469 --> 00:05:04.469
i can only send backward or sent to
the back this is sending behind of the shapes

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:11.379
bringing forward just brings it up one
shape, now here it looks like it didn't

00:05:11.379 --> 00:05:12.449
move it all

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:13.930
but wait now

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.080
were in front of the blue shape

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.389
so we have bring the front which brings
in front of all the ships bring forward

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.970
which comes up one layer at a time

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:29.560
send backwards sends it back one layer
at a time send to back sends it too

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.679
the way back

00:05:31.679 --> 00:05:35.569
now we have infront of object or behind
object

00:05:35.569 --> 00:05:39.699
well were behind a lot of objects so
let's click that

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:42.659
and when i go over these other objects

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:47.340
it asks me which one do you want to be
in front of

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:48.710
and that even works

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.979
with objects that it's not connected to its

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:55.180
any object on the page

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:58.150
so we will put it in front of the cube

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:05.150
and now we are in front of the cube

00:06:05.319 --> 00:06:07.919
behind the cube

00:06:07.919 --> 00:06:12.530
let's take a look at another example

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.180
i'm going to double-click on circle

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.069
make a big one

00:06:18.069 --> 00:06:20.889
one little smaller

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:22.529
little smaller

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:25.930
and then very little one

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:29.889
maybe make this one just a tad smaller

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:31.110
i'm going to make this one

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:34.159
white with the black line

00:06:34.159 --> 00:06:37.479
i'll make this one black

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:40.499
will make this one yellow

00:06:40.499 --> 00:06:45.310
and our last one red

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:51.400
now let's check are layers make sure
that our black goes over are white

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.429
are yellow goes over the black

00:06:54.429 --> 00:06:55.300
and the red

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:58.879
goes over the yellow

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:01.189
now if we select all these

00:07:01.189 --> 00:07:03.419
and right click

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:06.460
we went over alignment in earlier
tutorial

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:12.370
so I'm going to click on center make them all
even top-to-bottom

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.549
and now i'm going to do the same thing

00:07:14.549 --> 00:07:16.139
and make them all centered

00:07:16.139 --> 00:07:17.039
vertically

00:07:17.039 --> 00:07:19.039
as well as horizontally

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:20.569
and now we've got at target
