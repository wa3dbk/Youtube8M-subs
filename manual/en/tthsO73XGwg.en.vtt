and arts and crafts projects to keep you busy

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.229
Jen: This is Dr. Lafflel, she's the chief of Pediatrics
Micaela: Dr. Laffel, can you tell us

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.530
a little bit more about how family is incorporated here at Joslin?

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.479
Dr. Laffel: when a child is diagnosed with
diabetes, basically the family

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.970
now has diabetes. Diabetes at any age is not a do-it-yourself condition.

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.229
Particularly for children with diabetes,
these children

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.460
are relying upon the adults in their
lives, particularly their parents

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.490
to care for their diabetes. So families

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.660
are they important? They are absolutely critical. And the Child Life team allows us to

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:10.470
focus

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.770
on the questions and the needs of families

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:19.379
and to provide the support that families need. Because
the children who have diabetes

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:22.700
can be pleasantly occupied in

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.370
educational activities and support
activities with our wonderful Child Life

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.980
team

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.879
while we're working with the parents, with the family members to ensure

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.300
that their children are getting
the up-to-date information

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.010
all so that we are able to ensure their
children with diabetes

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.670
experience normal growth and development, 
that we can do our best to prevent

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.050
diabetes complications, to preserve the
health of our children

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.340
with diabetes, and most above all 
to protect their futures.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.360
Because the children we have today are the future for all of us tomorrow.

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.250
Micaela: Thanks for joining us for this tour of Pediatrics!
Jen: We look forward to seeing you at Joslin.
