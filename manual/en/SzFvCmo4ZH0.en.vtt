Welcome to InstaPrompter
Type into one device and it shows on another

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:13.400
You don’t need WIFI or BlueTooth
It just works

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.000
In this video we’re going to learn to make
it blink,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
beam images, use many different devices,
and change screen colors and fonts

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.570
Let’s get started
InstaPrompter consists of 2 apps

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.000
a sender and a receiver app
Let’s open the receiver app on an iPad

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.499
and let’s make this iPhone the sender
The sender looks like a note taking app

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:41.100
This way nobody will know that you’re using
a teleprompter

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.329
Type into the fake note app and everything
appears on the autocue receiver in real-time

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.899
This will work anytime and anywhere because it doesn’t rely on WIFI or BlueTooth

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:56.940
It simply works over the Internet
This way you can secretly teleprompt in meetings

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.749
or during interviews without needing WIFI
This also allows you to prompt across the

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:10.749
room or across the entire city or continents
Either type messages or copy paste

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.789
InstaPrompter works in every language
This combined with the limitless range allows you to

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.210
have a translator in a different city live-translate your speech

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:25.079
or assist the hearing impaired in lectures.
If you press this little light bulb, the receiver

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:29.090
will start blinking
This is useful if someone is not aware that

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.420
they can be helped or they froze up on stage
Or it can be used for live signage

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.820
The camera button lets you choose whether

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.159
you want to take a picture and send it
Or beam a photo you took earlier

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.299
Let’s send a picture from my photo roll
just to see how fast this really works

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.740
Remember I’m still not on WIFI and could
be countries away

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.920
Boom. Here it is!
This means that you can send graphics, or

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.909
logos, reports, or even screen shots
Look, here’s a screen shot of my iPad

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.039
Perfect for when you need to quickly hide
that you’re using a Teleprompter

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.859
And as soon as you start typing, the words
just take over

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:11.880
You don’t need a large iPad
Even a small phone will work

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.010
InstaPrompter works on iPhone, iPad, and Android
You can mix and match with your team

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.000
Let me paste a large passage of text and BOTH devices now prompt the same script

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.450
Multiple people can receive the same cues

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.380
Scripts don’t scroll continuously like a
Teleprompter because then you’d have to

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:35.600
stare at the device
Instead it goes bit by bit so you can glance,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.220
then speak directly to your audience
Depending on where you need to hide the device,

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.230
everything works vertically as well
If many devices can be a receiver, then many

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.690
devices can also be the sender
This way an entire team can send prompts to

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:55.790
a person on stage or someone being interviewed
While the sender looks like a note app for

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.720
ultimate discretion, the receiver can change
its look

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.840
Tap this button to change look and feel
This is mirrored type for glass Teleprompters

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.370
It shows things in reverse so you can stare
into the camera but actually read from the glass

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.900
This is for ultimate secrecy Very dark. No reflections at all

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.870
This is for very bright sets and of course for live signage

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:20.090
And multiple colorful combinations for events,

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.540
trade shows, or improv comedy
Depending on which color you’re in, if you

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.980
blink the receiver, it’ll blink in those
respective colors
