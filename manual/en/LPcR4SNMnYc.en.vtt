00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.820
The customer actually will not change but
we will offer to the customer a wider, broughter

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:18.820
range so that we are convinced that we are
attractive to much more customers in the future.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:39.279
Today we have with us our director of design
Alejandro Mesonero.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:46.280
Welcome to our SEAT stand and I would like
to go with you through the new Leon ST.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.500
Which other design elements, objects had an
influence on your work?

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.920
Basically you know that when we started the
project we were asked, and this was the challenge,

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.900
how to make a family car to look good.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:17.900
We have to tell people how we designers we
work, because we are working for people. We

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.159
are working with emotions.

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:27.030
Considering that we can not move people around
the word so easily, I think it's an excellent

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.890
way of making it.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:37.789
Dr Michael Hinz, good afternoon my good friend
and colleague. Dr Michael Hinz is the technical

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.090
project manager at our technical centre in
Barcelona.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:50.090
Okay I've got a technical question.
Please you are, Josep. Josep...

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.100
It's about the front assist system. So what
is the maximum speed at which the system detects

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.719
and prevents and reacts to the ...
Basically, the challenge for a radar based

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.749
system is not the top speed is always the
lower speed because then you have the challenge,

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:11.960
the distance gets very small. But this system
goes down to zero so if you follow a car and

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.090
it stops this car will also stop.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.090
With this Google Hangout you get very good
feedback, basically, and this is also an inspiration.

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:34.459
It allow us to connect directly with the consumer,
with the press, instantly and live from the

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:42.099
stand. It also allow us and provide us a new
way to broadcast our content and our messages.

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:50.540
We have the youngest customers in Europe,
less than 40 years old in average, so of course

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.760
this prospects, this customers are very digital
driven so this kind of tool, to give access

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.120
to them, is absolutely perfect for us.
