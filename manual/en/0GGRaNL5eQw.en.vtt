00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.420
Salut c’est Géraldine.

00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.960
Welcome to Comme une Française TV, live in
France, feel at home.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:10.700
If you’re planning on spending a nice Christmas
in France with your in-laws, better not break

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.060
the sacred rules about bread.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.220
The rules are engraved in popular culture,
and only learned by experience.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.980
Even though bread seems like a detail, it
is not.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.750
Bread is at the center of French culture.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.060
Its quality and the respect we show are essential.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.880
But no worries, I’m here to help you avoid
the biggest, most embarrassing mistakes about bread.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.400
Today, on Comme une Française TV, we’ll
demystify the bread etiquette.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.860
Buying the bread you like

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.820
“Vous amenez le pain?”

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.160
Hmmm the dreaded question.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.200
If you are charged with buying bread for a
family dinner, know that this is an important mission.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.140
Bread must come from the boulangerie.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:58.880
Not the supermarket.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:01.660
And obviously, don’t bring frozen bread
dough.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.319
Ok.

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:06.440
So, bread must be from the boulangerie.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:07.560
That’s a fact.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.980
Then, it’s important you choose the baguette you want

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:20.140
une baguette bien cuite or pas trop cuite.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.980
Baguette bien cuite is a brown crust and pas trop cuite lighter crust.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.580
How much bread and which bread?

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.040
Ask your host!

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.820
For a big dinner like a Christmas dinner (with
foie gras, meat and gravy, cheese…)

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.600
I’d go for one baguette for three people.

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.480
Remember that it’s better to buy too much
bread than run out of bread.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.640
Which bread?

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.020
If there’s Foie Gras or Snails (or both!)
on the menu, you may see other kinds of bread.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.820
Again, ask your host.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:04.940
If you buy “un pain” (a loaf of bread)
instead of a baguette, you can ask for it

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.880
to be sliced.

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:11.240
“Vous pouvez le trancher s’il vous
plaît ?”

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.240
One last thing: “Pain Surprise” is not
a random bread.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.420
It can be translated as “a party loaf”
a sort of pile of sandwiches.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:27.780
If you haven’t tried it, it’s worth it
for an apéritif.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:31.680
Presenting the bread

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:39.700
A baguette is to be sliced or broken like this, never eaten like sandwich!

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.180
Bread goes into “Une corbeille à pain”.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.560
And the baguette is sliced with “un couteau à pain.”

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.780
If you want to cut slices of baguette,

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.200
cut slices this size not this size.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.440
If you bought “un pain” like we saw before  a loaf of bread, or didn’t cut the baguette, never put it

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.240
upside down.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:06.660
Never.

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.760
To some people, it’s bad luck and it's a very important to them.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.760
At the table

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.520
In France, there’s no bread plate.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.860
And it is not offered with butter (except
for a few dishes).

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.580
The bread goes at the side of your plate here, on the table cloth.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.940
It is not cut with a knife.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.240
Instead, you break it with your hands.

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.640
Don’t bite the bread like this.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.000
Cut a piece that will go entirely into your
mouth.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.780
When you run out of bread and want more, ask:

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.540
Pourriez-vous me passer le pain s’il vous
plaît ? This is polite.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:52.180
At home you can say, Tu m(e) passes un bout d(e) pain?

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.740
This is what we use at home.

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.240
If you’re asked this, pass the full “corbeille,” and not just a piece of bread!

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:02.340
Like this!

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.260
It’s up to your neighbor to choose the piece
they want.

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:12.620
One last thing: no matter how tempting it
might be, don’t eat bread before your “entrée.”

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.940
It is supposed to be a side dish, not an appetizer.

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:23.020
And as your mother would say “tu n’auras
plus faim pour le repas”

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.280
you won’t be hungry for the meal anymore.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:26.660
Et toi ?

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.340
