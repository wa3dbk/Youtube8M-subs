00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:16.020
so we are in the subway and let me show
you the location! Entrance is here, you need

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:24.000
to hack this device and the code is
locomotive so let's go through here

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:36.540
now check the map we need to go here.
There are three Riddler trophies there

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:46.360
Let's move on. You run, press the crouch button to slide down.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.780
there's no way here.... you need to move up

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:25.610
you can go over here by doing this but
this is the location of that puzzle.3,2,1....

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:34.060
Riddler- "what starts with a tick and ends with a
shock" So guys what is the solution?

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:44.240
hmm the game gives a hint that you need
to get all gadgets in order to solve

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.230
this puzzle...Let's do it then

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:16.630
now get your line launcher Riddler- "3 2 1 and the
dark light detective fails to complete my challenge"

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.230
 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:42.860
we got them all! I hope this was helpful
Riddler- "That's cheating though I am hardly

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:51.440
surprised I knew this was too difficult
for you to complete! :P"

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:58.610
Now I'm kind of happy! I like his
responses always saying- yeah, you're

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:04.040
cheating, you're cheating or whatever...
