00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:06.850
Hey guys, Dr. Axe here, and welcome again
to the Chopping Block.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.059
Today on the Chopping Block our special guest
is the banana.

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:16.080
I'll tell you, surprisingly, one of the most
common questions I get from people is, "Are

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.210
bananas good for me?"

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.730
Now we've heard of some of the great health
benefits of bananas, but on the other end,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.789
I think a lot of people worry about the sugar
content that's found in certain fruits like

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:26.789
bananas today.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.730
I'll tell you here, bananas, they are teetering
on the edge here of the Chopping Block.

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.870
Let's talk about the negatives of bananas,
and then let's talk about the positives.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.300
The negatives, without a doubt, is that is
does contain a large amount of sugar and doesn't

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.640
really have much protein or any healthy fat
whatsoever along with it.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:52.790
One medium sized banana has 27 grams of carbohydrates,
14 of those grams are sugar, and then it contains

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.390
about 1 gram of protein and 0 grams of fat.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.270
So if you're eating a banana by itself, there's
no doubt it could affect your blood sugar

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:02.570
levels in a small amount.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.120
So that is really the negative side of bananas
is right there, is if you're a person who's

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.660
trying to lose weight, if you have sensitive
blood sugar, that bananas in terms of fruit,

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.900
it's higher on the glycemic index, which means
it will typically affect your insulin more

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.320
or affect your sugar more compared to most
other fruits.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.650
Now let's talk about the positives with a
banana.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.980
Bananas are one of the most potassium rich
foods in the entire world.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:41.470
One single banana has 500 mg of potassium,
so it's packed with potassium.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.310
It has 32 mg of magnesium, so it's really
loaded with electrolytes.

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.420
So if you're an athlete, if you're a person
that works out, this is an amazing food for

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.200
you because, again, it can really help fuel
your cells.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.580
Now another thing in defending the banana
is that if you're comparing this banana even

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.070
to a bowl of oatmeal, this is still lower
on the glycemic index and has a lower amount

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:11.000
of carbohydrates than even healthier grains
out there like rice, bananas, and quinoa.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.640
So again, this really is a better option compared
to any other grains out there in my book.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:21.180
But when you're comparing it to other fruits,
like berries for instances, berries have more

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.349
antioxidants, they're higher in fiber.

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:28.560
Berries definitely have more benefits as well
as a lot of other fruits compared to a banana,

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.879
but bananas are still better than grains.

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:33.450
So what do I say about the banana in closing?

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.920
Well, here's what I would say.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.560
If you're a person who is trying to lose weight
or has some digestive issues, I really think

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.379
if you're trying to lose weight or have sensitive
blood sugar, I would remove bananas from your

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.500
diet, but I would still eat them before any
other grains.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.430
If you're an athlete or somebody who is already
pretty lean and healthy and just trying to

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.840
stay healthy, I think bananas are still a
great option for you.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.530
So when it comes to bananas getting chopped,
we're going to spare the banana here, and

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.700
we're actually going to peel it here instead
of chopping it.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:09.910
I'm actually about to go on a run, so I'm
going to eat a little bit of this banana here

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.670
because, again, it's still packed with potassium,
has some good amount of fiber, has magnesium,

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:23.969
and number one thing that saved the banana,
it is a real food, unprocessed, unhybridized,

00:03:23.969 --> 00:03:25.450
completely real.

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:31.870
Again the banana is staying here on the Chopping
Block.
