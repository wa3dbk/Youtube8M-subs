00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:05.340
Today on our 2003 Toyota Tacoma we&amp;#39;re
going to be installing the CURT trailer hitch

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.490
receiver, part number 13013.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.099
Now here&amp;#39;s what our hitch looks like installed
on our vehicle.

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:15.469
Now we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and give you a couple
measurements in helping you choose some accessories

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.630
for your hitch, such as a ball mount, a bicycle
rack, or a cargo carrier.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.339
From the center of the hitch pinhole to the
outermost edge of the bumper is approximately

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:25.970
3-1/2&amp;quot;.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.490
From the top of the opening in the receiver
to the ground is approximately 15-1/4&amp;quot;.

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.790
Now let&amp;#39;s go ahead and install our hitch.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:03:20.409
We&amp;#39;re going to begin here underneath the
vehicle 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:04:06.279
on 

00:04:06.279 --> 00:04:29.849
the 

00:04:29.849 --> 00:05:54.720
driver side.
