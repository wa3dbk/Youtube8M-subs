- [Narrator] Welcome to BBQPitBoys.com,

00:00:26.936 --> 00:00:29.947
today we're cooking up some
bacon, ham, and hot pea soup

00:00:29.947 --> 00:00:32.025
at the pit and it's real easy to do.

00:00:32.025 --> 00:00:33.867
Alright, for this recipe
you're gonna' need

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.729
some pound of smoked bacon.

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:39.347
We got about a five pound
ham roast going in there.

00:00:39.347 --> 00:00:42.376
And here I've got a pound
of green split peas.

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:45.903
Here, two ham hocks, oh
yes, smoked ham hocks.

00:00:45.903 --> 00:00:48.192
You're gonna need a medium chopped onion.

00:00:48.192 --> 00:00:50.951
You're gonna need four
minced clove garlics.

00:00:50.951 --> 00:00:52.119
Some SPG.

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:55.119
We've got some chicken broth, mmhmm.

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:59.079
I told you this is gonna
be real easy to do.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.407
Alright, let's put this together.

00:01:01.407 --> 00:01:04.252
What you wanna do is heat
up some good cooking oil,

00:01:04.252 --> 00:01:07.857
with a little olive oil like this.

00:01:07.857 --> 00:01:10.424
Alright, 'cause what
we wanna do is we wanna

00:01:10.424 --> 00:01:12.247
saute up these onions.

00:01:12.247 --> 00:01:16.414
Like I said, I've got one
medium chopped onion there.

00:01:18.031 --> 00:01:22.442
Here I've got four
cloves of minced garlic.

00:01:22.442 --> 00:01:25.442
And you wanna saute them up briefly.

00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:29.741
Now if you've never had
bacon, ham, and hock pea soup

00:01:29.741 --> 00:01:33.558
before, you definitely
gotta check this out.

00:01:33.558 --> 00:01:36.516
Perfect when it's real cold outside.

00:01:36.516 --> 00:01:39.603
Now, wanna take those ham hocks
and like I said, these have

00:01:39.603 --> 00:01:43.397
been smoked, so we're just
gonna cook 'em up a bit.

00:01:43.397 --> 00:01:45.814
Put some SPG in there,
you always wanna put

00:01:45.814 --> 00:01:47.647
a little seasoning in.

00:01:49.028 --> 00:01:52.778
Oh man, can smell it
already, it smells good.

00:01:53.846 --> 00:01:57.679
Now here I've got eight
cups of chicken broth.

00:01:58.681 --> 00:02:01.031
Now you can just use water,
but a chicken broth's

00:02:01.031 --> 00:02:05.503
gonna make this rich
and stick to your ribs.

00:02:05.503 --> 00:02:09.817
Put the cover on and bring it to a simmer.

00:02:09.817 --> 00:02:13.247
Alright, it's been simmering
for maybe 15 minutes

00:02:13.247 --> 00:02:17.414
and here we're gonna take those
split peas and drop 'em in.

00:02:19.998 --> 00:02:21.990
Yeah those vegematics might just give us

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:23.894
a thumbs up on this one.

00:02:23.894 --> 00:02:25.889
(laughter)

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:28.568
Now we're gonna simmer this for about

00:02:28.568 --> 00:02:30.568
two hours, get it right.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.152
About an hour's gone by and
let's check on this soup.

00:02:38.152 --> 00:02:41.235
Man those ham hocks are cookin' good.

00:02:42.308 --> 00:02:45.399
Pea soup's beginning to thicken up.

00:02:45.399 --> 00:02:48.566
Probably got another hour to go.

00:02:48.566 --> 00:02:52.066
Let's check on this ham and bacon, oh man.

00:02:53.098 --> 00:02:55.098
They're just about done.

00:02:56.984 --> 00:02:59.547
And as you can bet, in
the miracle of time,

00:02:59.547 --> 00:03:03.402
two hours has gone by
and take a look at this.

00:03:03.402 --> 00:03:07.460
It's gotten nice and
thick, it's gettin' creamy.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:10.077
What we wanna do now
is pull these ham hocks

00:03:10.077 --> 00:03:11.512
out of the soup.

00:03:11.512 --> 00:03:15.679
We're gonna take the good
meat right off the bone.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:18.745
You don't want the skin
in there, you just want

00:03:18.745 --> 00:03:20.754
the nice tender meat of the bone.

00:03:20.754 --> 00:03:22.921
You know about this right?

00:03:24.254 --> 00:03:27.004
Alright, the hocks have been cut.

00:03:27.957 --> 00:03:31.290
Throw 'em back into that split pea soup.

00:03:33.228 --> 00:03:36.311
Now, gonna add the bacon and the ham.

00:03:37.535 --> 00:03:39.806
You know where we're
going with this right?

00:03:39.806 --> 00:03:42.262
Now we're gonna take
about a pound of bacon,

00:03:42.262 --> 00:03:46.429
or what's left after pickin',
just chop it up pretty small.

00:03:52.863 --> 00:03:56.946
Yeah and you can bet,
throw it right in that pot.

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.049
Alright, now you wanna grab a couple

00:04:04.065 --> 00:04:05.648
slices of this ham.

00:04:06.735 --> 00:04:10.902
Gonna use about a pound and
a half, maybe two pounds,

00:04:11.938 --> 00:04:13.521
of this smoked ham.

00:04:15.845 --> 00:04:18.910
You can bet, this is gonna
be some finger lickin' good.

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:20.807
(laughter)

00:04:20.807 --> 00:04:24.724
Now chop up this ham in
small bite size pieces.

00:04:27.678 --> 00:04:30.183
Of course you can use
as much ham as you want,

00:04:30.183 --> 00:04:32.516
that's pit master privilege.

00:04:37.365 --> 00:04:39.764
Alright, the ham has been chopped.

00:04:39.764 --> 00:04:41.431
Throw it in the pot.

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:48.169
Mix it up with all that
bacon and ham hock meat.

00:04:50.731 --> 00:04:51.898
What have you.

00:04:55.321 --> 00:04:58.688
Now one last thing, you wanna
season it up briefly again.

00:04:58.688 --> 00:05:02.169
So more SPG, but be careful,
there's plenty of salt

00:05:02.169 --> 00:05:04.677
in the bacon and in the ham.

00:05:04.677 --> 00:05:06.594
Just hit it, mix it up.

00:05:10.547 --> 00:05:12.807
Put the cover on for about 15 minutes,

00:05:12.807 --> 00:05:15.307
let the flavors come together.

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:21.792
Alright, I'd say it's time to eat.

00:05:29.553 --> 00:05:31.220
Take a look at that.

00:05:32.747 --> 00:05:34.048
You smell that?

00:05:34.048 --> 00:05:35.465
This smells good.

00:05:36.663 --> 00:05:39.080

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:34.869
