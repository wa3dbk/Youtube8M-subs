00:00:07.086 --> 00:00:12.476
&gt;&gt;Jalen: I was, I think,
three years old

00:00:12.556 --> 00:00:16.796
when I first went on the computer.

00:00:16.796 --> 00:00:20.096
I was five when I got my Game
Boy, used to play that every day.

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:24.176
It was just so fun, so I equally
use my Game Boy and my computer,

00:00:24.546 --> 00:00:28.946
so I get an hour to play each so that
I would do basketball during the time

00:00:29.386 --> 00:00:30.796
that I wasn't doing technology.

00:00:30.796 --> 00:00:34.446
And when during the times I wasn't
doing anything I would just lay

00:00:34.446 --> 00:00:34.836
down and chill.

00:00:35.416 --> 00:00:36.476
&gt;&gt;Zoey, Zoey.

00:00:38.726 --> 00:00:42.786
&gt;&gt;At seven years old, that's really
when I started drawing a lot.

00:00:42.786 --> 00:00:45.846
I like it, it's fun, and the
people compliment on my drawings,

00:00:46.086 --> 00:00:47.316
so I think that's kind of fun.

00:00:48.046 --> 00:00:51.676
And then at 10 years old,
when I went to 5th grade,

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:53.616
I made my first comic book.

00:00:53.616 --> 00:00:56.836
And after that I went
into sixth grade,

00:00:56.836 --> 00:01:00.956
and that's when I got my laptop, and
then I started using that more often.

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:02.596
I joined the DYM program.

00:01:02.596 --> 00:01:04.876
&gt;&gt;Akili: If you know your
account, pull it up on your laptop.

00:01:05.276 --> 00:01:06.856
&gt;&gt;The Digital Youth Network
was really trying to look

00:01:06.856 --> 00:01:09.016
to see how now the students
are really inundated

00:01:09.016 --> 00:01:10.356
with all this new technology.

00:01:10.356 --> 00:01:12.996
How does that impact how kids
socialize, and then how does that,

00:01:12.996 --> 00:01:14.886
in turn, impact how
they learn as well?

00:01:15.086 --> 00:01:17.696
&gt;&gt;There's a project
called "Editing Project 1."

00:01:17.856 --> 00:01:19.396
Everybody got that?

00:01:19.396 --> 00:01:22.096
&gt;&gt;The kid can come in and they
can do digital music production,

00:01:22.096 --> 00:01:26.516
graphic design and animation, game
design or digital video production.

00:01:26.516 --> 00:01:27.776
&gt;&gt;Why do they go slow motion?

00:01:27.776 --> 00:01:29.086
Why were they going
slow motion, though?

00:01:29.086 --> 00:01:30.306
&gt;&gt;Akili: The kids on
their own are jumping

00:01:30.306 --> 00:01:32.646
across from all these different
mediums, so we really need to kind

00:01:32.646 --> 00:01:35.056
of explore all of them as
well and try to support kids

00:01:35.416 --> 00:01:38.736
to become better producers
and consumers, and critique is

00:01:38.736 --> 00:01:39.856
within all these different pieces.

00:01:40.136 --> 00:01:43.866
&gt;&gt;So Remix World is kind of like
MySpace, kind of like Facebook mixed

00:01:43.866 --> 00:01:46.216
with a little bit of YouTube as
well, so you can go on there.

00:01:46.476 --> 00:01:48.886
You can post your own
videos that y'all make.

00:01:49.286 --> 00:01:50.726
You can post the music
that you're making.

00:01:50.826 --> 00:01:52.966
I saw that you were remixing
a song online already.

00:01:53.376 --> 00:01:53.616
&gt;&gt;I did.

00:01:53.616 --> 00:01:56.346
&gt;&gt;Akili: Remix World is a contained
social-networking site that's only

00:01:56.346 --> 00:01:58.566
open to our students and our mentors.

00:01:58.686 --> 00:01:59.736
&gt;&gt;So the rest of the kids

00:01:59.736 --> 00:02:01.626
in the school can actually
see what you guys are doing,

00:02:01.786 --> 00:02:04.196
and you can also go in and
you can comment and critique

00:02:04.276 --> 00:02:05.316
on what everybody else has done.

00:02:05.466 --> 00:02:08.236
&gt;&gt;So, the idea is that students
for us are already spending all

00:02:08.236 --> 00:02:11.046
of their time on all these different
social-networking communities

00:02:11.086 --> 00:02:11.686
around the Web.

00:02:11.886 --> 00:02:14.306
Why can't we re-appropriate
those kind of tools

00:02:14.306 --> 00:02:17.066
and then there's more
formal educational context?

00:02:17.466 --> 00:02:22.576
&gt;&gt;Jalen: I post up videos, poems and
just whatever I thought was, like --

00:02:22.736 --> 00:02:24.736
that my opinion was it was cool.

00:02:24.736 --> 00:02:28.626
I would post up on the Remix World
to see what other people thought.

00:02:28.626 --> 00:02:31.976
Sometimes on YouTube I get worse
feedback than the Remix World.

00:02:32.306 --> 00:02:35.076
Well, I'm okay with that, though,
because I know there's a lot

00:02:35.166 --> 00:02:38.766
of people on YouTube that're
better than me at what I do,

00:02:38.766 --> 00:02:41.416
because they've been doing it longer
and they know how to do it better.

00:02:41.816 --> 00:02:45.426
I accept that and I'll try harder
to make mine just as good as theirs.

00:02:46.356 --> 00:02:48.106
&gt;&gt;That's one of the
shoes I've created.

00:02:48.106 --> 00:02:52.316
First I just took a layout of the
normal Nike Dunkers just plain white,

00:02:52.316 --> 00:02:55.066
and after I add in colors
and different, like, images.

00:02:55.586 --> 00:02:58.126
When I created this shoe I
was thinking of Halloween,

00:02:58.276 --> 00:03:02.796
so I put in some 3D pumpkins almost
all across the front of the shoe.

00:03:02.906 --> 00:03:04.036
&gt;&gt;Scoop: Have your seat.

00:03:04.036 --> 00:03:07.136
Do your thing, sit back
and get out of your way.

00:03:07.256 --> 00:03:12.776
&gt;&gt;Jalen has always been
creative, always, and he did that.

00:03:13.046 --> 00:03:15.086
In his mind kind of
thinks a little different.

00:03:15.086 --> 00:03:20.476
He's very open, and to see him fall
into something that can connect

00:03:20.476 --> 00:03:23.446
with where his mind goes
sometimes and be able

00:03:23.446 --> 00:03:26.696
to have him do something
tangible, it's amazing to see that.

00:03:27.386 --> 00:03:30.836
&gt;&gt;Jalen: "A Division to Our Own" was
a movie that we made in the summer.

00:03:31.376 --> 00:03:32.046
I enjoyed it.

00:03:32.046 --> 00:03:33.496
I was a graphic artist,

00:03:34.176 --> 00:03:38.586
so technically what I did was
I created all the posters.

00:03:38.816 --> 00:03:42.996
&gt;&gt;I decided to use fingerprints,
because that's your identity,

00:03:43.306 --> 00:03:46.106
and I put them in different colors
for different races like that.

00:03:46.246 --> 00:03:50.716
&gt;&gt;You can sit wherever you'd like.

00:03:50.716 --> 00:03:55.206
&gt;&gt;Jalen: The movie was technically
about a class, which was in Room 201,

00:03:55.666 --> 00:03:57.546
and how races were segregated

00:03:57.546 --> 00:03:59.296
and that they then
discussed about racism.

00:03:59.986 --> 00:04:03.976
&gt;&gt;At the top it says "what divides
us," so they're all divided apart,

00:04:04.366 --> 00:04:06.286
and that there on the bottom,
it says "what unites us"

00:04:06.286 --> 00:04:07.516
and then they're all in one circle.

00:04:08.486 --> 00:04:09.826
&gt;&gt;Tracy: It feeds into his academics.

00:04:09.826 --> 00:04:11.436
He's reading.

00:04:11.436 --> 00:04:15.746
He's learning and he's figuring
out how to incorporate all

00:04:15.746 --> 00:04:17.416
of the technology into that.

00:04:17.926 --> 00:04:21.296
And I think it's teaching him
different ways to think about things

00:04:21.296 --> 00:04:25.926
and to figure out problems, so I see
him becoming even a better student

00:04:26.376 --> 00:04:27.206
as a result.

00:04:27.566 --> 00:04:31.786
&gt;&gt;Jalen: Sometimes we have
assignments like book reports

00:04:31.786 --> 00:04:33.506
and stuff, so what
I usually like to do

00:04:33.506 --> 00:04:37.096
for my book report is make a comic,
where I have, like, little squares

00:04:37.096 --> 00:04:38.836
where I could put, like,
some pictures in there

00:04:39.066 --> 00:04:41.726
and have the speech bubble
coming out and it says, "Hi.

00:04:41.726 --> 00:04:45.806
This is a book report from Jalen
Jackson," yadda, yadda, yadda,

00:04:45.806 --> 00:04:47.446
all that stuff that you
need in the book report.

00:04:47.446 --> 00:04:50.826
And sometimes we have
to do PowerPoints.

00:04:50.976 --> 00:04:54.066
Sometimes we do games,
all that stuff.

00:04:54.256 --> 00:04:58.456
&gt;&gt;Akili: Jaden has been in video
games for a couple of years now,

00:04:58.536 --> 00:05:00.866
so last year they were
using a tool called Scratch.

00:05:01.606 --> 00:05:05.536
&gt;&gt;Jalen: Scratch is a program where
you kind of make your own characters,

00:05:05.536 --> 00:05:08.846
and after that you edit their
actions so that they could probably,

00:05:08.846 --> 00:05:11.216
like, run maybe or anything.

00:05:11.376 --> 00:05:13.566
&gt;&gt;Akili: Then all you got
to do is tell the program

00:05:13.906 --> 00:05:16.296
that when I press left or
something that I want it

00:05:16.296 --> 00:05:18.586
to do the walking animation.

00:05:18.586 --> 00:05:21.686
&gt;&gt;Jalen: Yes, and after
that I put it into my game.

00:05:21.686 --> 00:05:22.986
&gt;&gt;Akili: Jalen is typical
in the sense

00:05:22.986 --> 00:05:24.856
that I think he embraces exploration,

00:05:25.196 --> 00:05:27.956
but I think he's a little
bit more unique in the sense

00:05:27.956 --> 00:05:30.696
that he takes it a step
further on his own very often,

00:05:30.966 --> 00:05:34.606
so he decides that he likes anime,
but now on his own he decided

00:05:34.636 --> 00:05:40.406
that he was going to learn how
to create an anime music video.

00:05:40.406 --> 00:05:43.166
&gt;&gt;Jalen: The idea was
cut up different clips.

00:05:43.166 --> 00:05:46.766
Then I pick a really good song that
I think will go good with the clips,

00:05:46.766 --> 00:05:49.256
and I thought I'd just
put it all together.

00:05:49.256 --> 00:05:50.726
&gt;&gt;Scoop: He's really into this,

00:05:50.726 --> 00:05:53.866
and me sitting there literally
creating a video, a music video.

00:05:53.976 --> 00:05:56.306
First four or five hours and he
have a three-minute video together.

00:05:57.086 --> 00:06:00.646
Six months later, four or five
hours he'd had four or five,

00:06:00.846 --> 00:06:02.686
four videos together,
so it was like, wow.

00:06:02.686 --> 00:06:07.176
And he's very, very,
very passionate about it.

00:06:07.176 --> 00:06:09.086
&gt;&gt;What's television class
going to be like, Jalen?

00:06:09.086 --> 00:06:10.756
&gt;&gt;Jalen: I think we're
recording this week.

00:06:10.756 --> 00:06:14.406
&gt;&gt;I need some sort of outline
what you guys are going

00:06:14.406 --> 00:06:15.136
to do on your show.

00:06:15.656 --> 00:06:17.116
&gt;&gt;Jalen: They want us to be able

00:06:17.236 --> 00:06:19.886
to make a movie using all
those skills of writing.

00:06:19.886 --> 00:06:21.736
They want it to have
a good storyline.

00:06:21.736 --> 00:06:22.406
&gt;&gt;So president

00:06:22.606 --> 00:06:24.936
&gt;&gt;Jalen: They want it
to have a certain amount

00:06:24.936 --> 00:06:27.896
of vocabulary that'll be appropriate
for a seventh-grade level,

00:06:28.496 --> 00:06:30.606
and they want it to
be at least something

00:06:30.606 --> 00:06:32.316
that would be interesting to watch.

00:06:33.036 --> 00:06:36.346
&gt;&gt;Right now I'm editing the clips
shorter so that it kind of looks more

00:06:36.346 --> 00:06:38.336
like a movie and not just

00:06:38.336 --> 00:06:42.186
like pictures just
floating out of the air.

00:06:42.266 --> 00:06:46.066
So I'm going to see how
that works out first.

00:06:46.296 --> 00:06:48.586
The stuff goes faster...

00:06:48.786 --> 00:06:52.706
&gt;&gt;Tracy: Jalen's a silly 12-year-old.

00:06:52.706 --> 00:06:54.416
&gt;&gt;Scoop: And he's proud
of being silly.

00:06:54.636 --> 00:06:55.236
&gt;&gt;Shut up, give me my game.

00:06:55.236 --> 00:06:57.976
&gt;&gt;Tracy: And he likes being
silly, he likes being silly.

00:06:58.046 --> 00:06:58.706
&gt;&gt;Jalen: [inaudible] our show too.

00:06:58.706 --> 00:06:59.956
&gt;&gt;No, he doesn't.

00:07:01.686 --> 00:07:04.906
&gt;&gt;Tracy: He always has an
idea, always has an answer.

00:07:04.906 --> 00:07:08.846
If I say, "Jay, can you not do that?"

00:07:08.846 --> 00:07:12.046
it's always a good reason
for why it should be done.

00:07:12.676 --> 00:07:14.346
So, I mean, he's a
typical 12-year-old.

00:07:14.346 --> 00:07:18.326
&gt;&gt;Thirty minutes, so now I am
eligible to play video games.

00:07:19.096 --> 00:07:22.836
&gt;&gt;What I want to do when I grow
up is I want to be a cartoonist

00:07:23.566 --> 00:07:26.216
and a video game maker and artist.

00:07:26.706 --> 00:07:28.206
Technically they all
come together, though.

00:07:32.666 --> 00:07:35.996
So, I think that this -- all
of this graphic design, gaming,

00:07:36.816 --> 00:07:39.506
all of this stuff that I do
will contribute to my cartooning

00:07:39.506 --> 00:07:45.106
and gaming one day, all these
technology programs that I do.

00:07:50.356 --> 00:07:52.316
