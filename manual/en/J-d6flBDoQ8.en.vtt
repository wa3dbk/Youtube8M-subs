00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.500
MARK&gt;&gt; Right, hello, today we are climbing Mount Fuji

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.000
That's in Japan.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.250
SIMON&gt;&gt; Today is the 13th of May

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:15.500
MARK&gt;&gt; 13th of May yes. You can't see it but

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.500
We're at 2400m already, having hitch-hiked up this far

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.000
Which is kind of cheating, but...

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.500
SIMON&gt;&gt; Well not really, we couldn't have done it if we didn't

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.500
MARK&gt;&gt; True

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:25.250
SIMON&gt;&gt; So, not cheating.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:28.000
MARK&gt;&gt; We've still got 1,300m to cleem

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.500
Cleem? Climb!

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.000
SIMON&gt;&gt; Well you can cleem it, I'll climb it

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
MARK&gt;&gt; If I could just read you a passage from our guidebook

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
"Mount Fuji's official climbing season is July and August"

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
"Authorities strongly caution against climbing outside of the regular season, when services are suspended"

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.500
"Hiking from October to May is definitely discouraged"

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.250
"The first half of this decade saw a number of high-profile deaths"

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.250
"from off-season climbers from overseas"

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.000
SIMON&gt;&gt; Well that's alright. We're in the second half of the decade, so we're alright

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
I don't know what you're worrying about

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.500
MARK&gt;&gt; So we're halfway through May, so... only a slight chance of death!

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.000
Anyway, this is the view, up through the valley

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.500
We're in the clouds at the moment, so not much...

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.250
And we're climbing up there...

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.250
...again, not a great view.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.000
SIMON&gt;&gt; But hopefully up above the clouds, there will be a better view

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
MARK&gt;&gt; Hopefully.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
SIMON&gt;&gt; If we get that far.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.500
MARK&gt;&gt; Oh, and the route is closed and we're not allowed to walk up it

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.500
So we're going to have to sneak in somehow.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.500
Luckily, we've found an alternative route. Bit chained off, but unguarded.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.500
We're between Station 8 and Station 9, so at roughly 3300m.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
We're heading up there, that's the path to the 9th Station

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Rocks are a bit jaggedy now, but that makes it easier. It's really really steep

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.500
Probably the steepest part.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.000
But the rocks are climbable, and not like shingle.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.250
Just got to the next station, and we've had a pretty bad setback.

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:06.000
We've found out this is only Station 8, we've been miscounting.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.500
The air is pretty thin, we're getting a bit tired now. It's a hard walk.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.000
and this isn't the news we wanted to hear.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We're nearly at the 9th Station.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.000
We nearly turned back because the weather was absolutely awful.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.300
...about 10 minutes ago.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:24.300
It's getting really hard.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.000
You may just be able to see the clouds coming in there

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.000
We're nearly above the cloud line, so we're carrying on.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
You might be able to see that cloud just coming towards the camera now.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.500
OK, we've made it to Station 9, it's been tough going.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.500
And unfortunately I can't show you anything that's going on

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.000
because the landscape is too white for my camera to handle it.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
But I can see up there what looks like the crater, and therefore the summit.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
It's not too far, but it's going to be the hardest section yet to get up.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.000
So. [sighs] How's it going down there?

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
SIMON&gt;&gt; Pretty shattered.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.500
MARK&gt;&gt; Shattered? Yeah, me too.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.000
One last push.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.500
If I filmed a video of how strong these winds were, 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.000
then it wouldn't work, because you wouldn't be able to hear what I was saying

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
because the noise would be too bad.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
So I'll just have 10 seconds of me complaining about it instead

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.500
The summit of Mount Fuji, and here is the money shot.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
This is how you get down from Mount Fuji

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Wave!

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
I am in a lot of pain.
