00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:21.000
This beast is the Century FMA, It's a long range rod primarily, but don't think for one minute because it's a long range tool, thats it's not a proper fishing rod

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:32.000
If anybody was or is a user of the Century FMJ, which is the original version of this, this is the new and improved version of the FMJ

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The FMJ was legendary for distance casting, this is a more civilised version, it will cast just as far as the FMJ in the right hands, if not further

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
with the technology in the tip setion now, it retains much, much, better fish playing action than the orignal FMJ.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
There is three models in the FMG range, and they are rated on optimum casting rate rather than on a test curve

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
The 12' FMA is to be used with leads between 3 and 4oz, 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:13.000
where the FMA 2's are available in a 12', and this which is the 13ft version. These will handle leads of up to 5oz.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000
All 3 rods in the FMA range benefit from the ATT anti twist technology and from the autoclave process

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It has been proven over the years that parallel butts, produce much longer casting distances than a standard tapered butt section

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:42.000
So as you can expect with a casting tool like the FMA, it starts off with a parallel butt at this end, full length Japanese shrink wrap, onto some very, very, light weight, laser etched, stainless trimmings behind the reelseat

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:50.000
The reelseat itself is an engraved, part stainless Century SB20 reelseat. 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Moving on, it's a 1k weave, which goes up to the first ring on the tip sections, similar to the C2

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:10.000
With these, the ringing is a Century SiC light, with a 50mm ring set, through to a 16mm tip ring

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:22.000
The spigot itself you can see is quite unique, because of the force that's placed on these rods as they are a casting tool, there needs to be a very, very, secure fit around the spigot

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:32.000
What we have done with these is we have just put some Japanese shrink rubber, some EVA there, on the Spigots just to give you a little bit of grip

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
This makes the tight fitting joint much easier to come apart

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:45.000
If it is a casting tool you are after, it has to be the Century FMA

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
For big pits, long range fishing, heavy leads, heavy shock leaders, this is the ultimate tool.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:02.000
They will take huge amounts of abuse, anything you want to throw at them, they will handle with ease
