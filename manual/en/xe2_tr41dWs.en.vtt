Hi everyone, I'm Sam. Today I want to
introduce you to the amazing Miracle

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.050
Complexion Sponge. I'm going to show you how this works. You might notice all the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.529
different angles on this sponge. I'm
going to show you how to use it, so we're

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.000
going to start with the flat side and a
bit of foundation and we can work that

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.930
all the way over the skin.
Now using a sponge is going to create a

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.129
light flawless finish, but if you do need
more coverage, you can just push the

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.590
sponge where you need it.
The flat edge of the sponge means that

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.710
we can get a really nice even finis,h but
also we can get right under the eyes and

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.250
around the nose area.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.170
The next thing to notice about the
miracle complexion sponge is that it has

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.879
a pointy end and this is great if you
want to cover any specific blemishes.

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.450
You just pop a little concealer on the
end and where you have a blemish you can

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.040
just push it onto the skin and it's going to
hide that. We can also use our flat end

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.390
with a little concealer just to pop that
very lightly under the eyes. And then I'm

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.659
going to turn the sponge around and I'm
going to use this rounded edge and I'm

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:28.229
just going to roll it and push that
concealer in. You can also use it to

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.549
apply a little bit of cream blusher so
I'm using again the rounded side for

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.610
this I'm just going to push that onto
the top of the cheek.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.750
Finally to take the shine off you can
use it with a bit of powder. So again

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.229
just push in the rounded side of the
sponge and we're just going to take it

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.250
through the center of the face.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.299
And once you've used it you can just
wash it with a little bit of shampoo and

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.180
leave it to dry and it's ready to go
again. So that's the miracle complexion

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.869
sponge, a great addition to the Real
Techniques range and I know you're going

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.700
to love it. Thanks for watching. I'll see
you next time, bye bye!
