Hi, I'm Sue Rose with Expert Village and today
we're talking about mixing colors. We've mixed

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.559
our primary and secondary colors and now we're
mixing, and come up with 24 colors, and now

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.180
we're mixing these and coming up with even
more colors. We're gonna take our green that

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.960
we have, and make another row down here, to
show you what to do with your green. I'm going

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.500
to put a little bit of my green here, and
I've mixed it with the red, as your know,

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:40.410
but this time I'm going to mix the green with
the blue, and I come up with yet another blue

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:49.030
that's different from any of those that you
see. I take my green again, just a little

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.400
dab here to show you what you need, and I'm
going to mix it with the orange, and I think

00:00:54.400 --> 00:01:04.449
this is going to be a pretty color, but we'll
see. It certainly is a warmer green, kind

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:13.950
of a fall, olive drab, green. Next I'm going
to take some more of my green, and I'm running

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:22.909
out of room here, rinse my brush, always tap
dry, and I'm going to mix it with my purple.

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:30.539
Just add a little dab of purple into my green,
that 's kind of an interesting color. It's

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:38.110
kind of a purpley gray. I had mixed my green
with my purple and now I'm going to try a

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:43.009
little bit more and I'm going to get another
little dab of green here and I'm going to

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:50.609
mix it with my yellow and I bet I come up
with a nice cooler, light, almost chartreuse

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:56.369
green here. So. look at all these different
shades I've added to my palette. Stay tuned

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.459
to our next segment and we will mix the blues
with the other colors.
