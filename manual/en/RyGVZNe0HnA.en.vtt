00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:03.850
this is a brief overview my gaming and
movies PC

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.540
this rig is only used for gaming and
movies

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.200
please keep this in mind whilst i show you
the components that are inside

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.300
system. The PC case I'm using is the
Cooler Master Elite 130

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.769
ITX case. It features a 120 millimetres

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.880
fan at the front and an 80 millimetres fan

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.380
near the back.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.240
Okay so let's see what's on the inside

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.200
I thought you guys might be interested in
my DIY

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.290
dust filters. Whilst there are dust filters for
this case available on the market,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.800
they are expensive and they are in the
US.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.640
This can push the cost even further
when it comes to shipping

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.790
and you often have to wait a great deal
of time for it to get through customs.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.000
These dust filters were made using magnetic
tape

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.160
and cheap net curtains local Home Depot.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.550
A small bit of nail polish on the back of
the tape

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.250
helps keep the net in firmly in place.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.540
Okay, power supply first on each in the Corsair CX600M.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:15.090
A 600 watt power supply is enough
for what I need.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.490
This is the ASRock FM2A85X

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.700
ITX motherboard. It uses the PCI Express
2.0 standard,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:28.430
UEFI BIOS and allows overclocking.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.990
The processor in this rig is the AMD

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.770
A8-5600k. Now as I said

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.149
bare in mind this is only used for gaming

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.720
and watching movies. I did a lot of
research before

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.490
building this rig, and I did
consider getting the Intel

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.110
i5 4670K, however,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.140
when comparing the two processors

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.580
in the fire strike benchmark, the minimum

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.710
and average frames per second in the combined

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.600
test were almost by identical.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.100
Now I understand this will change
depending on the game in the way it  is

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:08.979
coded,

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.390
but I have played through Bioshock
infinite

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.800
and Batman Arkham Origins without any
signs of slowdown

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.410
or bottleneck. Considering the price
difference at the time of making this

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.850
video is nearly Â£100,

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:27.240
it's not a choice I regret. The processor
is cooled use in the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:33.600
Corsair H60 all in one liquid cooler. While it
would be entirely possible to fit

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.209
an H80i in push/pull, it would
be completely unnecessary

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:44.220
for the processor that I have. I had
also originally intended to just use

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.730
a standard 3.5 inch hard drive.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.420
This would have meant that the H80i in push-pull would not have fitted.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:55.770
The stock fan has been replaced with the
Noctua NF12.

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:59.080
Storage is the

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:05.200
Crucial M500 SSD. This is the 480GB model.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.470
At the time making this video, it was the
best value for money

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:12.590
SSD on the market. Boot time from

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:16.360
BIOS to a fully loaded desktop is under

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.200
30 seconds

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.000
I am using Kingston HyperX beast

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.600
RAM running at 1600mhz.
Whilst the processor does support

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.100
faster memory it would not benefit from it in this  situation as I'm using a dedicated

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.420
GPU.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.950
The GPU i'm using is the Sapphire

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:40.290
HD 7870. This is essentially the
equivalent

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.460
to the newer R9 270x,

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:46.910
however this does have slightly
slower Vram.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.300
Luckily this particular GPU is a very
good

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.500
overclocker. Whilst I have been unable to
match Vram speeds on the

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:59.320
R9 270X, I have managed to overclock the

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.370
core clock to 1200mhz. I
have been able to play

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.450
most recent titles at ultra settings at
60 FPS.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:11.440
This includes the likes of
Bioshock Infinite,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.620
and Batman Arkham Origins. Of course no

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.110
gaming rig is any good without the
peripherals to support it,

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.110
so let me just talk you through what I
use.

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.150
As you can see, I use the Xbox 360
controller

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:29.800
for most games. This rig is designed to
be played

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.370
either on a sofa or in bed, not

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:38.280
at a desk. I use wireless a Logitech
Keyboard when traditional PC controls are

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.000
needed.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.070
However this rig generally boots straight
into Steam big picture mode,

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.900
so the keyboard is not used very often.

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.050
This is the Optima HD131XE

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:53.410
full 3d 1080P projector.

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:56.820
And this is the 100" projected screen

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.270
I get when using it. Just to give you a bit of
comparison,

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:07.270
this is a 42-inch HDTV

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.780
This takes up

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.110
most of my wall.

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.310
And last but not least, although I do
have

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.580
a sound system, I tend to game and watch
movies using my

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.390
Bose QuietComfort 15 acoustic noise
cancelling headphones.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:27.400
There is nothing more immersive than
having a whole wall dedicated to the

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.430
game screen,

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:32.750
and having all external sound blocked
out.

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:35.360
Thank you for taking the time to watch
my video.

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:38.400
Please leave a like and feel free to
comment

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.190
if you have anything to add. I do
generally try to respond to all comments

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:44.230
I get within

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.900
a couple of hours
