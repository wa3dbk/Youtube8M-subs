00:00:05.863 --> 00:00:07.913
Tell me how to fix PS4 Error CE-34452-8.

00:00:07.913 --> 00:00:08.913
Bingo!

00:00:08.913 --> 00:00:17.613
No, seriously, the error does not tell me
anything about what is wrong, much less what

00:00:17.613 --> 00:00:19.163
to do about it.

00:00:19.163 --> 00:00:22.383
The error means that the data you downloaded
may be corrupted.

00:00:22.383 --> 00:00:26.383
Let’s get to the core of the matter – how
do I fix it?

00:00:26.383 --> 00:00:31.223
The first step is to go to the home screen
and delete the likely corrupted content.

00:00:31.223 --> 00:00:33.483
Then restart the PS4.

00:00:33.483 --> 00:00:37.853
This sounds more like the standard tech support
for Microsoft than Sony.

00:00:37.853 --> 00:00:42.782
After you restart the system to make sure
the corrupted files are gone, select to re-download

00:00:42.782 --> 00:00:44.992
the content from the Library.

00:00:44.992 --> 00:00:47.013
What if that does not work?

00:00:47.013 --> 00:00:49.322
Check your network settings.

00:00:49.322 --> 00:00:54.172
It would be hard to think of anything wrong
there if I downloaded the content.

00:00:54.172 --> 00:00:59.043
If you still get the error, try connecting
to a different network or changing your DNS

00:00:59.043 --> 00:01:02.003
server before trying to download it again.

00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:04.023
With a deletion and reboot in between.

00:01:04.023 --> 00:01:09.343
If the content did not download or you get
the error simply upon trying to download,

00:01:09.343 --> 00:01:12.732
the problem may be that the network is too
busy.

00:01:12.732 --> 00:01:17.663
But instead of the digital equivalent of a
dial tone beeping, it tells me a more terrifying

00:01:17.663 --> 00:01:19.673
data corrupted error.

00:01:19.673 --> 00:01:24.933
You could do a computer based update, if the
PS4 cannot connect to the Sony servers.

00:01:24.933 --> 00:01:31.562
That’s where you save the updates to a USB
drive and copy it to the PS4, hoping it recognizes

00:01:31.562 --> 00:01:35.483
the FAT32 partitions on the USB drive.

00:01:35.483 --> 00:01:41.923
If you want to download the content off the
Sony servers, you can go to settings, initialization,

00:01:41.923 --> 00:01:46.483
initialize PS4 quick and try to solve it by
initializing the PS4.

00:01:46.483 --> 00:01:51.882
That’s really close to Apple’s default
restore to factory defaults if not wipe the

00:01:51.882 --> 00:01:54.492
device and restore from the cloud.

00:01:54.492 --> 00:01:59.022
If it saves the phone from being a brick,
it is not a bad solution.

00:01:59.022 --> 00:02:00.812
What else can I do?

00:02:00.812 --> 00:02:05.062
Do not play while the content is downloading,
because that could potentially interfere with

00:02:05.062 --> 00:02:06.412
the download.

00:02:06.412 --> 00:02:11.232
You could try signing out of PlayStation network
and back in before trying to download again

00:02:11.232 --> 00:02:14.013
in case it is account settings that caused
the error.

00:02:14.013 --> 00:02:19.513
I’ve heard of the privacy setting changes
causing problems connecting to the internet,

00:02:19.513 --> 00:02:24.983
but now we’re needing to log out, reboot,
log in, restart and kick it a few times just

00:02:24.983 --> 00:02:27.873
in case all to get a file download.

00:02:27.873 --> 00:02:33.683
Just delete the old content, sign off, reboot,
sign in, try again to download it and don’t

00:02:33.683 --> 00:02:36.932
do anything else until the download is done.

00:02:36.932 --> 00:02:39.953
That fixes it 99% of the time.

00:02:39.953 --> 00:02:44.783
And quick initialize everything if it does
not, losing all my user data in the hope of

00:02:44.783 --> 00:02:45.843
getting good data from the server.
