00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.682
I have two armsâ€¦ but I'm a One-Handed Wonder

00:00:03.468 --> 00:00:06.128
Hey Team Shot Science! Coach Tom here today and I want to talk to you about

00:00:06.346 --> 00:00:09.543
developing your Off- or Weak Hand for ball handling.

00:00:09.751 --> 00:00:12.699
Because unless you're dribbling in circles, you need to bring in that other hand.

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:15.871
So I'll give you a quick rundown on what you have to do to improve your off hand

00:00:15.938 --> 00:00:19.270
and then I'll send you off to a couple of drills you can use to get started.

00:00:19.306 --> 00:00:20.715
So stick around till the end!

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.349
Okay, here's the bottom line...

00:00:22.625 --> 00:00:24.571
If you want to advane to higher levels of basketball

00:00:24.644 --> 00:00:26.879
you need to advance your level of play.

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:31.736
and the essential ingredient towards reaching that goal is to have ambidextrous ball handling skills.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.039
Being able to go either way with your dribble will open up so many more doors

00:00:35.187 --> 00:00:39.077
simply because you've at least doubled the options available to your attack.

00:00:39.282 --> 00:00:41.769
When you rely just on one hand to carry you through your game

00:00:41.993 --> 00:00:44.461
you not only limit your options to put the ball on the floor,

00:00:44.665 --> 00:00:47.441
but you make yourself vulnerable to the defense overplaying your strong side, 

00:00:47.741 --> 00:00:51.094
exploiting your weaknesses, and completely taking you out of the game.

00:00:51.528 --> 00:00:54.805
And the truth is that a handicap like this is 100 0x1.044b00001d79p-166voidable

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.266
if you put in the necessary work to develop both hands to an equal ability.

00:00:58.451 --> 00:01:00.284
So here's what you have to do to get there!

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:04.880
First, you need to get thousands of repetitions in to innervate and build your mind-muscle connections.

00:01:05.025 --> 00:01:08.283
Over time, the constant repetitions will develop your muscle memory

00:01:08.678 --> 00:01:10.936
to the point where you won't even have to think about what you're doing.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.878
It'll just be in your fingertips.

00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:16.435
Second, you have to realize that your off-hand is going to feel a lot less comfortable

00:01:16.715 --> 00:01:18.646
doing anything when you first start working with it.

00:01:18.868 --> 00:01:20.665
It's going to feel weak and clumsy

00:01:20.752 --> 00:01:22.684
and you'll probably feel like it's a lost cause.

00:01:22.867 --> 00:01:24.222
But that's how everyone feels at first.

00:01:24.597 --> 00:01:29.779
You just have to spend considerable extra time working on that hand to bring it up to the ability of your strong hand.

00:01:29.915 --> 00:01:32.587
If you allow yourself to get frustrated and quit

00:01:32.752 --> 00:01:36.448
then there's nothing we can do to help you because the final point we have for you is...

00:01:36.535 --> 00:01:39.231
You're going to have to work hard on this if you want to make progress.

00:01:39.451 --> 00:01:42.147
There are no tricks or secret tips for building up your off hand.

00:01:42.379 --> 00:01:44.826
But we can assure you, if you put in the work and the time

00:01:45.046 --> 00:01:48.241
you'll reach your goal and be a much more formidable offensive threat.

00:01:48.461 --> 00:01:50.156
Don't let your weak hand hold you back!

00:01:50.404 --> 00:01:53.099
