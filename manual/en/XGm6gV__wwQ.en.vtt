00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.800
It turns out a lot of Americans are liars when it comes
to admitting how often they really go to church.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.000
And there's a new survey that came out not too long ago
by the Public Religion Research Institute
that sheds light on this,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:16.100
and it's kind of ingenious how they
showed that people are lying about this.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:21.700
Normally what happens is they do a random survey,
they call you up on the phone, and they say,
"Let's take the survey"

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.100
and they get one set of answers,
and they report that.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.100
They still call people up on the phone and they say,
you know, how often do you go to church?

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.700
Do you go weekly?
Do you go never?

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:31.600
Let us know.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.300
And they got those results.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.800
But at the same time they also
asked a group of people online,

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.900
you know, fill out the survey
for us and let us know.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.600
And again, these are controlled experiments, they
control for different factors that might affect all this.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.900
It turned out that people
who answered the survey online

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:51.100
had much higher rates
of not going to church

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.200
than the people who got interviewed
on the telephone did.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.500
So, to me that sounds like when someone's asking you
over the phone, you know, do you go to church?

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.000
You're way more likely to say,
"Oh, yeah, I totally go to church."

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.500
But when there's no other human in front of you
and the computer is saying, you know,
"Do you go to church? Let us know,"

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.400
you're way more likely to probably tell the truth
here and say, "No, I never go to church."

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.000
So, why are people inflating
how often they go to church?

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.700
I think there's a couple of reasons
for this, you know: peer pressure,

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.100
the social stigma against
not going to church.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.100
You know, people are not
willing to admit, even to a stranger,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:29.200
that they go to church. There are some people
out there that don't want to admit that.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.300
And part of the reason is you want people
to like you, you want people to trust you.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.500
And in American society, one of the ways
you get people to trust you

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.500
is you say, "Yeah, I believe in God, and I go
to church, and I'm a god-fearing American."

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.000
And that means even religious Americans who
believe, you know, "Thou shalt not bear false witness,"

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.400
will happily fudge the truth when it comes
to how often they go to church.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.200
But when you remove that human element from
the survey, the truth seems to come pouring out.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:03.000
And this is something I've suspected for a long time,
that people really don't go to church
as often as they claim to.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.900
The number-- the percent of people who
go to church, is actually much lower

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.300
than we think it is.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.600
And I also think the number--
the percentage of people who believe in God

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.900
is a lot lower
than we say it is,

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.800
but people don't always
want to admit

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.000
that they are atheists. They don't want to
admit that they don't believe in God.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.700
They feel weird, like there's
something wrong with them,

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.500
if they tell someone,
even a stranger,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.000
that they're atheists.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.700
And I think the survey is also some evidence
that the Internet is where faith goes to die.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.800
It's a lot easier to have honest
discussions about God and faith

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.300
when you're behind a computer screen,
when you're hiding behind
this veil of anonymity,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.700
than it is when someone's
asking you directly

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.300
what you believe
on these issues.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:51.000
I wish none of this were the case, by the way.
I wish more people were just open and honest
about the fact that they don't go to church or,
more importantly,

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.800
that they don't
believe in God.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.700
I think if they were
more open about it,

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.300
it would help decrease that social stigma against it.
And I think more people would then be willing to admit,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.400
"Yeah, I don't go to church, and I don't believe in God,
and there's nothing wrong with that,

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.400
and there's nothing
wrong with me."
