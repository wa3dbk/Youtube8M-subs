00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.690
Released in December of 2000, and grossing
nearly five times its ninety-million-dollar

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.240
budget - this survival story once again teamed
up two-time academy award winner Tom Hanks

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.131
with Robert Zemecicks, in what would be the
acclaimed director's last live-action film

00:00:18.131 --> 00:00:20.060
until 2012's "Flight".

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.910
Prior to Bob's foray into motion-capture animated
children's films though, we were treated to

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.420
a mesmerizingly beautiful and emotional captivating
motion picture that truly embodies the power

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.420
of the human spirit.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:33.820
In an incredible tour-de-force role that would
secure him yet another Oscar nod, Hanks stars

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.130
as a time-obsessed FedEx problem solver, whose
plans to propose to his long-time girlfriend,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:42.180
Helen Hunt, are put on hold when he's suddenly
required to travel overseas on Christmas night.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.450
In a tense, and grippingly claustrophobic
sequence though: Hanks' plane crashes in the

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.450
middle of the south Pacific following a nasty
storm.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.400
The middle hour-and-a-half of this 143-minute
adventure film takes place entirely on the

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.110
small, deserted island Hanks washes ashore
on.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.900
Not a single not of Alan Silvestri's moving
score is heard until almost two hours into

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.019
the picture, putting much more emphasis on
the astonishingly impressive sound mix, especially

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.780
once you learn virtually all of the sound
and dialog on the island had to be replace

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.320
in post-production, thanks to filming on-location
next to the ocean.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.970
With no one to talk to for the duration, the
veteran actor creates an inanimate companion

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.600
for company: Wilson, a recovered volleyball
with his bloody handprint for a face.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.970
The scenes between these two "characters"
are fascinating, entertaining, and surprisingly

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:39.660
emotional to watch.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:56.580
[CLIP] Book-ending the film, and otherwise
anchoring the entire purpose for the middle

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.270
act is a small, but effective supporting cast
leady by Hunt and Nick Searcy that really

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.180
shine, despite their limited screen time.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.560
Zemecicks' trademark, minute-long moving shots
paint an inspiring story of hope and second

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.950
chances as our stubbornly optimistic protagonist
gives us one hell of a hero to root for.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:18.029
Despite its limited dialog, characters, music,
and edits, "Cast Away" is anything but slow-paced:

00:02:18.029 --> 00:02:21.450
the tension in some of the smallest moments
and scenes, like when Hanks attempts to knock

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.109
out his own tooth with the crude edge of a
hockey skate, are intense and rewarding to

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:27.109
watch.

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:30.680
To account for Hanks' massive weight-loss
over the course of his island survival, this

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:35.420
feature film was ambitiously shot in two segments,
over a year apart.

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:40.250
Going above-and-beyond, these attentions-to-detail
elevate this simple concept to a wonderfully

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.379
grand and thrilling achievement; one that
you'll have no problem re-experiencing.

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.170
Although the narrative never allows the audience
to view the story from another perspective:

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.049
the unrelenting Hanks is impossible not to
love - who capes off his performance with

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:58.530
a truly amazing, bittersweet single-take monologue
delivered in the final moments of the film.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.530
"Cast Away", "Monumental performance, inspirationally
touching story."

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:06.189
Well, those are my thoughts on this picture,
so now lets see what you had to say in the

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:19.430
YouTube comments.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.310
And our rating for Cast Away is... a double-NINE.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.599
So, we've agreed again: and for good reason:
Hanks' single-man performance that anchors

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.250
the entire movie is nothing short of phenomenal:
and who knew we could feel such strong emotion

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.120
for washed-up volleyball?

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.909
This film was awesome.
