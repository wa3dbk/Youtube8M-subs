00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.940
Tracing through the depths of my memories

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:36.170
I fasten together my crumbling heart no place left to go.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.750
Come here once again and

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:51.710
take my hand, take me away to the ends of eternity.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.820
Dashing forward I find a way to know the

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.920
future. Time races ahead and

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.670
I see tomorrow, but

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:19.570
I cannot hide my heart now fraught with anxiety.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.230
My thoughts I release in a rasping voice

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.780
Disappear into an unreachable void; I cannot grasp the heart.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:36.640
Return the memories I’ve captured in my eyes,

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.120
Believe one day in the future we’ll meet again!

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.550
Deep in sleep deep within the earth

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:03.840
Under time slowly progressing and embraced in dreams,

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.540
Stopping the second hand of the clock

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:19.420
A whisper comes to wake..

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:30.430
Advancing, tracing my memories

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.580
I release myself to the story in this a progressing dream

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.210
and destroyed the continuation of this eternity;

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.320
No longer can illusions, dreams, or the future save us.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:52.950
Forgetting the future dissipating in the distance

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.630
I hold the memories you gave me close, I’ll never give them up!

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:04.360
Let the voice of my heart reach to the sky;

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:10.910
I refuse the next coming eternity softly with unclean hands.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:13.880
Exhausted with loneliness

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.380
I screamed in tears, “These emotions are so painful. I just want to disappear!”

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.650
Please don’t yet forgive these feelings, but

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:32.970
Take my hand and race ahead, escaping the darkness and into the sky!

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:38.190
My thoughts I release in a rasping voice

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:44.010
Disappear into an unreachable void; I cannot grasp your hand.

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.570
Return the memories I’ve captured in my eyes,

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:59.810
Believe one day in the future we’ll meet again!
