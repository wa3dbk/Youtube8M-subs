00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.620
So Walden, as I told you, Jennifer is my pilates instructor.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:04.840
Yeah, pilates.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.500
Well, you're certainly whipping Lyndsey into shape.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:12.520
Not that you need it.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.100
Not that I was looking.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.680
Not that you're listening.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.580
Oh, can I take a picture of you?

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.540
Okay.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.060
Uploading photo to wall...

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:29.440
'Check out my hot date'... smiley face.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.820
LOL, right?

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.240
So, pilates.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.980
That's all about strengthening the core, right?

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.480
Hm?

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.720
OMG, cat in a bow tie riding a skateboard...

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.560
Retweeting!

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.160
Guy in a bow tie, right here.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.300
Oh, good news. One person already likes our date.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.540
Unfriend.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.480
So, what looks good to you?

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.360
Actually, I'm not gonna eat.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.400
Nothing?

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.640
No, I'm doing a master cleanse. So I haven't eaten solid food in two weeks.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.820
Dawn, you might have mentioned that when I told you we were all going out to dinner.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.940
No, it's no problem. You guys eat. This stuff just flushes you right out.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.300
Well, I guess it's worth it if it rids the body of all those toxins and impurities.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.580
Right. And the stuff that comes out of you...

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.600
I swear, I found a Barbie head that I swallowed in the fifth grade.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.700
Good thing you didn't swallow her Malibu beach house. Ouch!

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.140
Well, whatever you're doing, it's working. You look great.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.600
Thank you! I also inject myself with the urine of pregnant women.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.920
Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna eat either.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.700
It's got a hormone in it that helps you lose weight.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.520
Which is ironic, because pregnant women pack on the pounds.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.600
I will never be fat.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.860
Or married.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.640
I can't believe you created and sold your own company.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:15.500
You must be incredibly smart.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.340
I don't know, I think it's more luck and timing.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.060
I think it takes a little bit more than luck and timing to make 1.4 billion dollars.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.660
Somebody did their research.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.380
I'll bet women are after you all the time.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.160
I mean, you could look like him and they'd still be after you.

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.980
You know what these women are thinking, don't you?

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.100
'I mean, is this guy gonna ask for a pre-nup?'

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.760
Because theoretically, your alimony payments would run 75, 100 grand a month at least.

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.760
And that's without child support.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.020
Good at math.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.880
You know, I never thought I wanted kids, but...

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.420
With the right person...

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.440
I could see myself having an entire litter.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.760
And I could see myself having a vasectomy.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.260
When she's on her meds, she's actually lots of fun.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.620
I am!
