Voiceover: So far in this tutorial,

00:00:02.846 --> 00:00:04.761
we've talked about states of consciousness

00:00:04.761 --> 00:00:06.121
that occur naturally,

00:00:06.121 --> 00:00:07.705
meaning you don't really have to try

00:00:07.705 --> 00:00:09.461
to be awake, or to fall asleep.

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.817
But there are some states of consciousness

00:00:11.817 --> 00:00:13.076
that do require some effort.

00:00:13.344 --> 00:00:14.640
So now I'm gonna talk about a couple

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.569
induced states of consciousness:

00:00:16.569 --> 00:00:18.517
hypnosis and meditation.

00:00:21.801 --> 00:00:23.688
When you think of hypnosis,

00:00:23.688 --> 00:00:26.489
you might think of the
typical Hollywood depiction

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.353
of some creepy guy, who
swings a pocket watch

00:00:29.353 --> 00:00:31.400
in front of people's
faces, and then gets them

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.144
to start clucking like a chicken,

00:00:33.144 --> 00:00:35.300
or something else they
would never do normally.

00:00:36.024 --> 00:00:38.584
But, don't worry, no one
can actually do that do you

00:00:38.584 --> 00:00:39.956
without your consent.

00:00:40.536 --> 00:00:42.120
A hypnotist's power rests completely

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.440
in how open you, or the
person being hypnotized,

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.860
are to suggestion.

00:00:47.878 --> 00:00:49.015
And most people are open

00:00:49.015 --> 00:00:50.866
to some degree of suggestion at least.

00:00:51.334 --> 00:00:53.302
For example, try this with someone

00:00:53.302 --> 00:00:54.822
who hasn't seen this video:

00:00:54.822 --> 00:00:57.062
Get them to stand up,
and close their eyes,

00:00:57.062 --> 00:00:59.059
and then tell them that
they're swaying back and forth.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:01.382
So don't tell them to sway back and forth,

00:01:01.382 --> 00:01:03.522
just tell them that,
that's what they're doing.

00:01:03.974 --> 00:01:06.278
And most people, when
they hear you tell them

00:01:06.278 --> 00:01:08.710
that they're swaying, will
actually start swaying,

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:09.859
if they weren't before.

00:01:11.232 --> 00:01:12.902
But if they know what's
coming, and don't want

00:01:12.902 --> 00:01:15.707
to be swayed (ha ha),
then this won't work.

00:01:16.223 --> 00:01:18.042
It's the same with hypnotism:

00:01:18.042 --> 00:01:20.509
It usually involves
getting people to relax,

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:22.654
and focus on a particular spot,

00:01:22.654 --> 00:01:24.798
or internal function like breathing,

00:01:24.798 --> 00:01:27.022
and people become more susceptible

00:01:27.022 --> 00:01:28.870
to suggestion in this state,

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.081
but only if they want to.

00:01:31.758 --> 00:01:35.470
So, as you enter into
that state of hypnosis,

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.150
an EEG would pick up more
Alpha waves in your brain,

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.536
indicating an awake, but relaxed state.

00:01:43.246 --> 00:01:44.878
And some people use hypnosis

00:01:44.878 --> 00:01:47.918
to try to retrieve memories,
which is kind of dangerous,

00:01:47.918 --> 00:01:50.090
and not scientific.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.398
'Cause memory is very malleable,

00:01:52.398 --> 00:01:54.542
and since we don't
record events in our head

00:01:54.542 --> 00:01:56.886
like a video camera does,

00:01:56.886 --> 00:01:58.910
sometimes people who
supposedly retrieve memories

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.526
during hypnosis, can actually
create false memories,

00:02:02.526 --> 00:02:05.357
that incorporate hypnotizers,
leading questions,

00:02:05.357 --> 00:02:07.817
or expectations, even
if they don't intend to.

00:02:09.981 --> 00:02:12.517
And some people also think
that hypnosis helps them

00:02:12.517 --> 00:02:15.739
refocus their attention,
which is why it can be used

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:17.143
to treat pain.

00:02:17.548 --> 00:02:19.099
For example, there is some evidence

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.395
that people under hypnosis
have reduced brain activity,

00:02:22.395 --> 00:02:24.923
in areas that process sensory input,

00:02:24.923 --> 00:02:27.851
even though the areas that
receive the sensory input,

00:02:27.851 --> 00:02:29.767
the sensory cortex, are
functioning normally.

00:02:30.251 --> 00:02:32.475
So this could mean, that
although hypnosis doesn't

00:02:32.475 --> 00:02:34.713
completely block out sensory input,

00:02:34.713 --> 00:02:37.641
it might help inhibit our
attention to that input,

00:02:37.641 --> 00:02:39.145
which enables some people to deal

00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:41.733
with more painful stimuli
than they normally would.

00:02:42.375 --> 00:02:43.674
But, again, the bottom line is,

00:02:43.674 --> 00:02:45.897
that if you think it will
work, it has a good chance

00:02:45.897 --> 00:02:46.774
of working,

00:02:47.145 --> 00:02:48.649
but if you think it won't work,

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:49.449
then you're stuck

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:51.529
with the more traditional
pain-killing techniques.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.804
And another induced state of
consciousness is meditation.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.247
There are a lot of
definitions of "mediation,"

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:03.144
but we're gonna focus on the type

00:03:03.144 --> 00:03:05.960
that involves training
people to self-regulate

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.579
their attention and awareness.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.632
So, meditation can be guided,

00:03:10.632 --> 00:03:13.762
and focused on something in particular,

00:03:13.762 --> 00:03:17.082
like breathing oftentimes,
or relaxing muscles,

00:03:17.082 --> 00:03:18.139
or something like that.

00:03:19.176 --> 00:03:21.336
But meditation can also be unfocused,

00:03:21.336 --> 00:03:23.220
when you let the mind wander freely.

00:03:24.344 --> 00:03:27.368
During light meditation, people
experience more Alpha waves

00:03:27.368 --> 00:03:29.524
than during normal relaxation.

00:03:30.311 --> 00:03:32.168
And then during deep meditation,

00:03:32.168 --> 00:03:34.295
this is the type that
usually only experts achieve,

00:03:34.295 --> 00:03:36.562
like Tibetan monks,

00:03:36.562 --> 00:03:40.611
but they have increased
Theta waves in the brain,

00:03:40.611 --> 00:03:42.978
which also happen during
some sleep stages,

00:03:42.978 --> 00:03:44.227
but you're still awake.

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.511
There aren't very many scientific studies

00:03:47.511 --> 00:03:49.415
on long-term effects of meditation,

00:03:49.415 --> 00:03:51.031
but some studies do indicate that

00:03:51.031 --> 00:03:55.127
in people who regularly
get into deep meditation,

00:03:55.127 --> 00:03:58.775
there's increased activity
when they're not meditating,

00:03:58.775 --> 00:04:01.847
increased activity in
their prefrontal cortex,

00:04:01.847 --> 00:04:05.671
right hippocampus, and
right anterior insula,

00:04:05.671 --> 00:04:08.023
suggesting that those people
have an increased ability

00:04:08.023 --> 00:04:10.026
to control their attention,

00:04:10.134 --> 00:04:12.199
which is the goal of
meditation, so that's good.

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:14.645
This ability to control your attention

00:04:14.645 --> 00:04:16.422
could have important implications

00:04:16.422 --> 00:04:19.734
for people with
attention-related disorders,

00:04:19.734 --> 00:04:22.710
such as ADHD, or even people who want

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.678
to avoid some of the attentional deficits

00:04:24.678 --> 00:04:26.466
associated with natural aging.
