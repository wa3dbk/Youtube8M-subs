00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.720
Morning guys it is Barry here apologies for
not looking a million dollars I have just

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:06.720
woke up, hello, you alright?

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:07.720
Yeah.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.560
She has just had her breakfast, Mrs Barry
and Chloe are just over there, say hello � �hello�.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.180
So today I am doing something called a negative
food calorie day so there is things called

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.369
negative foods apparently where the more you
eat it, you burn off calories eating it by

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.070
digesting it than you do once you have swallowed
it so you are actually negative calorieing

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.730
� there is a lot of debate around this,
whether it is true I do not know I decided

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.960
to get a list of these foods as you will see
on the screen right now and I made a little

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.550
menu with some pretty exciting stuff so I
am going to document my whole day my breakfast

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.769
rather than cereal like what you had mate,
was it nice?

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:47.969
I normally have cereal but today I am having
some tangerines which is really good, some

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.930
cherries which are also very good and the
good thing about this is I can have as much

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:57.180
water as I like so lets see how we get on
and I am going to get washed.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.659
Right mate, yeah.

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.579
Right so it is now half past ten in the morning
I am about to edit a video if you are interested

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.250
this is where the magic happens Phoebe is
sat on the bed there still doing her loom

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.790
bands which she will probably do all day,
she loves them at the moment it is normally

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.320
around this time when I get a little bit peckish
I may go down and nibble on something and

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.850
I am being good, in fact I had about ten cherries,
2 tangerines and loads of water so I am feeling

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.030
hydrated and full so I am just going to keep
drinking my water and I can have fruit if

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.280
I want to but feel at the moment that I do
not want to which is weird because I feel

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.710
light so I am enjoying this so far the only
bad thing is I feel I may need to wear a nappy

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.580
later on because I am going to be eating quite
a lot of fibre, we will see how we go.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.110
Right folks it is very nearly lunch time alright
girls?

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.110
Yeah.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.800
Right so Mrs Barry has just got back from
the supermarket and what have you bought?

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.880
Some nice treats yeah, so she has bought a
selection of things as we normally do, sometimes

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.090
some crisps, sometimes some chocolate and
that is the worse thing right now it is like

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.210
a knife through my heart as I have to have
salad but I am feeling good, I am going to

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.210
do this.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.540
You can do it, it�s cool.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.710
Right so it is lunchtime I have been eating
a mango celery radish strawberry and lettuce

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.890
salad right are you trying to copy what I
am saying like that but you had soup right?

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.239
And they had bread and butter with it and
at the moment I have a huge craving for bread

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:15.810
and butter I had to fight it, how are you
feeling mrs barry about me and my achievements

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:16.810
eating this?

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.349
I think you did good not to eat the bread,
yeah all good Chloe is just demolishing an

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.249
apple right there gonna dunk it in her soup
too I have this peach and pineapple smoothie

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:27.670
that I made with a little bit of ice cube
all whizzed up together all natural like that

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.219
it tastes so so good and this salad believe
it or not has got the right balance of crunch

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:38.560
and fruit I am happy I am surprised but I
am happy this is going well.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.049
Right folks I have made it to dinner time
although I have been sipping on loads of water

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:45.930
throughout the day and nibbling on grapes
and apricots and stuff which is all good right,

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.170
I have an amazing little vegetarian stir fry
on the go full of chillies and onions and

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.150
garlic for all that flavour, butternut squash
that has caramelised up for a bit of texture

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.299
in there and also we have rhubarb and apricots
there because they are just stewing I will

00:02:59.299 --> 00:03:03.349
grind on some orange zest and that will be
my pudding amazing times if you want better

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:07.139
pictures check out my Instagram feed and yeah,
lets see what this tastes like.

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:12.279
Guys I cannot stop eating this stir fry it
is so amazing really filling and full of flavour

00:03:12.279 --> 00:03:14.909
remember we have not added any flavourings
or seasonings to it no oils it is all the

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:19.719
natural flavourings and as I said before the
onion and the garlic and chilli it feels like

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:26.629
you can taste it more and I am just absolutely
loving it now with our rhubarb and apricot

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.189
I actually whizzed it up in the end put some
orange zest and juice because the rhubarb

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:33.209
is quite sharp so what I recommend is keep
adding orange juice until you are happy with

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:37.029
it grate on a little bit of orange juice on
top I have already tasted some of that and

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:38.029
it is delightful.

00:03:38.029 --> 00:03:41.829
Now the biggest thing is I am feeling full
of energy I have to go to the gym in a minute

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:42.879
how will I get on?

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.139
Lets find out.

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.849
So guys I am at my gym class where I normally
go to and the weirdest thing has just happened

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:52.029
I�ve been full of energy all day up until
seven thirty at night and the last half an

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:56.319
hour I got really weak and there are these
cross training classes I go to I just did

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:00.570
about ten minutes of it and I am knackered
the trainer Ed has just given me this carb

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:06.669
boost drink and I will try and drink it, if
it kicks in but yeah I guess it has kind of

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:08.079
caught up with me.

00:04:08.079 --> 00:04:13.939
I am here with Ed who does all the workouts
here give Barry a beasting, I am normally

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:17.650
quite good at them but I do not know why that
happened, any ideas?

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.380
Basically your blood sugar has crashed through
the floor and bearing in mind your body takes

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:28.090
say for example 2000 calories during the day
if you are on a zero calorie or 5000 for me

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:35.140
Barry is the extreme the hobbit himself needs
a lot of calories, so if you are having such

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.830
a huge deficit your body will just crash it
will go into shut down.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:43.600
But it is weird I have been eating all day
even up to about an hour ago then all of a

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.950
sudden I had a crash and just like whoah,
but now I feel like I have energy again after

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.610
having that carb drink so it is kind of crazy.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:05:00.310
Yeah so what has happened is the carbs stored
in the body once the energy reserves are gone

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.310
you will crash.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:09.400
Now you feel a little bit better you can get
home and eat have like a carvery or something

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:17.640
big and then Barry will be fine, he will not
die.

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.340
Cheers Ed
Morning guys so it is the day after the negative

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.620
calorie experiment and I have got to say today
I am feeling a lot better than I was last

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:30.190
night as you saw, I was so weak even lifting
this spoon would have been so hard but as

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:32.210
Ed said that carb boost, boom!

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.150
Really hit me when I got home all I wanted
to do was sleep so I had a little midnight

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:40.500
snack to keep me ticking over and I just went
to sleep and one thing I have learnt about

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:45.030
your diet and eating healthy which sometimes
to be honest doing what I do I do not really

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:49.670
get the chance to it is like now I am having
some fruit juice mixed with water I rarely

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:53.811
have breakfast sometimes I skip it entirely
or may have something naughty so it really

00:05:53.811 --> 00:05:58.380
has opened my eyes to eating healthy whether
it is negative calories I do not know, we

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.630
can debate that high fibre diet maybe or because
of the natural sugars in the fruit there must

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:09.170
be calories in there but it has opened my
eyes to things that I would not eat that much

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:13.280
maybe half a day do something like that and
have a nice big meal a good mix of all those

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.900
key things you need in your life but I hope
you enjoy this eye opener to it and see you

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:19.420
again next time guys, bye!
