[José María Castillejo] Hello, my name is Jose. I run the Pocoyó channels.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:06.110
And our topic today is how to reach global audiences.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.950
[YouTube: Reach a global audience]

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.150
[How did Pocoyó start?]
We have had more than 2.6 billion views

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.250
since we first started with our first channel that was Pocoyó TV.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.130
And in Pocoyó TV we basically have content in English and Spanish.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.480
Now we have 10 different channels with content

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.470
in English, in Spanish, in Italian,

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.020
in Chinese, in Japanese, in Korean, in Turkish.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.710
And we're still working also in channels in different languages.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.450
We're working on the Russian channel.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.700
We're working on the Indonesian channel.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.650
So now we have audiences mostly all over the world,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.450
and for us also it's been very helpful—

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.650
the content in English and Spanish because a lot of people use

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.170
the content to make sure their children learn English or learn Spanish.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.020
And it's basically happening the same thing now with Chinese and Japanese.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.780
[Why did you start multiple channels?]
We decided on the different channels, basically,

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:05.209
based on audiences, the number of people in the different countries.

00:01:05.209 --> 00:01:09.050
And we did cover the biggest populations,

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.700
and with English and Spanish and Chinese,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.070
basically, it's covered most of the world, to be honest.

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.560
And then we have Turkey, which is a huge country.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.750
There's a lot of Turkish people living outside Turkey,

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.300
which for us also it has a great interest

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.660
to cover those people that live outside their countries.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.590
It happens a lot with Spanish-speaking people.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.490
And we're also working now on the Russian and Indonesian—

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.850
and Japanese, it's over there—

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.550
because we do have the interest of making sure families

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:44.700
get together at the time they watch Pocoyó.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.430
And entertainment is not only the only thing.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.690
It's not the only thing to give them, but also the educational part,

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.380
and for parents, making sure that their children are really being educated in a positive way.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:01.100
It's great, and language is the first thing you want to teach

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.030
your children when you're outside your country.

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.740
[What is the goal of Pocoyó?]
Since day one when we started working on creating the Pocoyó series,

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.680
our goal was to reach the whole world.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.510
I mean, we really wanted Pocoyó to be global.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:19.580
We didn't want Pocoyó to have any nationality

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:23.000
or any culture or any language attached to him.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.090
And it's really funny because there are a lot of times

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.520
when people realize that Pocoyó is not English

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:31.950
or was not Russian or was not Japanese.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.800
They say, "Whoa, we couldn't believe it. We thought Pocoyó was Indian or Mexican or American."

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:42.320
But, no, Pocoyó is from all over the world. I mean from everywhere.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.840
He doesn't have a nationality, and that helped us a lot

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.940
at the time of being global, but I have to say that

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.520
that was the first, really, intention of when we started.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.710
[How does Pocoyó reach a large audience?]
We do a lot of things to make sure content is accessible to our followers—

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:02.600
not only languages, but we create playlists.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.740
Every week we upload one different playlist or we complete

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.620
or we get more content to different playlists we have,

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.580
and that makes the content a lot more attractive for people

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.750
because they can really interact with the content.
