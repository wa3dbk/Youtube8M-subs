Hey, guys, Sean Nalewanyj, of EliteImpactLabs.com.
And in this video by very popular demand,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.320
I'm going to be doing a review of intermittent
fasting. So, I'll be answering the question

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.329
of what is intermittent fasting? Does the
IF approach work for fat loss? Is it superior

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:19.140
to a standard four to six-meal per day cutting
diet? And do I recommend using it? Now, keep

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:23.470
in mind that there is a ton of potential research
to take into consideration here. And this

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.580
topic could be made&nbsp;extremely complicated
if we wanted it to be. So, I'm just going

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:33.219
to answer these questions as concisely and
to the point as I can. So, let's get started.

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:38.489
So, what is intermittent fasting? Well, to
put it simply, the IF protocol is a dietary

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.929
structure that alternates between an extended
period where no food is consumed at all, usually

00:00:42.929 --> 00:00:49.449
16 hours or more, followed by a feeding window
where all of your daily calories are consumed.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:55.050
So, there's no one single intermittent fasting
structure, and the fasting and non-fasting

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.870
periods can vary quite a bit depending on
which program you're using. One of the more

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.470
popular intermittent fasting diets out there
uses a 16-hour fast, followed by an 8-hour

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.400
feeding window, while another utilizes a 20-hour
fast, followed by a 4-hour feeding window.

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.720
And on the more extreme end are the people
who actually consume all of their daily nutrition

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:19.660
in a single sitting. So, secondly, does intermittent
fasting work? Well, the quick answer is yes.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:26.020
Intermittent fasting is certainly a viable
nutritional approach for fat loss for a few

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.310
reasons. First of all, it allows you to maintain
a calorie deficit. A calorie deficit, which

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.450
is a state where the number of calories burned
exceeds the number of calories consumed, is

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.540
the ultimate bottom line for fat loss. And
any diet that creates and sustains a proper

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.580
calorie deficit is going to produce fat burning
results. Secondly, the available research

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.460
is fairly conclusive in demonstrating that
a high meal frequency does not raise resting

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.220
metabolic rate nor does it increase the thermic
effect of food. So, consuming two or three

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.040
meals a day, which is the number where most
intermittent fasting protocols will land you,

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.140
is completely acceptable from a fat burning
standpoint. And finally, as long as overall

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.720
24-hour protein, carbohydrate and fat needs
are being met, there is no threat of excessive

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.950
muscle loss as long as the diet is combined
with a proper resistance training program.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.590
So yes, as long as your overall macronutrient
intake is nailed down, then consuming those

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.700
macro nutrients in an intermittent fasting
style interval is going to produce perfectly

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.650
good results. Next opt, is intermittent fasting
superior to a standard cutting diet? Now,

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.860
this&nbsp;is the real important question. Obviously
intermittent fasting&nbsp;diets work. But do they

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.390
work any better than a regular diet that evenly
spaces four to six meals or more throughout

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.390
the day? Well, the research here is mixed,
and it's -- it's inconclusive at best. At

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.281
this point, I can't really see any real reason
to suspect that an identical macronutrient

00:02:51.281 --> 00:02:56.770
intake consumed using an IF protocol is superior
to a standard dieting approach when it comes

00:02:56.770 --> 00:03:01.550
to overall fat loss. There is research indicating
that intermittent fasting can improve certain

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.310
aspects of overall health. But in this review,
we're obviously focusing specifically on fat

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.240
loss. So, why do so many people who failed
on previous diets swear by the results that

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:15.990
they've got using an intermittent fasting
approach? Well, the answer here is also pretty

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.569
simple. And that is that for many people,
an intermittent fasting approach is an easier

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.650
to follow method for maintaining a calorie
deficit over time. Again, long term fat loss

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.080
is ultimately a product of placing your body
into a prolonged calorie deficit. And any

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.180
dieting approach that accomplishes this effectively
is going to produce great results. Many people

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:42.310
find that employing a fasting period followed
by a shorter eating window, leads to greater

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.510
control in terms of hunger, energy levels,
mode and overall adherence to the diet. And

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:52.890
as a result, they feel better and they end
up with greater fat burning results. But the

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.470
only issue of diet adherence, two identical
individuals consuming identical macronutrients

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:03.599
would likely not experience any real difference
in fat loss whether they consume two, or four,

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:08.280
or seven, or nine or more meals per day. So,
the last question is should you use intermittent

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:13.920
fasting? Well, all things equal, the meal
structure that maximizes your mood, your energy

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.530
levels, your motivation and that controls
your appetite most effectively is going to

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.910
lead to the greatest long-term fat burning
results. So, if you find that an intermittent

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:27.860
fasting style approach accomplishes that for
you, then that is certainly the approach that

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:32.550
you should use. However, if you do prefer
spacing your meals evenly throughout the day,

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.350
don't make the mistake of believing that you
should switch to an intermittent fasting approach

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:42.820
despite this in order to super charge your
fat burning results. It all really just comes

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:47.590
down to personal preference and what works
best for you. So, 16 hours fasted, and followed

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:52.370
by 8 hours of eating, or three evenly spaced
meals, or 6 meals or 10 meals. If you're aiming

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.450
to maximize fat loss, all you really need
to focus on is hitting your macronutrients

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.910
for the day, and doing so using whatever structure
you personally prefer. So, I hope you found
