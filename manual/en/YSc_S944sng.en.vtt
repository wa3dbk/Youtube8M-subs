00:00:00.139 --> 00:00:04.982
(lighthearted music)

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:06.193
- Hi friends!

00:00:06.193 --> 00:00:07.179
Thank you so much for tuning in

00:00:07.179 --> 00:00:09.374
in CookwithApril on Tasty Tuesdays!

00:00:09.374 --> 00:00:12.722
Today we are going to
make Heath cookie bars

00:00:12.722 --> 00:00:13.599
or Heath cookies.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.418
I couldn't sleep the other
night, so I made them. (laughs)

00:00:17.418 --> 00:00:18.846
And they turned out pretty delicious,

00:00:18.846 --> 00:00:19.875
so I hope you stay tuned!

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:22.974
The first step is to pre-heat
your oven to 350 degrees

00:00:22.974 --> 00:00:25.889
and, while your oven is
preheating, chop some walnuts.

00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:28.071
I am chopping about two cups of walnuts.

00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:29.974
That might sound a lot,
but I love walnuts,

00:00:29.974 --> 00:00:32.726
but you are free to use less or more.

00:00:32.726 --> 00:00:34.734
And then you are going
to place your walnuts

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:35.988
in a cup or a bowl.

00:00:35.988 --> 00:00:39.587
And then add the whole eight
ounce bag of Heath toffee bits

00:00:39.587 --> 00:00:42.188
and mix the toffee and
the walnuts together.

00:00:42.188 --> 00:00:43.924
Now let's work on the cookie.

00:00:43.924 --> 00:00:45.243
You're gonna crack two eggs.

00:00:45.243 --> 00:00:46.251
And then you're gonna add

00:00:46.251 --> 00:00:48.306
two sticks of melted butter on top.

00:00:48.306 --> 00:00:50.511
And then you are going to mix in

00:00:50.511 --> 00:00:53.646
a cup and a half of sugar gradually.

00:00:53.646 --> 00:00:56.827
And I'm using an electrical
mixer to mix everything together

00:00:56.827 --> 00:01:00.251
and then I'm adding a teaspoon
of pure vanilla extract.

00:01:00.251 --> 00:01:02.849
Again, I'm using my electrical mixer

00:01:02.849 --> 00:01:05.412
and mixing that together.

00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:10.189
Next I'm going to add two
and half cups of flour,

00:01:10.189 --> 00:01:12.730
as well as one teaspoon of baking soda

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:14.545
that has been sifted together.

00:01:14.545 --> 00:01:17.439
And I'm adding it gradually.

00:01:18.048 --> 00:01:20.904
Then I'm gonna add the
toffee as well as the walnuts

00:01:20.904 --> 00:01:22.420
gradually as well.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.548
And I'm mixing it with a wooden spoon.

00:01:24.548 --> 00:01:27.347
Then I'm gonna place the
cookie mixture, or the batter,

00:01:27.347 --> 00:01:30.047
into the fridge for 30
minutes for it to harden,

00:01:30.047 --> 00:01:31.622
or even an hour.

00:01:31.622 --> 00:01:34.206
And once it has hardened,
you can roll your cookies

00:01:34.206 --> 00:01:35.952
and place it on a cookie sheet,

00:01:35.952 --> 00:01:38.336
or a Silpat sheet as well,

00:01:38.336 --> 00:01:39.669
which is fantastic.

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:42.838
And make sure you give
your cookies enough space

00:01:42.838 --> 00:01:44.376
'cause these cookies spread.

00:01:44.705 --> 00:01:45.835
As you can see,

00:01:45.835 --> 00:01:48.805
it's all done after baking
for 8 to 10 minutes.

00:01:48.805 --> 00:01:51.667
Alright, so the cookies are ready!

00:01:51.802 --> 00:01:53.150
Do you want to try it?

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:54.736
- Heck yeah!

00:01:58.994 --> 00:02:00.252
mmm.

00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:03.659
- You like it?

00:02:03.747 --> 00:02:04.961
- Did you put walnuts in here?

00:02:04.961 --> 00:02:05.928
- I did.

00:02:05.928 --> 00:02:07.159
- It's so good!

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:08.595
(laughs)

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.367
- Mm, oh man.

00:02:14.367 --> 00:02:16.450
I love that they're so chewy.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.302
They're like the perfect consistency.

00:02:18.308 --> 00:02:19.660
- Thank you!

00:02:20.002 --> 00:02:21.553
- mmmm.

00:02:21.628 --> 00:02:24.484
- Since I'm taste-testing it today too,

00:02:24.484 --> 00:02:27.444
I noticed I feel like it
needs more toffee bits

00:02:27.444 --> 00:02:29.841
- Really?
- [April] Do you think that?

00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:31.623
- No, I think it's pretty good.

00:02:31.623 --> 00:02:33.364
- I added the whole bag of toffee bits,

00:02:33.364 --> 00:02:35.291
but I feel like I could've even added more

00:02:35.291 --> 00:02:37.589
'cause in every bite, I
wanna taste the toffee.

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:40.423
But, that's just my personal
preference. (laughs)

00:02:40.423 --> 00:02:41.200
- I think it's perfect.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.164
- Thank you!

00:02:42.164 --> 00:02:44.648
Thank you friends so much
for watching Tasty Tuesday!

00:02:44.648 --> 00:02:46.979
I hope you tune in next Tuesday again!

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:48.247
And it would mean so much to me

00:02:48.247 --> 00:02:50.587

- Bye!

00:02:57.076 --> 00:03:02.076
