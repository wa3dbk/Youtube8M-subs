Hi, I'm Jennifer Cail. On behalf of Expert
Village I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:11.670
this delicious spicy pumpkin bread. While
our pumpkin bread is cooling I'm going to

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.599
show you how to make a nice little spread
to go with it. Either to use in your home

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.050
or to give away if you're going to make these
into gifts. We're going to make some honey

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:29.109
butter and it is really simple. All you need
is 1 stick of butter or a half cup (a quarter

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:35.440
of a pound) and you're going to want to let
it soften up to room temperature. Hopefully

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.261
your room is warm so that the butter is nice
and soft and to that we're going to add a

00:00:41.261 --> 00:00:46.219
1/4 cup of honey and you can use flavored
honey if you want to. I'm using cinnamon honey

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:54.110
but you can use orange honey or if there's
pumpkin honey which I haven't seen but I'm

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:59.960
sure they have some where for the holidays.
Or maybe some lavender honey depending on

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:08.750
the flavor that you want to achieve you're
just going to measure out a 1/4 of a cup.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.630
This honey smells fantastic it has that real
strong cinnamon scent to it and taste which

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:23.650
will go really well with the spices in the
pumpkin bread. You're just going to measure

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.189
that out, get all that in there and you'll
notice for beating this I've got a larger

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:33.190
beaters you don't want to use a whip for beating
the butter. You want something that is a little

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:39.400
bit bigger and we're going to turn on the
hand mixer on, you can also do this on a stand

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.270
mixer if you want to. Depending on how soft
your butter is you're fine with a lower power

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.410
mixer as well. Now you can see with the butter
and the honey all whipped in together. What

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.950
a great spread this looks and it also smells
great and it taste even better. While you're

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.810
making it you might want it to be a little
bit sweeter or perhaps not as sweet. So if

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.191
you start with amount of honey you can always
add more later if that is how you want it

00:02:05.191 --> 00:02:05.539
to taste.
