00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.970
leon panetta lifted the ban that was
stopping women from are being in combat

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.450
positions in the military and as you can
imagine conservatives have not been

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:10.349
happy about that now we have

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.739
senator talking about what people and
see the attached was stopped so this is

00:00:13.739 --> 00:00:15.259
the senator james inhofe

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.599
he's got some great quotes in regard to
that

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:21.800
he says abut i want everyone to know
that the senate armed services committee

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.830
which i am a ranking member will have a
period of provide oversight and review

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.340
during that time if necessary we will be
able to introduce legislation to stop

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.720
any changes we believed to be
detrimental to our fighting forces and

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.620
their capabilities i suspect they will
be cases were legislation becomes

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.500
necessary so this is before any review
of how they're actually going to

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.770
implement leon panetta spose changes

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.140
and he's already implying that don't
worry conservatives on the do whatever i

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.500
can to stop women from firing guns i
suppose recent wonder why women are

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.830
not sure the republicans represent them
i think within your perfect but wes i

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.090
defer to you here

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:00.939
i was unsure wristband

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:05.580
are reasonable meal unit because i
wasn't divisional kaveri which is

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.820
reconnaissance forces right

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.170
usually works is any knowledge

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.330
no kang son vis

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.520
helicopters and shot

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.000
we didn't have females it's it's like

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.170
canister have ground happier

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.850
and we didn't have any female pilots
even though we earn in aviation division

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.010
that did

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.670
because they were a lot

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.040
because it's a frontline unit

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.000
when i was a kid that we trained

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.240
with females like

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.920
you some call the dance camp or for you

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.400
you've senior year

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.110
and and we probably six or seven females
were put in

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.400
they were great

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:41.520
physically

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.450
there wasn't a single one of them that
complete a forced march

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.810
there wasn't a single one of them that
could

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.500
keep up even among the weakest guys
they're using cocaine

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.620
these are the women who

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.620
department and spend further education
in destroying out to become an army

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.720
officer these people really motivated

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.510
for those particular women uh...
probably not but i think if you would

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.630
force the standard rigorously it's not
gonna make a difference i think the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.229
number one problem with the military
right now in women is

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.639
rate in sexual assault

00:02:11.639 --> 00:02:13.250
also which is about

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.099
the females fault

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.729
uh... so that they want for several
times that you are saying bottom line is

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:22.799
you pass the test the president has if
you can do it you can do it mean

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.489
and so what you do you think look

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:31.079
it's crazy situation let's say you're
back in in your notes online security if

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:34.909
there's got to go back and it's like an
enemy army in california for the

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:38.590
withdrawal of abandoned this further

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:39.599
the project

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.669
what you think what is that it may not
exceed

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:43.569
get my back

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:47.559
and and if they can't physically do then
you don't care din doesn't make a

00:02:47.559 --> 00:02:48.250
difference

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.560
right netanyahu says that if what i can
say is i what was the sailor's i didn't

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:55.650
know if i know it's like do not need to
know sanders

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.379
enabled the battle is in today at the
same day there's a lot of five years ten

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:01.619
years that is not the right thing to do

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:05.819
now up when it comes to the issue of the
sexual assault rate

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.359
look at so that's a huge cultural issue
cuz u

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.429
it's not being taken seriously enough

00:03:11.429 --> 00:03:12.419
and then

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:15.519
and now we have of the numbers of women
who've been sexual assault and rape in

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:16.709
the army's use

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:18.140
not unbelievable

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:21.140
power yes some of the conservatives are
saying you know one reason we don't want

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:24.850
women in front-line combat positions is
because the chance of the enemy raping

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:25.739
them

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.309
they're being raped already let's do
something about right end and lookin

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:33.289
answer isn't well this is one of the
right to my solicit woman out of there

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:35.269
dancers let's do something about the
rate

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:39.819
yeah pregnancy since it's the same
organic mentality i mean

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:42.950
trip people say that's just standard
patriarchal argument 'cause it's

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.280
the same argument that radical muslims
have against women walking around with

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.659
their hair exposed everything else is

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.849
ritual man we can't control ourselves in
that's bs

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.110
quick and an end to that point uh... it

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:57.059
woman on the israeli army

00:03:57.059 --> 00:03:59.989
and needs to be doing just fine

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.589
wake of the israeli army for the army is

00:04:03.589 --> 00:04:08.479
close it wasn't looking at for the
middle images body weapon was a set of

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:11.749
but obviously doesn't destroy the
israeli army and so i think we ought to

00:04:11.749 --> 00:04:13.219
be a lot more serious about enforcement
