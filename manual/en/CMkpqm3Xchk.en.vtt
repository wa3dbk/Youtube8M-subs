I know some people might not be used to having
tofu on a regular base, as some think tofu

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.670
is for vegetarians only or because they heard
it doesn't have any flavour to it. While it

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.470
is true that tofu tastes
better with many spices, it doesn't mean tofu

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:21.470
lacks flavour at all. Just have a look at
our fragrant meat stuffed tofu in tomato sauce!

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.480
650g Tofu

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.180
For the Filling we are going to use
250g minced meat

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:34.129
1 tsp soy sauce
1/4 of a tsp of pepper

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:36.819
3 cloves of garlic

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:39.920
sauce
500 ml sieved tomatos

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.999
3/4 of a tsp of salt
3,5 tsp sugar

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:49.780
3/4 of a tsp of soy sauce
3 diced tomatos (optional, makes a beautiful

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:49.989
color)

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:56.569
1,5 tbs oil 
for frying

00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:03.569
First, let us peel our garlic cloves, cut
them into thin stripes and then mince them.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:13.100
Mix the minced garlic with the other ingredients
for the filling, then set aside.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.250
In a mixing bowl, combine all the ingredients
for the sauce and set aside.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.750
Now let's cut the tofu into slices. You can
get 3 to 4 slices out of a tofu cube, depending

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.140
on its width.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.800
Once the tofu is cut, divide your filling
according to the amount of tofu pairs you

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.280
have so you know how much filling goes into
the tofu sandwich.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.050
Scoop the appropriate amount of filling onto
one tofu slice, spread it evenly and put another

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.100
tofu slice on top.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:11.100
Heat up 1,5 tbs of flavourless oil in your
skillet on high heat and use the chopstick

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.560
method to find out when you can start frying
the tofu.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:28.560
Turn the heat down to medium and fry the first
side for 6 minutes or until it's golden brown.

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:39.359
Then flip the Tofu sandwiches over and fry
the other side for 3-4 minutes until they,

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:43.730
too, are golden brown.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:50.730
Turn the heat down to low, add the sauce and
let it simmer for another 5 minutes!

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.159
This is really one of my favourite tofu dishes,
as it is so fragrant. You could combine it

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.819
with another vegetable dish, but I find it
tastes great in combination with jasmine rice.

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.809
And there's plenty of tomatos in there, too,
right?

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:33.180
If you can then please add fresh tomatos to
the sauce, not only do they give lovely color

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.059
to the sauce, but they're also so healthy
and good for you. And since the sauce is merely

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:42.519
simmering on low heat you're retaining all
of the good their vitamins!

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:46.150

make sure to make a photo and send it to me

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.150

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:57.150
