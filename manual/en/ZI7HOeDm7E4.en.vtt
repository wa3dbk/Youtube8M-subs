00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:04.529
How to remove chewing gum from clothing.

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.089
Hello and welcome to Videojug.

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:12.710
Bena who has worked as a ladies maid for many
years is going to show us how to remove chewing

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:14.230
gum from clothes.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:20.020
We will show you that similar methods work
on both tough fabrics like denim and more

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.340
delicate materials like wool.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:31.910
Step 1, you will need, depending on how easy
the gum comes off you will need some or all

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.769
of the following.

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:43.540
A freezer, ice, a freezer bag, a knife, and
an old toothbrush.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.080
Step 2, act fast.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.510
For best results act fast.

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.479
Letting the gum dry makes it much harder to
get out later.

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.800
Pull off as much as you can with your fingers.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.580
Step 3, freeze.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:07.320
Hardening the gum by freezing stops it sinking
deeper into the fabric.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.820
If it's a bulky garment put some ice in a
freezer bag, place it onto the gum for a couple

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.760
of minutes until it hardens.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:23.420
Or take a single ice cube and rub it directly
onto the gum until it becomes brittle.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.430
Step 4, scrape off the gum.

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:30.460
Once the gum is hardened try to scrape it
off with a knife.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:36.640
You should be able to remove all the gum this
way from tough fabrics to light denim.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.500
Step 5, delicate fabrics.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.100
For more delicate materials like wool pull
off as much as you can.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.979
Then, wrap the item in a plastic bag and place
it in the freezer to harden the gum.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.120
This should only take a few minutes.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.370
Or rub an ice cube over the gum as before
to harden it.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.960
When it is brittle enough gently pull as much
as you can off with your fingers.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.030
Be careful not to pull to hard.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.970
You may damage the fabric.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.880
Step 6, scrub with a toothbrush.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.780
Finally, take an old toothbrush and gentley
scrub the area to remove any remaining traces

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:14.780
of gum.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.950
Bena has removed the chewing gum from both
garments using these methods, but if there's

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.940
any left on yours wash as you normally would.

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.380
Done.
