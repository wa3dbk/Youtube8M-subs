Hello and welcome to euro football weekly,
a 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.340
show where we take a look at the betting lines
for the upcoming European football fixtures,

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.290
and joining us right now to lend us his expert
betting advice and to tell us where the value

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.340
lies, is Barrie from premiershiptips.com,
twitter handle @BarriesView

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.670
Barrie welcome
Playing for the Premier league is Chelsea

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.860
vs Newcastle.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.899
After being the first to beat Man Coty at
home this season on Monday, Te Blues must

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.502
be feeling rather pleased with themselves
and are a big favourite in this match to win

00:00:37.502 --> 00:00:42.969
priced at 1.29 with WillHill, whilst 8th place
Newcastle are priced at a long 12 with Corel.

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:47.300
So firstly, any chance of the upset here,
after all Newcastle beat Chelsea twice last

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:55.199
year, with he most recent win being back in
November where Chelsea failed to score?

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:17.840
Chelsea has only let in 20 goals this season,
the least from any team, but Newcastle have

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.170
a reasonable attack.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:33.289
With 
that on mind, are you swaying more towards

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:37.299
Chelsea keeping a clean sheet @ 1.8, or BTTS:
2.25?

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:46.159
Would you 
take that bet?

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:51.249
The best value bet for me in this match has
to be Chelsea -2 on the Asian Handicap lines.

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:57.640
Home advantage, pocketed 43 goals over 23
games and the price is good at 2.25, plus

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.079
Newcastle defense isn't the greatest, letting
in 31 goals over 24 games.

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:03.140
Would you take it?

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:19.591
Another bet I like is Over 2.5: 1.66 -- low,
but combine that with a Chelsea win and you

00:02:19.591 --> 00:02:26.420
have 1.8, not as high as I like it, but it
has some value.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.950
What do you think?

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:34.550
We've discussed my bets Barrie, so what are
