00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:01.660
So we just received our

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:04.550
Kaimin Tai
Acupuncture Snapper.

00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:06.140
So Kaimin means sleeping,
right?

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:09.230
The reason that he's
sleeping is because he's

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:11.330
been acupunctured.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.290
They actually built
a little mat that has

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.700
needles coming out, so

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:17.460
all you have to do
when you catch a fish,

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.180
you put the fish on
top of the needle.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.960
And then it sleeps.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.394
Literally, it sleeps.

00:00:24.394 --> 00:00:32.997
[MUSIC]

00:00:32.997 --> 00:00:34.856
My name is Antonio Park
from Restaurant Park.

00:00:34.856 --> 00:00:35.761
&gt;&gt; [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:35.761 --> 00:00:39.360
&gt;&gt; I, I'm the cook,
the dishwasher.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.760
Sometimes the owner.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.900
Depends.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.569
And today we're
going somes

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:46.400
Acupunctured Snapper
Kaimin Tai from Japan.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.065
We're gonna try to
utilize every single part

00:00:50.065 --> 00:00:50.647
of it.

00:00:50.647 --> 00:00:53.662
[NOISE] Fried, seered,
raw, in a soup,

00:00:53.662 --> 00:00:56.955
in a broth, and try to
use everything of it.

00:00:56.955 --> 00:00:59.000
[MUSIC]

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.761
So before the arrival
of the fish,

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:03.530
always make sure your
knives are sharp.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.920
A lot of people does
it both sides sharpen,

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.950
this is only one side.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.251
Normally you take
it in a very,

00:01:10.251 --> 00:01:12.552
very sharp 15 degree,
deg,

00:01:12.552 --> 00:01:15.580
degree angle in
the first ,up and down.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:16.500
One of the first
thing that you

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.110
see is the clear eyes.

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:19.710
That's how you know if
your fish is fresh,

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.600
then you go in, you dig,
dig it in there and

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.020
then you see how
clean it is here?

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.180
How beautiful it is?

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.660
Is not only because
the fish is fresh,

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.000
it's also the way
that it's killed.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.220
A Snapper, a family,
you have to bring it from

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.120
either Japan, New Zealand
or Hawaii, California.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.408
Well, there's many
places that, that the,

00:01:37.408 --> 00:01:39.870
that do this, but
you just have to find it,

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:40.930
find it on
the internet and

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.670
find out who's
bringing in this.

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.603
Or you can just come
to my restaurant and

00:01:44.603 --> 00:01:45.658
I'll sell you one for

00:01:45.658 --> 00:01:47.940
like a hundred bucks,
hundred fifty.

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:48.930
It's pretty expensive,

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:50.170
but it's pretty
damn good.

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.470
Just gonna
scale these up.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:55.450
Don't do this at
your mother's sink.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.870
She won't be happy.

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.304
[NOISE] We're gonna
take the Snapper.

00:01:59.304 --> 00:02:01.278
We're gonna fillet
the Snapper first.

00:02:01.278 --> 00:02:01.905
Separate it.

00:02:01.905 --> 00:02:04.204
Put it in different
components.

00:02:04.204 --> 00:02:06.265
A lot of people will
actually take the head,

00:02:06.265 --> 00:02:07.602
[NOISE] and
deep fry them, and

00:02:07.602 --> 00:02:08.839
use it as a presentation.

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:10.433
That's like
the old school.

00:02:10.433 --> 00:02:12.257
But there's so much
flavor going on there,

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:14.426
you don't wanna use it,
you don't wanna waste it,

00:02:14.426 --> 00:02:16.510
so I'm gonna change the
way of thinking that way.

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.340
So, this is a way that
you filet two ways, but

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.630
at the same time, so

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:25.060
that you have two filets
going back to back.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.188
[NOISE] When you
cut the fish you

00:02:26.188 --> 00:02:27.008
gotta feel the bone.

00:02:27.008 --> 00:02:29.065
I'm separating the belly
and the top side.

00:02:29.065 --> 00:02:29.611
Cut the belly.

00:02:29.611 --> 00:02:30.655
Open the belly first.

00:02:30.655 --> 00:02:32.745
We wanna make a stock
out of this belly also.

00:02:32.745 --> 00:02:34.986
So, there's no waste.

00:02:34.986 --> 00:02:37.464
I, I, I been to so many
restaurants that they

00:02:37.464 --> 00:02:39.770
just cut the belly and
throw it away.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:40.800
Number one,
because they don't

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.820
have the knife to cut it.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:44.790
They don't have the
technique to use it in

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.160
a certain way.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.510
We're gonna do
sashimi-style first.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.380
Take out the skin of it.

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.450
All the steps are very
straightforward.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:53.185
All the steps are,

00:02:53.185 --> 00:02:55.920
are basic steps
to filet a fish,

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.280
to cut down a fish, and

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.250
to separate a fish in
many different ways.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.760
So many use
the micro chives.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.920
They're a bit more
stronger that normal,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.410
normal chives.

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:08.390
This is freshly
grated wasabi.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.170
My boys already
grated it so.

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:11.330
I don't,
I don't like to mix it.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:12.610
I like to just
put it on top.

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.600
So the person who's

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.520
gonna eat it will put
as much as he wants.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.160
[FOREIGN] noodles.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.364
It's like a clear noodles
but there not noodles.

00:03:20.364 --> 00:03:21.700
Cuz it's a seaweed.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:24.470
And we're gonna finish
with a little bit of

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.160
flower on top.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:27.885
A little bit of [FOREIGN]
which is a japanese

00:03:27.885 --> 00:03:29.262
citrus in-between
lemon and lime.

00:03:29.262 --> 00:03:31.280
That is freaking
expensive.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.940
And then after, I'm gonna
put a little sauce.

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:36.500
Dish one completed.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.740
So I'm taking out
the innards right there.

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:41.500
This is like the liver
of the fish.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.080
So a lot of people
will not even use it,

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.190
will not even touch it,

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.440
will just throw it
in the garbage.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.400
A lot of people will use
a lot of chicken liver

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.980
cow liver, beef liver
duck liver, but

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:51.940
never fish liver.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.047
I'm gonna put
a little bit of

00:03:54.047 --> 00:03:55.281
Japanese [FOREIGN]
peppers in there.

00:03:55.281 --> 00:03:58.320
A little bit of green
onion, soy sauce.

00:03:58.320 --> 00:03:59.400
Let it marinate
a little bit.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:02.555
I'm gonna take that bone,
right there.

00:04:02.555 --> 00:04:05.071
[SOUND] That's going
in a deep fryer.

00:04:05.071 --> 00:04:08.707
[NOISE] The top side,
put a little salt.

00:04:08.707 --> 00:04:10.692
Don't be afraid
to season.

00:04:10.692 --> 00:04:12.387
So now we're gonna
take the pan.

00:04:12.387 --> 00:04:14.164
[NOISE] Put some
oil in there.

00:04:14.164 --> 00:04:15.896
We wanna keep it there
[NOISE] until it

00:04:15.896 --> 00:04:16.765
becomes crispy.

00:04:16.765 --> 00:04:19.667
I, I, I try to leave
the tail with out

00:04:19.667 --> 00:04:22.272
frying because it gives
a natural color to

00:04:22.272 --> 00:04:22.952
the tail.

00:04:22.952 --> 00:04:25.147
I'm gonna turn that over.

00:04:25.147 --> 00:04:28.770
[NOISE] Break the skin.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:30.609
You really need
a sharp knife to

00:04:30.609 --> 00:04:31.893
cut a cooked-fish.

00:04:31.893 --> 00:04:33.694
A raw fish is
much more easier.

00:04:33.694 --> 00:04:35.330
When it comes
to cooked-fish,

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.852
it's a whole
different way.

00:04:36.852 --> 00:04:38.664
I wanna saute some
[FOREIGN] peppers.

00:04:38.664 --> 00:04:40.522
[MUSIC]

00:04:40.522 --> 00:04:41.566
Add a little salt.

00:04:41.566 --> 00:04:43.018
&gt;&gt; Its like Russian
roulette, right?

00:04:43.018 --> 00:04:44.303
You're going to eat it

00:04:44.303 --> 00:04:46.196
until you find
the spicy one, but

00:04:46.196 --> 00:04:48.776
when you find the spicy
one its really spicy.

00:04:48.776 --> 00:04:50.485
It's not even a joke.

00:04:50.485 --> 00:04:53.271
I'm gonna finish with
the liver right there on

00:04:53.271 --> 00:04:55.419
the side,
as like a dipping sauce.

00:04:55.419 --> 00:04:56.800
Put a little bit of ,.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.518
[MUSIC]

00:04:58.518 --> 00:05:01.070
A little four seasons
sprouts right next to it.

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:01.680
Put a little lemon.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.710
Dish number two.

00:05:06.538 --> 00:05:08.804
We're gonna make a stock
with the head and

00:05:08.804 --> 00:05:10.810
the middle bones
of the filet and

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:12.117
the bellies of course.

00:05:12.117 --> 00:05:13.002
[MUSIC]

00:05:13.002 --> 00:05:14.151
You, you,
you cut it in half so

00:05:14.151 --> 00:05:15.578
you can, there is
more flavor there.

00:05:15.578 --> 00:05:16.995
You gotta pop
off the eye.

00:05:16.995 --> 00:05:18.120
Cuz the,
the eye is bitter.

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.334
Rinse it [NOISE] nicely,

00:05:19.334 --> 00:05:20.791
take out all
the blood line,

00:05:20.791 --> 00:05:21.952
you don't need that.

00:05:21.952 --> 00:05:22.830
That's the bellies,

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:24.220
remember the belly
that I took out?

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:26.040
Put it in there.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.073
The middle bones
from the fillets.

00:05:28.073 --> 00:05:29.906
[NOISE] So this is kelp.

00:05:29.906 --> 00:05:31.797
I wanna mix it
with some miso.

00:05:31.797 --> 00:05:34.177
I make it like a,
light miso soup.

00:05:34.177 --> 00:05:37.195
We're gonna put a little
bit of bonito flakes.

00:05:37.195 --> 00:05:42.235
Soy sauce, we're gonna
boil this nice and hot.

00:05:42.235 --> 00:05:43.980
And once we do that
we're gonna strain it.

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.220
Don't forget
to squeeze it,

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:47.380
that's a lot of
flavor right there.

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:49.960
Im gonna take out
the other top side that I

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.660
had, salt and
pepper on one side.

00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.710
Cut it really thin.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:53.547
Get a little green onion.

00:05:53.547 --> 00:05:55.866
I wanna put it going up
on the bowl because if I

00:05:55.866 --> 00:05:58.374
put it inside, it's just
going to soak it in and

00:05:58.374 --> 00:06:00.594
you won't see how
beautiful is the fish.

00:06:00.594 --> 00:06:03.137
That's it.

00:06:03.137 --> 00:06:04.578
Enjoy your fish.

00:06:04.578 --> 00:06:07.074
Do not waste your
ingredients.

00:06:07.074 --> 00:06:08.677
Use every part of it.

00:06:08.677 --> 00:06:10.650
Everything is edible.

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:14.413
People doing this at home
take, take your time.

00:06:14.413 --> 00:06:19.300
Sharp your knife and
have fun.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.333
Have a lot of fun.

00:06:20.333 --> 00:06:20.833
