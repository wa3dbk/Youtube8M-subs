00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.950
The first time you set up your printer, you'll need to install the print heads and the ink

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.610
cartridges. When you run low on ink, you'll need to replace the ink cartridges. This video

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:19.439
shows you how to perform these actions. First, we'll install the ink cartridges.

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:25.480
Press the Power button to turn the printer on.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:33.390
Next, open the ink cartridge cover. Remove each new ink cartridge from its package.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:47.600
Push each cartridge into its slot. Do not force the cartridges into the slots. Each

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.070
cartridge is designed for its assigned slot only. If the cartridge does not snap into

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.769
place, check to make sure that the color coding on the cartridge matches that on the printer.

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.559
If it does not, find the right color-coded slot.

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.729
When all cartridges have been installed, close the ink cartridge cover.

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:15.320
The printer has both ink cartridges and print heads. The ink cartridges store the ink, and

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.020
the print heads fire drops of ink onto the paper to create your prints. You'll have

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.719
to replace the ink cartridges regularly, but the print heads should not have to be replaced

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:29.810
very often. Open the top cover to access the print heads.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.490
The carriage should automatically move all the way to the left.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.259
If it does not, press and hold the star button on the printer control panel until the carriage

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:46.229
moves all the way to the left. Be careful not to proceed until the carriage is on the

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:58.630
left side of the printer. If the carriage does not move to the left automatically, turn the printer off and back

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:08.160
on and then try holding down the star button again. The print head can be damaged if the

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.690
carriage is not all the way to the left for installation.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:20.130
Lift the blue print head latch. While the new print heads are still in their

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:27.130
packages, shake them six times. Shaking the print heads helps prevent print quality problems

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:33.220
later. Remove the new print heads from their packages.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.630
Then remove the orange protective caps. Be careful not to shake the print head after

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:46.960
the caps have been removed. Insert each print head into its color-coded

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:54.220
slot. Lower the print head latch and snap it into

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:02.620
place. Next, close the top cover.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.210
Whenever you insert or replace a print head, the printer automatically aligns the print

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:12.140
heads to ensure the best print quality. If the printer doesn't automatically print

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.780
the alignment page, start the alignment process manually. To start the alignment process manually,

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:22.170
perform the following steps. On the touch screen, press the icon of the

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:28.500
wrench to enter the setup menu. Using the arrow buttons, navigate to the Tools

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.180
option and select it. Using the arrow buttons again, navigate to

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:41.890
the Align Printer option and select it. The alignment process starts.

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:47.290
Replacing the ink cartridges is almost as easy as the first time you installed them.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.920
Press the Power button to turn the printer on.

00:03:52.920 --> 00:04:00.320
Open the ink cartridge cover. And remove the old ink cartridge from it's

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:15.280
slot. Remove the new ink cartridge from it's packaging.

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.220
Push each new cartridge into its color-coded slot.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:27.960
Then close the ink cartridge cover.

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.979
Replacing the print heads is similar to the way you initially installed them.

00:04:32.979 --> 00:04:38.340
Open the top cover to access the print heads. To access the print heads you must press and

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.509
hold the star button on the printer control panel until the carriage moves all the way

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:57.599
to the left. Be careful not to proceed until the carriage is on the left side of the printer.

00:04:57.599 --> 00:05:02.110
If the carriage does not move to the left automatically, turn the printer off and back

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:11.889
on and then try holding down the star button again. The print head can be damaged if the

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:16.629
carriage is not all the way to the left for installation.

00:05:16.629 --> 00:05:24.860
Then, lift the blue print head latch. On the print head that needs to be replaced,

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:31.280
lift the blue handle. Use the handle to pull the print head straight up and remove it from

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.330
the printer. While the replacement print head is still

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:40.789
in its package, shake it six times. Shaking the print head helps prevent print quality

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:47.780
problems later. Remove the new print head from its packaging.

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:53.030
Then remove the orange protective caps. Be careful not to shake the print heads after

00:05:53.030 --> 00:06:01.069
the caps have been removed. Insert the print head into its color-coded

00:06:01.069 --> 00:06:09.620
slot. Lower the print head latch and snap it into

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:20.210
place. Then close the top cover of the printer.

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:24.520
After replacing the print head, the printer will calibrate and then print out an alignment

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:29.830
sheet. Once the alignment pages prints, you can begin using your printer.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:32.509
Your printer is now ready for regular use.
