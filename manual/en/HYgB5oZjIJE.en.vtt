Q.My base makeup keeps getting thicker because I want to cover up the redness. How can I apply less makeup and still cover all the redness? 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.000
A: Iâ€™m going to teach you how to focus your base makeup over just the red areas and minimize makeup application on the other areas.

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:42.680
S1: Pump a pea-sized amount of foundation onto the brush and spread evenly over the red areas on the cheeks and the dark circle areas under the eyes.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:51.640
S2: Pat the product thoroughly into the cheek area using a wet hydro sponge. Do not rub or spread, just tap for even application.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:08.000
Tip: Using a hydro sponge can give a smoother and better coverage and help the product set on the skin better.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:32.260
S3: Apply the foundation on the opposite cheek using the brush and the sponge in the same manner.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:01.100
My skin looks so much smoother

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.260
Can I just use my fingers? Is there any difference?

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:18.960
You can but oil-free type foundation like this one dries very easily once pumped. So the beginner can feel difficulties in control to achieve an even application.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.720
Using the brush and sponge is recommended as it will irritate the redness on the skin less and provide better coverage.

00:02:41.855 --> 00:02:49.515
S4: Use the same brush and sponge technique to apply the foundation around the nose, forehead, chin.
