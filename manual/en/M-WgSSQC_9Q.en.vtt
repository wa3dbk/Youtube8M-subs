Hi my name is Rachel Deon for Expert Village.
Now I'm going to put it on the fire and we're

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.499
going to start cooking. We're going to put
it on high fire and we're going to mix very

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:20.279
good all this sugar on the bottom. It's very
important in the beginning to mix it good

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:31.570
because you can see there's a lot of sugar
in the bottom. I use a wooden spoon because

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:45.270
it doesn't give a taste, most of the sugar
is mixed now as you can see can see actually

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:51.519
but some fruit is on the bottom and you have
to be very careful on a high fire if a fruit

00:00:51.519 --> 00:01:03.539
is laying down there it might burn and might
change the whole taste of this jelly. It's

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:12.320
important not to let it sit there. We're going
to wait it takes about 10 minutes I think

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:21.430
to boil and we'll mix it so that the sugar
won't settle to the bottom and burn there.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.890
You can't leave it to long without taking
care of it cause you don't want first of all

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:36.430
the sugar to burn on the bottom. The fruits
start to stick to the bottom and burn or you

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:43.810
don't want it to boil over. Now we got to
the boiling point because of my oven I decided

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:53.070
to move it to a smaller burner. But you can
just turn your burners to a lower flame. We

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:04.850
got it to a good temperature now and just
simmering. I want to ass to to not to cover

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:13.159
the pot don't cover it cause you want the
liquid to evaporate some of it of course not

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:13.599
all of it.
