00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:37.760
Sonic: Hello TV Land. I'm famous
Hollywood actor Sonic the Hedgehog.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.360
Did you know that at this very moment, 30 fan characters are being made, abused,

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.140
and forgotten by their owners?

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.500
The generous people at Sonic Paradox
have selflessly put together a

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.120
Sonic-themed holiday album that takes
all of your favorite Christmas tunes,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.080
and totally remakes them with the new music, commentary and lyrics,

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.440
all out the goodness of their hearts

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.620
Enjoy these holiday classics like "Eggman's Mech is Burning Things Down"...

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.360
~You'd better watch out~
~You better not cry~

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.800
~You better run now~
~Or you're gonna fry~

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.540
~Eggman's mech is burning things down~

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.100
"You're a Mean One, Mephiles"...

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.780
~You're a monster, Mephiles~

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.680
~You're a jerk in every scene~

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.380
And "Sega, Help Us"...

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.580
~Sega, help us~
~Give us a new job~

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.620
~We don't have time for these cameos~

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.420
Sonic: So what are you waiting for?

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.500
Also, seriously, please donate to the Child's Play charity,
along with all of these other charitable causes.

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.700
Bystander: But wait...
What about the fan characters?

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.660
Sonic: Ha ha ha ha... No.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.280
GLaDOS: We recommend $5 for the album.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.540
Of course, you can choose to pay
less than that, or even not pay at all.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.120
Granted, that would make you a
horrible person who's dead on the inside.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.740
And you'd be forced to live
with that for the rest of your life

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.740
while other people rightfully
reserve the right to point at you,

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.320
call you a cheapskate,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.820
and throw rocks at you.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.600
But hey, it's your call.
