00:00:02.430 --> 00:00:05.780
Okay, okay... We found something..

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:08.509
Come one, Schadow, we really need to..

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.539
have a look because maybe..

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:13.649
Maybe we'll find the..

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:16.480
the answers I have been looking for..

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.279
Let's have a look inside..

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.579
No.. No..

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.949
This is not it..

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.949
This isn't it, sorry Shadow.. This won't be it..

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.820
But that seems to be a Fort..

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.800
But the bridge is gone..

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.370
Let's see if we can..

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.560
cross the river..

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.090
Because I need to know..

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.130
what happened exactly..

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:00.090
Because I don't know..

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.370
....

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.580
Why would they have..

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.860
taken down the bridge..

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.640
It's really dark here..

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.150
Abandoned..

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.010
OMG..

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.230
A dragonhead..

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:21.729
yeah we ran..

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:24.500
Woow, it's the second one..

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.470
Like the one on the ship..

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.730
Okay Shadow, stay close..

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.650
I don't trust this..

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.250
There's light inside!

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.450
I can see a throne..

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.800
Could there be anyone inside?

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.800
I do see a lot of cobwebs..

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:03.660
Omg.. Shadow, get them!

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.500
O no, no, no, no, no no!

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.019
Shadow, come on!

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.009
What was it?

00:02:15.009 --> 00:02:19.299
Oh it's a trap..

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:25.679
Oh no! There are more of them! OMG, I'm so stupid..

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:31.879
Who would have placed the traps..?

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:36.609
SHADOW? SHADOW? WHERE ARE YOU?

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.269
Oh no!

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:41.019
I wanted to disable it..

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.979
Didn't go as planned..

00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:52.979
I think that I have..

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.929
Let's not touch that again..

00:02:57.929 --> 00:03:01.169
Let's have a look around..

00:03:01.169 --> 00:03:04.619
Ooh, a bat..

00:03:04.619 --> 00:03:06.689
That's not going to work..

00:03:06.689 --> 00:03:13.689
The spiders have taken over this place..

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:21.619
Not here either..

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:24.419
This looks different..

00:03:24.419 --> 00:03:26.119
Oh, we can go up here..

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:32.399
Maybe we can go up here too?

00:03:32.399 --> 00:03:39.399
O no it's broken..

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.239
Let's go up...

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:46.889
Some chests,,

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:50.199
let's have a look at the top..

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.749
another chest..

00:03:51.749 --> 00:03:55.759
nothing at all..

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:57.429
All those spiders..

00:03:57.429 --> 00:04:00.329
I hate those spiders..

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:06.779
There was nothing up there.. Let's have a look inside these chests..

00:04:06.779 --> 00:04:12.319
These are probably completely raided.. What's this?

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:15.229
We had to destroy the bridge to defend ourselves..

00:04:15.229 --> 00:04:16.269
oh..

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:17.789
Almost out of food..

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:21.389
This is what happened to this place.. Riverwalt as been destroyed..

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:28.159
That's right.. Villagers have fled, we're leaving..

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:30.439
Oh, that's it?

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:32.590
Behind the skull, Etholdir..

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:37.020
Which skull?

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.229
What is happening?

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:41.860
Which one?

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.990
I haven't seen any?

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:49.039
I haven't seen any skulls..

00:04:49.039 --> 00:04:52.009
I really didn't see any..

00:04:52.009 --> 00:04:58.800
What could this be...

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.629
oohh.. omg..

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:06.249
Oh, behind the skull..

00:05:06.249 --> 00:05:07.569
What..

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:11.770
is this?

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:12.160
...
