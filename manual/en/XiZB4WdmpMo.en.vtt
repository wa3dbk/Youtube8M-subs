In growing citrus, we also have to pay
attention to

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.120
the problems with insects--

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.120
and there are

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.869
several that do affect the plant pretty
severely.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.580
Most people that grow citrus,

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.610
from time to time, have problems with
some of what I would call immobile

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.440
ones; those are scale and mealy bug.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.649
Those are usually insects that feed
on the leaves and stems,

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.880
that are transmitted either by us, the
gardener, or by nearby plants. They don't

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.850
have the ability to travel great
distances

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.289
to get on the plant. And then there are
those insects, like

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:56.609
spider mite, which actually can
move through the air, and seem to

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:00.649
affect the foliage of our plants.
Particularly,

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:04.300
when we move our plants from the
outside in the summer; inside in the winter--

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.440
we see problems with spider mite.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.020
There are many
ways to control that;

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.990
spider mite: simply, it's cold water
sprayed on the entire plant; do it every

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.260
day for a week, and that pretty much
eliminates them.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.540
You can also use one of our favorites,
which is

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.369
Neem oil;  that's a leaf polisher. Mix
it up, spray it on the entire plant.

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.079
That works very well for both mealy bug
and scale, although you have to remember

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:29.220
with those two

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.390
insects repeated applications are
necessary, in order to get control.

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.520
One application may suppress them and
you'll see them sort of disappear, but

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.100
they will--

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.520
but trust me, they will be back, if we
don't do repeated applications. And

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.210
generally, it's like three or four
applications,

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.140
with good penetration of the canopy. So,
that means you need to get a sprayer

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.439
that has some force on it, so that you
can get

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:55.789
down into the cracks, into and around the
fruit, into the edges of the leaves, here,

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.320
where the insects may be hiding.
