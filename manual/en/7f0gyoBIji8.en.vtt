Hi my name is Adam Bowling. I'm representing
the Christian Martial Arts Association. On

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:11.530
behalf of Expert Village, I'm here to talk
to you about the Five Animal Forms of Kung

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:20.069
Fu. Leopard Style was generally used by people
who had a leaner body type, than someone who

00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:27.470
would typically be doing a say for instance,
a tiger style or dragon style. The leopard

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.780
is a style that a person was interested in
preserving his body which is also true in

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.820
nature. Leopards are very concern about injury
because they have to run fast, they have to

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.350
move. Leopard stylist would be someone who
was interested in being able to move, preserving

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:55.740
their body, not attacking and defending straight
on. Always moving in angles, in circles. The

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:04.080
leopard was very elusive. A leopard stylist
once attacked, once the attack comes straight

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:10.670
would move in an angle. This would be what
was be called a leopard fist, kept like so,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.009
so that small striking areas would be able
to be penetrated, say like in the ribs. A

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:24.039
quick strike would injure a person only manutely
so that they would have their man on the strike

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:30.759
rather than the person that their striking.
They would use circular movements say like

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:38.700
a hook kick. They would strike low to the
groin. Paring, moving, circling, striking,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:47.759
blocking, everything outside of the center
line. Contouring the body even so that they

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:55.749
might be able to access under the arm, in
the ribs, using the knees or even the kicks.

00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:05.090
The Leopard Style was third on the body chart
for sash. The biggest person would probably

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:12.510
be more of a dragon stylish. Then a tiger
stylish. The leopard stylish would probably

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:21.520
be the next person in line with body type.
This is what typifies the Leopard Style.
