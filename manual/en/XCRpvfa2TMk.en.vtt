00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.770
Now we'll talk about the, briefly of course,
about the origins of mechanical time keeping.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.789
We're talking about clocks that tick. They
figure back in maybe early Italy, eleventh,

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:19.230
twelfth century, the mechanical time keeper
probably began in a monastery. As you may

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.029
know, that the monks at that time felt very
concerned about praying frequently and praying

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.810
at the right time. And it often required a
monk to stay up all night perhaps with his

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.300
candle burning down or other methods that
we talked about to ring the bell at the certain

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.079
time so that the monks would get up and pray.
But there was some beginning of understanding

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.430
of gearing even going back to the Greeks,
so they knew that there was some ability to

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:52.100
do, to perhaps use a machine to tell time
if they could. The earliest form of time keeping

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.000
machine, and I have a little model of it here,
this is basically again here, this is of course

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.090
in the original days would have been huge
probably in a tower, but it would have been

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:09.100
this type of mechanism called a folio, where
there's actually a rod that can be ticked

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.771
back and forth by a power source, in this
case it's a spring, but in the old days it

00:01:13.771 --> 00:01:17.420
would have been a weight, perhaps a giant
boulder with a rope around it hanging from

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.340
underneath it. And this folio would tick back
and forth and tell you the time. What you're

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:29.140
trying to do is have a regulated tick and
you need some way of taking all this power

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:36.030
of a machine and letting it use the energy
in a regular way so that the clock ticks and

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.550
keeps the time once you translate it to time
that's on an hour, on a dial. The original

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.909
clocks had no dial, all they did was ring
a bell, hence the name clock which comes from

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:52.140
Latin and other languages. The Latin clocka,
other things that gave us that. So theoretically,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.810
a clock any clock now really shouldn't be
called a clock unless it strikes. The problem

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.439
with folios is that they weren't very accurate.
These rods, this bar would just hit back and

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.049
forth. You could move the weights in and out
and maybe get an adjustment, but these were

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.250
really only good accuracy maybe an hour a
day if you were lucky.
