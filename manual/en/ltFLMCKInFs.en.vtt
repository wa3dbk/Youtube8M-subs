00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:29.089
At first, I thought this thing was, like,
the ultimate example of 1990s video game lies.

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:34.010
Case in point, this is a game that says you
can make 216 different killer cyborgs.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:40.420
Funny how they all feel the same!

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.390
Of course, the reality is...they’re not
all the same.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.380
I discovered this in the instruction booklet,
which has almost 30 pages trying to explain

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.390
how to play this thing.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.609
Uh, yeah, I’ll pass on the reading...okay,
Cyborg Justice?

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:58.679
If I wanted to study, I wouldn’t be playing
a video game.

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.890
I guess the bottom line here is...you either
like complex games or you don’t.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.820
And I’m someone who wants to jump in and
find the game so intuitive and user-friendly,

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:11.610
it takes about a minute to figure things out
and start having fun.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.980
This freaking thing...you are literally forced
to study the instructions to figure out how

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:16.980
to play.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.990
Maybe you’re into that.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.970
I wish I were.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.640
So the game is this classically styled 2D
beat ‘em up, right?

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.439
Think Turtles In Time, Battletoads, that kinda
thing.

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:37.310
Only with customization, fewer enemies, emphasis
on individual battles...and, like, the most

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.740
complicated fighting system ever devised by
people.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.590
On Earth.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.430
Maybe games are like this on Neptune, I don’t
know.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.719
You start by creating your cyborg.

00:01:48.719 --> 00:01:52.450
Basically, there are three parts to each one,
and the game gives you several options for

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.450
each part.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.290
Evidently, the math adds up to more than 200
possible combinations, and evidently, each

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.719
one would have its own unique abilities and
characteristics.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.909
I don’t know...I found the dropkick and
the punch to be effective across the board.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.459
Of course, I am playing the game wrong.

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:10.459
I freely admit that.

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.849
And I’m okay with that because, to play
the game right, I’d have to freaking take

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:15.849
notes.

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.849
Like, okay, you can execute your low special
attack...by crouching and then double tapping

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.540
A and then holding down A. Or hey, how about
the jump kick from the ground?

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.840
Pfft, easy.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.569
Press forward on the d-pad, but then tap the
B button and real quick, press down diagonally

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:33.980
toward your intended target.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:36.680
I mean, what’s not clear about that?

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.230
But with that said, if you’re a really hardcore
gamer who digs complexity and has the patience

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.349
to spend hours with a game, there’s a lot
here to like.

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:47.860
You really can do some awesome stuff in this
game.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:53.040
You can rip off cyborg limbs, you can jump
on top of them and pound them into pieces.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.360
It’s just...it requires way more button
combinations and control complexity than I

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.080
can deal with.

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.129
And to be honest, it’s kinda more than just
the convoluted game mechanics.

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:07.610
This is just not a very well-designed game
in general.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.610
It looks pretty terrible, the controls are
clunky, there are cheap deaths everywhere...throw

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:17.049
in the fact it happens to be one of the least
user-friendly games I’ve ever played, and

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:20.610
Cyborg Justice just wasn’t a game for me.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.270
You might like it, though.

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:30.810
I envy your ability to memorize button combinations.
