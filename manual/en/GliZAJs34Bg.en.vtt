00:00:00.042 --> 00:00:02.897
- Hi, I'm Rosanna from One Hand Can,

00:00:02.897 --> 00:00:04.690
and today I'm going to show you how to cut

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.123
a couple of different kinds of tomatoes

00:00:06.123 --> 00:00:09.873
on my CanDo one-handed
kitchen cutting board.

00:00:15.008 --> 00:00:17.851
I have a whole tomato
here, a nice sized tomato

00:00:17.851 --> 00:00:21.264
from our garden, I'm going
to impale it on the nails.

00:00:21.264 --> 00:00:24.182
I don't care too much
about how this looks,

00:00:24.182 --> 00:00:26.842
so I will use it with the nails,

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:29.006
and then I can score the skin first,

00:00:29.006 --> 00:00:31.461
which makes it easier to cut in general.

00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:33.751
It takes a pretty sharp knife to do it,

00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:36.167
but if you score the skin first,

00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:39.778
then you don't smash your
tomato while you're cutting it.

00:00:39.778 --> 00:00:41.333
And once I'm done doing that, I can just

00:00:41.333 --> 00:00:43.495
go back in, and it's being held

00:00:43.495 --> 00:00:45.547
tightly on the prongs, and I can just

00:00:45.547 --> 00:00:50.083
cut from side to side,
which makes it fairly easy,

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:54.083
until I have my tomato
sliced the way I want it.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.221
And that's how I would cut a tomato

00:00:59.221 --> 00:01:03.304
into just plain slices
using my CanDo prep board.

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:12.666
The next tomato I'm going
to cut are grape tomatoes.

00:01:13.743 --> 00:01:16.826
This also works with cherry tomatoes,

00:01:17.665 --> 00:01:19.429
and I can take this small tomato,

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:21.920
and I can put it right between the prongs,

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.170
that will hold it very securely,

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:27.347
and I can just slice it down, and I get

00:01:27.347 --> 00:01:30.133
a couple of nice halves of tomato.

00:01:30.133 --> 00:01:32.635
And if I want these in a smaller piece,

00:01:32.635 --> 00:01:35.055
with the flesh side up, I can just

00:01:35.055 --> 00:01:38.021
chop it down that way, and
with the flesh side up,

00:01:38.021 --> 00:01:40.366
it's easier to cut than it would be,

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:42.179
for instance, with the skin side

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.432
because it's tougher and it'll squash

00:01:44.432 --> 00:01:45.868
and it'll go all over the place.

00:01:45.868 --> 00:01:49.228
Eventually it will cut, but this piece

00:01:49.228 --> 00:01:51.878
doesn't look nearly as nice as

00:01:51.878 --> 00:01:55.682
the nice even cuts on the little tomatoes.

00:01:55.682 --> 00:01:58.189
Again, I can just put
it between the prongs,

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:01.711
and I can do a couple at a time actually,

00:02:01.711 --> 00:02:05.136
and then just slice downward, and I get

00:02:05.136 --> 00:02:08.391
a nice chopped or a nice little cut tomato

00:02:08.391 --> 00:02:10.335
that I can use as an ingredient

00:02:10.335 --> 00:02:13.418
in salads, or anything else.

00:02:13.418 --> 00:02:16.168
