00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:04.234
Legendary Verses

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.000
Hulk VS The Thing

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.900
Fight

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.500
Ben, tread lightly. It’s highly likely,
when I’m angry, you wouldn’t like me.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.820
Walk away or meet your maker. THE GROUND SHAKER!
THE EARTH QUAKER!

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.220
The single step creator of a thousand acre
crater. THE WORLD BREAKER!

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.350
Banner, you better fix your tone before these
fists are thrown, and your puny physicist

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:42.789
mind is blown. Sticks and stones will break
your bones and I’m made out of bricks, no

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:44.499
shit Sherlock Holmes.

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:50.409
Focus, come close and soak in these next words
spoken. YOU DO NOT WANT THE JADE GIANT AWOKEN!

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.800
It’s Newtons Third Law of Motion. Every
action has a reaction and you’re attacking

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.629
a guy who has a knack for over reacting.

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.579
YA KNOW THIS AIN’T A SCIENCE FAIR RIGHT?!?!
This is David vs. Goliath. It ain’t even

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:08.180
a fair fight. Come on, I’ve dated gals twice
your size but I’m sure some gals just adore

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.360
guys with four eyes.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:15.540
Call me four eyes but these rex specs reflects
me, intellectually. So go ahead and flex your

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:21.430
rock hard pecks but see girls find intelligence
sexy. Why do you think all your exes always

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.870
text me?

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.720
Enough with the wordy gibberish, you nerdy
physicist. Your verbal hammer and chisel is

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.680
starting to tickle. Now you’re caught in
a little bit of a pickle. Between A ROCK and

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.270
hard place and brittle Banner’s stuck right
in the middle.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.780
If you engage his chronic rage, I’m afraid,
he’ll jump straight off the comics page.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.230
You got hit with measly cosmic rays. The Hulk
creates seismic waves and earthquakes with

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.360
his legs like tectonic plates.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:52.780
It’s those antics that manage to get you
banished from so many planets. Banner dammit,

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.290
you need Xanax.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:00.280
Sue Storm’s massive ass is the only aspect
about you 4 bastards that’s actually Fantastic.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:06.180
This’ll make you green with envy. Your gal
and I been getting pretty hot and heavy. We

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.190
make the bed rock plenty, get all sweaty.
Yea, I gave her a nickname

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:12.780
BOUNCING BETTY.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.760
AHHHHHHHH!!!! AHHH!!! You should have left
Betty out of this! AHHHHHHHH!!!!ORANGE MAN

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.620
PUSH HULK BUTTONS! HULK START HULK SMASHING
PUMPKINS!

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.860
HULK DROP MAMMOTH GAMMA BOMB, ON JACK-O-LANTERN
IN BANANA HAMMOCK THONG!

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.540
WHOAAAAA!
Talk about baggage, no wonder you’re so

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.140
savage. You grow five times the size and your
package is still below average. I figured

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.870
you’d be bigger. This stress ain’t good
for your ticker. You’re not yourself when

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.970
you’re angry Bruce, here have a snickers.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:57.970
HULK CLASH WITH PUNY ROCK TITAN IN PAST! HULK
SHATTER ROCK LIKE GLASS! HULK NO MORE TALK

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.080
TRASH! HULK SMASH!

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:10.080
Listen, Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde and the monster
of Frankenstein combined.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:17.510
I’M DONE, hooting and hollering rhymes.
LET’S GO, IT’S CLOBBERING TIME!
