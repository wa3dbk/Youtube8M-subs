00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:09.130
Now after stretching for about 15, 20 minutes
however, maybe needed more, you like to start

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:13.600
a little warmup. We're going to break a little
sweat today because we want to have our blood

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.990
pumping before we actually physically start
playing the sport of basketball. So I like

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:23.339
to start off with maybe 5 to 10 minutes of
jump rope and then doing a couple of up downs.

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:28.609
Up downs, going all the way to the mid court,
back to base line, free throw line extended,

00:00:28.609 --> 00:01:10.020
back to base line, all the way back to the
base line and then back, etc. Next we want

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.020
to do layups, we're going to start at the
free throw line using the corners. I want

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.790
you to start on the right corner driving to
the hoop using your right hand. Switch off,

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:23.490
come back to the left side using your left
hand. What this allows us to do is to get

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:50.720
in a good rhythm before we start playing the
sport of basketball. Next thing we're going

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.260
to do is we're going to pair up. We're going
to go all the way down to the base line doing

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.400
passing drill. Now, the important part to
remember when passing is that the ball should

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:05.580
be at chest level. I want you to go chest
level to your partner going back and forth

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:14.200
using the side step. So basically, there we
go, all the way down the court. What this

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.240
again does it allows us to get in a good rhythm
because we all know basketball is a team sport,

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.440
not an individual and this allows us to use
our teammates effectively getting us ready

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.630
for game time situation.
