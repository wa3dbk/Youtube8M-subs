00:00:11.229 --> 00:00:15.939
A long run is the long distance run that provides the gentle challenge through

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:17.159
mileage extension

00:00:17.159 --> 00:00:20.350
which will develop the exact endurance
necessary

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.410
for getting you to the finish line.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.089
this will be the cornerstone of your
training and fitness.

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:28.939
it starts with the longest distance you've
covered

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:30.920
within the last two weeks,

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.420
as you lengthen the long run to
fourteen miles for a half,

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.810
or twenty six miles for a full marathon,
you build the exact endurance needed to

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.250
complete your target race.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.890
a detail training plan can be found in
that dvd run.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.770
Now, you may be asking yourself why do i
need to do the full mileage of my race

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.280
before the race?

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.830
Well, i found out that the place where you might hit the wall is the distance of your

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:04.619
last long-run within the last two to
three weeks before you race.

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.920
the wall is a debilitating state of fatigue,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.660
within a few hundred yards you go from
feeling very tired to feeling like

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.590
you just can't go on anymore, and the most
common reason for hitting the wall is

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:25.190
that you haven't  run far enough in
preparation for your event. our training

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:26.260
program

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.540
lead you right up to the distance that

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:32.060
you will need in order to complete your event.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.350
while there are significant and continuing
physical benefits from going farther

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.670
regularly, the mental ones

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.150
are even greater.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.630
this produces mental momentum,

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.049
self-confidence, and a

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:46.570
positive attitude.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:53.350
it also reduces the number of negative messages that most people get who do not go up to the full distance in

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.130
preparation for their race.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.420
you only have to do the long run

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.200
every other week once you reach five miles and a half marathon or ten miles

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.029
in the full. Let's talk about what to
do on the non long-run weekends.

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:10.880
most you're going to do is slow

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.639
run walk about half the distance of the
current long one

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:17.919
up to seven miles. you may also take this
opportunity

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:22.479
to do some cross-training. but look at
the schedule and you can figure out what to do.

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:27.799
On two to four of these easy weekends
is wise to test your improvement using

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:28.949
the magic mile.

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.179
this will help you predict where your phase is

00:02:31.179 --> 00:02:36.529
in both training and in racing.

00:02:36.529 --> 00:02:41.309
The galloway program has a number of unique elements that allow you to gain control

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:44.700
over your fatigue, virtually eliminate
injury,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.780
monitor your progress, and tell you
pretty much exactly how slow you need to

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:56.049
go on long runs. therefore, eliminating
that causes of most injuries.

00:02:56.049 --> 00:02:57.560
the bottom line is that

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.770
you can't go too slow on the long runs, and
the magic mile will tell you what that

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:05.290
slow pace should be, but

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.369
even if you run two, three, four, or five
minutes per mile slower

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:14.259
than your current capability in the
marathon or the half marathon, you're

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:18.799
still going to get all of the endurance
of that long run.

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:25.799
let's go through the procedures of the
magic mile as to how it should be done.

00:03:28.589 --> 00:03:33.430
the magic mile is the very best way i
have found to determine what is an

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.430
appropriate pace both a goal in the
marathon itself, and also a long-run pace.

00:03:41.099 --> 00:03:43.649
At the first part of the season,

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:48.019
you will run your first magic mile for
time. go to a track, run four laps around

00:03:48.019 --> 00:03:50.259
the track and time yourself.

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:54.849
the first time you do it though, don't run
fast, just run about the pace that you

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.279
normally run. You could pick up the pace
of tiny tiny bit at the end, but do not

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:00.269
sprint,

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.319
and of course

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:05.430
do not puke. I'm against puking, so after
you've gotten your time on the first

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.019
magic mile

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.899
your purpose, and mission on the second
one is to beat that first time. and on

00:04:11.899 --> 00:04:18.120
each successive magic mile, you continue
to shoot for running your fastest magic

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:20.139
mile time, each time.

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:24.719
that magic mile becomes very predicted
as to what you're capable of doing. and a

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:26.989
half marathon or a marathon,

00:04:26.989 --> 00:04:28.299
because over the years

00:04:28.299 --> 00:04:32.999
i've crunch the numbers, i have taken over
fifteen thousand instances of people

00:04:32.999 --> 00:04:37.279
running the magic mile, and then compared it with what they ended up running. And i have

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:42.089
found that most people tend to
slowdown twenty percent when they go to

00:04:42.089 --> 00:04:45.340
a half marathon, and thirty percent in the
marathon.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.230
that means that a person

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:51.660
that ends up with their fastest magic
mile of ten minutes flat could be

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.480
expected to run a really hard
half-marathon in twelve minutes per mile,

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.350
and a really hard full marathon in thirteen
minutes per mile. now we don't want first

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:05.990
time marathoners or half marathoners
to go all out and try for these

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.699
times, but at least you know what these
times would be.

00:05:10.699 --> 00:05:12.620
 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:16.240
the most important function of the magic
mile is to determine what your

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.340
long-run pace should be, and that's
determined very simply by adding two minutes

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:25.580
to what is predicted in the marathon,
even if you're training for the half

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.300
marathon. so the example here someone
that runs a ten minute flat magic mile

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:37.460
as their fastest magic mile, multiply by
one point three. that predicts a really

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:42.100
fast marathon pace of thirteen minutes
per mile, so that person should be

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.360
running no faster than fifteen minutes
per mile on their long runs.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.989
the main concept here is that the pace
that

00:05:50.989 --> 00:05:52.989
is recommended for long runs

00:05:52.989 --> 00:05:58.169
is the fastest pace that you should be
running on long runs. it's always fine to

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:03.279
run slower than that pace. all this means
is that you will recover faster,

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:06.330
it all falls into place once you've done
three or four long runs.
