00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.180
[playing and laughter]

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.000
Applebloom: STOP!

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.160
[laughter]

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:05.140
Applebloom: Stop, stop. No more!

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:06.680
Rainbow Dash: Applebloom, listen.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.560
Okay. the world presents some problems and we don't know what to do!

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.540
You've come to find your feelings aren't exactly what you knew.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.560
The odds are stacked quite poorly if without a winning hand.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.800
But bear in mind your faring's only worse if you don't-

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.480
Chin up!

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:27.320
Don't bet on sinking ships because they'll turn your chips to trash!

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.160
You've got to set your sights and hopes on setting not to crash!

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.020
The truth can seem quite bleak if you don't make your plans unfurl.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.060
But I would not let that mar my opinion of the -

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:42.260
Fact is that if you could fix the failings of the current paradigm,

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.000
We would have a hero who's both been elusive and on time.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.760
Just one time.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:49.440
⋯

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.820
And then,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:51.420
⋯

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.400
We would all contrive new conflict!

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:54.120
Chin up!

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.000
Don't bet on sinking ships because they'll turn your chips to trash!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.900
You've got to set your sights and hopes on setting not to crash!

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:05.720
The truth can seem quite bleak if you don't make your plans unfurl.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.280
But I would not let that mar my opinion of the world!

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.540
Applebloom: This coming from a pony whose been up everyone's butt with moping for three months.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:15.160
Rainbow Dash: Well, they let me take time off work for my emotional recovery, so

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.560
Applebloom: That is completely appalling

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.040
Rainbow Dash: Well, I do blame myself and feel badly, and my job sucked.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.600
Look, I'm not saying to follow your heart or something dumb like that

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:24.200
Just-

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.760
Chin up!

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.760
Don't bet on sinking ships because they'll turn your chips to trash!

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:32.600
You've got to set your sights and hopes on setting not to crash!

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.420
The truth can seem quite bleak if you don't make your plans unfurl.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.380
But I would not let that mar my opinion of the -

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.860
Stipulations placed before you to get all the things you really need.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.100
Mr. Big may make things hard but you have got to plant your seeds.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.600
⋯

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.020
Go to war.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.760
⋯

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.040
Fight more.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.720
⋯

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.900
Your dreams thrive by competition.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.260
You'll find no one famous ever got there just by flinching at their foes

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.460
Cling against the torment, claw with all your might at what you know.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.000
⋯

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.420
Don't let go!

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.180
⋯

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.020
Just grow!

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.240
⋯

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:10.280
Don't wait or play to indecision!

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.040
Chin up!

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.860
Don't bet on sinking ships because you've got to be more grand!

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.720
You've got to think ahead and carry out the things you've planned!

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.520
The truth can be of use when you can see where falsehoods lay.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.680
Don't quit on hopes or dreams when you have simply got to -

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.380
Chin up!

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.140
Don't bet on sinking ships because they'll only drag you down!

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.060
You've got to keep on sailing even when you want to frown!

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.900
The world will keep on turning without matter where you land.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.560
You might as well be running when your feet should hit the sand!

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.840
Applebloom: Oh, so what you're saying is that the world is going to screw us left and right anyways

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.740
So, we may as well screw the world right back

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.840
Rainbow Dash: No, I'm saying that the world is a hard place, and, if you need a leg up, I can be there

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:51.340
But

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.920
I think you'll be okay if you just keep working hard and trying new strategies

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:56.380
Really, I just wanted you to -

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.120
Chin up!

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.960
Don't bet on sinking ships because you've got to be more grand!

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.780
You've got to think ahead and carry out the things you've planned!

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.600
The truth can be of use when you can see where falsehoods lay.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.640
Don't quit on hopes or dreams when you have simply got to -

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.520
Chin up!

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.320
Don't bet on sinking ships because they'll only drag you down!

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.140
You've got the means to live and it needs merely to be found.
