00:00:04.645 --> 00:00:05.750
Oooh, hello there!

00:00:06.112 --> 00:00:10.813
I still have a bit of time before I have to take Thomas out with Annie and Clarabel.

00:00:11.157 --> 00:00:15.048
You know, Thomas didn't always have his own coaches.

00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:20.625
No, when he first arrived, he just used to shunt the trucks or fetch the coaches for the bigger engines.

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:25.628
In fact, the first time he took his own passenger train out, he made a right mess of it.

00:00:25.984 --> 00:00:27.487
Listen to this story.

00:00:27.692 --> 00:00:29.272
Thomas' Train.

00:00:29.953 --> 00:00:34.423
Thomas often grumbled because he was not allowed to pull passenger trains.

00:00:34.423 --> 00:00:36.094
The other engines laughed.

00:00:36.094 --> 00:00:38.766
"You're too impatient!" they said.

00:00:39.037 --> 00:00:44.627
One night, Henry was ill. The workmen worked hard, but Henry didn't get any better.

00:00:44.925 --> 00:00:48.939
In the morning, Thomas had to get Henry's coaches ready.

00:00:49.173 --> 00:00:54.766
"If Henry is ill," Thomas thought, "perhaps I shall pull his train?"

00:00:55.033 --> 00:01:01.502
Thomas took Henry's coaches to the platform and wanted to run round in front at once, but his driver wouldn't let him.

00:01:01.502 --> 00:01:04.033
"Don't be impatient, Thomas," he said.

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:06.939
Thomas waited and waited.

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:12.986
The people got in, the guard and stationmaster walked up and down, but still Henry didn't come.

00:01:12.986 --> 00:01:17.016
The Fat Controller came out of his office to see what was the matter.

00:01:17.016 --> 00:01:19.681
"Find another engine!" he ordered.

00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:23.251
"There is only Thomas," said the stationmaster.

00:01:23.251 --> 00:01:27.283
"You'll have to do it then, Thomas," said the Fat Controller.

00:01:27.283 --> 00:01:33.161
So Thomas ran round to the front and backed down on the coaches, ready to start.

00:01:33.161 --> 00:01:38.250
"Don't be impatient," said his driver. "Wait 'til everything is ready."

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.039
But Thomas was too excited.

00:01:41.391 --> 00:01:44.240
What happened then, no-one knows.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.063
Perhaps they forgot to couple Thomas to the train? Anyway, Thomas started.

00:01:50.063 --> 00:01:53.640
People shouted and waved to him, but he didn't stop.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:02.052
"They're waving because I'm such a splendid engine!" Thomas thought. "Henry says it's hard to pull trains, but I think it's easy!"

00:02:02.052 --> 00:02:06.751
"Hurry, hurry, hurry!" he puffed, pretending to be like Gordon.

00:02:07.003 --> 00:02:10.845
Then, Thomas came to a signal at 'danger'.

00:02:10.845 --> 00:02:14.128
"Bother," he thought, "I must stop."

00:02:14.128 --> 00:02:17.487
And he blew an angry "peep peep" on his whistle.

00:02:17.487 --> 00:02:22.095
"Hello, Thomas!" said the signalman. "What are you doing here?"

00:02:22.095 --> 00:02:27.674
"I'm pulling a train!" said Thomas, proudly. "Can't you see?"

00:02:27.674 --> 00:02:32.346
"Where are your coaches then?" said the signalman.

00:02:32.346 --> 00:02:34.283
Thomas looked back.

00:02:34.283 --> 00:02:39.517
"Why, bless me!" he said. "We've left them behind!"

00:02:39.517 --> 00:02:44.408
Poor Thomas was so sad, he nearly cried.

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:52.360
At the station, all the passengers were talking at once. They were telling the Fat Controller what a bad railway it was.

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:58.286
But when Thomas came back and they saw how sad he was, they couldn't be cross.

00:02:58.286 --> 00:03:03.929
So they coupled him to a train and this time he really pulled it.

00:03:04.898 --> 00:03:09.641
Silly Thomas! Imagine rushing off without the coaches!

00:03:09.641 --> 00:03:10.704
[MR. PERKINS CHUCKLES]

00:03:10.704 --> 00:03:13.285
Oooh! I better get going!

00:03:15.018 --> 00:03:19.408
Oh, Thomas is waiting with Annie and Clarabel. Goodbye!

00:03:21.344 --> 00:03:23.938
Oh, dear! Silly me!

00:03:23.938 --> 00:03:27.704
