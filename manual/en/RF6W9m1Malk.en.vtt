00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.950
&gt;&gt;AL SOUSA: Hi, this is Al Sousa.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.290
I was part of the Stan Winston crew for Jurassic
Park.

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.670
I was the lead mechanical designer for the
sick Triceratops.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.340
&gt;&gt;SHANNON SHEA: Hi, this is Shannon Shea.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.980
I was fortunate enough to be part of Stan
Winston’s Triceratops crew for the first

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.990
Jurassic Park movie.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:32.360
&gt;&gt;AL SOUSA: Here I am

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.210
many years ago,

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.870
demonstrating the breathing mechanism on the

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.230
small scale model.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.550
We built a small scale version of the

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:42.870
character before the full scale

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.480
so we could show Stan how everything was going
to work

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.800
and basically

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:48.800
built

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.640
a bigger scale version of everything

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.320
with all the mechanisms and controllers

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.280
when we went to the full scale version.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.489
That breathing mechanism was basically just
a post

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:00.489
underneath

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:04.820
that just pushed a lever pushed it up and
down and moved the skin up and down.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.100
There I am demonstrating the tail mechanism

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.220
which had movement from side to side

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.880
and also up and down as well.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.980
There were no hydraulics in this character.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:17.980
It was all just

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.980
mechanical.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.750
A lot of cables and pulleys and the tail was
like a direct linkage mechanism.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.679
&gt;&gt;SHANNON SHEA: Joey Orosco is here painting
the Triceratops.

00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:32.470
He started the paint job in Los Angeles.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.280
You can see how detailed and beautiful of
job he did.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:38.009
Unfortunately, things were so,

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:41.720
so tight that we had to ship it

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.910
to Hawaii

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.869
and Joey actually finished the paint

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:46.869
on set.

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:49.570
Here he is working on this very intricate
paint job.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.080
This is when Steven came by the shop

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.819
and this is us demonstrating again a concept

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.060
of how we were going to puppeteer it.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.800
It got loaded into, as you can see it wasn’t
finished.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.490
All the legs were apart.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.920
We could only ship

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.560
a certain container to Hawaii.

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.270
The legs had to be put on in Hawaii.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.360
&gt;&gt;AL SOUSA: We had to be ready

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.250
with the character because it was going to
take like a month to ship it there on the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:15.250
container,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.250
on the boat.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.130
We had to have it ready a month before they
wanted to shoot it,

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.360
to give it time.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.830
Then this is a big hole they dug in the ground
with the platform over the top,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.300
so that all the puppeteers could be underneath.

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.660
There were

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.320
one or two inside

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.160
the character.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:33.730
The only one that was outside was

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.940
the guy doing the eyes

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.130
with the remote control,

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.280
with the radio.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.280
Everyone else,

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.460
all the cables and all the controllers were
down underneath that platform.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.110
I think the one guy

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:50.800
was inside that was working the tail.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.830
Everyone else was underground

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.080
working the breathing mechanism,

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.150
working the mouth, and the tongue.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.980
Working the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.420
forearms and the legs.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.980
Those were all cable controlled.

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:08.510
I remember when

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.800
they told me I was going to Hawaii

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.830
because I had just started working for Stan
at the time.

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.280
Out of all the characters we made, this was
the only one that shot on location.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.490
Everything else was shot back in L.A.

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:23.930
I was pretty much the brand new guy at Stan’s.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:30.800
They said, “The character you built is filming
in Hawaii so you get to go to Hawaii.”

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.140
That was kind of funny.

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:34.300
Now, here

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.000
here we are starting rehearsal.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.940
This was, I believe, our first day there in
Hawaii.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.740
We set up a camera

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.459
and had a monitor underneath

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:49.160
in our little put down there.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.510
Then Stan was directing us.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.959
We were going through the various movements.

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.430
First one at a time so we could look at each
one, one at a time.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:00.660
Then we started trying to

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:02.290
combine them all together

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.150
and Stan was kind of conducting us like an
orchestra

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.070
where he wanted all of those movements to
blend together into a really smoothe …

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.630
He was really,

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.680
really about smooth movements in your performance.

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.040
He didn’t want any of what he called herky-jerky
movements.

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.720
&gt;&gt;SHANNON SHEA: While most of the guys were

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.070
in the pit

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.470
moving the dinosaur around, I was outside

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:28.960
on the day of shooting.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.880
The radio controls were

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.530
handed off to me because I was responsible
for doing all of the

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:38.040
cosmetics on the dinosaur for the shoot.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.040
I had to do all of the

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:40.040
puss

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.160
and the spit and

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.450
the rheumy eyes and all that stuff.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.630
In fact when Laura Dern,

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:50.590
pops the micro vesicle on the tongue,

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:51.590
that was a little gag

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.960
that I figured out.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.490
I would have to actually run in with a syringe

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:56.940
and refill

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.190
the cavity.
