00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.300
Hello Noobs !

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.270
This is Pomf &amp; Thud, and today we will pimp up a tournament !

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.000
For those who do not know us, check out what we do:

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In January, we launched the Nation Wars 1;

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We decide to produce a second edition of this tournament

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
with not 8 but 16 countries, in order to find out

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
beyond doubt which Nation rules on Starcraft 2.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In its original form, the tournament will be produced 100% online

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.710
with progamers playing at home and the games will be available on streaming

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:50.000
At first, the Prize Money for the players will start at 9 600$

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.400
Why at first my dear Pomf ?

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.210
It's quite simple my dear Thud, I'll explain :

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.000
We offer to open a Crowdfunding project,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and let you choose to finance both the venue of the Nation Wars 2's finale

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
in a Prestigious place : the "Trianon de Paris"

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
BUT ALSO to make the Prize Money grow beyond 9 600$ !

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
To give you a glimpse of the Nation Wars 2's potential, let us introduce to you an intimistic teaser.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Press the Play Button Georges!
