00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.950
(music)

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.220
(music)

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:17.090
(music)

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.390
I've been active my whole life but I've
ran Boston in 2001,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.849
then I joined the gym for about three
years, and I would go once a week, twice

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.950
a week.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.890
With the gym I got burnt out because I
got bored of being on the treadmill.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.800
Then I just stopped everything and
I gained a lot of weight and I wasn't happy

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.280
with myself.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.630
Three and a half years ago my wife saw
an ad for bootcamp in

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:53.220
the paper and she said you should do it for
tree months. So with the encouragement from 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.590
her back and I signed up for it.  I loved
it the first day I went there and I

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.020
mean

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.820
I lost the weight. Ever since then I've
been gone five days a week and it's like

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.950
I'm addicted to it.

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.510
I love it and I'm in the best shape of
my life and I just turned 50 and I don't

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.080
feel it.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.600
If I wasn't doing it with the classes,
if I was doing it by myself,

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.730
I know myself I would quit. When you're
in the gym you try to-

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.380
from a running standpoint you're on a
treadmill you look at the clock, it's so

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.910
easy to just jump off and hit stop.

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.119
That's the good thing about being
a part of

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:29.140
boot camp is there's always people there that
are in front of you that you're trying to catch

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.979
up but there's always people there
cheering you on telling you doing a good

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:38.979
job keep it up.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.860
My first obstacle race I really didn't
know what to expect. I watched the

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.049
videos of it online and saw some
of the obstacles

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:53.430
but I still went there saying okay

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:59.509
I'm prepared for this with all my training.
Once I finished that first one it was

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:00.220
so much fun doing it with people

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.360
and all the
obstacles, it was like a different

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.270
challenge for me.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.780
I would never think about myself doing
an obstacle race

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.140
but training for it probably you can do
anything.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.350
Doing the different things and 
different obstacles

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.360
it adds a variety of life and
makes me kinda proud that

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.370
I accomplished all of these things.
Could I ever go back to the gym?

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.490
No. I would never go back to the gym 

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:31.040
There is nothing that I would do with
the gym that I can't do at

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.430
bootcamp anymore. I've run around on the 
treadmill over four years and I don't think I will

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.560
ever run on another one. I'll go
out in the rain and train

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.000
rather than run on a treadmill. I like
doing it, it keeps me

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.470
alive, it wakes me up every morning.
