00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:13.142
This application is for rib pain- where location may vary.

00:00:13.142 --> 00:00:15.710
Though it is often caused by an impact injury,

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.040
excessive coughing, or muscle strain, 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.512
and this is how we will tape. 

00:00:20.712 --> 00:00:22.338
For this application we are going to place 

00:00:22.338 --> 00:00:27.476
the area of pain on as much stretch over that skin as possible. 

00:00:27.957 --> 00:00:30.511
And in this case I am going to 
 use a red dot just to indicate

00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:32.557
where that point of pain may be.

00:00:32.972 --> 00:00:36.300
Your pain may vary towards the front or back of the rib cage.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.799
For my first piece of tape I am going to tear off an I-Strip.

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:45.908
Forming an anchor down at the logo end of the tape.

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:48.483
I am just peeling that paper off-

00:00:49.087 --> 00:00:54.218
and I am going to apply that anchor with no stretch on 

00:00:54.818 --> 00:00:58.362
the tape and as I remove the paper,

00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:01.637
again- no stretch on the tape as I lay this down.

00:01:02.937 --> 00:01:10.867
And no stretch on the other end of the tape. 

00:01:10.078 --> 00:01:15.342
Tearing off another I-strip. Again I am tearing the paper

00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:20.295
to form an anchor on the logo end of the tape. 

00:01:22.294 --> 00:01:24.892
I am going to apply this much as I did the first piece.

00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:29.165
No stretch on the anchor. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And as I lay the strip down, again no stretch on the tape. 

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:36.701
as I lay this down, and what I am doing here is 

00:01:36.701 --> 00:01:39.575
framing that point of pain.

00:01:40.945 --> 00:01:47.140
And for the third piece, tearing off an I-strip, this time

00:01:47.044 --> 00:01:50.620
I am going to tear the paper in the middle of the strip 

00:01:52.827 --> 00:01:57.220
peeling that paper back to leave 1Â½-2 inches of anchor. 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:06.600
And from here I am going to apply even pressure on that middle section,

00:02:06.595 --> 00:02:10.700
or full stretch on that middle section of tape

00:02:10.695 --> 00:02:12.600
applying that over the point of pain. 

00:02:13.068 --> 00:02:16.520
Pinching off the anchors, so when I lay the anchors 

00:02:16.673 --> 00:02:21.870
down there is absolutely no stretch on the anchor end of tape. 

00:02:23.263 --> 00:02:24.530
(Same thing on the back) 

00:02:24.734 --> 00:02:30.000
Paper is removed and I lay that anchor 
 down with no stretch on the tape.

00:02:30.698 --> 00:02:33.120
And bring your arm back down- 

00:02:33.623 --> 00:02:36.160
that is one way you can tape for rib pain.
