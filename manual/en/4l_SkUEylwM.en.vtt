00:00:00.852 --> 00:00:01.572
- Hi!

00:00:01.572 --> 00:00:02.698
- We're Rainy Day Dreamers.

00:00:02.698 --> 00:00:03.660
- And people have asked,

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.180
"What Christmas gifts did
Roxanna and Ximena get?"

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.258
Well they got monthly subscription boxes,

00:00:08.258 --> 00:00:10.395
but not the MunchPak or
one of those food ones,

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:11.497
instead we picked out some

00:00:11.497 --> 00:00:13.563
very specific ones to their interests.

00:00:13.563 --> 00:00:15.398
So today they're going to tell you about

00:00:15.398 --> 00:00:16.839
these that they got!

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:18.092
The Threaded Canvas

00:00:18.092 --> 00:00:19.488
and the Book of the Month.

00:00:19.488 --> 00:00:22.985
♫ Rainy day dreamers

00:00:23.284 --> 00:00:25.519
♫ Rainy day dreamers ♫

00:00:26.245 --> 00:00:28.584
They have been receiving
these since Christmas,

00:00:28.584 --> 00:00:30.414
every month, and I think
they're enjoying them.

00:00:30.414 --> 00:00:32.299
They're gonna tell you about that today.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:35.167
If you're interested in these
two subscription services

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:37.367
we'll put links to them
down below this video.

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:38.779
So Ximena, how have you liked this

00:00:38.779 --> 00:00:40.658
Spellbound Book of the Month?

00:00:40.658 --> 00:00:41.707
- I love it.

00:00:41.707 --> 00:00:43.120
- Look forward to it every month.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.442
Show us some of the books you've received.

00:00:44.442 --> 00:00:47.135
- This is the first book I
got, "A Gathering of Days."

00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:49.261
Before they sent me the books,

00:00:49.261 --> 00:00:52.238
I filled out a thing that said, like,

00:00:52.238 --> 00:00:54.085
my interests and stuff about books.

00:00:54.085 --> 00:00:55.703
So I got three new things,

00:00:55.703 --> 00:00:58.153
and then one more, I
don't know where I put it.

00:00:58.153 --> 00:01:01.339
And then, like, they sent one really late

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:03.737
because there was a returned book thing,

00:01:03.737 --> 00:01:05.259
so they sent me an extra one,

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:06.755
and this is "The Magic Half"

00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:08.129
which I really really really really

00:01:08.129 --> 00:01:10.178
really really really love

00:01:10.178 --> 00:01:12.698
and "Moxie and the Art of Rulebreaking"

00:01:12.698 --> 00:01:13.835
which I really really really

00:01:13.835 --> 00:01:15.530
really really really loved.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.574
- So would you say they've done a good job

00:01:17.574 --> 00:01:18.978
picking out books for you

00:01:18.978 --> 00:01:20.692
to send to you each month?
- Yes.

00:01:20.692 --> 00:01:23.194
- Okay, so they do send the questionnaire

00:01:23.194 --> 00:01:25.678
about the age of the
child and the interests

00:01:25.678 --> 00:01:26.919
and some different things,

00:01:26.919 --> 00:01:28.510
and based on that, these are people

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:29.892
who actually run a bookstore,

00:01:29.892 --> 00:01:30.914
and every month send one

00:01:30.914 --> 00:01:31.934
and she's been very pleased.

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:34.151
And it so happens that, hold on!

00:01:34.151 --> 00:01:35.995
It so happens that today

00:01:35.995 --> 00:01:37.890
she got her latest book,

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.260
so she's gonna open it right now

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:40.434
and give us a quick impression

00:01:40.434 --> 00:01:41.797
of what she thinks.

00:01:41.797 --> 00:01:43.127
She likes these.

00:01:43.127 --> 00:01:44.083
- I do.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:48.939
- What's the name?

00:01:50.239 --> 00:01:52.339
- "Our Only May Amelia."

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.619
- Okay, and this looks like it has...

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:55.989
it's an award-winner book.

00:01:55.989 --> 00:01:57.291
Do you know what that silver award is?

00:01:57.291 --> 00:01:58.230
- Newbery Honor.

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:59.414
- The Newbery, okay!

00:01:59.414 --> 00:02:00.894
So that's a good way to know,

00:02:00.894 --> 00:02:02.457
if you're picking out books for kids,

00:02:02.457 --> 00:02:04.050
those award-winners tend to be

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.356
good and popular for kids.

00:02:06.356 --> 00:02:08.238
So what's the story on this month's book?

00:02:08.238 --> 00:02:09.688
- It seems really good,

00:02:09.688 --> 00:02:12.637
the thing is I think I've
already read the book before.

00:02:12.637 --> 00:02:14.948
This might be, like,
another version of it.

00:02:14.948 --> 00:02:16.470
But I pretty much read the story,

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.775
but it was a while ago
so I've sorta forgot it

00:02:18.775 --> 00:02:20.787
so it will be like reading a new book.

00:02:20.787 --> 00:02:23.271
- Okay, so this one is one
that she has read before.

00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:25.775
That can happen when you
have a voracious reader

00:02:25.775 --> 00:02:27.750
who reads everything in the school library

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.237
and spends their allowance every month

00:02:30.237 --> 00:02:32.111
at Half-Price Books.

00:02:32.111 --> 00:02:33.987
But you did say that you liked it

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.527
the first time you read it, right?

00:02:35.527 --> 00:02:37.443
- So they did a good job
matching your interests.

00:02:37.443 --> 00:02:39.711
And if this sounds interesting to you,

00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:40.837
if you really like reading,

00:02:40.837 --> 00:02:42.114
this is something you might consider.

00:02:42.114 --> 00:02:43.586
They have it for kids,

00:02:43.586 --> 00:02:45.748
younger kids, kids Ximena's age,

00:02:45.748 --> 00:02:47.448
teenagers, and for adults.

00:02:47.448 --> 00:02:49.447
They'll pick out books
they think you'll like,

00:02:49.447 --> 00:02:50.936
so it's an interesting idea.

00:02:50.936 --> 00:02:53.016
They do charge you more than the price

00:02:53.016 --> 00:02:54.535
on the back of the book, of course,

00:02:54.535 --> 00:02:56.057
because they have to do the shipping

00:02:56.057 --> 00:02:57.810
and they have to make
some money off the deal,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.911
so it's maybe about twice the price

00:02:59.911 --> 00:03:01.107
of what you would pay for the book

00:03:01.107 --> 00:03:02.871
if you went and picked it up yourself.

00:03:02.871 --> 00:03:04.276
Okay, Roxanna.

00:03:04.276 --> 00:03:06.146
Roxanna's monthly subscription box

00:03:06.146 --> 00:03:07.551
is called Threaded Canvas

00:03:07.551 --> 00:03:10.080
because there's threads involved, right?

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.066
And there's art, so it's canvas.

00:03:12.066 --> 00:03:13.886
Please go ahead and tell us about it.

00:03:13.886 --> 00:03:17.396
- Well it's basically a box that comes

00:03:17.396 --> 00:03:20.690
and you, um, they have different artists,

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.670
art from different artists,

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.318
and then really, like they
go and they put on, like,

00:03:25.318 --> 00:03:28.744
a postcard or a little button,

00:03:28.744 --> 00:03:30.410
or just a piece of paper,

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.766
or on a t-shirt.

00:03:32.766 --> 00:03:34.878
- Yes, which is very nice.

00:03:34.878 --> 00:03:38.599
Now this one, they don't
customize it to you by the artist.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.921
I think everyone gets
the same box every month.

00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:44.573
They do customize it by t-shirt size.

00:03:44.573 --> 00:03:46.353
And you said these
t-shirts have been good?

00:03:46.353 --> 00:03:47.951
- Yes.
- She really likes them,

00:03:47.951 --> 00:03:50.108
that's pretty much all she's wearing now,

00:03:50.108 --> 00:03:51.712
are the t-shirts she's collected

00:03:51.712 --> 00:03:53.187
every month from these boxes.

00:03:53.187 --> 00:03:54.430
You said they're soft?

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.067
And they're loose-fitting
how you like them?

00:03:56.067 --> 00:03:56.868
- Yeah.

00:03:56.868 --> 00:03:58.782
- Yeah, so this has
been a really good deal.

00:03:58.782 --> 00:04:01.853
If you've tried to shop
for a teenager for clothes,

00:04:01.853 --> 00:04:03.345
this is a two in one deal for you.

00:04:03.345 --> 00:04:05.022
I'm gonna show some of these things.

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:06.573
Now, what else comes in the box.

00:04:06.573 --> 00:04:08.151
They do tell, this was back from December,

00:04:08.151 --> 00:04:09.804
they do tell you about the artists

00:04:09.804 --> 00:04:12.055
who have done the artwork on the shirt

00:04:12.055 --> 00:04:13.513
and the other things.

00:04:13.513 --> 00:04:15.151
If you want to order additional things,

00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:16.105
they give you the price.

00:04:16.105 --> 00:04:17.208
Because you might find something you like

00:04:17.208 --> 00:04:18.722
and want to order for your friend.

00:04:19.902 --> 00:04:22.187
In the December box, here is a bookmark.

00:04:22.187 --> 00:04:23.452
Very pretty.

00:04:24.462 --> 00:04:26.338
And a postcard.

00:04:27.284 --> 00:04:28.932
And Roxanna mentioned,

00:04:28.932 --> 00:04:32.388
if you like pins,
dragonfly pin, pretty cool.

00:04:33.166 --> 00:04:36.050
They also include a large print,

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.319
which is very nice to put on your wall.

00:04:38.488 --> 00:04:39.924
And my favorite,

00:04:39.924 --> 00:04:41.912
they throw in a piece of candy!

00:04:41.912 --> 00:04:43.490
Roxanna, you haven't eaten this one yet,

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:44.934
since December, can I have it?

00:04:44.934 --> 00:04:46.455
- [Roxanna] Sure.
- Thanks!

00:04:46.455 --> 00:04:47.837
The Threaded Canvas subscription

00:04:47.837 --> 00:04:49.475
is a little more each month

00:04:49.475 --> 00:04:51.611
than the book subscription.

00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:52.968
I don't want to say exact prices here

00:04:52.968 --> 00:04:54.674
because it was a present for them,

00:04:54.674 --> 00:04:56.092
but I can tell you that if you sign up

00:04:56.092 --> 00:04:58.716
for a longer term, you
do get a better price

00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:01.087
than if you do month-to-month
or just thee months.

00:05:01.087 --> 00:05:03.347
So, you guys have been pleased
with what you've gotten?

00:05:03.347 --> 00:05:05.055
- Yes, definitely.
- Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes.

00:05:05.055 --> 00:05:07.146
- Do you think this was a good gift

00:05:07.146 --> 00:05:09.188
compared to just getting one

00:05:09.188 --> 00:05:11.672
kind of more expensive
gift at Christmas one time?

00:05:11.672 --> 00:05:12.787
You like this better?

00:05:12.787 --> 00:05:14.585
- Yes.
- I think so, yeah.

00:05:14.585 --> 00:05:16.130
- Well that speaks pretty highly

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:18.475
of at least these two
monthly subscription boxes.

00:05:18.475 --> 00:05:19.995
We do others that we've reviewed,

00:05:19.995 --> 00:05:21.447
usually food items, right?

00:05:21.447 --> 00:05:23.623
Food and geeky stuff,
and those are fun too.

00:05:23.623 --> 00:05:25.335
So, it's a nice gift idea

00:05:25.335 --> 00:05:27.089
that keeps on giving month after month.

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:28.471
We'll have links to both of these

00:05:28.471 --> 00:05:29.743
down below this video,

00:05:29.743 --> 00:05:31.945
and if you're interested
in finding out more

00:05:31.945 --> 00:05:34.328
about Roxanna's opinions in depth

00:05:34.328 --> 00:05:36.086
of her Threaded Canvas boxes...

00:05:36.086 --> 00:05:38.153
How many videos do you
have up, two or three?

00:05:38.153 --> 00:05:41.207
- I've just put up January,
so I'm a little bit behind.

00:05:41.207 --> 00:05:43.504
- One, but at least there's one video

00:05:43.504 --> 00:05:45.567
over on Roxanna's YouTube channel,

00:05:45.567 --> 00:05:47.344
YoSoyRoxanna.
- Mm-hmm.

00:05:47.344 --> 00:05:49.066
- I will put a link to
that down below as well.

00:05:49.066 --> 00:05:51.294
So if you'd like to see
her describing in detail

00:05:51.294 --> 00:05:53.245
about when she first opened up the box

00:05:53.245 --> 00:05:55.060
and her impressions, go check that out.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:57.344
We'll give you more gift
ideas in future videos.

00:05:57.344 --> 00:05:59.085
Toy reviews, other types of videos.

00:05:59.085 --> 00:06:00.350
You can keep checking back for those

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.069

I'll eat this lollipop and you will...
