00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.149
\f0\fs28 \cf0 Imagine learning for the first
eighteen years of your life that the earth

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:06.960
is flat. All through elementary school and
high school you grow up hearing about the

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.759
flat earth we live on and doing boring flat-earth
physics homework and then (if you're lucky

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.129
enough) you get to college and PSYCH!
\f1 for the first time they show you a globe

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:17.119
and say "sorry for lying, the earth is actually
round".\

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.970
\
Well, this is, unfortunately, exactly what

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.029
we do with\
\

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.880
1) Gravity\
You probably learned that objects attract

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.630
each other based on their mass so you probably
grew up thinking that light can't possibly

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.630
be affected by gravity because light is massless.
I know I did. Well guess what? The source

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:38.290
of gravity is not mass - it's energy and momentum,
which light certainly has (of course, regular

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.710
matter does too). So not only does light get
bent passing by a star or planet or black

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.000
hole, but light attracts the planet or star
or black hole in return (to be sure, it's

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.280
only a very very small amount. But a small
amount is not zero). Anyway, the point is

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.980
that Newton's law of gravitation is just an
approximation - good enough to get us to the

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.170
moon, but not perfect. General relativity
is better.\

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.170
\
2) Special Relativity\

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.210
Speaking of the moon, you probably also learned
that if a sheep is moving 2 mph relative to

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.190
a train and that train is moving 2 mph in
the same direction relative to the ground,

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.460
then the sheep is moving four mph relative
to the ground. 2mph+2mph=4mph, right? FALSE.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.190
Experiments in special relativity have confirmed
that velocities don't simply add together

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:22.940
and so the sheep will in fact be moving very
very ever-so-slightly slower than four mph

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.820
relative to the ground. And the formula that
correctly predicts this deviation from just

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:34.229
adding the velocities is (v1+v2)/(1+v1*v2/c^2).
It's not a very big effect, but then again,

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.040
the earth looks pretty flat, doesn't it?\
\

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.640
But the earth isn't flat: if I walk 10,000km
away from my cat, and you continue on walking

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:48.800
10,000km more, you're NOT 20,000km away from
my cat. You're just 12,750km away\'85 in fact,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.159
the farthest on earth you can get from ANYTHING
on earth is 12,750km. It's the "earthly distance-limit",

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:59.420
though we normally call it the diameter of
the earth. And similarly, when you try to

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:05.000
add two velocities together, there's a "cosmic
speed limit" of 300,000,000m/s - that is,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
the speed of light.\
\

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.149
So, just because to our eyes the earth looks
flat, velocities look like they simply add

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.519
together, and light looks like it doesn't
attract gravitationally, is that an excuse

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:37.390
to mislead ourselves and our children about
the true nature of things?}
