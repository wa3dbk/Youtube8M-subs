00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:10.469
THE TALE OF
MR. JEREMY FISHER

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:11.469
BY
BEATRIX POTTER

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.930
FOR
STEPHANIE

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:25.750
FROM
COUSIN B.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.580
Once upon a time there was a frog called Mr.
Jeremy Fisher; he lived in a

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.320
little damp house amongst the buttercups at
the edge of a pond.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.760
The water was all slippy-sloppy in the larder
and in the back passage.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.079
But Mr. Jeremy liked getting his feet wet;
nobody ever scolded him, and he

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:47.809
never caught a cold!

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:51.239
He was quite pleased when he looked out and
saw large drops of rain,

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.239
splashing in the pond--

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.700
"I will get some worms and go fishing and
catch a dish of minnows for my

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.550
dinner," said Mr. Jeremy Fisher. "If I catch
more than five fish, I will

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.011
invite my friends Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise
and Sir Isaac Newton. The

00:01:06.011 --> 00:01:10.090
Alderman, however, eats salad."

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:14.830
Mr. Jeremy put on a macintosh, and a pair
of shiny goloshes; he took his

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.740
rod and basket, and set off with enormous
hops to the place where he kept

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:19.740
his boat.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:25.079
The boat was round and green, and very like
the other lily-leaves. It was

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.529
tied to a water-plant in the middle of the
pond.

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:33.389
Mr. Jeremy took a reed pole, and pushed the
boat out into open water. "I

00:01:33.389 --> 00:01:37.200
know a good place for minnows," said Mr. Jeremy
Fisher.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.090
Mr. Jeremy stuck his pole into the mud and
fastened the boat to it.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:46.090
Then he settled himself cross-legged and arranged
his fishing tackle. He

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.109
had the dearest little red float. His rod
was a tough stalk of grass, his

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:55.929
line was a fine long white horse-hair, and
he tied a little wriggling worm

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.869
at the end.

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.490
The rain trickled down his back, and for nearly
an hour he stared at the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.490
float.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.109
"This is getting tiresome, I think I should
like some lunch," said Mr.

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.789
Jeremy Fisher.

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.951
He punted back again amongst the water-plants,
and took some lunch out of

00:02:11.951 --> 00:02:12.951
his basket.

00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:17.450
"I will eat a butterfly sandwich, and wait
till the shower is over," said

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.360
Mr. Jeremy Fisher.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.090
A great big water-beetle came up underneath
the lily leaf and tweaked the

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.090
toe of one of his goloshes.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.420
Mr. Jeremy crossed his legs up shorter, out
of reach, and went on eating

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.420
his sandwich.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.390
Once or twice something moved about with a
rustle and a splash amongst

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.330
the rushes at the side of the pond.

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.860
"I trust that is not a rat," said Mr. Jeremy
Fisher; "I think I had better

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.780
get away from here."

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.580
Mr. Jeremy shoved the boat out again a little
way, and dropped in the

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:54.840
bait. There was a bite almost directly; the
float gave a tremendous

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.840
bobbit!

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.650
"A minnow! a minnow! I have him by the nose!"
cried Mr. Jeremy Fisher,

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.410
jerking up his rod.

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.760
But what a horrible surprise! Instead of a
smooth fat minnow, Mr. Jeremy

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.330
landed little Jack Sharp the stickleback,
covered with spines!

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.730
The stickleback floundered about the boat,
pricking and snapping until he

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.870
was quite out of breath. Then he jumped back
into the water.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.580
And a shoal of other little fishes put their
heads out, and laughed at

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:31.040
Mr. Jeremy Fisher.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.150
And while Mr. Jeremy sat disconsolately on
the edge of his boat--sucking

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.510
his sore fingers and peering down into the
water--a _much_ worse thing

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.490
happened; a really _frightful_ thing it would
have been, if Mr. Jeremy had

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.810
not been wearing a macintosh!

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:53.080
A great big enormous trout came up--ker-pflop-p-p-p!
with a splash--and

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:58.511
it seized Mr. Jeremy with a snap, "Ow! Ow!
Ow!"--and then it turned and

00:03:58.511 --> 00:04:01.130
dived down to the bottom of the pond!

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.069
But the trout was so displeased with the taste
of the macintosh, that in

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.490
less than half a minute it spat him out again;
and the only thing it

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:13.459
swallowed was Mr. Jeremy's goloshes.

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.060
Mr. Jeremy bounced up to the surface of the
water, like a cork and the

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.810
bubbles out of a soda water bottle; and he
swam with all his might to the

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:22.401
edge of the pond.

00:04:22.401 --> 00:04:25.949
He scrambled out on the first bank he came
to, and he hopped home across

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:30.199
the meadow with his macintosh all in tatters.

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:37.469
"What a mercy that was not a pike!" said Mr.
Jeremy Fisher. "I have lost

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:41.460
my rod and basket; but it does not much matter,
for I am sure I should

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.460
never have dared to go fishing again!"

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:48.749
He put some sticking plaster on his fingers,
and his friends both came to

00:04:48.749 --> 00:04:53.710
dinner. He could not offer them fish, but
he had something else in his

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:54.710
larder.

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.050
Sir Isaac Newton wore his black and gold waistcoat,

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:04.080
And Mr. Alderman Ptolemy Tortoise brought
a salad with him in a string

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.539
bag.

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:09.860
And instead of a nice dish of minnows--they
had a roasted grasshopper

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:15.449
with lady-bird sauce; which frogs consider
a beautiful treat; but _I_

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:19.419
think it must have been nasty!

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:21.110
THE END
