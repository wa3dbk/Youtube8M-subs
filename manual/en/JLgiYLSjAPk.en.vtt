00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:05.049
Hello! Today in my review

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.220
will be comparison of the two models of watches

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.220
Casio AQS810W

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:16.289
and Casio AQS800W

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.729
I've already made a review of this model

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.300
AQS810W

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:28.579
Therefore

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.519
I wont repeat the technical specifications of watches

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.220
Just want to show

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.500
why sometimes there is a desire to do reviewes of watches

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.100
When I ordered this model

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.720
I focused only on design

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.340
And didn't imagine that

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.820
in real life the models will differ not only in design

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.300
but in size too

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.320
When you look at photos online

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:59.960
you may not notice it

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.420
There is size in the description not always

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.980
Or you can forget to read this information

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:07.840
The both models include the same modules

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.020
I can show you if you're interested

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.500
Unfortunately the inscription is hard to see

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.680
I will read

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.730
There is a module 3208

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:28.470
In this model 5208

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.070
They are identical

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.740
You can understand it due to location of hands

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.600
and location of digital part

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.100
But the watches have different size

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.720
The diameter of this model is 44 millimeters

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.800
And this one is 48 millimeters

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:49.940
Thickness is varies too

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.660
The thickness of this model is 15 mm

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.780
This one is 12 mm

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.620
Maybe a little more

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.200
This difference is visible immediately

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.610
I'll show you how watches look on the wrist

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:16.239
When you have the opportunity to see the review

00:02:17.169 --> 00:02:20.429
it can help you to decide

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:23.319
which model to buy

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.580
This model looks quite compact

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:31.459
I don't want to say that

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.619
it's small

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:36.109
but less than the second

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:40.129
Let's look at the model 810

00:02:50.799 --> 00:02:53.969
As you can see

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:56.769
body looks more brutal

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.120
and resembles in body of Q-Shock seria

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:08.979
Look

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:12.939
Also, I will show backlight

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:15.749
There are other colors of this model

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:17.749
Not only orange

00:03:17.749 --> 00:03:21.649
There are also with a white digitals

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:25.299
But I've chose this

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:28.799
I will show how backlight is working

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:32.129
The watch has lumo

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:33.629
As you can see

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.149
In one model hands glow on the dark

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:40.829
In another one digitals are coated with lumo too

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.759
I will show backlight

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:46.879
Only the numeric part is lighting

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:50.360
In both models the same

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:57.129
It is not surprising because those models have included the same modules

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.220
I have this model in this color

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.069
Only the last figures differ

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:09.999
810-3

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:12.289
The color is khaki

00:04:12.289 --> 00:04:17.489
Hour hand is orange

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:28.009
Design looks different

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.140
I don't now which design you prefer

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:33.279
Also

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:35.639
Interestingly

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:38.370
The inscription "Illuminator" is written here

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.590
But there is not such inscription

00:04:41.660 --> 00:04:45.040
despite the identical models

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:48.200
I want to add that

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.560
Both models are charged by solar energy

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:54.120
There are batteries inside

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.480
And photocell is located on the front of the dial

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:01.579
It charges the battery

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:04.229
I also want to show

00:05:04.229 --> 00:05:06.460
the process

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:09.640
how the watches choose the right time automatically

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.180
Now the watch has another timezone

00:05:12.189 --> 00:05:16.249
When we will choose our timezone

00:05:16.249 --> 00:05:20.140
the watches will make right time

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.160
Its looks interesting

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:32.960
This process looks so

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.080
The power of robotics as it called

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:47.130
I will put link on full review of this model

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:50.040
in the discription

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:53.110
I've made video with description of features already

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.990
and wont do it again

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.689
Thank you for attention!

00:06:00.689 --> 00:06:03.749
Choose the model you like
