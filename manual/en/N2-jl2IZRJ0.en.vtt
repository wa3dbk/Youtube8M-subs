00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.080
Did you know that the passing of the plate or the
collection of offering hasn't always

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.949
been a standard feature of Sunday morning worship. Surprised? Me too.

00:00:15.949 --> 00:00:18.029
That's what we're talking about the
offering plate

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:25.029
on this episode Chuck Knows Church [fun intro music]

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.419
Passing the plate is a way the ushers 
on Sunday come around

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:46.860
and collect the gifts of the church
and it's not always a plate actually

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.470
could be a basket

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:55.600
or a.. wooden box I suppose. uh,..

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.360
a tambourine? Really?

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.660
Alright, I guess if

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.660
you can put money in it
an usher can pass it.

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.970
It's hard to imagine but passing the
plate wasn't always necessary to

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.090
financially support the church

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.810
not until the late eighteen hundreds did
church's actually count on voluntary

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.100
contributions to keep their doors open.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.810
You see, just like it was in Europe the new
government of colonial America

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.970
established sanctioned and financially
supported the church.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.620
Colonist couldn't see it any differently.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.200
[some refined English voice] "a prosperous  society depends upon

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.870
having citizens of good character."

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.260
and where else would this

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.890
good character come from, but the church.
groups

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.420
Except in eighteen thirty three

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.730
Massachusetts became the last state to
rescind its religious taxes, so by then

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:56.030
congregations in the United States had
to rely solely on their members for

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.940
financial support.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.280
Pastor came up with all sorts of ways to
survive the free market of the

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.890
nineteenth century America.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.060
uh... for example many churches actually
sold a pew to their members.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.909
That way congregants could sleep in

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:12.810
come to church late

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.209
and still have a good seat.

00:02:16.209 --> 00:02:17.669
Then after the civil war

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:20.089
something new became popular

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:23.399
pastors began teaching the biblical
principle

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:24.949
of tithing.

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:26.689
God gives unto us.

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:33.689
and we give back to God 1/10th of all
that is blessed us with.

00:02:34.179 --> 00:02:36.989
Just like that.

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.969
An act of worship

00:02:38.969 --> 00:02:40.689
and commitment to God.

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:46.389
That sounds like the right answer, still it'd

00:02:46.389 --> 00:02:52.029
be nice to sleep in a little on Sunday. Oh well..

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:53.489
to learn more

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.279
ask your pastor.

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:59.859
Tell the Chuck sent ya.

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:05.529
It's not always a plate actually.. 
let me try one more time..

00:03:05.529 --> 00:03:10.019
and collect the gifts to the church..

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.569
not always plate actually..

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:14.989
[laughing behind camera] hahahahahahaha

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:16.589
sometimes it's.. haha

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:17.610
uh...

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.070
It's a basket in your eye.
