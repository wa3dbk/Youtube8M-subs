00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.860
G'Day there Scotty Boxa here and I am going to show you one of my all time favorite 

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:19.979
summer treats

00:00:19.979 --> 00:00:20.770
which is

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:23.040
Vodka infused watermelon

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.459
basically you dont need much for this, all you really need is a bottle of your favourite vodka

00:00:28.459 --> 00:00:29.960
a watermelon and a knife to cut a hole in it with

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.340
a spoon to scoop it out, somewhere to put the scoops, and a towel.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:35.970
First up

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.500
basicly get the towel and wrap it around the base of the watermelon to keep it 
in the world on

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.710
from rolling everywhere.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.120
You basically cut a hole in the top of the watermelon the size of the spoon or the neck of the bottle.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:52.120
you cut that out

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.610
then you get your spoon

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.730
and scoop the

00:00:58.730 --> 00:00:59.670
top out

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:06.670
and scoop a little bit of the insides out as well as some of the juices

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.090
Get your bottle of Vodka

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.840
basically

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.970
Roll your watermelon forward, so you don't spill to much. And put it in

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:18.930
and leave it up side down, now leave it like that 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.539
for about four

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.790
six, twelve hours, sometimes over night will be best as long

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.259
as you get most of the vodka

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:30.099
into the watermelon, depending on the size of your watermelon and how juicy your watermelon is

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:34.670
will depend on how it absorbs into it

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:40.550
so we will let that sit, and we will come back later and see how its gone.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.660
Its been about 12 hours since I put the bottle in, and its just about all of

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.080
it has been taken up

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.560
into the watermelon which is great, thats what we wanted. 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.339
So now what we need to do is chill it in the fridge for a little while and chop it up.

00:01:57.339 --> 00:02:01.810
Now that we have the chilled vodka infused watermelon, its time to cut it up and eat it.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.049
So first we'll just cut it straight down the middle.

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:13.049
There may be alot of juices because it dose have extra in it (sit that half over here)

00:02:14.079 --> 00:02:18.429
And we'll cut this in half again

00:02:18.429 --> 00:02:21.179
Its very juicy 

00:02:21.179 --> 00:02:23.589
Now don't forget these juicy's

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:30.589
are not just watermelon juices. 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:39.639
Now time for the taste test

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:41.239
it is good

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:42.359
really good

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:48.580
Now don't forget to keep this away from the kids, because we don't really want them running around drunk.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:53.769
And please drink responsibly 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.859
mmm really good.
