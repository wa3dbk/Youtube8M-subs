00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.410
not until the aftermath of World War
Two and its atrocities

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.700
did issues concerning civil liberties
and human rights

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.990
once more gained worldwide attention at
that point

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.210
there was political resolve and popular
support

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.930
to have stronger monitoring and
enforcement of minimum

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:28.039
international standards of human rights.
The United Nations was formed in 1948

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.690
and one of its first acts was the
adoption

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.059
the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights, it established a fundamental set of

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:37.819
standards

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:42.719
for countries to follow, however the
declaration was limited

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.979
in the individuals could not enforce
these rights against governments

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:51.839
at the same time as the United Nations
declaration was being written

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:55.039
there was a movement in europe to
identify and

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:59.200
instituted charter a fundamental rights
and freedoms

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.610
the International Committee of the
movement for european unity

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.710
organized a congress in 1948

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.180
at which result there's a body
representing different states

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.380
be established with the remit to draught a
charter

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.070
charter of rights

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:20.110
this charter, based on the United
Nations Declaration

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.970
was adopted as the European Convention
on Human Rights

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.259
by the Council of Europe in 1950

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:32.880
and was ratified by the United Kingdom
in 1951

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.320
however petition by individuals to the
European Court of Human Rights in

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.210
Strasbourg

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.560
was not allowed by the United Kingdom
government until 1966

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.640
the granting of the right individual
petition

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.930
subsequently resulted in Britain
becoming one of the country's with most

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:52.310
cases before the court

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.360
the increasing awareness of human rights
in the United Kingdom

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.710
and the growth of a rights culture may have
been partly responsible for these large

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:01.439
numbers

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.700
the fact that the United Kingdom did not
have a bill

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.700
or charger a bright embedded in its
constitution may

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.700
also have resulted in more cases being
taken to europe

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.140
because at the absence relevant
legislation

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.650
to redress wrongs in this country

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.770
a movement grew through the nineteen
eighties in nineteen nineties

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:25.540
the incorporation of the European
Convention on Human Rights

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:30.319
into domestic law and the labor party
included a promise to do this in their

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.290
manifesto

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.630
prior to the 1997 general election the
outcome

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.099
was a white paper entitled rights
brought home

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:44.599
the human rights bill, following the
publication of this bill

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.730
the human rights act was enacted in 1998
