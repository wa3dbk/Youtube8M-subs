00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.910
Hi this is Gary with MacMost.com.

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:09.200
On today's episode let's look at how you can
type special characters on your Mac.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.890
Let's look at how to type all sorts of special
characters.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.360
Anything that is not standard on your keyboard.

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.039
We'll start at the beginning here with simple
variations of characters usually with accent

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.710
marks and such.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.120
In Yosemite, and Mavericks before it, it is
very easy to type these.

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.610
All you need to do is pick the root letter,
like say an e, and instead of tapping it on

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:32.520
the keyboard tap and hold down.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.020
You get this little menu here of all the different
variations.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.530
Then you can use the number underneath it
to get the one you want.

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.199
So, for instance, I can tap 1 on the keyboard
and I get that.

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.149
I could have also selected it with the cursor
to get it.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.100
So it is very easy to do that with any character
like for instance a Y or Z.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.940
Anything that has got a special variation
will pop-up with this.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.379
You don't have to remember any special keyboard
combination or go to any special place to

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:04.379
get it.

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.830
So for most text that you need to type in
most languages that use Latin characters you

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:12.810
can very quickly get these special characters
that way.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.980
Now if you've used Macs for a while you may
remember there is a special way to bring up

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.080
these characters using the Option key.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.990
For instance I can type Option e and you see
an accent mark appear and it is actually highlighted

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.990
in yellow.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.000
Then I can type the letter e and it puts it
above it.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.580
You can do Option e again and type an a, for
instance.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.030
Now the way to know these is to find a website
that lists them all and kind of memorize them.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.490
But you can also bring up the Keyboard Viewer.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.240
We're going to use both the Keyboard and Character
Viewer a lot in this.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.010
So let's go and add those.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.970
We're going to go to System Preferences, go
to Keyboard, and under the keyboard setting

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.310
select Show Keyboard &amp; Character Viewers in
menu bar.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.980
You will see this icon appear here that allows
us to bring those up.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:03.210
So now we can go and bring up the Keyboard
Viewer and this keyboard is something used

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:07.870
to type when clicking on it with the mouse
but you can also see how it reacts when you

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.200
hold down the Shift key or the Option key.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.430
Here this clearly shows the special keys that
have accent marks.

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:19.799
If I want to add this type of accent mark
to any letter that uses it you can see it

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:22.389
is the i key, Option and i.

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:29.300
So over here I will do Option i and then type
i and I get that character.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:33.529
So it is a quick way to learn these by using
the Keyboard Viewer just to see which key

00:02:33.529 --> 00:02:36.019
turns orange when you hold down the Option
key.

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.480
But what if we wanted to go further than that
and type all sorts of odd characters that

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.889
aren't just simple variations.

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:45.720
Well you can use the Keyboard Viewer here
and say look at the Option key and find things

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.659
like the registered trademark symbol, there's
pi.

00:02:49.659 --> 00:02:54.620
You can do combinations like Option and Shift
and find even more things, like there's the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.650
Apple symbol which is Option Shift and k.

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.790
You can do that but it will only reveal just
a few that you can easily type.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.799
To reveal more you want to go to the Character
Viewer.

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:12.150
The Character Viewer brings up this whole
control panel here that allows you to explore

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.959
all the different characters and all the fonts
on your machine.

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.940
You can select something like say Arrows over
here and see all sorts of different arrows.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:27.159
If you want to type one all you need to do
is double click it and it will insert it wherever

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:29.059
it is you are typing.

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:31.629
Now what is listed here on the left can be
changed.

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:36.680
So if mine looks different than yours all
you need to do is to go to this settings menu

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:42.159
here, customized the list, and you can see
things that you can add or remove from the

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:43.159
list.

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:48.900
There is all sorts of different types of things
that you can add here like Braille patterns,

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.590
different arrows, Dingbats, all sorts of different
things.

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.199
Once you do it changes the menu over here.

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:59.749
So I click on Dingbats and now we see all
these cool little special characters.

00:03:59.749 --> 00:04:05.319
If I select them not only do I get a larger
view over here but I could, as before, double

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:07.430
click to add it.

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:10.180
I can even drag and drop as well.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.550
So there is a lot of different things you
can do.

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:13.510
You can select variations on here.

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:19.120
So I see Webdings here but I can do Webdings
2 going through all the different fonts that

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:23.140
I've got installed on my Mac to see what is
available.

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:26.820
Now you can also search for characters.

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.010
Search works reasonably well.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:33.910
You will notice that some of these characters
include some special text that accompanies

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:37.160
it that will help in searches but others do
not.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:43.820
So, for instance, if we're looking in Webdings
here for things and we look at this and we

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:47.780
want to search for house it doesn't come up.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.140
But we do get a couple other variations and
you can see that's kind of in the name there

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.140
like that.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.910
So sometimes if you are looking for something
special you can find it by searching.

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:04.130
Other times you can't but you do have the
ability to add things into your favorites.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:06.750
You've got your Recently Used, you can see
ones I've recently used here.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:12.880
But also if we go into Emoji here and we want
to add something to Favorites we can drag

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:15.370
and drop into Favorites there and it will
appear.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.530
So now we can easily find it next time instead
of searching for it in here just by clicking

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.690
on Favorites to see it listed.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:27.130
So you can also go in and search for something
and then find variations on it.

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.670
So, for instance, we look under Bullets here
and we want to find some sort of special bullet

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:34.730
character we can see related versions of it
and variations.

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:38.240
So there is different types of bullets.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:42.460
Sometimes variations are very similar to the
one you've got but they are just done with

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:44.050
different fonts.

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:47.310
So you can choose which font you are going
to be accessing.

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:53.330
Say I want to use the Arial one right here
as opposed to using the one inside dingbats.

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.310
You want to be careful when using some of
the characters as they don't always work in

00:05:57.310 --> 00:05:58.470
all applications.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:03.610
For instance these full color ones, like the
Emoji ones, work fine under TextEdit under

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.650
Yosemite.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:11.810
If I were to switch to Pages, and use the
old Pages, you can see I drag and drop and

00:06:11.810 --> 00:06:12.810
it won't work.

00:06:12.810 --> 00:06:14.300
Old Pages won't support that.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:21.030
The new Pages, however, does support it.
