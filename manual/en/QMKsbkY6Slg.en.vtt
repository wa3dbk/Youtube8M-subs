00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.569
senators carl levin and john mccain of
proposed a new version of the national

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.760
defense authorization act and in this
version of it that would allow women to

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.969
be on the front lines of combat

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.009
and this is something that we debate a
little bit yesterday on current and

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:18.500
should women be allowed to be in those
positions when it comes to you know

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.450
participating in the military

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:25.109
and it's interesting i noticed if you
don't actually participate in combat

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.689
u_s_ all women are not able to move up
the ranks in the military so you know

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.890
the circle benefits you don't make as
much money right where idon't think that

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.090
you have to be income that the way that
were

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.960
talking about

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.190
because that's who we have

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.090
when at the highest levels of the
military so but some degree of

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:48.240
combat or field about that battlefield
of operations my guess is that it

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.330
depends on the what area urine and and
so the rules here really uh... murphy

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.949
side read into this trial and so

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.629
you know first of all when you're on the
battlefield what does the front line the

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:03.020
right in iraq if you're in

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.070
car cook would move would where is the
front line in the race so that's a open

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.320
question they're getting bond and i need
the just like everybody else is and then

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:14.830
did you know you're right then this
general stonewall and colonels asoto

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:17.390
women writer lieutenant generals et
cetera

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.580
so they must have a way of interest and
there are certain more cells where women

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.040
are not allowed to participate in combat

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.610
an industrious citizens with
temperatures opinion that

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.270
there not be able to get that certain
promotion for the first ones in the

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.540
first there and they've given outfield
commissions

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.090
mean your commissions offer for props
are for my first officer you're promoted

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.380
for your conduct in a specific

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.990
battle in the former competitive
situations

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.290
i a you may be well talking about more
than that but at the very least cannot

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.400
get a battlefield commission if you're
not engaged in that

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.870
act absolutely right

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:55.509
so i'm not that it was originally right
neanderthal on this uh... the fact that

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.049
because i think my flight was good read
my friend i dot that's all for frontline

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.810
i might is a woman you know an average
when likely to be able to that now on

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.400
the other hand it's a very mistaken
average guy drag my fat ass off also

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.920
should brought a half day on the front
line to see if i happen to have a

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.529
problem now has it

00:02:13.529 --> 00:02:17.319
look everything we discuss and as for
evening we had another debate on this

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:21.009
which is the most object to be on the
fact that uh...

00:02:21.009 --> 00:02:24.559
then i guess you're gone but then so
that a woman you know she sure where it

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:26.029
is as much as i can

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:30.809
and so you know i i'm a little makes
idea and but i do know that i'm a little

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:35.030
worried it for things like navy seal
team six the rangers etcetera

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:39.430
i don't want them to water down the
property she owns because while no women

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:40.820
are making it break

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.190
because once they are not open yet but
they're going that direction once they

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:47.620
open it up at some point somebody's
gonna complain is this is for mission

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.590
though no woman has ever made navy seal
team six animated get tempted to say

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.930
what

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.830
well what if we have let's put ten
thousand i'm totally against i'm totally

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.950
against them watering down standards
just to allow women and write the

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.790
standards are the standards there has to
be a reason for the standards right so

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.989
if there are certain physical tests
thirties the reason for white house

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:09.540
physical tests are in place and i don't
think they should watered down just so

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.019
women can participate and this is the
military we're talking about war and its

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:13.709
serious

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.470
but if a woman has the same physical
capability is a man in the military then

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.310
why wouldn't she be allowed to be in the
front lines uh... i think we we we got

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:25.849
to apply uh... you know one of my hunch
is the military which is not as

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:28.470
susceptible to that kind of pressures

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.529
many other things are

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:33.889
i mean they can be sued they need to do
what they want

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:37.659
so just have a reasonable past and make
sure that the things you have a

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:41.169
reasonable and i i it's not like that
you can live three hundred fifty pounds

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:41.690
cuz thats

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:44.290
probably you know but they'll be
reasonable and

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:46.429
whoever passes it

00:03:46.429 --> 00:03:47.989
gets it that's all there is still

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:51.620
faster than i could be a lot of women e
who would just like

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.829
disney just like the n_b_a_ n_b_a_ can
have it all that role

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.509
there's a woman training reporters she's
quick enough to get open

00:03:58.509 --> 00:03:59.859
and keep them up

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.319
charlotte bobcats either you know
schindler instantly the seven th best

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.040
player on the team that you know great

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:07.180
habit have ac

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.170
i know immensely i'm gonna go back to my
liberal ad-lib roots and i was ok fine

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:14.319
fine and the woman on the front lines

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:19.030
k baad and tell you not doing up water

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.610
all okay
