00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.020
Okay I’m inserting my mold, as you can see
I’m going to burn out here, the wax is no

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:12.980
longer in here and I have an open cavity for
my metal to be pushed into. Tighten those

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:21.670
up. What I normally do is light the torch
while that metal’s still hot, get it ready

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:26.790
to melt again. Your metal cools down while
you’re grabbing your flask, that’s okay

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:53.580
just re-heat it. Keeping it around that metal
as to not boil it, of course use gloves. It

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.309
takes a good amount of time to get used to
what your metal needs to look like before

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:04.489
you insert it into your mold. If it’s not
completely molten then you end up with incomplete

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.960
casting. If it’s overheated of boiled you
end up with a lot of ferocity which is basically

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:23.190
little holes in your casting and many other
issues can arise. Give it a little shake.

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:37.760
Get it moving there. And also take a graphite
stick, and stir it up make sure it’s all

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:49.330
molten and together before you let it go.
Now what I’m going to to do shake it up,

00:01:49.330 --> 00:02:03.770
drop a pin and basically when I let go it’s
going to shoot that metal into my cavity.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:12.569
Sterling silver, usually it takes a few seconds
to cool once it hits that flasks it pretty

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:25.790
much takes its shape and you find out what
you ended up with there. Let it keep spinning

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:32.520
so it can cool naturally. And then we remove
that flask that I just shot that metal into

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.939
and quench it in some water and then pull
out your piece.
