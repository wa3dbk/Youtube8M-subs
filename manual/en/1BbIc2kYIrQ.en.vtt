Hi, I'm Rachel for Expert Village. Now we
are going to do the soft dough; the very oily

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:15.269
dough. We are going to take the 4 cups of
flour and the 2 cups of margarine and start

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.690
mixing them together. The margarine should
be at room temperature otherwise it is a little

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:38.390
bit harder to get it/to mix it together. It
is easier if you kind of pick it up between

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.289
your hands and mix it this way. At the end,
you take everything and mix it making into

00:00:45.289 --> 00:01:07.780
one ball. If you have a mixer you can always
use a mixer. But I prefer to show you that

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:31.500
it is possible to make it with your hands
too. Very very oily dough. So you don't have

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:49.600
to worry if it is sticking to the sides. There
you go it is very soft, it is nice to work

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.110
with and here we go.
