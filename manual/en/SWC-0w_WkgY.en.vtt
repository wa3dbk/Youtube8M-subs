So tonight we're having a fundraising art show to raise awareness 
 and to raise money for the victims in Japan

00:00:23.731 --> 00:00:28.770
and the money that we raise tonight is going to be donated 
 to the Canadian Red Cross which in turn will be donated

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.975
to the Japanese Red Cross for the relief efforts.

00:00:30.975 --> 00:00:36.850
Originally, I did one poster and I started off with the first one, 
 which was the lotus one. That one I created first because

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:43.031
it has a lot of heavy symbolism and it has a lot 
 of meaning about rebirth and compassion which I thought was really

00:00:43.031 --> 00:00:49.853
fitting for the cause because what's happened in Japan they need to rebuild 
 and they need to kind of come out of this again.

00:00:54.381 --> 00:01:00.604
It really hit me emotionally and I really wanted to do something 
 to help them, to help people and kind of express 

00:01:00.604 --> 00:01:08.513
my feelings in a piece of art. The inspiration 
 mainly draws from YouTube videos and online pictures.

00:01:08.513 --> 00:01:18.716
My brother lives in Tokyo and he says he doesn't have any bottles 
 of water. Japan is my country, I was born in Japan, 

00:01:18.716 --> 00:01:27.261
so I really love Japan. I decided to contribute a poster in this event.

00:01:28.491 --> 00:01:33.530
I admire the strength that they have because what's happened 
 in Japan was such a horrible thing and

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:38.824
all the images we see on television of how they're handling it 
 is with just such grace that I can't even imagine.

00:01:38.824 --> 00:01:45.160
In addition to this art show, I created a website, tojapanwithlove.ca, and 
 it's going to grow as kind of a place 

00:01:45.163 --> 00:01:50.880
to go to to buy art that's in 
 support of this cause so it'll continue.
