00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.700
How to Grill the Perfect Steak.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.750
Before you throw your next steak on the barbecue,
see what grilling experts do to ensure that

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.850
it turns out tender and juicy.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:19.460
You will need A gas or electric grill, or
charcoal Soapy water, a brush, and a sponge

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:28.710
Cooking oil Good beef Paper towels Olive oil
Salt and pepper Tongs A meat thermometer Aluminum

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.750
foil Lighter fluid Marinade and a knife.

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:34.820
Step 1.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.699
Clean the inside of your grill and the grate
with soap, a brush, and a sponge, and then

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:41.719
wipe or spray it with cooking oil.

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.510
This prevents the steak from sticking to the
grate and tearing, which will cause it to

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.949
lose juices.

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:48.239
Step 2.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.449
Start with good, grain-fed beef.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:56.409
No matter the cattle breed, USDA prime, grain-fed
beef is the highest rating, followed by choice.

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:02.399
Rib eye, New York strip, tenderloin, top sirloin,
porterhouse, and T-bone are all good cuts

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.399
for grilling.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:07.650
Look for evenly-distributed marbling – the
white streaks that indicate fat.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.250
Without it, your steak won't be as tender
or tasty.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.180
Don't grill a steak less than one inch thick;
it will dry out easily.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.799
The ideal grilling width is one to one and
a half inches thick.

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:19.799
Step 3.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.680
Take steaks out of the refrigerator 30 minutes
before cooking to allow them to come to room

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.680
temperature.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.680
Step 4.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.689
If you're using a gas or electric grill, turn
it to 300 degrees Fahrenheit, or set it on

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.549
medium, and let it heat up for at least 15
minutes with the hood closed.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.570
Step 5.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.670
If you're using charcoal, set the briquettes
over three-quarters of the bowl so they are

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.950
about three times higher on one side than
on the other.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.340
Leave one quarter of the grill empty, which
provides an area with less heat in case your

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.270
fire gets too intense.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.509
Use lighter fluid to start the fire, and wait
until all of the coals are lit before you

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.259
put anything on the grill.

00:01:56.259 --> 00:01:57.369
Step 6.

00:01:57.369 --> 00:02:00.829
Pat the steaks with a paper towel to absorb
moisture.

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:06.069
Then brush both sides with olive oil and liberally
sprinkle them with fresh pepper and kosher

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:07.069
salt.

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:12.160
If you like to marinate your steaks beforehand,
keep in mind that the acidity in most marinades

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.360
makes meat cook faster.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:14.470
Step 7.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.700
Cook the steaks evenly, flipping them four
to six minutes after placing them on the grill.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.160
Use tongs or a spatula to flip steaks.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.190
A fork will pierce the meat, releasing juices.

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.380
Step 8.

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.670
After you've flipped them, wait two to three
minutes.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:35.190
Then, check each steak's temperature by picking
it up with tongs and inserting the meat thermometer

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.040
into the steak's side until it reaches the
center.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:44.490
A reading of 115 means the steak will be rare
when you serve it, 125 to 130 is medium-rare,

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:51.940
140 to 145 is medium, 150 to 155 is medium-well,
and more than 155 is well done.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.430
You can also make a small incision to peek
inside.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.300
Meat continues cooking for a few minutes after
you remove it from the heat.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.300
Step 9.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.610
Remove the steaks and let them rest, loosely
covered with foil, for about five minutes

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.410
before serving to allow the juices to redistribute
throughout the meat.

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.650
For best results, let the steaks rest with
the side that was most recently on the grill

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:13.780
face up.

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.940
Now dig in and enjoy!

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:21.900
Did you know World-famous Wagyu Kobe beef
steaks are lower in saturated fat and higher

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:26.820
in monounsaturated fat – the kind that's
good for you – than some other types of

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.530
steaks.
