00:00:05.094 --> 00:00:08.135
We're at Nirimba College
with OTEN Head Teacher David.

00:00:08.262 --> 00:00:10.267
What are we going to be doing next?

00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:12.690
Jason, now we're going to complete
a short level run.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.553
And what's that all about?

00:00:14.553 --> 00:00:18.736
Normally we'd do a short level run
when we want the reduced levels

00:00:18.868 --> 00:00:23.574
of some points that are too far apart
to get a reading on

00:00:23.574 --> 00:00:25.745
without changing the instrument level.

00:00:25.904 --> 00:00:27.361
So, in this exercise,

00:00:27.361 --> 00:00:30.083
we're going to be starting
at the white peg behind us,

00:00:30.373 --> 00:00:35.087
which we're going to say
is an arbitrary benchmark of RL 10.000

00:00:35.087 --> 00:00:39.030
and we're going to get an RL
on this corner of these sleepers here

00:00:39.782 --> 00:00:43.085
and then move
to the communication pit behind me.

00:00:43.498 --> 00:00:45.053
Then, from the communication pit,

00:00:45.053 --> 00:00:48.210
we'll move back to the white peg
to close the level run.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.472
And are you going to need
some help with this?

00:00:50.472 --> 00:00:51.587
I will.

00:00:51.587 --> 00:00:53.294
I'm your man, let's do it!

00:00:53.748 --> 00:00:57.669
Okay, we're starting our short level run
with Jason on the arbitrary benchmark

00:00:57.759 --> 00:01:00.048
and I'm taking a backsight to that point.

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:21.045
Now taking a foresight to the corner
of the sleepers.

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:05.690
So Dave, now that you've shown us
the short level run,

00:02:05.807 --> 00:02:07.572
what have you got planned next?

00:02:07.572 --> 00:02:10.184
Jason, I thought we'd take
some spot levels

00:02:10.184 --> 00:02:12.515
to allow us to produce a contour plan.

00:02:12.515 --> 00:02:14.599
- Excellent, let's see that.
- Okay.
