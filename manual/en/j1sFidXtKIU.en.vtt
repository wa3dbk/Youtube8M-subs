43.

00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:02.859
Where Did the Earth's Water Come From?

00:00:02.859 --> 00:00:03.859
I'm Fraser Cain, the publisher of Universe
Today.

00:00:03.859 --> 00:00:07.130
This question comes from Andrew Bumford and
Steven Stormont.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:13.169
In a previous episode I've talked about how
the entire Solar System collapsed down from

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.760
a cloud of hydrogen and helium left over from
the Big Bang.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.410
And yet, we stand here on planet Earth, with
all its water.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:24.800
So, how did that H20 get to our planet?

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.780
The hydrogen came from the solar nebula, but
where did the oxygen come from?

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:32.300
Here's the amazing part.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:39.190
The oxygen came from stars that lived and
died before our Sun was even born.

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.870
When those stars puffed out their final breaths
of oxygen, carbon and other "metals", they

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:49.250
seeded new nebulae with the raw material for
new worlds.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.620
We owe our very existence to the dead stars
that came before.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.700
When our Sun dies, it'll give up some of its
heavier elements to the next generation of

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:59.700
stars.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.420
So, mix hydrogen together with this donated
oxygen, and you'll get H20.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:10.391
It doesn't take any special process or encouragement,
when those two elements come together, water

00:01:10.391 --> 00:01:12.250
is the result.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.970
But how did it get from being spread across
the early Solar System to concentrating here

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.550
on Earth, and filling up our oceans, lakes
and rivers?

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.170
The exact mechanism is a mystery.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.990
Astronomers don't know for sure, but there
are a few theories:

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.090
Idea #1: impacts.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.770
Take a look at the craters on the Moon and
you'll see that the Solar System was a busy

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.850
place, long ago.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:45.470
Approximately 3.8 to 4.1 billion years ago
was the Late Heavy Bombardment period, when

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:50.810
the entire inner Solar System was pummeled
by asteroids.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.890
The surfaces of the planets and their moons
were heated to molten slag because of the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.050
non-stop impacts.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:02.400
These impactors could have been comets or
asteroids.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.009
Comets are 80% water, and would deliver vast
amounts of water to Earth, but they're also

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:12.530
volatile, and would have a difficult time
surviving the harsh radiation of the young

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.530
Sun.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.760
Asteroids have a lower ratio of water, but
they could protect that water a little better,

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.349
delivering less with each catastrophic impact.

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:27.709
Astronomers have also found many hybrid objects
which contain large amounts of both rock and

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:28.709
water.

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.810
It's hard to classify them either way.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.410
Idea #2 is that large amounts of water just
came directly from the solar nebula.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.890
As we orbited around the young Sun, it passed
through the water-rich material in the nebula

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:44.540
and scooped it up.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.740
Gravitational interactions between the planets
would have transferred material around the

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.380
Solar System, and it would have added to the
Earth's volume of water over hundreds of millions

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.760
of years.

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:01.080
Of course, it's entirely possible that the
answer is "all of the above".

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.670
Asteroids and comets and the early solar nebula
all delivered water to the Earth.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.360
Where did the Earth's water come from?

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.840
Astronomers don't know for sure.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:18.090
But I'm sure glad the water is here; life
here wouldn't exist without it.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:33.909
Thanks for watching.
