00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.620
Here I am. Chuck, layperson.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.099
In this case, lay speaker.

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.959
The pulpit. Speaking.

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.940
But, then I was afforded the opportunity

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.950
[clears throat] to become

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:23.420
a servant. Thanks to the 2012 conference

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.200
of the United Methodist Church, they
approve the legislation to change the name 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.730
of Lay Speaking ministries to [clears throat]

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.739
Lay Servant ministries. But what does
that mean?

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.109
It means I get out from behind the
lectern as a speaker and I

00:00:40.109 --> 00:00:44.190
become a servant. So what was a Lay
Speaker?

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.280
And why is it now a Lay Servant?

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.449
Why am I wearing a bow tie coat and tails?

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:54.569
Why is the earth round? These questions just

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:59.400
keep piling up don't they? All right, well, I can help you with the Lay Servant questions

00:00:59.499 --> 00:01:00.210
because

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.870
you know that's what we're talking about
on this episode

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.000
of Chuck Knows Church.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
[Cue theme music]

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.460
 [that's me, Chuck]

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.190
Somebody....

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:33.210
Can somebody dust that up? Did you know the United Methodist Church has a Lay

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.800
Servant ministry leadership development
program?

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.040
Now in early Methodism there was a class
leader,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.880
an important position, a spiritual leader
of the people. Then

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.060
there was the office of the Lay Speaker,
originally known as the

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.160
Exhorter, a position that existed
since 1746.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:56.320
Of note, the Exhorter is also the name
a very popular television

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.930
crime drama from the 1980s... Alright, I
made that up.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.119
Exhorters or Lay Speakers

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:09.080
actually did not just preach in the usual sense of that term but they

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.770
organized prayer meetings and spoke with
Methodists about religion,

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.200
gave them encouragement and often
called them to repentance.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.520
Now over the years the office of Exhorter

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.600
transformed into the office of Lay Speaker. But today,

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:28.020
the term Lay Speaker typically
synonymous with preaching

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.720
does not embrace all that is expected
of that position. Now many efforts were

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.480
made to

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.890
change the focus on the Lay Speakers
role to leading,

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:43.239
caring, and communicating but still the
perception persists that lay speaker was

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.489
primarily for stepping into the pulpit

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:48.950
in the absence of the pastor.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:53.060
Then, legislation finally passed at the 2012
General Conference to change

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.310
Lay Speaking ministries to Lay Servant

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.070
ministries. Today Lay Servants are those
members of the church who,

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.519
among other things, feel called to serve
in the local church.

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.730
They're committed to the scriptures and
they support their church's mission and

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:10.380
ministry

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.280
and the doctrine and life of the United
Methodist Church.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:19.750
Lay Servants receive specific training
to develop skills in all these areas

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.610
and much much much much much much

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.290
more. And of course they witness

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.650
to the Christian faith through spoken
communication, which

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.130
was always the focus on the previous Lay
Speaker title.

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.470
Now all of us as a people of God are
called to be faithful

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.700
in their ministry. It's important that
clergy and laity realize that we live

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.819
out our ministry as we have been called

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.400
whether it's in the hospital, at work,

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.870
in the factory, at home, in the church.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.750
But anywhere in the community... anywhere...

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.680
If you'd like to learn more be sure
to ask your pastor

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.170
and tell them Chuck sent you.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.420
