00:00:18.923 --> 00:00:22.916
Beautiful! Beautiful!
Take away my heart.

00:00:27.663 --> 00:00:31.676
My dear! My dear!
Take away my sleep.

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.339
- What do you want?
- I want you.

00:00:34.613 --> 00:00:36.640
You live in my breath.

00:00:37.343 --> 00:00:41.327
You live in my heart beats.

00:00:42.457 --> 00:00:44.311
You live in my thoughts.

00:00:45.234 --> 00:00:49.434
My love! It's very nice!

00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:53.471
How should I praise you?

00:00:53.848 --> 00:00:55.781
You live in my breath.

00:00:56.529 --> 00:00:58.303
What do you think?

00:00:58.887 --> 00:01:00.317
That you have defeated me.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.477
What do you think?

00:01:05.935 --> 00:01:07.712
That you have snatched
Ravi from me.

00:01:09.322 --> 00:01:10.844
What do you think?

00:01:11.514 --> 00:01:14.830
That Ravi doesn't love me now
but you.

00:01:15.153 --> 00:01:17.261
What did one heart
say to another heart?

00:01:17.491 --> 00:01:19.375
Listen to it! Listen to it!

00:01:19.675 --> 00:01:21.647
What is it calling for?

00:01:21.928 --> 00:01:23.693
Listen to it! Listen to it!

00:01:24.185 --> 00:01:26.956
O spring, please come!

00:01:28.663 --> 00:01:30.651
Please come! Please come!

00:01:30.971 --> 00:01:32.798
Please come! Please come!

00:01:33.124 --> 00:01:35.099
What did one heart
say to another heart?

00:01:35.344 --> 00:01:37.295
Listen to it! Listen to it!

00:01:37.545 --> 00:01:39.554
What is it calling for?

00:01:39.813 --> 00:01:41.534
Listen to it! Listen to it!

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:45.503
Ravi, please don't leave me.
I can't tolerate this.

00:01:46.042 --> 00:01:48.639
Why don't you understand?
I love you.

00:01:48.961 --> 00:01:51.498
- Sister, please...
- Don't call me sister.

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:55.156
You have done the great work of saving
the honour of mother and father...

00:01:55.435 --> 00:01:57.406
...for that you have been
applauded by everyone.

00:01:57.607 --> 00:01:58.683
Now your drama has ended.

00:01:59.068 --> 00:02:01.933
I will pull your tongue out
if you utter this word again.

00:02:02.167 --> 00:02:02.836
Shut up!

00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:06.477
My Banno's wedding
procession will arrive.

00:02:06.902 --> 00:02:09.572
Beat the drums!

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:13.443
My Lado's wedding
procession will arrive.

00:02:13.877 --> 00:02:16.548
Beat the drums!

00:02:17.053 --> 00:02:20.358
I will dance all night today.

00:02:20.725 --> 00:02:23.233
Beat the drums!

00:02:23.712 --> 00:02:25.552
Stop it! Stop it!

00:02:25.952 --> 00:02:28.199
Only an Indian wife
can understand this.

00:02:28.661 --> 00:02:29.944
How would you know it?

00:02:30.193 --> 00:02:31.741
You have not performed
the nuptial rounds.

00:02:33.145 --> 00:02:34.411
You have not put vermilion.

00:02:35.655 --> 00:02:37.205
You have not worn nuptial
thread around your neck.

00:02:38.364 --> 00:02:41.439
You can't compete with it by
wrapping a towel around your body.

00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:47.167
My face is like a mirror.

00:02:48.038 --> 00:02:51.208
My face is like a mirror.

00:02:52.664 --> 00:02:56.202
You can see your image in it.

00:02:57.518 --> 00:03:00.996
Raise your glance at it, dear.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.814
And see your destiny in it.

00:03:07.053 --> 00:03:10.243
My face is like a mirror.

00:03:11.838 --> 00:03:15.106
My face is like a mirror.

00:03:20.783 --> 00:03:24.759
Beautiful! Beautiful!
Take away my heart.

00:03:25.212 --> 00:03:29.029
My dear! My dear!
Take away my sleep.
