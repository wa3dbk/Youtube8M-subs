00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.699
I just discovered this amazing gold addon
that automates the most

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:53.049
powerful gold making strategies in the game.

00:00:53.049 --> 00:00:59.710
So far it's made me a
fortune and I suggest you check it out immediately...

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:00.710

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:07.610
It's called Tycoon and it's the most powerful
gold making product

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.610
I've ever used.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.720
PDF guides don't even come close.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.490
In the first day I pulled in over 25,000g
and I didn't even

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:15.430
understand how the addon worked yet.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.430
http://tinyurl.com/WOW-AddonGuide

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.350
Not only does it pull in massive gold in minimum
time, but it makes

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.840
gold making fun again.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.180
Here's just a FEW of the cool things it does:

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:35.540
- Scans the auction house, studies your economy,
and tells you the

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.620
most profitable items in the game.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:39.620
(Insane)

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:47.090
- If that item, for example, is something
that should be gathered

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.210
with mining it will give you an optimized
mining route that leads

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.950
you over the most densely populated mining
nodes in a zone...

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.450
resulting in over 2-3 times more ore than
normal.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:07.159
- It does this for all the major strategies
in the game, like

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:09.250
Gathering, Grinding, and Crafting.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:15.079
- It even knows if there is too much competition
and tells you to

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.809
go for a different item instead.

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:24.700
- You can choose any strategy you prefer,
such as crafting, and

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:45.480
Tycoon will give you a list of 
just Crafting items to make for huge

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:57.230
profit... (and then it goes on to show you
how to 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:09.220
make it and where
to grind materials for even more profit!)

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:29.110
There is a lot more features in this addon
but those are just a few

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:39.140
that really stood out to me.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:47.260
This is going to change the way gold making
is done forever and I

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.019
know you'll like it.

00:03:50.019 --> 00:04:01.420
It just came out and I know a bunch of people
are talking about it

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:06.579
so I suggest checking it out before too many
people get their hands

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:07.579
on it.
