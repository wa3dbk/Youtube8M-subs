Hi, I'm Daniel, and today we're gonna show you how to start a fire without using matches.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.059
which is a pretty handy skill if you're ever lost in the woods or maybe you just

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:11.660
forgot your matches on a campout.

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.750
The three methods are flint and steel, magnifying lens,

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.420
and fire by friction. The first step is
always the same

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.990
no matter which method you use: Gather
combustible materials.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:28.510
Start by collecting tinder -- fine dry
material that easily bursts into flame.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.830
Find about two handfuls of things like
pine needles,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.010
the inner bark of dead branches, dried
grass or slivers of wood

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.659
shaved from a stick with a pocket knife. Then make a separate pile of kindling --

00:00:41.659 --> 00:00:45.530
-- larger chunks of material that burn
hotter and longer than tinder

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.600
but need a little coaxing to start
burning. Look for twigs about the size

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.329
of a pencil.

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.719
Finally, collect fuel -- dead and downed wood

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.489
no bigger around than your wrist that you
can feed the fire over time to keep the

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:59.229
fire burning.

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:04.979
OK, now let's get into the specifics of
our three fire starting methods.

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.399
We'll start with flint and steel. You can buy ready-made

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.859
flint and steel fire starters from an outdoor supply store

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:16.350
or your local Scout Shop. But if you don't have one with you,

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.070
try getting a spark by scraping the blade of your pocket knife against a piece of flint,

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:25.649
a hard, gray rock that fractures easily. Form your tinder into a nest about the

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:26.780
size of a softball.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.939
Hold the flint just above the tinder and
direct your sparks into the tinder.

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:35.640
Nurse the spark into a flame by blowing
gently on the tinder when you see ignition.

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:39.259
Once you have a flame, gradually add tinder and

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.729
then fuel. OK, method number two:

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.390
the magnifying lens. Most of us have played around with using a magnifying glass to

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.340
focus the sun and

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:52.429
make things smoke or at least get hot. Same principle here.

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.319
If you don't have a magnifying glass handy, you can substitute

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:59.780
any curved lens like eyeglasses, camera lenses,

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.499
or the lenses from binoculars or telescopes. Hold the lens so the sunlight

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:05.499
goes through the lens

00:02:05.499 --> 00:02:09.840
onto a point in your tinder. Then wait and wait

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.629
and wait. The technique takes a while but eventually the tinder will smoke

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.069
and then burn. Blow gently to get the flame going and then slowly add kindling

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.530
followed by fuel. And now

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.560
last but not least -- fire by friction. Scouts used to start fires all the time

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.940
using a bow and spindle and you'll need several elements to try this one yourself.

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:36.349
Any curved piece of wood can serve as the bow. You can use a piece of nylon cord

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.379
or shoestring as a bow string. Cords from a tent,

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:45.099
pack or tarp will work too. Use a piece of dry hardwood for the spindle.

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:49.709
The hand block can be another section of hardwood. Carve a depression into the hand

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:50.730
block to fit the top

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:55.390
of the spindle. Finally you need a fire board. Use a dry piece of soft wood

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.939
and whittle a notch into the wood to hold the spindle. Place some tinder under the notch.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.099
Now comes the tricky part. Wrap the bow line firmly around the spindle

00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:09.340
and place the spindle into the fire board. Use the hand block to hold the spindle steady.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.840
 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.319
Begin moving the bow slowly back and forth, gradually increasing the tempo

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.739
until you have a brisk pace going. With the right wood and conditions

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:21.510
you'll create sawdust that should smolder and generate an ember.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:25.170
Transfer the sawdust ember to your tinder and gradually blow the fire to life,

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:25.560
 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.670
adding kindling then fuel to keep the fire burning.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:33.400
Developing any skill takes practice and fire starting without matches is no exception.

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.400
So take some time and work on your fire starting, because this is a survival

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.930
skill you'll be glad to know

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.849
if and when the time comes to start a fire and you find yourself ...

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:44.620
... matchless.
