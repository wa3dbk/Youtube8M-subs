00:00:00.121 --> 00:00:01.653
- There's nothing more classically French

00:00:01.653 --> 00:00:03.325
than an apple tart.

00:00:03.325 --> 00:00:06.297
The French have really
perfected the art of the tart.

00:00:06.297 --> 00:00:08.364
They're beautiful, they're
elegant, and the recipe

00:00:08.364 --> 00:00:09.432
I'm going to share with you

00:00:09.432 --> 00:00:11.313
will have your friends thinking
that you bought this tart

00:00:11.313 --> 00:00:13.170
at a fancy French bakery,

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.308
it's that impressive.

00:00:14.308 --> 00:00:15.306
The first thing you want to do

00:00:15.306 --> 00:00:16.862
is make your tart shell.

00:00:16.862 --> 00:00:17.976
In a food processor

00:00:17.976 --> 00:00:18.789
you're going to combine

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:19.578
flour,

00:00:19.578 --> 00:00:20.461
sugar,

00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:21.181
and salt,

00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:23.085
and give that just a quick pulse.

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:25.476
Then you're going to add
some very cold butter

00:00:25.476 --> 00:00:29.679
and pulse it up just until
kind of a course meal develops.

00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:31.467
Then, in a separate bowl,
you're going to mix together

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:33.231
egg yolks and water.

00:00:33.231 --> 00:00:34.926
Whisk that up just until combined,

00:00:34.926 --> 00:00:36.830
and add that to your dough

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.781
just while the machine is running.

00:00:38.781 --> 00:00:41.822
You'll start to see a
dough beginning to form.

00:00:41.822 --> 00:00:42.998
Once the is formed you're going to take it

00:00:42.998 --> 00:00:44.531
out of the food processor,

00:00:44.531 --> 00:00:45.854
turn it into a ball,

00:00:45.854 --> 00:00:47.828
and then press it into a disk.

00:00:47.828 --> 00:00:50.359
Wrap in plastic and
refrigerate for 30 minutes.

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:52.982
Or, what I like to do because
I'm an impatient cook,

00:00:52.982 --> 00:00:55.049
is put it in the freezer for 10 minutes.

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:56.419
While your dough is firming up,

00:00:56.419 --> 00:00:58.379
then you're going to get
one with making your apple

00:00:58.379 --> 00:00:59.437
compote.

00:00:59.437 --> 00:01:01.329
One of the things that I
love about a classic French

00:01:01.329 --> 00:01:02.188
apple tart

00:01:02.188 --> 00:01:04.277
is the fact that it's
composed of three layers.

00:01:04.277 --> 00:01:05.996
So you have the crisp crust,

00:01:05.996 --> 00:01:08.248
you've got that delicious apple compote,

00:01:08.248 --> 00:01:10.802
and then a layer of cooked apples on top.

00:01:10.802 --> 00:01:13.519
So, unlike American apple
pie where we tend to put

00:01:13.519 --> 00:01:16.166
all of the apples in a pie
shell and then cover it

00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.048
with a crust

00:01:17.048 --> 00:01:20.229
that then bakes and makes those
apples really, really sweet,

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.226
the apple in this tart are exposed,

00:01:22.226 --> 00:01:23.735
so you really want to choose an apple

00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:25.128
that's a little bit sweeter,

00:01:25.128 --> 00:01:26.777
and less on the tart side,

00:01:26.777 --> 00:01:28.634
and for me, that's a gala apple.

00:01:28.634 --> 00:01:29.958
To make the compote

00:01:29.958 --> 00:01:31.653
you're going to put your
apples in a heavy bottomed

00:01:31.653 --> 00:01:32.906
sauce pan,

00:01:32.906 --> 00:01:34.067
to that you're going to add

00:01:34.067 --> 00:01:35.321
some apple juice

00:01:35.321 --> 00:01:36.830
and some water,

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.084
sugar,

00:01:38.084 --> 00:01:39.547
cinnamon,

00:01:39.547 --> 00:01:41.397
and a little bit of lemon zest.

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:43.260
You're going to cover your pot

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.395
and let that simmer for about 10 minutes.

00:01:46.395 --> 00:01:47.951
Once the liquid has evaporated,

00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:49.111
you want to go in with a fork

00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:51.015
and just mash those apples up.

00:01:51.015 --> 00:01:52.687
What you're doing is
basically trying to create

00:01:52.687 --> 00:01:53.848
an apple sauce,

00:01:53.848 --> 00:01:55.450
it'll be a little chunky at first,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.052
but as it begins to kind of cook down,

00:01:57.052 --> 00:01:59.560
and you mash it more,
it'll turn into a beautiful

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.000
apple sauce.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.036
Set that over to the side,
and then you're going to start

00:02:03.036 --> 00:02:05.288
slicing all your apples
for the third layer:

00:02:05.288 --> 00:02:06.797
the top of the apple tart.

00:02:06.797 --> 00:02:10.257
So the secret here is really
to get those apples paper thin.

00:02:10.257 --> 00:02:12.346
You don't need any fancy
equipment, in fact,

00:02:12.346 --> 00:02:15.040
I think it's better to really
cut those apples by hand.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.106
Yes it takes a little bit
of work, but this is really

00:02:17.106 --> 00:02:18.894
the most impressive part of the tart,

00:02:18.894 --> 00:02:21.053
so you do want to take
the time to do it right.

00:02:21.053 --> 00:02:22.609
Just put on some French music and

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:23.770
settle down and get to work.

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.770
(lighthearted music)

00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:36.935
At this point you're going
to take your firmed up dough,

00:02:36.935 --> 00:02:38.212
roll it out,

00:02:38.212 --> 00:02:40.465
and put it into your tart shell.

00:02:44.544 --> 00:02:46.192
Once your dough is all in your shell,

00:02:46.192 --> 00:02:48.352
you're going to take
your cooled apple compote

00:02:48.352 --> 00:02:50.464
and spread it along the
bottom of the tart shell,

00:02:50.464 --> 00:02:52.309
just until you have a single layer.

00:02:53.382 --> 00:02:54.868
Now comes the fun part:

00:02:54.868 --> 00:02:57.260
creating the beautiful apple swirl.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.815
At first when I started to make this tart

00:02:58.815 --> 00:03:00.928
I could figure out how
to get it as perfect

00:03:00.928 --> 00:03:02.345
as the way that the French do,

00:03:02.345 --> 00:03:04.620
and then my husband, who
actually worked in a bakery

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:05.874
when we was about 13,

00:03:05.874 --> 00:03:07.356
came and showed me how to do it, which,

00:03:07.356 --> 00:03:09.446
I had to laugh because the
guy doesn't cook anything,

00:03:09.446 --> 00:03:11.048
and the fact that he knew how to do this,

00:03:11.048 --> 00:03:12.789
I was completely impressed.

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:14.972
You want to have the
pattern of an escargot,

00:03:14.972 --> 00:03:15.831
or a snail,

00:03:15.831 --> 00:03:18.176
if you just keep that in
mind and start at the top,

00:03:18.176 --> 00:03:20.777
and work your way all the
way around to the center,

00:03:20.777 --> 00:03:22.147
you can't go wrong.

00:03:22.147 --> 00:03:24.956
Little by little you just
want to overlap those apples

00:03:24.956 --> 00:03:27.278
going all the way around the shell,

00:03:27.278 --> 00:03:30.064
just until you can't go any further.

00:03:30.064 --> 00:03:32.409
Once you get the very center of the tart,

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:34.429
you'll see, you'll have
a little hole there,

00:03:34.429 --> 00:03:36.473
take the thinnest apple that you have

00:03:36.473 --> 00:03:38.838
and kind of fold it in half
so it creates almost like

00:03:38.838 --> 00:03:40.022
a little rosette,

00:03:40.022 --> 00:03:41.833
you'll see you have a beautiful little

00:03:41.833 --> 00:03:42.878
circle in the center

00:03:42.878 --> 00:03:44.387
that looks kind of like a flower.

00:03:44.387 --> 00:03:45.757
Sprinkle with some sugar,

00:03:45.757 --> 00:03:47.220
and then you're going
to put it in the oven.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.611
Now, at this point you might
be wondering why did I not

00:03:49.611 --> 00:03:51.074
prebake the tart shell,

00:03:51.074 --> 00:03:52.583
and I will be perfectly honest,

00:03:52.583 --> 00:03:53.674
the reason is simple,

00:03:53.674 --> 00:03:54.998
I just hate that step.

00:03:54.998 --> 00:03:56.554
I never really have the time to do it,

00:03:56.554 --> 00:03:59.038
I always feel like it adds so
much more work to a dessert,

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:01.662
so I try to find ways to
get around having to do it,

00:04:01.662 --> 00:04:04.239
and the one way that I find
that works for me everytime,

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.072
is to start your tart in a very hot oven.

00:04:07.072 --> 00:04:09.533
So I'm going to bake this
tart at about 400 degrees

00:04:09.533 --> 00:04:11.066
for about 15 minutes.

00:04:11.066 --> 00:04:12.827
What that's going to do
is bake that tart shell

00:04:12.827 --> 00:04:14.011
really, really quickly

00:04:14.011 --> 00:04:15.543
so that it doesn't get soggy,

00:04:15.543 --> 00:04:16.723
and then I'm going to lower the oven

00:04:16.723 --> 00:04:19.556
to about 350 for the
rest of the cooking time.

00:04:19.556 --> 00:04:22.064
That way it alleviates having
to prebake the tart shell,

00:04:22.064 --> 00:04:25.105
but you still end up with
a really nice, crisp crust.

00:04:25.105 --> 00:04:26.963
Here's the final step of the tart:

00:04:26.963 --> 00:04:28.588
We're going to take some apricot jelly

00:04:28.588 --> 00:04:31.328
and put it int he microwave
just until it's liquified,

00:04:31.328 --> 00:04:34.230
then take a pastry brush
and brush all of your apples

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.973
on the tart,

00:04:34.973 --> 00:04:36.993
just until it has a beautiful shine.

00:04:36.993 --> 00:04:39.571
And what that will do is just
create a really nice sweetness

00:04:39.571 --> 00:04:42.264
and tartness, I think apricot
is a really great flavor

00:04:42.264 --> 00:04:43.750
combination with the apple,

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.163
but you also could use apple jelly too

00:04:45.163 --> 00:04:47.445
if you couldn't find apricot.

00:04:47.445 --> 00:04:49.826
You can serve this tart either
with some vanilla ice cream,

00:04:49.826 --> 00:04:51.660
or some homemade whipped cream.

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:53.226
Either one would be great.

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:55.902
You'll see, if you make this tart,

00:04:55.902 --> 00:04:58.177
your friends and family
will be so impressed

00:04:58.177 --> 00:05:00.267
they'll think you bought it
at a fancy French bakery,

00:05:00.267 --> 00:05:01.498
they'll be ooing and ahhing,

00:05:01.498 --> 00:05:03.819
everybody will not believe
that you made it yourself.

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:05.607
It's that delicious and good.

00:05:05.607 --> 00:05:09.380
(lighthearted music)
