Jaystepher presents

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:13.969
Series 8 Minifigures

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:16.009
Series 8 Minifigures,

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:20.019
set number 8833,

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:24.739
contains an undisclosed amount of pieces, and is recommended for ages five-plus.

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.199
So I guess we get to pick one of sixteen in the pack,

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:29.550
So I guess we get to pick one of sixteen in the pack,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.330
but we don't know what mini-figure it is until we open it up.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:41.330
So let's take a look in here and see what we got.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.010
I didn't get it cut all the way.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:01.010
Some times you got to be careful on what's inside.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:08.470
So it looks like we get a few parts here.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.270
Nothing in the bag.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.510
Well let's see we got....

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.450
It looks like we got some wings here. It looks like we're building some kind of bat person.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:24.450
As a matter of fact, everything's black. So let's see what we got on the form here.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.750
We get to build this guy here. This is number 11.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.390
It looks like he's the bat guy.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.900
I'm taking it but not sure.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.890
Let's put him together and let's see here. It should be very straight forward.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.670
They do give you building instructions but....

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.910
So the clothes are printed on.

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.829
Here's the mini-fig head,

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:55.829
and the head gear.

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.500
And there is, I think the bat guy.

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.760
And there is, I think the bat guy.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.079
Sweet mini-fig.

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.310
It also comes with the stand

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.449
for displaying purposes.

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:15.849
So that is number 11 on the check list.

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:18.719
So that is number 11 on the check list.

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:19.869
So Series 8 Minifigues mystery pack.

00:02:19.869 --> 00:02:22.189
So Series 8 Minifigues mystery pack.

00:02:22.189 --> 00:02:24.599
So Series 8 Minifigues mystery pack.

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:28.929

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:32.709
