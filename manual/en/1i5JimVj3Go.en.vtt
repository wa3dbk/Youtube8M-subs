00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.870
welcome back to students at the centre
week on Jeopardy, Bill

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.549
you have command of the board let's do
student

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.570
centered assessment for 200. A formative assessment method backed by extensive

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.019
research in which students provide each
other with feedback on their schoolwork

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:25.179
in order to deepen learning and increase
achievement.

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.909
Yes, jody. What is self-assessment? [Buzzer Sounds] No, I'm sorry Jody,

00:00:29.909 --> 00:00:32.820
that would be a process of having
students identify strengths and

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.530
weaknesses in their own work in order to
revise and improve it.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.910
Yes, Bill. What is a group project? [Buzzer sounds]

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.680
No, Bill a group project is
collaborative effort in which students

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.670
define roles and team up to develop an
academic project.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.270
Anyone? Anyone? Marcia. What is

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.360
peer assessment. [Bell Dings] Peer assessment that is correct

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.650
Feedback in revision are essential to
learning. Research demonstrates that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:59.080
both the student giving

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.310
and the student receiving the feedback
get deep in their level of learning and

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:03.850
raise their level of achievement.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.619
Interesting, I'll take Student Centered
assessment for 400.

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:13.370
[Noise] The Daily Double. I'll wager it all, Alex.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.780
[Gasping] Wow, okay, very good here it is

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.140
these must be clearly defined and
communicated grounded in the content

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.260
area or discipline

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.740
in order for formative assessment to be
effective. What are criteria and

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.490
standards? [Bell Dings]

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.600
That is correct. You choose again, Marcia.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.240
I'll take Student Centered assessment for
600. This tool

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.290
for offering critique promotes effective
peer feedback between students

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.720
and includes steps such as "ask clarifying
questions"

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.530
and "make suggestions." What is the Ladder of Feedback. [Bell Dings] Yes, Marcia

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.570
you're on a roll. Assessment for 800 Alex

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.909
Excellent. At the end self or peer
assessment,

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:55.420
it is crucial to allow time for this
process so students can incorporate

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.450
feedback

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:59.770
and improve their work. What is revision

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.970
[Bell Dings] Yes, Marcia you mastered the category. It is also important for the teacher

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.060
to provide continuous monitoring and
guidance during both self and peer

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.969
assessment.

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:14.890
That brings us to our final Jeopardy
question. The category

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.209
"Useful Resources" Here's the clue, this
website

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.459
offers current research on key
components of student-centered

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.819
approaches to learning

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:30.819
along with a collection of
student-centered tools and resources.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.670
[Drum plays]

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.500
Let's see how you did. Jody, you wrote

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.980
"students at the center dot org" That's
correct. Bill

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.400
what website did you choose? Students at the center as well

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.770
and Marcia did you come up with students at
the centre dot org?

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:01.980
Yes and with that Marcia, you're our new champion. [Bell Dings] [Music plays]
