00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.340
Hello everybody.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.270
Erik Bryan here, owner of Precision Air &amp; Heating.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:31.350
Since 1995, we have performed well over 250,000
service calls across the valley.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:37.500
We thought, what better way to share our experience
and know-how than answering some common homeowner

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:38.649
questions.

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:42.320
Adam in Phoenix asks, "I have a new air conditioning
system.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.600
So why are some rooms in my home still warmer
than others?"

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.949
Adam, great question.

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.559
Listen, one of the biggest misconceptions
when purchasing a new air conditioning system

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:56.000
is that it is going to correct air flow.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.499
Please understand that a new air conditioning
system has zero to do with the distribution

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:03.300
of air into your home.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.140
Just about every new manufactured piece of
equipment has roughly the same amount of air

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:09.810
distributed.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.960
In all, the distribution of air in your home
is entirely related to your duct system.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.850
Most of the time when you're having a residential
retro-fit of new equipment, you're not being

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.100
contracted to replace your duct work.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.479
The natural assumption is that if "I bought
a new air conditioner, it should blow air

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:26.479
better."

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:27.479
Well it's not.

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.560
It's going to distribute the air roughly the
same as your old one.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.659
What you've bought is better efficiency and
things like that.

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.310
Here's some important things to notice on
some reasons why you might still be experiencing

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.359
some hot spots.

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:39.090
Number 1 is poor insulation.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.990
It is very, very common that in new manufactured
homes for there to be insufficient insulation.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.550
On the older homes as well.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.670
Insulation has settled over time and it's
just the R-values are lower than they were

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.940
when they were installed.

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.170
Vaulted ceilings are a big one.

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.859
It is very difficult in some areas for contractors
who build your home to get insulation into

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:04.590
all of these particular spots on a vaulted
ceiling and it creates a hot spot.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.880
Another big one is broken or kinked duct work.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.160
Keep in mind you might have just replaced
a 15 year old air conditioning system.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.620
Well the duct work inside your attic is 15
years old as well.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.440
It's experienced sagging, fatigue, broken
spots....it might have leaks in it.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:22.030
Those types of things might be contributing
to that as well.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.709
Another really, really big one...and probably
most disguised one...is infiltration.

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.560
When I say infiltration, I'm referring to
any opening in your ceiling or your wall to

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.019
your attic where it is pushing hot air in.

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.890
Outlets, supply registers, can lights....all
of these, if they're not properly sealed provides

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.980
an opening for the hot air in your attic to
find its way into your conditioned space.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.959
Attic ventilation is another big one.

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:53.640
If you don't have proper ventilation in your
attic to expel the 180 degree heat out of

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.450
your attic, that also helps contribute to
the infiltration being forced into your home.

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.319
Probably one of the biggest ones is return
air.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:08.379
Almost every home that we go to, when retro-fitting
a new piece of equipment, is inadequate as

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:10.390
it relates to return air.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:13.460
There's generally only one return-air in the
home.

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:17.090
We like to recommend multiple return airs
in the home.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:22.150
This simply allows the air conditioner to
pull more heat out of your home in multiple

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.549
areas which provides much better balance cooling,
and a much happier customer.

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:29.470
Thank you for sharing your questions.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:35.049
I hope this helps shed some light on keeping
your home operating properly and as efficiently

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:36.380
as possible.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.750

heating, plumbing or home performance needs,
