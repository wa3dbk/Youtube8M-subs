00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.200
Where better to see what truly goes
into designing

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.210
that type of equipment than here, Puma's 
global headquarters

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.230
in Herzogenaurach, Germany

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.070
We came here to meet the company's global creative director

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.240
Torsten Hochstetter

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.060
to find out more about his vision
about the World Cup kits

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.360
he designed and the technology within

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.800
He designed national kits for no less than eight partner teams competing in Brazil

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.670
Algeria, Switzerland, Uruguay, Ivory
Coast, Ghana

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.629
Italy, Cameroon, and Chile, and all
feature new technologies that Puma

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.229
calls Power ACTV

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.810
Thank you very much Torsten for having
us we actually now looking at

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.170
the shirt football players at the
World Cup right now are wearing so what

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.289
is special about that?

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:03.170
Well this jersey, first of all, that's the Italian Jersey that

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.950
Italian Federation will be wearing at
the World Cup and in

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.259
the games and we made sure that the
execution is right for the culture of

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:11.960
the country

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.360
so particularly for Italy it was important
to have some sartorial aspect

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.450
about the jersey suggest the collar line
for example

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.399
but also the badges, you know, this is a
high-definition heat transfer

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:27.380
are lightweight and are really
performance executions

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.170
so do the national teams also have a say
in how their shirts are going to look

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.909
like then?

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.110
Absolutely, we work very closely

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.830
with the athletes but also with the
Federation's, obviously

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.429
and it's important to have that input
and really get the feedback from the

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:44.609
athlete right away

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.159
 Last week I was just coming
back from Coverciano

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.780
which is the actual training facility

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.470
for the Italian team and I was talking to
the athletes, to the coach

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.319
also to the medical staff and get
feedback on how they really feel

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.879
and to make sure that we would
include that feedback into our design

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:06.519
So let us have a look at that special
technology here

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.160
how does it look from inside? 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.540
right let's have a look at the
inside

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.610
now the ACTV technology and as
you can see here

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.650
is anatomically placed silicon print

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.760
and is strategically placed

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.159
on the item so that it really enhances the
movement

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:26.959
of the athletes when doing the
sports, when playing football actually

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:27.670
particularly

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.630
in this case

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.760
 And does it have other effects
like cooling?

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.580
It has the effect of cooling when you
wear it

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:39.250
when you first wear it, but the main

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.510
idea behind the ACTV technology is to
bring back, bring together

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.599
the idea of compression so when
the muscle

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:52.180
fatigues sets in, it really compresses the
muscle

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.900
but in the same time it also has to
support 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.310
attributes to the muscle and also
to the athlete

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:00.210
where it meets

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:04.180
So how long did it take to
actually develop such a shirt?

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.590
The technology is more than two years
when we look at the technology we make

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:09.690
the first research

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.069
So about 2 to 1 and 1/2 years

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.509
before it really can come to life

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.880
Where do you take those ideas from? 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.040
We look at
the sports itself

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.500
We also look at the culture of the sport's
and then make sure that we are able

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.000
with the technologies to support the
athlete to really perform better

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.750
How much just technology really driving
as well the success

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.370
of the football team? What do you think?

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:35.760
 I think it's

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.700
very important because the
athlete wants to be supported

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.800
from a technological perspective, from a
physical perspective

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:45.819
but also emotionally. An athlete wants to
go out and

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:48.079
feel right in the jersey that he
wears.

00:03:48.079 --> 00:03:49.899
So right now this is the most

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.800
technologically advanced shirt we can get for a
football player

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.180
so looking into the future could it
happen that

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.450
the regulator might step in if you're
getting

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.540
far more advanced then perhaps the shirt is
more important than the player?

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.870
We certainly will continue to explore
technology

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.239
and find new ways to help the athletes
perform better

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:15.970
we do by the way have an innovations
team that takes care of that

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.079
and that is going to influence also the
future but

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:22.710
in reality you're looking at the future
right now because that technology the ACTV

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:24.870
technology is an award-winning
technology

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:27.570
that is good for the athlete

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.960
Of course it's called football for a reason and the boots are actually the most

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.010
important weapon

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.310
in a players arsenal

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:43.360
For these shoes, why actually are they in two

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:44.200
different colors? 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:46.659
Well, that's a wonderful story

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:50.050
because it was a former
player

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.389
Rigobert Song, who was the
captain of the Cameroon national team

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:58.099
who at the World Cup in France in 1998

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.259
dared to walk out with two different
colored shoes and 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.639
it was a clear statement of his
passion for his nation

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.810
but also the fun and joy that football
expresses

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.150
And why did you choose pink and blue as colors?

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:14.780
We felt we wanted to 

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:18.220
portray exactly that - the
passion, the joy and the fun

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.340
that goes into football and therefore
we picked these two colors

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.409
Run me through the technology which is 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:25.109
hidden in those shoes?

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.039
These shoes which is EVO power
technology

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.110
we wanted to explore barefoot kicking and

00:05:32.110 --> 00:05:35.970
if we look at the tooling it has a
spine running through

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:39.930
and very high-level of flexibility in both
ways

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.210
for the plate so therefore you really
mimic

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:47.509
barefoot kicking which optimizes power

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:51.270
But they seem to be
also

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.110
having a certain control here in that
part of the shoe?

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.300
 That's right there's a high level of stability

00:05:57.300 --> 00:06:03.090
the lateral side and the upper
material is flexible in a horizontal way

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.030
and therefore this again
enables you to

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.530
have higher level of control or accuracy

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:13.789
as well as power - which really important
is also the 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:17.949
foam that's applied at the
vamp of the shoe

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:23.190
and at the moment of impact it has a
very good distribution a force

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.819
and therefore the moment you strike you have a
very high level of accuracy

00:06:26.819 --> 00:06:30.960
it really gets a player an edge and again
it helps the athlete to perform better

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:34.660
So from the professional athlete to the
excited

00:06:34.669 --> 00:06:39.259
fan that just wants a piece of the
team's magic the science behind sport

00:06:39.259 --> 00:06:41.840
constantly propels everyone forwards
