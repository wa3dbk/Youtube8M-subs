00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:02.339
Okay

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.410
Hi there

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:04.580
good Morning

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.640
good afternoon

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.220
good night

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:11.740
depending on where we are seeing

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.780
here we are again

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.640
for another lesson

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:19.340
My World Tango to you

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.520
What are we going to work today?

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:21.800
the Sanguchito (Sandwich)

00:00:25.814 --> 00:00:27.814
And comes the intro to My World Tango 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.100
Very good at all again

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.090
Today we will work on ...

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.170
Sanguchito

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:51.575
The sanguchito is a classic learning tango

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.130
classic of classics

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.890
I always taught in the first steps

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.620
and there was a person in Spain

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:03.860
who wants to deepen a little sanguchito (Sandwich)

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.100
The sanguchito, whose name

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.970
Sounds funny, sanguchito

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.550
Besides Argentina is the word sanguchito

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:14.980
do not say sandwichito

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.859
say sanguchito

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:18.619
and if they see it written so rare

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.430
'Sanguchito' is because it is here as well.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.210
Then work the sanguchito

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:30.550
but we will see the first part of the foot

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.140
and in an upcoming occasion

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:35.400
We will be working

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.860
driving and we will give some
details on operating

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:41.340
&nbsp;because there are many ways to drive

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:42.573
All are well

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.510
but let's see the pros and cons of the different lines

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.610
Let the feet.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.140
But before passing to feet

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:55.620
I forgot to say one thing

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.890
this is closely related to the spin that work last week

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.850
Here is the twist here on Rosy pansa

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.840
to work that shift because it has much of that

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.080
we do exactly the same.

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:12.719
Man has altered

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:16.349
Tambie women, but it is less marked than that of men

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:18.869
the man of much different

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:21.649
but we will work some sort of rotation

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:24.519
we will transform sanguchito

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:26.959
Is this the Mario, you got hungry?

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:31.549
Yes, I have hunger

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:35.039
let's start over as we did in
rotation

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:39.799
but what we do in the parallel system

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:42.020
open the side to start

00:02:42.029 --> 00:02:46.849
to make a reference to starting
from somewhere

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:48.719
in this case from an opening

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:54.619
we do cross system
where we changed the foot to move forward with the other foot

00:02:56.109 --> 00:02:59.969
Step up here going all Standard

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:06.969
Now the woman goes back to 8 I'll get it this foot

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:11.239
once you've found the foot of it

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.759
let's move on with the other foot

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.460
do the sanguchito (Sandwich)

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:16.849
So we call sanguchito

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:18.780
because as you can see

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.000
remains a sanguchito

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.860
My foot is like a cheese and ham

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:25.655
And I would loaves

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.969
Now when we step back

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:31.990
for now we will do in this address to PCs

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:34.730
and the next we will detail some
more that

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:38.239
Women happen to 8 below

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:41.889
man will turn

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.779
on your left

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:45.779
will gather right

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:47.579
with a woman when she comes

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:49.260
and take this dance.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.720
Let's do it again.

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.389
only the feet.

00:03:52.389 --> 00:03:56.229
let's take our multiple cameras des

00:03:56.229 --> 00:03:57.805
¿Camera 2 is attentive?

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:02.359
¿Camera 3?

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:03.699
we will repeat again

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.339
show only the foot portion

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:08.889
very slowly so they can go
viewing

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.039
let's go step by step braking

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:12.279
and we will go showing it

00:04:12.279 --> 00:04:13.619
Opening

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.999
step left, step back left of the woman.

00:04:16.999 --> 00:04:19.299
sanguchito the right leg
man

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.960
right leg backward woman makes 8

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:24.649
do is sanguchito

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:30.559
back right man

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:35.879
forward eight women and man
carries all the weight on the left leg

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.670
And now while I tread with women.

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:45.499
Work this

00:04:45.499 --> 00:04:46.960
this is the part of the foot

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:52.180
It is very simple, if you already worked driving the above sequences

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.870
may not need to spend the next video

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:56.690
which leave here

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.840
and that's where we'll talk about driving

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.999
we will give important details

00:05:02.999 --> 00:05:06.879
variants that can be made
to give different dynamic.

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:09.080
Practice this

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.939
Anything else you want to tell people?

00:05:10.939 --> 00:05:14.969
if, discuss, ask if they have questions

00:05:20.499 --> 00:05:24.520
Put Like

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.240
Ask

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:28.729
leg so we can answer

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:32.760
ye this was a lesson in

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.200
Mi Mundo Tango

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.490
And he comes the intro

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.880
That in the end will not
