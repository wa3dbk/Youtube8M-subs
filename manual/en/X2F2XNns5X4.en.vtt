Vibracoring: Reconstructing Earth’s past
from sediments

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.730
Narrator: Geologists rely on information from
deep beneath the Earth’s surface to reconstruct

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:17.930
the past.

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.820
As sediments accumulate over time, they create
records geologists use to understand Earth

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.520
history and to predict future processes and
trends.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.750
The most common way to get this information
is to drill a hole in the Earth where sediments

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.980
have been deposited over time.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.760
The sediments drilled are recovered in the
form of a core that will contain an intact

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.760
record of the past.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.760
[Map with explanation: ‘Cores from the Sabine
National Wildlife Refuge study area shown’.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.760
Two cores are shown, each with a Description
and Photo.]

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.590
Core samples are used to assess the geologic
history of an area, such as its geomorphology;

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.390
coastal, marine, and terrestrial processes;
and changes in environmental quality.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:55.500
The type of drilling tool used for cores depends
on how deep and how hard the sediments are.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.539
Vibracoring is one of the tools used in shallow
coastal areas where sediments consist of soft

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.440
sand and mud.

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.229
Hi, and welcome to the U.S. Geological Survey
Coastal and Marine Geology Podcast.

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.000
I’m Matthew Cimitile.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.330
I’m here with two marine geologists, Kyle
Kelso and Nancy Dewitt.

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.679
They are part of the St. Petersburg Coastal
and Marine Science Center’s seafloor mapping

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:17.679
group.

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:22.649
They have taken cores in coastal areas all
around the U.S. Together this team of scientists

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:28.130
analyzes geologic information to reconstruct
Earth history and to predict future trends.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.450
We’ll be talking to them about what it takes
to collect a sediment core using a vibracoring

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.120
rig from a boat platform.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.259
Nancy, can you tell me what we’re seeing
here?

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:46.200
ND: That’s the RV/GK Gilbert, that we use
for seafloor mapping purposes.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.540
What you are going to see today is taking
sediment and vibracores off of the boat.

00:01:50.540 --> 00:02:01.780
KK: It has a nice big deck to hold the tripod
and also to handle all of the equipment that

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.540
is necessary to perform our fieldwork.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.700
ND: We have a captain on the top of the fly
bridge, and we are positioning over the place

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.980
that we’re going to take a sediment core.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.490
In order to do that you have to have a stationary
boat so we have a two-point anchor in this

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.490
situation.

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.500
Sometimes, in rougher seas, you need a three-point
anchoring situation.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:29.609
KK: We are hooking up the pipe to the vibracore
head.

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:34.319
It connects just by a little clamp there,
and then we raise it up and getting ready

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.480
to insert the entire rig into the water.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.489
ND: Rich is raising it up with the crane,
and then we lock the barrel in place so it

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.489
stays vertical.

00:02:44.489 --> 00:02:51.730
KK: The rig will sit on the seafloor bottom
and it‘ll vibrate and penetrate the sediment

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.849
until the head reaches the bottom.

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:01.120
ND: In this situation, this rig is setup for
20-foot barrels.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:04.209
Sometimes you can take it down to 10 feet.

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:10.780
On a manual vibracoring setup, you can use
40-foot barrels to get a continuous record.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.260
The goal is to get a continuous record as
long as possible.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:21.549
Normally, this rig is underwater but since
we are only in about 6 or 7 feet, you get

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:24.250
to actually see the electronic vibracore head.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.239
The black part right there actually shakes
the barrel.

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.950
It liquefies the sediment around the barrel,
which allows the barrel to enter the seafloor.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:45.219
KK: It’s pretty shallow water here but we
are able to collect in water depths in excess

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:46.900
of 200 feet.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.751
We are guiding it now back on to the deck
of the boat.

00:03:53.751 --> 00:03:59.930
You can see the weight of the coring rig pulling
the boat to the side and sometimes when the

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:07.120
core gets stuck in the sediment the angle
of the deck is about 30 degrees in some instances.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.519
You have to make sure you wear closed-toed
shoes.

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:19.550
ND: That’s a two-ton crane that Rich is
operating there, allows us to handle the weight.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:24.060
KK: And the sediment in those barrels do weigh
a lot, I’ll tell you that much.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.810
Tripod is now in place; rinsing it down.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.620
ND: You end up marking the outside of the
barrel.

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:37.530
It is very important which end is up because
we are taking a section of geologic history

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:42.250
and we are trying to piece history back together.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.200
So it is chronologically important to know
which end is up.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:55.570
KK: Right now, Chandra was tapping to see
where the sediment surface was and she is

00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:00.120
releasing the water above the sediment surface
in order to be able to cut the core without

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:06.470
any danger, because those cores get really
heavy, especially when they are saturated

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:07.910
like that.

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:12.880
ND: She is using a pipe cutter.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:14.560
Plumbers use those things a lot.

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:19.510
It is just a cleaner cut, a straight cut,
and it is faster than a hacksaw.

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:23.530
KK: So here we are cutting again right at
the sediment surface.

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:27.641
That initial cut was just an estimation because
we didn’t really know where the sediment

00:05:27.641 --> 00:05:28.660
surface was.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.840
Getting rid of as much void in the core as
possible.

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:39.600
And you will see us stuffing, in this case
paper towels, in order to keep the sediment

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.010
from moving around while it is in the core.

00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:48.580
ND: That is a very, very, very heavy sediment
core right there.

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:50.180
You would be surprised.

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.060
It looks like a toothpick but it is very heavy.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.410
It takes two people to move it.

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:01.500
KK: That was Chandra marking the top and naming
the core and marking the top and bottom.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:06.390
Narrator: Thanks, Kyle and Nancy, for your
time and for explaining the process of vibracoring.

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:10.400
Now, once the core is brought back to the
lab, it will be cut into meter sections and

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.510
split lengthwise into two halves.

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.660
One core will be kept for archiving and one
core will be kept for sampling.

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.140
The archiving core would be photographed and
stored in plastic bags for future reference.

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:26.140
The sediment core could be analyzed for grain-size
analysis, and age through radiometric dating.
