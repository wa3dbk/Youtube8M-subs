00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
Fuchsias I tell you what if there's one
plant that people get obsessive about

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.929
it's fuchsias you ever go to a fuchsia
show debt everywhere there's thousands

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.670
and thousands and the Americans are as
obsessed as we are but they're beautiful

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.670
things now there's all sorts of patio
fuchsias outdoor fuchsias fully hardy

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.369
fuchsias, I mean what we're planting today
is giant trailing futures now these are

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:32.520
something special now I'm putting them
in a basket and just to let you know

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.840
there's nothing difficult about them
nothing at all a multi-purpose compost

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.840
just your standard multi-purpose nothing
special no other additives and the

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.260
normal food that's in there anyway nice
and open

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.000
don't tamp it down too hard you want to
keep it just like that and that's as

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.460
complicated as you need to get it's just
out of the bag it's just moist and you

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:02.780
want to keep it just that way not
soaking wet but just moist

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.930
now these fuchsias look at that that is
a beautiful thing a giant trailing

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:16.409
fuchsia let's grab a flower that's
probably 2 to 3 inches large a small

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.549
child hand that's the size of that is
going to be and three in a basket like

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:28.290
this is more than enough and all you've
got to do is pop it in like that one two

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.049
three just in a little triangle and this
will grow away now these fuchsias are

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.820
something special they all trail but the
flowers are the size of a small child's

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.860
hand they're beautiful and some
wonderful colors voodoo deep purple with

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.409
scarlet pit leaves on them Oh
Holly's beauty snow burner a deep purple

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:56.100
one Bella Rose Ella peachy now that's a
really nice one they all trail they're

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.930
all huge flowers but look out for
Hollies beauty that really is lovely

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.500
like looks all the world like a
bridesmaid's wedding dress fantastic and

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.970
if you've got no discipline in your life
get yourself a fuchsia because the

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.290
discipline you need for the
is to keep that damp now there's still

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.950
Frost's around
we're still quite early and what I'll do

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.950
is I'll put these it's quite a nice warm
day today I'll hang these up in the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:27.090
greenhouse if I get a nice sunny day
outside they'll go that'll toughen up a

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.860
little bit mmm that's getting a bit cold
and then I'll bring them in over night

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:35.910
time so that's the discipline you need
I'll keep them damp all the time

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.040
keep them damp water them every day and
as the season goes on some flowers will

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.810
drop off if you see them fade pull them
off and you keep them damp I usually

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.810
water them with a foliar feed a normal
tomato grow more anything like that will

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.370
actually give them a slow-release feed
something that will feed them over the

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.549
week and then feed them once a week and
that's all you need to do you're going

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:03.510
to have stunning baskets that your
neighbors are going to say whoa where

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.500
did you get em from you could say I grew
myself just like I do
