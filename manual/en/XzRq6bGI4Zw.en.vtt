My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village. Today I'm making broccoli soup. Ok,

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.030
so while we are waiting on the broccoli to
cook, we've got 5 minutes or so. I'm just

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:19.270
gonna go ahead and do the garlic butter as
well as start salteing the vegetables that

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:35.780
are gonna go into the soup. First stick of
butter. Drop it in there. And as this starts

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:47.420
to melt, what we're gonna do, cause I don't
want the garlic to brown up really badly,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:54.530
I'm gonna put it in now as as I bring the
butter up over heat, it'll very smoothly and

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.460
very mellowly start bringing the flavor out
of the garlic. What I am looking for here

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:07.070
is I don't want to fry the garlic or anything
like that. Something else you can do to speed

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:15.940
things up is cut through your butter into
smaller pieces. It'll cook faster or melt

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:26.630
faster. This is for the garlic bread. I'm
gonna put a tiny bit of salt, tiny bit of

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:40.920
pepper. We're gonna let this go basically
until right to the point when it all melts,

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.510
then we're gonna pull it aside and we're gonna
use this to brush on the actual bread. Then

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.850
what else we're gonna do in this exact same
pan because its also gonna be garlic and butter

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.869
and onions, we're just gonna dump this right
into a bowl and then from there we're gonna

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:07.830
go put the butter and onions right in here.
We're gonna let this go and I'll come back

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.439
in just a second and we'll do the onions.
