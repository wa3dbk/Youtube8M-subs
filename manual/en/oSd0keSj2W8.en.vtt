&gt;&gt; HOPE BAGOZZI: Hi, I'm Hope Bagozzi,

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.040
Director of Marketing for McDonald's Canada.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.000
I'm here with a question from Isabel M., from
Toronto, Ontario.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.660
She asks, "Why does your food look different
in the advertising"

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.299
"than what is in the store?"

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:12.460
It's a great question, Isabel.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.419
We get asked that a lot.

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:15.780
And if you want to come with me,

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.240
I'm going to take you across the street

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.430
and we're going to find out a bit more.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:19.430
C'mon!

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.430
&gt;&gt; HOPE: Hello!

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.430
&gt;&gt; MCDONALD'S EMPLOYEE: Hi!

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.680
&gt;&gt; HOPE: Could I please order a Quarter Pounder
with Cheese?

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.910
Thank you, thank you so much!

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.790
Here's my hot and fresh Quarter Pounder with
Cheese!

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:31.100
Oh, it looks good!

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:33.410
Look at this beauty!

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.540
We'll put this one back in the box.

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.210
We're going to go over to our photo studio

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.460
and see a little bit more about behind the
scenes,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.980
what happens at a photo shoot.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.810
So we're en route to Watt Photo Studios.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.130
Watt has been our agency,

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.940
doing all of our merchandising creative,

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.760
for probably about seven years.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.031
What we're going to do here is

00:00:51.031 --> 00:00:52.031
we're actually going to put the burger

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:53.149
that you saw me just buy...

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.720
we're going to put it side-by-side next to
a burger

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.930
that we going to actually craft from scratch,

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.600
with our food stylist and our photographer.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.460
We're going to compare what's different about
the two.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.420
I've just bought this Quarter Pounder with
Cheese.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.190
It's as hot off the press as it can be.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.190
&gt;&gt; NEIL: Good.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.020
&gt;&gt; HOPE: So maybe we just put that in and
get a photo of it,

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.689
so we can use that for comparison.

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:15.270
&gt;&gt; NEIL: So we'll keep the camera, the lights
and everything the same.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.820
It will be a direct comparison of the right
side of both burgers.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.110
&gt;&gt;HOPE:Perfect, that makes total sense.

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.240
What I'm going to do is introduce you now
to Noah,

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.810
who is our food stylist.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.470
OhÃ¢ that burger was made in about a minute
or so.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.150
The process we go through on the average shoot
takes several hours.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.720
And here, I think it's important to note

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.960
that all the ingredients that Noah uses

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:38.020
are the exact same ingredients that we use
in the restaurant.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.970
So it's the exact same patties,

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:41.810
it's the exact same ketchup, mustard and onions.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.659
And the exact same buns.

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:45.729
Almost ready for you, Neil.

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:46.729
&gt;&gt;NOAH: Hey Neil.

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:47.729
&gt;&gt;NEIL:
We want to be able to show

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.110
the pickles and the condiments as we build.

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.110
HOPE:Right.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:52.229
NEIL:In the store, they would naturally

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:54.600
just line it up, straight in line.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.370
We have to bring it back a little bit,

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.470
to reveal the fact that it comes

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.320
with the pickles and the slivered onions.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.190
&gt;&gt;NOAH: Because we're in a one-dimensional
world in the camera,

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:04.400
everything is in the back in the picture.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.030
I don't know what's actually in it.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.930
This way, we can at least tell people

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:09.090
you have ketchup, you have mustard,

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.229
you have two pieces of cheese

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.580
and you know what you're getting.

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.370
&gt;&gt;HOPE: Perfect onion selection.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.770
It's like you're a surgeon in there.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:16.920
&gt;&gt;NEIL:Because we've had to put things forward,

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.410
the bun is sitting crooked.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.700
So he's just compensating...

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.480
&gt;&gt;NOAH: So Hope, I'm just melting down the
cheese with my palette knife.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.160
Maybe I'll put mustard, ketchup...

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.280
actually, ketchup, mustard, ketchup.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:29.870
&gt;&gt;NOAH: You ready?

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:30.930
&gt;&gt;NEIL: Yep.

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.520
&gt;&gt;HOPE: Oh, beautiful!

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.110
&gt;&gt;NOAH: That's nice.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.630
&gt;&gt;HOPE: This burger looks pretty good as is.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.670
I don't think it's going to need much retouching
whatsoever.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.730
Let me introduce you to Stuart Murray.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.800
He's going to take the side-by-side comparison

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.950
and do a little finessing of the product.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.370
The less amount of retouching that we do to
something,

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.660
the less perfect it looks.

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.599
But actually, it looks more appetizing and
more convincing.

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:54.870
Just enhancing some colour,

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.730
taking out some of the little accidents that
might happen in preparation,

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.760
which obviously doesn't show the product in
its best possible light.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:05.780
Here you can definitely see that there is
a size difference.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.819
The box that our sandwiches come in keep the
sandwiches warm,

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:10.650
which creates a bit of a steam effect,

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:13.440
and it does make the bun contract a little
bit.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.940
And then the main difference is the fact that

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.510
we actually took all the ingredients

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.050
that are normally hidden under the bun

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.140
and we pulled them to the foreground,

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.959
so that you could see them.

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.209
And those are the main differences.

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.500
So Isabel, thank you so much for your question,

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.050
and we hope that's answered it for you.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.400
Thanks.
