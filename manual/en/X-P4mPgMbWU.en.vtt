Hi! This is Beth Essington for Expert Village.
We are now going to demonstrate a double treble

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:11.420
crochet which is a very, very tall stitch.
So when you get to the end of your row like

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.760
before when we did the treble, for this one
you are going to chain 4 and again when you

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.140
do the chains at the beginning or at the end
depending on how you look at it, that is going

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:27.413
to count as your first stitch on your next
row. So we are doing 4 here. Now what we are

00:00:27.413 --> 00:00:34.040
going to do before we wrap around 2 times,
this time we are wrapping around 3 times.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:41.380
So we are going to go into our first stitch
which is right here, go through, go through

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:47.120
like that and you will have 1,2,3,4 and 5
on your stitch. Wrap around, going to pull

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:55.230
through 2. Again, you are going to wrap around
and pull through 2 again. Wrap around, pull

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:02.960
through 2 again and wrap around and pull through
2 again. That is a very, very tall stitch.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.429
That is your double treble. So again, you
wrap around 3 times. Go into your next little

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:15.159
chain link; it's always at the top and go
through and pull it through like so. We are

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:20.729
going to have 5 on your hook now. Now you
are going to pull through 2 but you are not

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.679
going to be eliminating the 2 stitches. You
will actually only be eliminating 1. So you

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:31.719
pull through 2 and the one you pull through
leaves 1 left so now you have 4. So again,

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:38.350
wrap around and pull through 2, bring this
down to 3 stitches, wrap around pull it again

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:44.189
down to 2 stitches. Wrap it around again,
pull through once more and finally down to

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:52.179
1 and there's our nice tall double treble
crochet stitch. So wrap around 3 times and

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:59.229
repeat what we did before. Underneath the
chain and pull it on through. Wrap around

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:08.890
and pull through 2, wrap around pull through
2, wrap around pull through 2 again and your

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.040
last two like so. Isn't that pretty?
