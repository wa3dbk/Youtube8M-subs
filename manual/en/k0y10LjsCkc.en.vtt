Hi! It's Tyrone Shum from Outsourcinglive.com
and welcome to the dedicated channel where

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.580
I teach you about how to outsource your videos.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.630
Now, a very common question that people are
always, always asking is "What camera shall

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.920
I use?" Because once you've recorded your
content like what I'm doing right now, you're

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.980
going to have to send it over to your video
editor. So what is that's really, really quick

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:29.519
and easy and also what is very efficient to
be able to get across to them.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:38.440
And there's really two options. One, is to
use a very basic camera for people who are

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.329
on a budget which I'm going to share with
you shortly. Or two, use a little bit more

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.949
advanced camera which is the current one that
I'm using right now to record on. And both

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:51.510
is really dependent on your budget and also
depending on the quality of the video that

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:52.829
you want to get out there.

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.980
Obviously the more you pay for a particular
camera, the better the quality you're going

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.710
to get but it won't break an arm and a leg.

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.650
All right so the first one that I've been
using for quite some time before I actually

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.220
upgraded to this camera that I'm currently
recording on is a Kodak Zi8 camera. This is

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.530
a very nice, very thin and very light camera
that I've been using and I had a 32GB card

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.990
in here to be able to record all my high definition
videos.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.670
Now the reason why this is a great camera
is one, it has an external microphone which

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.640
you can just plug in onto the side right over
here. I don't know if you can see it actually

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.490
right here but basically you just plug in
that condenser mic which is I'm going to talk

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:39.630
a little bit more about that but plug that
straight in, mount that into a tripod and

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.160
then hit the remote to record where you can
get a separate remote and you're up and away.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.740
That's exactly what I did for quite a long
time. When you have look at a lot of my videos,

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.900
I had at least about almost 100 videos that
I recorded using the Kodak Zi8 camera. And

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.230
it's a great camera because it records in
high definition and the video files are quite

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:00.180
small in comparision.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.010
So that's - that's what I would recommend.
I noticed that a lot of other people also

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:09.050
recommend the Flip Mino, but unfortunately
the Flip Mino doesn't have any of the external

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.320
mic plugin unless you want to spend extra
money but this is a really good budget camera

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.170
that you can pick up. You can buy from Amazon
or eBay or anything like that and I'll make

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.060
sure I'll put a link down below so that way
you can check it out directly.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.390
So that one is very good because you can upload
easily, send to your video editor and he'll

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.240
be able to do it straightaway.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.590
Now the second option which is a little bit
more advanced and also too, it records very,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.540
very high quality and you can see just from
the recording is called the Canon T3i Rebel.

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:42.860
And I'm not going to take the credit that
I found this. This was actually recommended

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:49.530
to me by my good friend Gideon Shalwick from
GideonShalwick.com and he uses a little more

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.150
advanced camera which is the next model up
but for me, I'm happy with this one because

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.930
this one has been really focused on allowing
me to record videos. And just again, it does

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.060
have an external mic so the great thing is
I can plug this mic that I've got on clipped

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.190
on me straight into the camera and start to
share with you.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.660
So what I'll do is I'll put the link below
but it's called the Canon T3i Rebel which

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:18.450
is an SLR camera and it allows you to be able
to record well, videos up to at least 12 minutes

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.450
or so then after that you can edit it from
there.

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:20.450
Now, one word of caution, these cameras these
particular Canon cameras record very, very

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.450
large file and there's little trick that I'm
going to share in the future video on how

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:22.450
to be able to get this sent over to your video
editor in a smaller format and I think apparently

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.450
right now it records up to about 300MB per
minute so if you're going to do a 10-minute

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.450
video, it's going to be about 3GB which is
quite big. Whereas in comparison, the Kodak

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.450
Zi8, for about a 5-minute video that I used
to record, it will only be about 200-300MB

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:26.450
so it's a fraction of that size so you just
have to take that in consideration when you're

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:27.450
working with you and outsourcing it over to
your video editor overseas.

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.450
All right so yeah, these are really the two
cameras that I highly recommend. Make sure

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.580
that whenever you're getting a camera, you'll
also get a lapel mic which is what I'm currently

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:33.959
holding right now, you can sort of see it
on me. But basically it's just a mic that

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.750
just clips onto you and plug it straight into
your camera and it gives you much, much better

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.880
quality of sound.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.630
And you can pick up these for like $30 or
so from like Dick Smith or Tandy store and

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:44.959
that's what I've done.

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:49.180
Okay so yeah, hopefully this video has helped
you there. If you've got any further questions,

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:52.580
feel free to leave your comments down below
and I'll be more happy to answer them but

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.410
these are one of the two the cameras that
I've been using for quite some time and I

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.920
- I cannot just - I cannot say how great they
are because they're just - brilliant. So give

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.380
it a go, check it out and let me know what
you think.

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.440
All right, thanks so much for watching this.
