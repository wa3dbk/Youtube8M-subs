00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.290
Hey guys! It’s Phil from smilinggardener.com
and today I’m going to show you, to do something

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.610
called rock mulching. First while I’m standing
by my garden here I might as well show you

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.820
the progress, things are starting to grow.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:28.360
I have some tomato support, you can see it
up around there, there’s my little path

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.160
and I got a nice new little sidewalk in here
and things are starting to grow. But still

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.989
not much exciting going on it’s little bit
too early in the spring and it’s been cold

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.600
and rainy and so we need some warmth for things
to really start taking off but I’m pretty

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:45.499
excited about this garden this year.

00:00:45.499 --> 00:00:54.140
So rock mulching. You know, I don’t generally
recommend you using a stone or rocks as a

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.670
mulch in your garden and the main problem
with that is that they don’t let organic

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.019
matter be recycled back into the soil which
is one of the most important goals for us

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.280
in the garden is to improve the organic matter
content of the soil.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.729
So that’s gonna be in the fall, we want
to have the leaves that fall from the trees

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.280
and the plants, we want them to be incorporated
back in to the soil like nature does right

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.280
every fall.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.750
We want to bring compost in every year or
a couple of years and things like that. So

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.530
stones stop all these process from happening
and they just, they just stop all the nutrients

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.780
cycling and organic matter replenishment process
in the soil.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.950
But there is one time that I, that I used
rocks and it’s called rock mulching for

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.549
some reason which to me just sound mulching
with rocks but it’s not. What it is, is

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:50.039
it’s, oh! That’s a nice lilac out there,
coz it does not look as cool in the camera.

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:55.380
I haven’t notice that yet.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:03.619
Sorry I got distracted so, so rock mulching
is when we, usually around a very important

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.710
new plant like a young fruit tree or something
that we have, you make sure you have a nice

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:11.540
bed around the tree.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:16.430
Put down a bunch of leaves like a few inches
of leaves on that bed and then put some rocks

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.450
on top, not little rocks but like bigger rocks
or flagstones which I’ve done and I, I,

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.470
here I can show you because I have done it
to a pear tree here.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:33.420
Well, I actually show you that coz I was recording
this yesterday in a video for the academy.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:38.379
I so, I’ll show you the process of, from
start to finish, so what happen is first you

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.380
make sure the bed is good then you put this
nice layer of leaves in there, a few inches

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:48.640
of leaves then you cover it up with rocks
and what happen is normally those leaves would

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.090
take, you know 6 to 8 months to break down
something like that.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:58.060
But with the rocks on there it happens in
a couple of months and what that means is

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:02.870
that I can add another few inches of leaves
in a couple of months; and I can do that a

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.650
few times this year and that’s really where
you get the benefits by doing this a few times

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.650
in a year.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:11.500
So the rocks really, it’s like they’re,
it’s like they’re making these leaves

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:17.230
compost much more quickly, improving the organic
matter content of the soil and people have

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.110
proposed different reasons why the rocks might
do that.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:27.819
You know, it could be that a, that just the
pressure exerted to the leaves get them more

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.799
in contact of the soil food web and the earthworms
and molasses and break down faster. It could

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:36.129
be that the rocks are for protections for
earth worms coz there’s certainly an explosion

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.689
of earthworms under there once this rocks
get on there.

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:43.879
It could be that they, you know the heat that
the rocks get during the day from the sun

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:50.720
is radiated back out at night allowing for
a more smooth, a longer breakdown by the soil

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.079
food web and which is more heat in there so
there’s a longer work day for them.

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.230
Could be that there’s, there’s definitely
gonna be more moisture in there with the rocks

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.720
there to hold the moisture in so I, it’s
probably all of these reasons together, I’m

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:07.160
not sure but I do know that these leaves are
gonna disappear very quickly and what’s

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:10.840
gonna happen is by the end of this year when
I’ve done this a few times the soil is going

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:17.340
to be beautiful under their full of worm casting
and it’s, it’s gonna be a rich beautiful

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.340
soil.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.970
And I expecting at the top growth is gonna
be, when I’ve done this at the past the

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.240
top growth is going to be nice and I’m hoping
will get some pears here for the first time,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.900
nice edible pears, and so that’s, that’s
rock mulching.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:35.650
You know it’s this way that we use rocks
to help facilitates the breakdown, the fast

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.930
breakdown of leaves on a very important tree
or if you’ve planted a few tree or a small

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.170
orchards like that.

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:48.169
I think that’s all I wanted to talk about
today about rock mulching. Oh! There’s another

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.419
lilac, I, I gotta start looking around here
more and I’m at my parents place.

00:04:53.419 --> 00:05:01.490
So, so that’s all so if you haven’t picked
out my 15 vital lessons from, for becoming

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:06.180
a better organic gardener you can do that
at smilinggardener.com and other than that

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.500
I hope you can get doing some rock mulching.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:12.960
You know obviously the fall is when you, your
leaves are going to be there but if you have

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.919
some left over like I did you can start this
in the spring and do it a few times this year.

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:22.919
So I hope you have a good rest of the day
and I’ll be back next week talking about

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:23.460
something else.
