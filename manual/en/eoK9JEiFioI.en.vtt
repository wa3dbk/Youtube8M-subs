00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.300
Welcome to a lesson on adding whole numbers.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.220
The goals of this video are to define whole numbers, define place value of whole numbers,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:11.500
and also to add whole numbers.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.080
Whole numbers are the numbers that you probably use most often in your life.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:23.360
Whole numbers consist of all of the natural numbers, or counting numbers, as we see here, and zero.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.820
Here we see a very straight-forward addition problem of two whole numbers.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:41.080
We have one plus two equals three which means if we take one item and we add two more items, we have a total of one, two, three items.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:48.180
The numbers being added are called the addends. So in this case the addends would be one and two.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.780
And the answer is called the sum.  So in this problem, three is the sum.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.120
Now one key to adding whole numbers is knowing place value.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.120
Starting with the right-most digit of a whole number, we would have the one's,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.480
the tens,

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.680
hundreds,

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.640
thousands,

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.980
ten thousands

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.420
hundred thousands, and millions.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.260
So for example, if we wanted to write this number in expanded form to represent the place value of each digit,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:19.800
we could write this number in this table.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:27.200
So this one represents ten thousand.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.320
This five is in the thousands place value, so this represents five thousand.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.000
The two is in the hundreds, so this represents two hundred.

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.720
The six is in the tens, so that represents sixty.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.480
The four is in the one's, so that represents four.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:55.640
So this expanded form shows what each digit represents in this number based upon its place value.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.740
Okay, so here's the procedure for adding whole numbers.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.560
We're going to write this sum in vertical form and line up the corresponding place values,

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.840
and then we'll add by starting with the one's column, and then work our way left.

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.640
We will have to carry if the sum of any column is a two digit number.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.320
So here's an example.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.160
Three hundred forty-eight plus seventy-three.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.400
We'll write this in vertical form, so we'll write down three hundred forty-eight,

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:30.760
and then writing this in vertical form, we'll line up the seven in the ten's column with this four in the ten's column,

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.880
and we'll line up the three with the eight in the one's column.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:41.360
And now we'll find this sum by adding up the columns, starting with the one's column.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.800
Eight plus three would be eleven.  Eleven would be a one in the ten's column and a one in the one's column.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.500
So we write down the one in the one's column and we carry the one over to the ten's column.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.480
Now when we add the digits in the ten's column, we have to add one, plus four, plus seven.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:09.140
Well that would be twelve, so we write down the two in the ten's column and we carry the one over to the hundred's column.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:13.020
So for the hundred's column, we have one plus three which would be four.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.880
Our sum is four hundred twenty-one.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:24.440
Here we have fourteen thousand three hundred eighty-nine plus six thousand eight hundred forty-six.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.160
Let's write it vertically.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.040
Notice all of the place values are lined up vertically.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.260
Let's go ahead and start to find the sum of each column starting in the one's.

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:50.300
Nine plus six would be fifteen.  So we write down the five in the one's column and carry a one to the ten's column.

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:58.040
One plus eight plus four would be thirteen, so you write down the three and carry the one.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.680
One plus three plus eight, that would be twelve.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.160
Write down the two, carry the one.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.820
One plus four plus six, that would be eleven.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.180
Write down the one, carry a one.  One plus one would be two.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.800
Our sum is twenty-one thousand two hundred thirty-five.

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:28.520
Here we have seven million four thousand five hundred eighty-five plus eighty-six thousand nine hundred forty-two.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.040
Let's write it in vertical form.

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.520
Starting in the one's, we have five plus two, that would be seven.

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:57.100
In the ten's, we have eight plus four, that would be twelve.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.800
We write down the two, and carry the one.

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:04.060
One plus five plus nine, that's gonna give us fifteen.

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.720
Write down the five, carry the one.

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:13.060
One plus four plus six, that's eleven.  Write down the one, carry the one.

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.580
One plus zero plus eight, that would be nine.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.100
Notice in the next column we just have a zero.  Next column is just a seven.

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.000
So our sum is seven million ninety-one thousand five hundred twenty-seven.

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.900
Now let's take a look at a word problem.

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:40.140
The current balance of your checking account is two hundred four dollars.  If you deposit your paycheck for seven hundred forty-eight dollars

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:47.400
and a rebate check for one hundred forty nine dollars, what will the new balance of your checking account be once the checks have cleared?

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:55.480
So we have two hundred four dollars in our checking account and then we add our deposit of seven hundred forty-eight dollars

00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.940
and then add the rebate check for one hundred forty-nine dollars.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:04.380
So we want to find the sum of these three numbers.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:09.260
So as long as we line up the place values, we can add all three of these at the same time.

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:15.760
We have two hundred four, seven hundred forty-eight, and one hundred forty-nine.

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.580
And we'll follow the same procedure.  We'll start with the one's column.

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:25.320
Four plus eight would be twelve, plus nine, that would be twenty-one.

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.360
So we write down the one and carry the two into the ten's column.

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.340
Here we have zero plus four plus four, that's eight.  Plus the two that we carried, that would be ten.

00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.480
So we write down the zero and carry the one to the hundred's column.

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:48.820
So here we have two plus seven plus one, that's ten, plus one which would be eleven.

00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:55.700
So the new balance in the checking account will be one thousand one hundred one dollars.

00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.220
Okay, that's gonna do it for adding whole numbers.  I hope you found this video helpful.
