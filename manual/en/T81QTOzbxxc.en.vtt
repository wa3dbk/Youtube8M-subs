00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.569
Back in the 1960s, Jack Warner infamously
decided that Broadway star Julie Andrews - who

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.360
originated the role of Eliza Doolittle on
stage - was not a big enough draw for the

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.230
movie adaptation of My Fair Lady.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.330
Andrews was then scooped up by Walt Disney
to make her Hollywood debut in Mary Poppins

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.130
- and both films competed in the 1965 Oscar
race.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.270
Sure both films were big winners that night,
and Warner even won Best Picture, but Andrews

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.440
won Best Actress while her replacement Audrey
Hepburn wasn’t even nominated.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.620
And of course, the very next year Andrews
went on to star in The Sound of Music, one

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.870
of the biggest hits of all time and another
big Oscar winner.

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:47.100
Well, wouldn’t it be something if Warner’s
studio decades later made the same mistake

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.540
with Stephen Amell?

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:55.201
Amell is the star of Arrow, the current flagship
DC Comics television show on The CW, which

00:00:55.201 --> 00:01:00.449
is partially owned by Warner Bros. Arrow has
been such a success for the junior network

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.239
that it’s already spun-off another hit series
- The Flash - while another spin-off DC’s

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:08.710
Legends of Tomorrow just got picked up for
next year.

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.210
Plus Vixen will be an animated web series
taking place in the same universe, and will

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.150
launch later this year.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.939
Now to be super clear, this shared universe
does NOT overlap with the DC Cinematic Universe

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.070
that Warner Bros is currently building on
the big screen.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.470
See unlike Marvel Studios, where all its initiatives
from the small screen to the big screen to

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.939
Netflix are interconnected, Warner Bros doesn’t
feel that’s the way to go with its DC properties.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:35.619
Is that the right play?

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.619
Well considering some of the backlash against
Age of Ultron, it’s too early to tell.

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:45.450
But the decision has resulted in a sort of
glass ceiling for Amell and his fellow co-stars.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.270
Which must really smart considering that WB
Animation just debuted a new direct to video

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:54.640
movie - Batman Unlimited - and one of its
selling points is that it features Arrow and

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.100
The Flash... but not the ones from The CW?

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.780
Holy Brand Confusion, Batman!

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.439
But just like his television alter-ego, Amell
has a problem with authority - and has therefore

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.830
taken a lead role in Paramount’s Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles 2 Half Shell!

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.830
GASP!

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.480
Co-starring Megan Fox and now also Tyler Perry!

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.480
GASP!

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.260
Still produced by Michael Bay!

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.260
GASP!

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.080
I know, I know - but sometimes desperate times
call for desperate measures.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.330
And Amell has already proved that when it
comes to his career he really is willing to

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:30.560
do anything, or anyone...

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.700
Anyway, while you freak out that supporting
Amell on the big screen means also supporting

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.379
Michael Bay, I’m here to tell you it’s
actually not so bad.

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:42.470
In fact, it might be kind of awesome.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.780
Amell is playing Casey Jones, a fan favorite
from Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles mythology.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.420
And even better, he’s a spoof on vigilantes!

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.349
Just imagine the fun Amell - and you - can
have with a character who decided to fight

00:02:55.349 --> 00:02:58.879
crime after watching TV shows like...Arrow!

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:04.550
That means Amell gets an origin story, kick-ass
action scenes, plenty of laughs AND the girl.

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:09.470
Yeah, he’s PROUD to play this role, with
Bay and Amell tweeting a first look at Casey

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.920
Jones just a few weeks ago.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.800
So while Warner Bros benches Amell, Bay and
Paramount are all too happy to lend their

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.310
very popular yet much maligned rebooted franchise
some hardcore fanboy street cred.

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.830
And it will be interesting to see how much
- if at all - the family friendly TMNT movies

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.830
explore Casey Jones’ more...violent tendencies,
and their repercussions, in the sequel.

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:37.599
Hey, maybe if Amell’s performance proves
to be popular enough, PARAMOUNT won’t hold

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.210
him back and he’ll maybe a get a spin-off
movie?

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.900
Maybe they could even find a role for his
cousin, Robbie.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.160
So, do you think Warner Bros has seriously
underestimated Stephen Amell’s star power?

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.490
And will they regret that mistake when he
storms the big screen as Casey Jones?!

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:58.340
Or is starring in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
2 Half Shell a booby prize no matter how you

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.630
look at it?

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.810
Write your thoughts down below.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.920
I’m Grace Randolph and this has been a movie
byte!

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:12.420
You can watch more, right now!
