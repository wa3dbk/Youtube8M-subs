00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:03.250
Howdy

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:06.990
Welcome class of 2016

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:09.440
AAAAAAAAAAA

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:20.830
Today, we want to celebrate the academic rigor
that you can expect during your time here

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.050
at Texas A&amp;M University.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:31.180
So with that in mind, I need for each of you
to get out a No. 2 pencil, a scantron, and

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:37.190
let's have our first pop quiz.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.000
This afternoon, I simply want to say a few
words that I hope will encourage you to achieve

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.540
the great things that are possible at Texas
A&amp;M.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:51.040
I am a first generation college graduate.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:56.739
My parents and grandparents valued education,
but they simply did not have all of the same

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.320
fortunes that I had.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.110
I was fortunate to be born when higher education
is readily available.

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.090
I was fortunate to have family that instilled
and nurtured strong work ethic in me.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.999
And I was fortunate to have teachers in my
life who were instrumental in helping me arrive

00:01:16.999 --> 00:01:20.200
at my position today.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.670
The first such teacher was Mrs. Morton she
was my 4th grade home teacher at Beardsley

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.860
Elementary.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.859
From the picture you get the sense that she
was pleasant and stylish.

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:41.499
I remember the time she called me to her front
desk while the class was busy with an assignment.

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:48.110
She showed me a recent homework paper and
asked me to explain my method of long division.

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.619
I was using a simple shortcut that I had stumbled
upon myself, it was nothing clever really

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:57.099
and she knew what I was up to.

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:01.439
She just wanted to encourage me to continue
being creative.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.240
Mrs. Morton motivated me that day and she
made a difference in my life.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:14.150
I also fondly remember Mr. Blantred, he was
my English teacher at Fresno City College

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:17.310
where I had started my college journey.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.440
Mr. Blantred made everyone want to be a writer
and I'll never forget the day where he stood

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.390
beside me during class.

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:31.280
I had written an essay describing Christmas
decorations in my grandparent's dilapidated

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:32.810
farm house.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.360
He approached me, he put his hand on my shoulder,
and he announced to the class how much he

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.280
enjoyed reading my paper.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.200
I doubt that my essay was really any better
than the others.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.730
But I believe he was encouraging me to continue
forward.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:55.410
Mr Blantred noticed me that day and he made
a difference in my life.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:02.720
I especially remember Dr. Lorensys, he was
a brand a new professor at San Diego University

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.900
where I received my bachelors degree.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.350
He introduced me to the idea of graduate school
and when he had mentioned this, I didn't even

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.420
know what he was talking about, I certainly
didn't know that it was an option for me.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.040
He helped me select a few good schools, he
helped me complete my applications, and eventually

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.480
he helped me decide on Texas A&amp;M.

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:33.020
Dr. Lorensys guided me and he made a difference
in my life.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:40.120
These people and many others, including someone
on stage today, were kind enough to motivate

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:46.040
me, notice me, and guide me throughout my
education.

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:51.290
Sir Isaac Newton once wrote: "If I had seen
further, it was by standing on the shoulders

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:52.800
of giants."

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.480
Today, I have introduced you to few of the
giants in my life who have helped me see beyond

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.600
what I had ever thought was possible.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:09.840
So during the next few years, I want you to
actively seek out such mentors at Texas A&amp;M.

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.740
I want you to climb onto our shoulders.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:22.150
Let us help you see from Freshman 101 to Sophomore
201, from Freshman Seminar to Senior Design.

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.379
I want you to challenge us to explain our
ideas more clearly so that we can challenge

00:04:28.379 --> 00:04:32.680
you to develop and extend your ideas.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:39.289
I want you to challenge us to explain the
relevance of our lectures so we can challenge

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.410
you to explain the relevance of your answers.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:51.050
I want you think big, speak up, and be noticed
so that we can solve a problem or invent something

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.580
new together.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:58.680
My students and I try to that everyday in
our laboratory.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:08.040
The laboratory is called LASR; which stands
for Land, Air, and Space Robotics.

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.349
Our lab is home to all types from freshman
student to Ph.

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:15.669
D candidate, to distinguished professor.

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:22.460
We specialize in design and rapid prototype
of robots and robotic concepts.

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.259
We develop ideas from cartoon to creation.

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:33.879
And our ideas can be applied to satellite
docking, aerial mapping, and robotic pursuit.

00:05:33.879 --> 00:06:29.400
So let's see a little bit of that now.

00:06:29.400 --> 00:07:29.150
Finally, I want to offer a few words of advice
on how to succeed during your fist semester.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:35.930
President Eisenhower once wrote: "Always try
to associate yourself with and learn much

00:07:35.930 --> 00:07:42.789
as you can from those who know more than you,
who do better than you, and who see more clearly

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:44.349
than you."

00:07:44.349 --> 00:07:49.059
That's what I do and that's why I'm here at
Texas A&amp;M University.

00:07:49.059 --> 00:07:49.879
Gig 'em.
