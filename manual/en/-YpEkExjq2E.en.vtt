00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.390
So we've got this fraction
written here, 2/3.

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:05.850
What I want you to do
is pause this video

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.400
and try to think of any
other fractions that

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.930
are the same that are
equivalent to this fraction

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.800
right over here that essentially
represent the same number.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.200
So to do that, let's
visualize what 2/3 is.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.570
So let me draw a whole here.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.090
Let me draw a
whole, and I'm going

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.820
to divide it into
three equal sections.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.965
So that is my whole.

00:00:27.965 --> 00:00:29.670
I'm drawing three
equal sections I'm

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.950
going to try to draw and
make them as equal as i--

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:34.570
I can do a little
better job than that.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.580
So that's 1, 2, 3.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.130
Three equal sections.

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:43.080
And so 2/3 would
represent two out

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:44.840
of those three equal sections.

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.630
So actually I can
spray paint this.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:51.140
So that's 1/3 right over
here, and then this is 2/3.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.070
So we have two of the
three equal sections.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:56.195
So that is 2/3.

00:00:56.195 --> 00:00:58.260
And now let me
copy and paste that

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.600
so we can think about other
ways to represent this fraction.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.540
So copy.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.790
And then let me paste it.

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.482
I'll do it once, and then
I'll do it another time.

00:01:08.482 --> 00:01:09.940
And I could do this
multiple times,

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.270
but I'll do it two other
times right over here.

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.190
So there's a couple
of things we could do.

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.070
The first option is
we could take this

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.700
and we could draw a
horizontal line that

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.860
divides each of these three
sections into two sections.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:23.635
So let's do that.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.095
So now, how many equal
sections do I have?

00:01:29.095 --> 00:01:35.530
I have 1, 2, 3, 4,
5, 6 equals sections.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.720
And how many of those
equal sections are actually

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.380
shaded in now.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.500
Well, we see it's 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.000
4/6.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.870
So notice, 4/6 is the exact same
fraction of the whole as 2/3.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.340
These are equivalent fractions.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.814
We could say that
2/3 is equal to 4/6.

00:01:53.814 --> 00:01:55.480
Now, we could do
something very similar.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.111
Instead of dividing each
of these thirds into two,

00:01:59.111 --> 00:02:01.110
we could divide each of
these thirds into three.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.980
So I could draw three
horizontal lines here.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:09.139
So let's see 1, 2, 3.

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:12.840
So now I have divided what
was in three equal sections,

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.040
I now have three times
as many sections.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.640
I have 1, 2,, 3, 4, 5, 6,
7, 8, 9 equals sections.

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.410
And then which of those
are actually shaded in?

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.254
We have 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:02:27.254 --> 00:02:28.020
6.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:34.732
So 2/3, which is equal to
4/6, is also equal to 6/9.

00:02:34.732 --> 00:02:38.680
All three of these are
equivalent fractions, 2/3, 4/6,

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.292
and 6/9.

00:02:39.292 --> 00:02:41.250
And if you were to put
them on the number line,

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.420
the same thing would happen.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.631
So let's do that.

00:02:43.631 --> 00:02:44.880
Let's draw a number line here.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.070
Let's say that's 0.

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:48.610
And I'm just going to
focus on between 0 and 1.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.780
And obviously we
can go beyond that.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.090
And let's divide it
first into thirds.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:59.940
So this is 1/3 and 2/3.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.550
So we already know this would
represent 1/3 and this is 2/3.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.050
We've gone two of the equal
spaces of the three on the way

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.870
to 1.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.740
We've divided the
section between 0 and 1

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:14.510
into three equal spaces.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:15.879
Now, what for 4/6 be?

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.670
Well, now we would just
have to divide this

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.300
into 6 equal spaces.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.190
So 1, 2, 4, 4, 5, 6.

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.350
And 4/6, that would be 4 out of
the 6 spaces on the way to 1.

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.620
So 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.637
So this number is
also equal to 4/6.

00:03:34.637 --> 00:03:36.220
And you could do the
same thing if you

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.705
want to think about ninths.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:51.450
So what we could do, we could
put 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.480
Now I've split this part of
our number line between 0 and 1

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.290
into 9 equal spaces.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:59.230
Well, what would 6/9 be?

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:03.330
Well, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:05.540
Once again, the exact same
point on the number line.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:06.706
It's an equivalent fraction.

00:04:06.706 --> 00:04:10.994
6/9 is equal to 2/3
is equal to 4/6.
