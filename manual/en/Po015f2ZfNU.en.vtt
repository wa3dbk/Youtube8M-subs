00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:01.510
&gt;&gt;DALE: Good afternoon.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:07.759
Today's topic of discussion is going over
three critical tips to prevent the pitfalls

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.299
from consumers looking at buying new construction
homes.

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:14.769
This is Dale Snyder with The Snyder Homes
at Keller Williams Realty here in Las Vegas

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:15.769
Nevada.

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.460
Today, we have Rhonda Allen with us.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:18.460
Thank you for your time.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:19.650
&gt;&gt;RHONDA: Thanks Dale, thanks for having me.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.700
&gt;&gt;DALE: You bet.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.650
So Rhonda, she's a senior buyer's agent on
the team.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.860
She's an expert at selling new construction
homes.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.860
What have you sold?

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.080
Half a dozen?

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.400
Six or so, already this year?

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:31.400
&gt;&gt;RHONDA: Yes.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:33.420
&gt;&gt;DALE: She's just doing an amazing job.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.890
She understands it inside out, everybody on
the team looks at her for guidance and what's

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:46.079
going on in the current marketplace with new
construction.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.289
[music]

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:56.170
&gt;&gt;DALE: Let's jump right in Rhonda.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.659
What would tip number 1 be?

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:03.139
&gt;&gt;RHONDA: Well, tip number 1, I would say,
would be to actually have a second set of

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:05.400
eyes during the process.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:12.390
It's crucial that when you go on to home sites,
everything just looks gorgeous so its hard

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.390
to know.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.320
You think everything's perfect and it's hard
to know what questions to ask.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:22.440
So you definitely want to have somebody there
with a second set of eyes throughout the process.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:27.960
Just to make sure they're putting in the right
cabinets, the right flooring, houses face

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.370
the right way, things like that.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:32.100
So you want to make sure those things are
happening.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.460
&gt;&gt;DALE: Yeah, that makes sense.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.350
There's a lot of stressful that could happen
during the process, I would assume.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.370
Just having you there to babysit the builders,
so to speak, sometimes.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:47.280
And the sales agents to make sure they're
doing what they're supposed to be doing.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:48.510
&gt;&gt;RHONDA: Definitely.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.510
Definitely.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.160
There's deadlines that need to be met and
so it's helpful to have somebody to speak

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:58.460
on your behalf to make sure that we're on
track with the process and that you get moved

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.410
in, you know, when you're expecting to be
moved in.

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:02.920
&gt;&gt;DALE: Yeah, that makes sense.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.210
Alright, what's tip number 2.

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.840
&gt;&gt;RHONDA: Tip number 2 is you have expert
council.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.520
You got somebody there to ask the crucial
questions, you know.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.810
We've had a new home sell site maybe couple
of weeks ago, and the agent was gracious enough

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:25.200
to answer the question of how many investors
have actually bought in this neighborhood.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.810
And we later find out that there was a whole
street that was sold to just investors.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:30.810
&gt;&gt;DALE: Wow.

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.090
&gt;&gt;RHONDA: Which means, you know, you're going
to have a ton of renters in that neighborhood.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.340
So those are crucial things that you need
to ask.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.450
You know who's buying here.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.640
You know what's our demographic's like?

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:43.640
You know.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.640
&gt;&gt;DALE: Yeah.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.490
That makes sense because a lot of times consumers
they don't quite know what questions to ask.

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:55.490
They just get excited about the model homes
and want to buy the home and they don't know

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:58.290
what potential pitfalls could be there later.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.220
Alright, so what's tip number 3, Rhonda?

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.990
&gt;&gt;RHONDA: Tip number 3, is a lot of the consumers
don't know, Dale, that the sales agent onsite

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.570
has a fiduciary duty to the seller, to the
builder.

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.380
They're there to net the builder as much as
they possibly can.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.730
That being said, you know base price, everybody
knows how, you know, you're going to have

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.180
to add some options to get that home where
it needs to be.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.040
A lot of consumers don't know that you could
actually add that stuff later at a fraction

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:28.600
of the cost of what the builder's going to
charge you.

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.849
The beauty of working with our team is we
have a project manager team that can go out

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:39.739
and price those items for you and make sure
that you're actually getting a good deal.

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:45.820
So close with the cheap builder carpet, close
with the linoleum and then once you get it

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.510
closed we can have somebody come in and do
those items for you.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.440
And it won't cost you as much.

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.180
&gt;&gt;DALE: Yeah, that's a good point Rhonda.

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:02.770
As you said, you know, the sales agent is
on payroll, they're getting paid by the seller

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:08.180
to be in that model home and negotiate and
get the best deal for the builder.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:09.180
&gt;&gt;RHONDA: Absolutely.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.560
&gt;&gt;DALE: You know having an expert like Rhonda
to negotiate on your behalf and it cost you

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:17.109
nothing is a very critical thing.

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:24.889
And then tying into the builder upgrades,
we can get you an estimated cost analysis

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:31.620
on what it would cost to a - say you want
to do 17-inch diagonal tile through the whole

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:33.490
first floor level.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.800
We could get you an estimated cost on that
so you can see what the builders are going

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.190
to charge versus getting the base carpet and
linoleum, and then having that ripped out

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.900
at closing.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.870
We could save you tens of thousands of dollars,
I would suspect.

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:48.850
&gt;&gt;RHONDA: Absolutely, yeah definitely.

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:50.430
&gt;&gt;DALE: Okay, thank you for your time.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.750
&gt;&gt;RHONDA: Alright Dale, thanks for having
me.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:52.750
&gt;&gt;DALE: You bet.

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:57.430
This is very great information that we went
over today there's a lot of new construction

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.870
going on in the Valley right now.

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:05.120
We're going to be doing another video, tying
in to what is going on in the Valley as far

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:11.330
