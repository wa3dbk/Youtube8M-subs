00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.070
Alright the era of solid 
state drives is finally here

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.280
and this is probably
one of the drives

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:17.450
that's going to make it 
very very possible for somebody,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.150
just a regular old joe
like me, like you,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.860
young people, college 
kids, enthusiasts

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.160
to get a solid state
drive into your computer.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.800
And the reason why is you finally
have a good bang per buck.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.330
A lot of performance
at a reasonable price.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:34.600
There's no way that
I will ever spend

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.900
like 8, 9, 1000 dollars
on a solid state drive.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.600
And here's the other thing,
because you're only using it

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.280
for your operating system,
you don't need to have

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.210
a huge solid 
state drive.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:45.580
You just want it for the
performance upgrades

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.620
that it's going to give you
when you're using your computer

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:49.920
on a day to day basis
so take a look at this.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.780
This is the
Patriot Warp V2.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.120
It's a 2.5 inch
MLC SSD.

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.220
It comes in 32, 64 and
128 gigabyte flavors.

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.500
This is the 32, I've got
the 128 right here.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.360
They actually all
perform identical,

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:05.590
they're just
different capacities.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.440
And my favorite one so far, even
though they're all the same,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.310
is the 32 because
of the price.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.970
For the price of one Western
Digital Velociraptor drive,

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.710
you can get two 
of these 32s,

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:19.580
and have a RAID 0 array
with 64 gigabytes of capacity

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.220
and you're going to get some
serious performance numbers

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.920
out of these things.  Now,
these Patriot Warps V2s

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:27.250
are the second version
of the Patriot Warp SSDs

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.490
and they are actually
very very fast.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.520
The reason that they're
so special I think

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.390
is because they're still using
the JMicron 602 controller

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.700
which is not exactly
the best controller.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.130
It's the one that's been
giving stuttering problems

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.830
to a lot of the first
solid state drives

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.070
the first gen-ones
that were all expensive.

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.940
They stuttered when they wrote,
they stuttered when they read.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.010
They would have a really
low read/write speed,

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.680
minimum, and then a
really high max,

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:51.080
and the average would be
somewhere in the middle.

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:54.980
These are not like that. Somehow
even without using a cache buffer

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.050
simply using the
JMicron 602 controller

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.720
these things are
absolutely incredible

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.590
using their multi-layer cell
NAND memory.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.820
They're actually 
really really fast

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.050
and they're great for 
desktops in a RAID array

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.330
or in a netbook
or a notebook.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.390
I threw one into this thing,
and I tell you what

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.350
it got so much faster,
and not only is it faster

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.960
it's also lighter,
it produces less heat,

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:17.800
it's shock-proof
and all that stuff

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:19.910
is really really good
for a notebook

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.180
or for a laptop.  They're 
also more efficient

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.450
so you get better
battery life.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.110
Now let's talk a little bit 
about benchmarking these things

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:27.580
because I did do 
some benchmarks here.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.080
Now I want to tell you about
my setup first of all.

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.520
Vista 64 stock configuration,
no type of upgrades

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.960
for solid state drives.  There
are some tweaks

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:37.710
that you can do to Vista
and especially to Windows 7

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.320
to get faster SSD performance
and I did none of those.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.800
I wanted this to be
a baseline test,

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.070
I didn't want this to have numbers
that I couldn't reproduce later.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.770
It's on a regular computer,
it's a Core i7 965,

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.000
which is not really
that regular

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.230
but whatever, the processor
has nothing to do with it.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.110
ICH10R South Bridge chip set
64-bit Vista, SP1,

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.380
pretty much stock but with
a lot of drivers,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.650
I've been installing
software on it

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:01.280
so it's not like
a fresh install,

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.520
this is going to give
you real world performance.

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.780
I didn't load the OS on it,
I kept it as a separate drive

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.810
to give you real
read and write speeds

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:08.290
and here is
what I got.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.160
First of all for
sequential read,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.430
I'm going to give you minimum,
the maximum and the average.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.700
107 megabytes per 
second minimum,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.400
144 megabytes per
second maximum,

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:18.630
which is 
very high,

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.700
and the average was 
131 megabytes per second.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
So that's very fast, remember,
imagine two of these in RAID 0.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:26.500
Alright, you can get 
two in RAID 0

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:27.940
for the price of
one velociraptor,

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.180
and it'll be even faster
than those numbers

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.150
I just told you so keep that in
mind because these are awesome.

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.510
Now write speeds, 
this is where you see

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:41.390
the weak point of
a multi-layer cell SSD drive

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.630
but it's still nothing to sneer
at, pretty good performance.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.890
Minimum 9.2 
megabytes per second.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:47.610
So that is kind of slow,
it was stuttering,

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.600
but it's not that bad,
it's still really good.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.440
Maximum 91.4, 
very very high number.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.170
So that's really good.
Average came out to 52.8,

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.640
which is still very 
very good performance.

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:02.180
Probably slightly slower
than a regular platter drive

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:04.090
for writing but
it doesn't matter.

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:05.650
Another thing is that if
you put these in RAID,

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:08.120
and you actually
get a RAID card

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.190
even an affordable RAID card
that has on board cache buffers,

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.720
since these have none, you'll
get a huge performance gain

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.430
because that 
JMicron 602 controller

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:16.690
won't be the weak
point any more.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.390
0.2 access time, 0.2 ms access
time is very fast,

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.900
and 3.1% CPU usage
is also very good

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.170
and my favorite part
about these things,

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.830
besides the fact that it's
like 1.5 million hours

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.460
mean time 
between failures

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.700
is that they do come with
a 2-year warranty

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.570
instead of one
year warranty

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.200
so you don't have to worry
about them breaking,

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:34.650
or you being a 
first time adopter.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.380
It's no big deal.
So I really really like these.

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.510
They're very 
very affordable SSDs.

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.020
They give you probably
the highest performance

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.390
for the buck.  
Best bang for buck

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.450
and they come in 128,
32 and there is also a 64.

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:50.790
