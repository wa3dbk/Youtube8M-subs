00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.410
Like a comet, our solar system has a tail.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.560
It has never actually been observed. Until now. NASA's 

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:20.740
Interstellar Boundary Explorer, or IBEX recently mapped the boundaries

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.950
of the solar system's tail, called the heliotail. By combining

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:29.130
observations from the first three years of IBEX imagery, scientists have mapped

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.250
out a tail that shows a combination of fast and slow moving 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.440
particles. IBEX can map such regions because it uses a technique called energetic

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.540
neutral atom imaging. An energetic charged particle 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.650
in the outer heliosphere hits a hydrogen atom, stealing its electron

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.790
and becoming neutral. It then travels straight, though some of them come back

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:53.930
toward the inner heliosphere. They're they collide with IBEX, and are 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.960
detected. By plotting out such neutral atoms and where they came from, 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.990
IBEX has recently been able to describe the tail streaming behind the solar

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.050
system. The tail is composed of solar wind plasma and magnetic 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.180
field. The solar wind streams out from the sun in all directions, out

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.260
past the farthest planets. It eventually slows down, 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.340
bending back along the tail, due to pressure from the interstellar gas and magnetic

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.470
field. Based on the map of the heliotail, if we could look straight 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:26.560
down the tail, we would see a shape a little like a four-leaf clover. 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.640
The two side leaves are filled with slow moving particles, and the 

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:34.760
upper and lower leaves with fast ones. This is in line with how 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.890
the sun releases fast solar wind near its poles, and slower wind 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.970
near its equator. The four-leaf clover does not align perfectly with 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.020
the solar system. The entire shape is rotated slightly. 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.100
This indicates that as it moves farther away from the sun's magnetic influence 

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.170
the charge particles have begun to be pulled into a new orientation,

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.250
aligning with the magentic field of the local galaxy.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.330
Scientists still do not know how long the tail is, but think that it 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:07.370
eventually fades away and becomes indistinguishable from the rest of 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.410
interstellar space. Together, data from instruments in space 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.460
and analysis at labs on the ground will continue to improve our understanding 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.490
of the comet-like tails streaming out behind us.
