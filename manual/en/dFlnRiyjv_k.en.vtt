00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:06.129
All transitions is tough and university
is no different, but there is help

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:07.129
to help you get by.

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:11.360
I just finished the first year
success program at Memorial University

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.880
and I'm looking to start my second year
in the next couple of months. First year

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.730
success is a program to help you

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.769
adapt to university and get ready for the
workload and the environment

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.390
that university presents.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.340
 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.190
 

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:31.340
 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.189
 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.520
 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:36.940
 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:38.540
 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.190
 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.860
I wasn't sure what exactly I wanted to
do at university and I thought first year

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.030
success would be a good way to

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.140
figure out what I wanted to do and how
to move forward in the future.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.490
My name is Katrina Boland and I just finished my first year at Memorial University.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.300
I was a part of the first year success
program

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.930
and I found it was was a really great experience for me. It's a great transition from high

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.290
school to university.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.080
You really get to know your professors well and you can ask as many questions as you

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.060
want to always be there to help you.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.850
There is also academic advisors and career advising

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.930
and they're there to help you to. The
class sizes are fairly small so

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:18.640
you get to make friends and know people.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.060
 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.830
 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.900
 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.260
I met a lot of people that I still keep in contact with.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.390
When you come into university a main thing you need is to use the library.

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.480
Just being able to a

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:45.130
understand the library and being able to use the library properly is

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.200
essential to surviving university.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.330
University is tough, although there is a lot of work

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:54.550
and more is expected of you, the FYS program has

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:57.580
support there to help you get through
it. The professors

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.490
are there to provide you with the tools
needed to succeed in university, not just

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:03.290
for first-year

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.520
but in the years to come as well. Were
here to make something of ourselves and

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.250
I think

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.190
to feel that sense of accomplishment at the end of the day was very satisfying.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:15.990
 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.160
 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.230
