00:00:00.011 --> 00:00:02.469
ANNOUNCER: President Jimmy Carter.

00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:07.404
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:07.404 --> 00:00:10.275
JIMMY CARTER: Thank you, thank you.

00:00:10.937 --> 00:00:13.037
Well, it's a great honor for me to be here today, and

00:00:13.037 --> 00:00:18.249
it reminds me of my favorite cartoon in the New Yorker magazine

00:00:19.003 --> 00:00:21.060
this little boy is looking up at his father

00:00:21.737 --> 00:00:25.404
he says "Daddy, when I grow up, I want to be a former president."

00:00:25.404 --> 00:00:27.715
[LAUGHTER]

00:00:27.715 --> 00:00:30.470
Well, four of us have already made that goal

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.068
and one is still working on it

00:00:32.068 --> 00:00:34.270
but it is a wonderful thing to be with the other presidents

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.653
and to have a chance to address this wonderful audience.

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:41.103
I'll be very brief and I'll be limiting my comments just

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:43.085
to the things that I know personally

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.853
that have been important for me and for George W. Bush.

00:00:48.069 --> 00:00:50.503
In, uh, 2000, as some of you may remember

00:00:50.503 --> 00:00:53.111
there was a disputed election for several weeks

00:00:53.604 --> 00:00:57.570
and finally when President Bush became president

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.620
they had the inauguration in Washington on schedule

00:01:01.374 --> 00:01:04.874
and I think my wife and I were the only two volunteer Democrats

00:01:04.874 --> 00:01:06.469
on the platform

00:01:07.669 --> 00:01:10.403
and George and Laura afterwards came up

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:12.028
and thanked us for coming

00:01:12.936 --> 00:01:16.639
and so he said "Now, if there's anything I can ever do for you, let me know."

00:01:17.209 --> 00:01:19.070
Which was a mistake he made.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.375
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:20.375 --> 00:01:22.541
I said, "Mr. President, the Carter Center has programs

00:01:22.541 --> 00:01:25.736
in 35 countries in the world, and the worst problem now

00:01:25.736 --> 00:01:29.729
is a war going on between North and South Sudan,

00:01:30.791 --> 00:01:33.137
and millions of people are being killed. And I'd like for you

00:01:33.137 --> 00:01:36.537
to help us have a peace agreement there."

00:01:37.168 --> 00:01:39.408
And in a weak moment, he said, "I'll do it."

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.136
And I said, "when I can meet your Secretary of State and your National Security Advisor?"

00:01:44.136 --> 00:01:48.285
He said, "Well, I haven't even chosen them, yet. But give us three weeks."

00:01:48.624 --> 00:01:52.403
So three weeks later I came up and met with Colin Powell and Condoleeza Rice

00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:55.012
and President Bush kept his promise.

00:01:55.336 --> 00:01:59.708
He appointed our distinguished senator from Missouri, John Danforth

00:01:59.708 --> 00:02:03.503
and a great general from Kenya named [???].

00:02:03.503 --> 00:02:10.836
And in January of 2005, there was a peace treaty between North and South Sudan.

00:02:11.236 --> 00:02:14.236
that ended a war that had been going for 21 years.

00:02:14.236 --> 00:02:16.236
George W. Bush is responsible for that.

00:02:16.236 --> 00:02:22.503
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:22.503 --> 00:02:26.737
And that was the first of his great contributions to the countries in Africa

00:02:26.737 --> 00:02:29.268
As has already been mentioned briefly here

00:02:29.268 --> 00:02:32.904
he increased the development assistance to Africa

00:02:32.904 --> 00:02:35.170
from the time he went in office until he left

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.536
from 1.4 billion dollars to the more than 9 billion dollars

00:02:39.536 --> 00:02:43.051
and that's an increase of 640 percent.

00:02:43.436 --> 00:02:45.277
That is development assistance.

00:02:45.277 --> 00:02:47.668
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:47.668 --> 00:02:49.098
He established the PEPFAR program

00:02:49.437 --> 00:02:52.669
There were 50,000 HIV sufferers in Africa being treated when he

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:53.958
came into office.

00:02:54.143 --> 00:02:56.570
When he left office, per year, 2 million

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:58.620
I'll let you figure the percentage on that.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.752
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:59.752 --> 00:03:01.269
And now with his new institute

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:04.011
he has a program called "Pink Ribbon, Red Ribbon"

00:03:05.104 --> 00:03:07.810
To save women from cervical and breast cancer

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.669
in Subsaharan Africa

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:11.809
and that's, again, is something that's dear to my heart

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:15.571
and I know means a lot to millions of people in Africa

00:03:15.571 --> 00:03:20.169
So, Mr. President, let me say I'm filled with admiration for you.

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.309
And deep gratitude for you

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:26.237
about the great contributions you've made to the most needy people on earth.

00:03:26.237 --> 00:03:28.169
Thank you very much.

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:29.761
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:29.761 --> 00:03:30.000
GEORGE BUSH: Thank you.
