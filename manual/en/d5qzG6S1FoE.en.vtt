00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.669
This is Ron Paul with your weekly update for
January 30th.

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:09.490
The Federal Reserve's interest rate price-setting
board, the FOMC, met last week.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.910
They will continue to set the federal funds
rate at well below 1%, and plan to keep it

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.120
low until the end of 2014.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:23.340
That's a year and half longer than they planned
when they met just last month.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.630
Chairman Bernanke says they are keeping interest
rates so low for so long because the economic

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:31.420
outlook warrants it.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.450
The fallacies in their reasoning would be
amusing if they weren't so dangerous.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.440
The Fed wants to keep the price of money at
essentially zero - in other words "free" - to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.910
boost the economy.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.600
But the boost they are attempting won't get
here for another three years.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.030
That's not a recovery.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.440
And we've already tried this tactic.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.120
That's how we got into this mess in the first
place: with interest rates artificially low

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.020
for a very long time.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:04.070
Free money doesn't stimulate growth, as Japan's
two lost decades clearly show.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.360
Artificially low interest rates only serve
to punish saving, distort market signals,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.720
and cause further malinvestment.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:16.800
They also do nothing to address the only real
solution to our economic woes: liquidation

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:23.290
of the bad debt that hangs around the neck
of the world's economy, preventing recovery.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.600
Artificially low interest rates merely ensure
that we remain a debt-financed consumer economy

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.250
guaranteed to end up with a weaker economy
and higher prices.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.960
What baffles me even more is that two decades
after the collapse of Soviet planning and

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.060
decades more since the U.S. and economists
purportedly rejected the idea of price setting,

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:50.270
we find nothing wrong with the Fed setting
the price of money.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.280
We all agree it is a bad idea to have a board
saying the price of wheat should be $250 a

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.850
ton today, or carpenters wages should be $25
an hour until the end of 2014.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.670
But we are perfectly comfortable with having
a board set the price of one half of every

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.780
transaction in our economy.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.390
And our markets are supposedly free.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.030
The Fed policies of low interest rates, Operation
Twist, and rounds of quantitative easing are

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.270
all attempts to keep the economy alive artificially.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.730
But the 12 FOMC participants cannot manage
the economy any better than the bureaucrats

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.610
of the Soviet Union.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.490
The policies haven't worked.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:33.130
They won't work.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.670
Real economic recovery cannot come until we
liquidate the bad debt, until we eradicate

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:44.170
the poor decisions we made over the last decade,
and start with a sound foundation.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.459
It is time we acknowledge the truth of the
Fed's activities: they are merely using fancy

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.200
words for price setting.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.260
Treasury Secretary Andrew Mellon was correct
in the 1920s when he said "liquidate everything."

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:05.630
That's what we did in the severe depression
of 1920-21, and we recovered so quickly it

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.130
is never even talked about.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:14.010
We didn't take his advice after the 1929 crash,
and ended up with the Great Depression.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:19.489
We are committing the same mistakes, destined
to live in this Great Recession for a decade

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:25.890
or more - it has already been four years,
the Fed says it will be at least three more!

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.580
It's time we start rethinking what the Fed's
policies are really doing to our economy,

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:36.650
because obviously, by their own admission,
they haven't helped.

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.319
Thanks for calling.
