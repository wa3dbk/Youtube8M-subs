00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:06.470
Tactical Espionage Action. There's no question
that the PlayStations's Metal Gear Solid was

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:12.660
a revolution in video game design. But the
N64 offered up a third person stealth/shooter

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.130
of its own, and although it's often-forgotten,
WinBack's innovations continue to influence

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:25.130
game design to this day.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.400
Jean-Luc Cougar is a member of the elite Strategic
Covert Actions Team, which has been dispatched

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:49.339
to the GULF security complex. The installation
has been taken over by the Crying Lions terrorist

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.329
organization, allowing them control of a weaponized
satellite straight out of GoldenEye.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.969
Unfortunately, just before their drop-point,
the team's helicopter is hit, and Jean-Luc's

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:04.070
comrades are scattered. As Jean-Luc, you must
work your way through the GULF installation,

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.860
reconnect with your lost teammates, take down
Crying Lions' own rogues gallery, and... save

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.250
the world.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.770
WinBack's controls are a complex, but beautiful
thing to behold. Running up to a wall and

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:20.040
tapping A will allow you to back onto the
surface. From there, you can watch and wait

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:25.640
for targets as they come by. Hold R to pop
out from around the corner, and tap A to shoot.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.600
Release R to return to the safety of the wall,
and wait to plan your next move. The game

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.340
also allows for crouching, rolling, and general
badassery.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.760
Unfortunately, WinBack's slow-moving camera
controls do hold back the action a bit. You

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:34.290
need to pan back and forth using left and
right C to get a broader view of your surroundings,

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:34.740
but this often takes long enough to leave
you stranded at the mercy of passing enemies.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.960
Once you've managed to master WinBack's controls,
the game will have you feeling like a covert

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.610
God... for a while. The title is a long affair,
lasting 31 lengthy and very same-y missions

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.670
broken up by checkpoints. Unfortunately, as
awesome as poking up or around environmental

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.290
objects and blasting away dim-witted terrorists
is, it lacks the compelling storytelling insanity

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.720
of its more famous predecessor, Metal Gear
Solid.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.010
WinBack's moveset may seem obvious now, but
for its time, it was new, brilliant, and kind

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.720
of revolutionary. It's too easy to dismiss
the game as an also-ran against its great

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.610
PlayStation influence. WinBack's innovative
cover system and laser sight shooting took

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.970
what MGS did with stealth and evolved it,
introducing the world to mechanicsthat would

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.400
go on to inspire MGS2, Killswitch, Gears of
War, Resident Evil 4, and almost every other

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.610
third-person shooter of today.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.400
WinBack ended up being ported to the PS2 in
2001 which allowed for better graphics and

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:36.160
the addition of some questionable voice acting.
The title was followed up by a poorly recieved

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:41.240
sequel in 2006, and has since been quietly
forgotten. Still, the game's legacy lives

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.560
on through its influence.

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.060
