00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.593
Hello everybody, we're here with James 2GD Harding

00:00:21.093 --> 00:00:24.462
Do you like the city (Valencia) and the event?

00:00:24.901 --> 00:00:28.048
Yeah I've been to Valencia last year at Dreamhack

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.455
that was really cool and it was a great crowd

00:00:32.593 --> 00:00:35.969
a great turnout and I'm really happy Dreamhack came by

00:00:36.088 --> 00:00:41.244
and you know, I know this is part of an already existing area

00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:45.022
the tournament area is great, the crowd is really nice

00:00:45.179 --> 00:00:47.612
and it's sunny outside and I play videogames

00:00:48.627 --> 00:00:49.963
We are happy aswell

00:00:50.451 --> 00:00:52.288
Do you know something in Spanish?

00:00:52.666 --> 00:00:54.898
Nah, absolutely nothing

00:00:55.204 --> 00:00:57.744
Nothing? Not even flaming?

00:00:57.938 --> 00:00:59.841
You should teach me how to flame people

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:03.101
Okay, if you see SingSing, if he tells you puta

00:01:03.156 --> 00:01:05.458
you can call him capullo

00:01:06.918 --> 00:01:09.704
Singsing: capullo

00:01:13.563 --> 00:01:17.557
You sadly lost two matches in a row, and we have to ask

00:01:17.424 --> 00:01:20.885
can you win a match with Weppas in your team?

00:01:21.234 --> 00:01:23.663
Well, you know like, I think if we won a game

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:26.972
with Weppas the universe would implode

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:30.099
so we are trying to make that happen

00:01:30.813 --> 00:01:33.225
We had some great strategies

00:01:33.374 --> 00:01:36.883
going up against Italian and Spanish teams

00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:39.319
We wanted to start the game off against both teams

00:01:39.747 --> 00:01:41.838
 you know, first ten minutes we were bad

00:01:42.026 --> 00:01:45.985
and then finish not as bad

00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:49.402
And in the process, you know, we stomp their faces

00:01:49.654 --> 00:01:51.441
and basically make them cry

00:01:55.151 --> 00:01:57.813
but they used our tactic, that's the problem

00:01:58.214 --> 00:02:00.499
Do they use the strat of picking anti-mage?

00:02:00.805 --> 00:02:03.186
Yeah, everyone here is an Anti-mage picker

00:02:03.637 --> 00:02:06.849
Ah, you know, we let it go in the game

00:02:06.705 --> 00:02:09.144
because we don't wanna hurt anyone's feelings

00:02:09.985 --> 00:02:14.764
But yeah it does come down to anti-mage

00:02:14.875 --> 00:02:16.645
Anti-fun, anti-fun

00:02:17.451 --> 00:02:20.835
And now, questions about The International

00:02:20.878 --> 00:02:24.339
The teams had a great time but did you expect

00:02:24.596 --> 00:02:26.845
all the roster changes and team disbands

00:02:27.245 --> 00:02:31.176
Yeah, it was always.. when you went to TI

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.453
and you hung out with a lot of teams

00:02:33.793 --> 00:02:35.651
there was always people going like

00:02:35.651 --> 00:02:38.335
"I'm not gonna be playing with him"

00:02:38.106 --> 00:02:40.402
and maybe someone doesn't like one guy

00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:43.543
so we already knew that most of the teams

00:02:43.544 --> 00:02:45.762
were gonna have roster changes after TI

00:02:46.396 --> 00:02:49.308
And you know, the gdstudio, we like to do 

00:02:49.482 --> 00:02:51.298
some tournaments for DotA

00:02:51.873 --> 00:02:55.672
and were like "we can't do them directly after TI

00:02:56.081 --> 00:02:57.190
we have to wait 2 months"

00:02:57.356 --> 00:03:01.143
So I think within 2 months time the teams will reform

00:03:01.083 --> 00:03:03.139
in a different way and then we'll see

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:08.947
Let's hope

00:03:09.539 --> 00:03:12.690
And please in exclusive for our website:

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:13.911
Who is Icefrog?

00:03:14.377 --> 00:03:19.656
Everyone thinks Icefrog is a man

00:03:19.988 --> 00:03:27.136
Maybe it's a woman, maybe... you said it was Bruno

00:03:27.323 --> 00:03:29.374
but I'm not very fond of that

00:03:30.034 --> 00:03:31.980
Is Icefrog even a real person?

00:03:32.184 --> 00:03:38.442
I don't know, maybe it's you! Maybe 2GD is Icefrog

00:03:38.813 --> 00:03:40.341
Maybe a Spanish player

00:03:40.753 --> 00:03:41.810
Yeah!

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:44.731
Well, are you out of the tournament already?

00:03:44.798 --> 00:03:47.440
Oh, no no, we're gonna play Fnatic next

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:50.483
Actually the reason we've been losing is

00:03:50.837 --> 00:03:52.966
we've been holding a lot of strategies back

00:03:52.962 --> 00:03:55.250
Fnatic, they just wouldn't leave us alone

00:03:57.863 --> 00:03:59.891
Yeah, I see Trixi and everyone

00:04:00.164 --> 00:04:01.975
Because they know we're the team to beat

00:04:02.058 --> 00:04:05.155
and I'm okay dropping this early games

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.157
just to take down Fnatic

00:04:07.568 --> 00:04:09.670
Yeah, you are making the PPY and na'vi tactic

00:04:09.564 --> 00:04:13.652
you make the show: you lose and then you comeback

00:04:13.162 --> 00:04:14.667
Like, right now everyone thinks

00:04:14.968 --> 00:04:19.241
we are MTW skill and soon we'll be EG

00:04:19.268 --> 00:04:23.549
So we are gonna EG-Fnatic

00:04:24.675 --> 00:04:29.212
So, for the end, any shout-outs?

00:04:29.383 --> 00:04:34.161
No really. Just it's a great event here in Valencia

00:04:33.648 --> 00:04:35.455
the Spanish community is really cool

00:04:35.534 --> 00:04:37.412
if you have time to come down and check it out 

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:40.058
you should, and keep playing Dota 2 

00:04:40.437 --> 00:04:42.370
And if you are upset because 

00:04:42.713 --> 00:04:44.188
of the low performance of the 2gdteam don't worry

00:04:44.491 --> 00:04:47.287
we'll be fine by The International 3

00:04:47.497 --> 00:04:49.700
and the gdteam will be represented

00:04:52.804 --> 00:04:56.777
Well, bye to everyone and check GamersespaÃ±oles.com
