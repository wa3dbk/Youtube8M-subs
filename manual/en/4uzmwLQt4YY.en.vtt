Hi everyone! Welcome to Keith's Toy Box.

00:00:03.085 --> 00:00:06.785
Today's surprise toy is a chatting little yellow friend.

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.280
Can you guess what it is?

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.720
It's the McDonalds Happy Meal Chatting Bob minion from the 2015 Minions movie.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.900
So let's open the bag and take a look.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.340
There's bob.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.960
Bob is a short and bald minion.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.700
He has multi-colored eyes, one green and one brown.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.020
He is child-like who finds love in everything.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.920
He has an on and off switch at the back and a speaker.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.340
Let's turn him on.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.500
And press this button.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:18.040

Now for more fun, we can combine him with the rest of the McDonalds Happy Meal minions.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.040
Then for even more fun, we can combine them with the happy meal minions from 2013.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.700
There they all are.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:08.580
