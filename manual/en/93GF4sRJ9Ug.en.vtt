00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:08.621
Hinata: It's because I hate to lose.

00:00:10.287 --> 00:00:14.896
When I'm working on something this hard, I don't want to lose to anyone.

00:00:24.658 --> 00:00:29.231
Hinata: I'm much more of a sore loser than most people think.

00:00:36.551 --> 00:00:41.999
Hinata: I've only been fighting for five years, so I'm still curious as to how far I can go.

00:00:48.894 --> 00:00:53.237
Hinata: I think it was at the end of my Junior year of college.

00:00:53.137 --> 00:00:57.272
There was talk that If you won that tournament, then you could be in MAX.

00:00:57.141 --> 00:01:02.581
But when I lost in the semi-finals, I thought I might have to start looking for a real job.

00:01:02.481 --> 00:01:09.981
I was told, "You fight well so you should keep going. You can probably be champion."

00:01:17.356 --> 00:01:23.820
Hinata: Losing when you're a student and losing when you're a pro is totally different.

00:01:24.868 --> 00:01:26.968
I can't afford to lose anymore.

00:01:31.635 --> 00:01:36.644
Hinata: My friends and family cheered me own so I didn't feel like quitting.

00:01:37.494 --> 00:01:41.442
I don't think I'm cut out for anything else.

00:01:45.847 --> 00:01:50.822
The stronger I get, the more people respect me and the more my life changes.

00:01:51.828 --> 00:01:55.035
If I'm gonna try something, I want to become the best at it.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.683
Yamamoto: I never felt like I want to be stronger.

00:02:00.068 --> 00:02:04.290
I have no idea what that means.

00:02:09.682 --> 00:02:15.152
Yamamoto: I'm really a sore loser. It's not that I want to win, but I hate to lose.

00:02:15.264 --> 00:02:23.345
My team cheers on my wanting not to lose and that's how I became a sore loser.

00:02:24.092 --> 00:02:26.908
Yamamoto: I sometimes feel like I shouldn't be fighting.

00:02:26.908 --> 00:02:28.127
No. Really.

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.808
Yamamoto: I really don't want to be the best.

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:48.016
But I don't want to disappoint those who have gotten me this far.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.820
So I would like to be someone who wants to be on top.

00:03:31.621 --> 00:03:34.231
Hinata: I think he's a great guy outside the ring.

00:03:34.231 --> 00:03:36.715
Yamamoto: I think Hinata is a great guy.

00:03:37.127 --> 00:03:40.733
Hinata: It's a battle of the good guys, but I hate to lose.

00:03:40.904 --> 00:03:47.485
Yamamoto: A lot of people are supporting me, so I have to win. But I don't mind if they cheer on both of us.

00:04:03.492 --> 00:04:09.412
Hinata: I'm not trying to become number one in Japan, but in the world.

00:04:09.375 --> 00:04:14.930
Yamamoto: Last year I was second, so I've only got the top to shoot for.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:21.584
Even though that's what I'm aiming for, I don't think I ready for it.

00:04:21.584 --> 00:04:29.205
I'll win the first fight and then do my best to win all three fights.
