00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:16.680
Ever since pool or billiards has existed, mathematicians and physicists have had these thought experiments about mathematical pool and mathematical billiards.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:24.420
Because it's great for working out how a particle, or in this case, a pool ball, will rebound against the sides, and where it will go.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.400
So I thought "enough of these thought experiments, lets build one!"

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.500
The shape is an ellipse, and ellipses are an interesting type of shape, because they can come in a infinite number of varieties.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:47.820
The geometrical property of ellipses, which is why I made this table, is the fact that if you place a ball on a focus point...

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:57.180
...where ever you hit it, in which ever direction I hit it, over there, over there, over there, over there, over here, 
it will always rebound into that pocket.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.900
That is because from any point on the side, it makes the same angle to each focus point.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.500
And as you know, when you rebound something against a surface...

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.560
... the angle of incidence equals the angle of reflection.

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:17.340
Whenever it is positioned on this focus point, wherever I hit it, it will go in.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.280
If it's here, wherever I rebound it, it's never going to go in.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.940
It's only when it's exactly on this dot.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:27.480
So that's the theory, and that makes this really good fun.  I will demonstrate it.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.280
But obviously I'm a mathematician and I love things to be perfect, but this is, we're in the real world...

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.660
...so now kind of annoying physics gets in the way.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.780
Things like friction, things like the difficulty of manufacture.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.920
You also have to hit it with just the right force.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.640
For example, if I hit it really hard...

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.380
... it rebounds to this side of the pocket.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:55.760
If I hit it, but softly...

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:00.460
... it goes to the other side of the pocket.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:07.460
So obviously there is the Goldilocks hit, the one that's neither too hard nor too soft, that should get it in.

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.720
And let's see if I can do that.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.860
If I do get it in, it's really difficult.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.080
So you have to be very skilful.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:18.340
Oh, beautiful!

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.260
It's so satisfying the way it goes round and round and round. It's reminding me I got it in.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.840
Okay. So I chose to hit it over here.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.980
We can nominate any other part of the board.

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.360
Again, it's going to be difficult because I don't have much time to practice on this.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.260
I'm not a very skilled pool player.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.520
But maybe something like...

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:53.300
Oh!

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.340
[Brady]: Take the camera.  I'll get my first ever shot.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.180
It was quite..

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:12.620
Perfect!

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.700
At first I was a bit disappointed it was so difficult...

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:22.200
... and then I realized it's actually much better that it's difficult, because it's more more fun.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.740
Starting from cuing off, you put the cue ball somewhere in the line between the black and here.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.220
You've got to be thinking about this dot and how things would happen if they were coming from this dot.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:38.580
I have to hit the black on this edge...
