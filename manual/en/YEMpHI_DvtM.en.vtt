Doctor Murphy presents "Questions and Answers About the Brazilian Butt Lift." 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.210
Hi, I'm Doctor Terry Murphy.

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.580
I am a board-certified plastic surgeon and I am the Chief of Plastic Surgery

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:21.710
here at Swedish Medical Center.

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.679
Today I want to talk about body
contouring, and in particular a specific

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:29.559
body contouring procedure which has
become commonly known as a Brazilian butt lift. 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.250
In my practice I have a broad experience
in body contouring procedures,

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:41.630
probably performed easily thousands of combined things like liposuction, tummy tucks, 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:44.230
butt lifts and arm reductions.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.320
But today we're going to focus on the rear end and the kind of procedures that I  

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.440
do on patients who want to improve the
appearance of their buttock area. 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.010
Who are the candidates for a Brazilian butt lift? 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.230
In general, plastic surgeons have seen an increased demand from patients

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.080
who want to improve the appearance of the buttock area.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:07.520
I divide the patients kind of into two groups. There's maybe a younger group 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:11.410
who has good-quality skin, good elasticity, and they just want to increase the firmness 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.180
and the roundness of their buttocks.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:18.300
And there's a group who is maybe a little older and has more laxity of the skin and

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.350
we lean a little more towards 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.820
procedures which are lifting the buttock, 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.799
and also maybe adding some volume in a couple different ways as well. 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.689
The Brazilian butt lift, which is the classical procedure you hear most about 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:33.000
is a combination 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.140
where number one, you're reducing fat in the periphery of the buttock area, 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.570
to re-contour the area, and then you can save that fat and re-concentrate it 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.880
in a special way, and then reintroduce and re-inject it into the central buttock area to

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:54.120
augment and lift and round out and fill out the buttock. It's a nice procedure, it's done

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.640
as an outpatient, and minimal incisions, and a pretty easy recovery  

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:00.960
because

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.360
it's minimally invasive.

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.490
What are some of the characteristics of
the second group?

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:10.349
The other group of patients has more
laxity in their buttock and 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.819
and it's a much bigger procedure. It involves larger incisions, 

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:18.649
but it is very effective in improving the buttock. Instead of pushing the butt up like 

00:02:18.649 --> 00:02:21.430
a Brazilian butt lift, you're actually pulling it up. 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.029
So tissue is removed above the buttock area, and it kind of extends around the sides a little bit  as well,

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:29.199
so we can sometimes pull up the lateral thigh  

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:30.299
and the

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.859
tissue is introduced into a higher level, which is rounder and fuller.  

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:38.180
What is an auto-augmentation?

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.739
In some patients, instead of just
removing the upper buttock tissue, 

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:48.079
we can retain it as what's called a flap, and we can rotate that tissue down into the buttock, so as we  

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.779
pull the skin up over the top we can move that tissue down lower to round out  

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:55.679
and fill out the buttock. I call that an auto-augmentation. 

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:59.009
I like these two procedures, the Brazilian butt lift and the auto-augmentation, 

00:02:59.009 --> 00:03:03.509
because we're using only your own tissue. Very safe, complication 

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:04.729
rates are low,

00:03:04.729 --> 00:03:07.499
and satisfaction rates are very high. 

00:03:07.499 --> 00:03:10.369
What about implants in the buttocks?

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:14.430
You'll hear about patients having buttock implants placed. 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:19.469
It's not a procedure I'm really crazy
about because the quality of implant we

00:03:19.469 --> 00:03:21.419
have available here in the United States 

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:25.289
doesn't really match that which is available in the rest of the world, 

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:29.389
and a lot of patients who have buttock implants don't really like the way it feels when they sit 

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:33.449
down. It's like you're sitting on some artificial thing inside. 

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:36.909
Which brings me back to why I prefer

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:42.299
natural auto-augmentation-type procedures such as the Brazilian 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:46.229
butt lift where we are just reintroducing and re-injecting your own 

00:03:46.229 --> 00:03:47.629
fat into the area,

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:53.139
or, less commonly, the auto-augmentation where we are rotating tissue into the area. 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.829
So you can think more about buttock augmentation. If you're interested please

00:03:56.829 --> 00:04:01.939
come and see me. My name is Dr. Terry Murphy, I'm at Swedish Hospital here in  

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:02.379
Denver, Colorado.
