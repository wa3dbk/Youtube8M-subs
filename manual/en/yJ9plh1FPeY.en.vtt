00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.208
See what happens.

00:00:10.208 --> 00:00:12.208
Give it a few minutes.

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:16.417
Come back here.

00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:18.750
Here, cameraman.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.750
Pull it up, and then wind it down.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.250
That was a lovely snapper.

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:26.167
Just what we were after.

00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:28.167
That is pan material for us.

00:00:32.708 --> 00:00:35.792
That’s me scoring on Troy
right down there.

00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:39.625
Little mustache, a lot of hair,
and bodgy little shorts.

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:41.495
The first pass to Brian Going.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.167
And that’s a try to Brian Going.

00:00:44.167 --> 00:00:46.667
Oh-so-easy for the Going brothers.

00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:50.125
We started playing as kids,
like most Kiwis.

00:00:50.125 --> 00:00:51.792
We had a unique coach.

00:00:51.792 --> 00:00:56.583
He was the only one game enough
to put three brothers on one team.

00:00:56.583 --> 00:01:00.583
We had no trainers,
no idea about fitness programs.

00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:04.792
We were brutally strong from
working on the farm with Dad.

00:01:04.792 --> 00:01:07.542
It was kind of a family thing.

00:01:07.542 --> 00:01:11.208
People started to think
we had a special team.

00:01:11.208 --> 00:01:14.375
The crowds would swell to 40,000.

00:01:14.375 --> 00:01:16.208
There’d be street parades.

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:17.667
It was amazing.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.583
Brian Going, the try.

00:01:19.583 --> 00:01:23.042
It was a family affair
from the attempt by Sid Going,

00:01:23.042 --> 00:01:26.042
then a simple reverse pass
to Brian Going,

00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:29.792
the second-highest try scorer
in New Zealand this year.

00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:32.875
When you finish playing rugby,

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:36.000
you leave it for a couple of years
to let the dust settle.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.750
It makes you realize
there’s more to life than rugby.

00:01:42.833 --> 00:01:45.667
I’ve got a nice boat
that I’m proud of.

00:01:45.667 --> 00:01:48.720
I got my grandsons
a little fizz boat,

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.120
but I haven’t given it to them
because I like it myself.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.042
Most Saturdays in the summer

00:01:58.042 --> 00:02:01.125
are swallowed up by us out
there in the ocean.

00:02:03.042 --> 00:02:06.542
I believe having a family
that is close to me

00:02:06.542 --> 00:02:09.208
is the reward
of living a good life.

00:02:09.208 --> 00:02:13.000
Our dad and mum told us about
living good, clean lives.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.458
Since it was great for us,
we’ve told our children,

00:02:16.458 --> 00:02:19.333
and hopefully they’ll tell
their children.

00:02:20.583 --> 00:02:23.042
I’m a grandfather.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.600
I love rugby.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.200
I’m trying to be a great husband.

00:02:27.208 --> 00:02:29.125
I love to go fishing.

00:02:29.125 --> 00:02:30.792
My name is Brian Going,

00:02:30.792 --> 00:02:32.958
and I’m a Mormon.
