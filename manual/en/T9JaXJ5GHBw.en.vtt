Mark F. Kozloff, MD: The surgery for colorectal
cancer will differ depending upon the origination

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.310
site of the colorectal cancer.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.710
Cancers of the rectum that are near the anus
may need what we call an AP resection meaning

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.080
that everything is removed including the rectum.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:40.000
If a cancer is up higher in the rectum, one
can do less surgery meaning that one does

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.469
not need to remove the rectum, but can do
what we call a low anterior resection where

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.480
just part of the colon removed and the rectum
is left behind.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:58.549
There are different ways of doing colorectal
cancer, one can do an open type of procedure

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:06.229
where there is a larger incision, also now
people are favoring less surgical procedures

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.310
is in which one can do laparoscopic surgery.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:16.790
In any case of these surgeries, the cancer
needs to be removed, if the lymph nodes nearby

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.950
the cancer need to be removed, and one wants
adequate amount of tissue removed.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.030
We actually look at the number of lymph nodes
that are removed within the sample of the

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.110
surgery to determine, if it was an adequate
surgery.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.850
People feel that one needs to remove at least
12 or greater lymph nodes to show that it

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.130
was a good surgical resection.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:50.430
So, there are ways of checking the quality
of the surgery and the surgery does differ

00:01:50.430 --> 00:02:04.140
depending upon where the cancer originated
from.
