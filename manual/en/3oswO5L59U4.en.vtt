00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.982
Riding a motorcycle in constant fear of a

00:00:02.982 --> 00:00:05.760
crash is just as bad as over confidence

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.270
Sure, fear is a good thing because it

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:11.070
keeps you alert But it makes the ride a lot

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.320
less enjoyable

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.430
And besides, too much of anything isn’t

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.430
good for you

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.480
I have been having a lot of sex recently

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.910
Guys like Bob need to learn that

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.410
We can't have sex all the time

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.640
It's all about balance

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.010
How’s it going people, BrownBrady here,

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:25.500
and in this episode, I will show you 7

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.860
steps to gain confidence on a motorcycle

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:30.730
or at least how I did.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.780
Step 1 is to Accept the Risks and Move On

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:35.370
I’m a smoker, and I get to see a warning

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.230
label on the pack every time I pull out a

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.230
cigarette

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.830
In a way, I am accepting the risks of

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:41.670
smoking by lighting up anyway

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.980
The same can be said for riding a

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.790
motorcycle, and even more so, in North

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.300
America, because you don’t see a lot of

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.829
bikes on the roads compared to other

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.789
countries like India and China anyway.

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:54.469
Motorcycles require more focus and

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.140
concentration so you must always be ready

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.680
to avoid vehicles that will eventually cut

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:00.680
you off.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.829
And let’s be honest, to many Canadians,

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:04.890
riding a motorcycle is a hobby.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:07.180
You weren’t forced by anyone to ride a more

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.390
dangerous mode of transportation which, by

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.880
the way, is a common argument that some

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.020
drivers often use to hate on bikers.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.610
So what cause you have a Harley Davidson

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.240
You're someone like cool person

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.230
No you're a fkn ashle

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:20.280
Will you fall?

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.009
Well, some riders say there are 2 types of

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.009
bikers:

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:25.310
those who have fallen, and those who

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.369
haven’t…

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:27.430
YET…

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.970
either by your own doing, or because of

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.840
obstacles like vehicles and animals.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.250
Will you get killed?

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.310
Maybe.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.090
Think about these risks

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.259
then accept them.

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.110
Now stop thinking about them constantly

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.990
because there is nothing you can do about

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.189
things you cannot control.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.689
Step 2 is to Take a Motorcycle Safety

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:48.689
Course

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.189
This is probably the single most important

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.290
investment you’ll make

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.370
And if you cannot afford it, at least learn

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:55.479
from an experienced rider who will teach

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:56.860
you the basics like

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.860
walking your bike

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.909
startup routines

00:01:58.909 --> 00:01:59.909
accelerating

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:00.909
emergency braking

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:01.909
and counter steering

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.229
It’s better to make mistakes in a

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.121
controlled environment where you don’t have

00:02:05.121 --> 00:02:07.649
to worry other cars on the road

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.069
or people pets

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:11.459
In some riding schools, you can experiment

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.030
with other types of bikes like sportbikes,

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.620
standard, cruiser, dirt bikes

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.230
which was the case at RTI where I learned

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.471
which by the way I endorse they are a

00:02:20.471 --> 00:02:21.660
great school

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.300
As a bonus, you may get back your

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.540
investment by saving on insurance if you

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.090
took a safety course.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.290
Step 3 is Always Wear Protective Gear

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.080
Start shopping for your gear before

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.080
your bike

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.680
You can wear the same gear no matter what

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.430
type of bike you eventually get.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.650
Most motorcycle safety courses require you

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.010
to wear some gear anyway

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.650
a full face helmet offers the best

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.709
protection because it has a chin bar

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.140
It's also good to have

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:47.720
a jacket - preferably ones with built-in

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.269
armour or real leather

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.269
leather gloves

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:52.990
pants - preferably thick denim, kevlar re-

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.580
inforced or leather

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:55.769
and riding boots

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.420
You know I don’t ride around in all that

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.501
gear thinking that I’m invincible.

00:02:58.501 --> 00:03:01.580
I understand that it will only reduce the

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:04.380
extent of my injuries should I get into an

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:05.599
accident.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.019
Step 4 is to Start with a Low Powered Bike

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:09.959
Smaller bikes are more forgiving when you

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:12.239
make a mistake because they are lighter and

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:13.409
less powerful.

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:15.849
And as a general rule, anything below 500

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:17.720
cc’s is a good beginner’s bike.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.720
Why?

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.720
Because you will eventually make a

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.930
mistake or be tempted to do something

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:22.930
stupid.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:24.720
A low powered bike is more likely

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.780
to give you a second chance to keep riding,

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.190
or to call it quits.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:30.330
And here’s a special message to middle aged

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:31.860
riders like myself.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.490
Now that you are likely more financially

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.190
capable of making that dream bike as your

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:39.610
first, try to resist that temptation.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.340
Unless of course you’re happy with a small

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:42.340
bike.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:43.340
once you have your beginners bike,

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.450
understand all the switches, knobs, and

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.450
what not.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.750
And guess what, since a smaller bike is

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.940
cheaper, you might be able to afford to get

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.940
one with ABS.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.010
However, this is not a reason for you to

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:55.560
slam on the brakes in the middle of a turn.

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.110
They are great for keeping the bike's

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.060
wheels from locking up during emergency

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:00.060
braking.

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.110
Again, don’t skip that beginner’s bike,
and

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:04.379
believe me, if it is not your dream bike,

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:06.709
it won’t be your last purchase.

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:09.400
Step 5 is to Practice in Empty Lots and

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.400
Work Your Way Up

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.790
Don’t ride in public roads immediately.

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:13.790
Don't rush it.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.019
Build upon what you learned from your

00:04:15.019 --> 00:04:16.970
motorcycle safety course first.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.570
Some things you may not have learned

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:19.570
include:

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:20.759
using the turn signals with head checks.

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:21.759
low speed turns.

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:23.620
and coming to a stop at a slope

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.750
because where I learned

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:26.940
everything was flat but in the real world

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:27.940
that's not true

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:29.550
sometimes I may have to angle the bike a

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.440
certain way so that I can keep the bike

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.440
upright

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.810
Practice clutching, signalling, and braking

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.550
until you can do them without taking your

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.770
eyes away off the road.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.600
Then move up to a low traffic street and

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.860
put your skills to the test.

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.400
start with minimal distractions --- put

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:44.660
away your vlogging equipment for now.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:46.380
because there are already enough distracted

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.560
drivers that you need to look out for.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.280
And when you eventually make it up to high

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.490
traffic roads, you will need to look out

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:53.490
for:

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.880
other new drivers or riders

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.580
they may change lanes without signalling

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.930
red light beaters

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.240
drunk drivers

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.780
bicyclists and joggers

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:01.780
J-walkers

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.270
and animals
Step 6 is to Be a Defensive Rider

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.500
When I had a sailboat, I was taught that a

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.430
good skill was knowing when not to sail or

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:11.720
when to call it a day.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.860
Learn to identify things that can affect

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.780
your ride like poor weather or poor road

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.990
conditions, problems with your bike, or

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.020
even your mood.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.169
Ride like you are invisible, so to speak,

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:24.480
because many drivers will not see you

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.480
approaching.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:26.710
Do not assume that they can see you.

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.950
So always be aware of situations and have

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.650
at least 1 escape path.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.699
Avoid riding too aggressively because

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:35.419
overconfidence gives you a false sense of

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:36.419
security.

00:05:36.419 --> 00:05:37.730
If you want to get into advanced riding

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.050
skills such as racing and stunting, learn

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:42.680
them off of the public roads.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:43.680
Keep your cool

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:44.820
you will be cut off,

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:47.410
remember, you accept that risk in step 1?

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:49.900
But if you have already lost your cool,

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.810
sometimes it’s better to pull over and

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:52.810
relax for a bit.

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.740
I don’t try to be a model rider, but at

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.370
least I try not to set a bad example for

00:05:57.370 --> 00:05:58.370
all of us.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.560
And finally, Step 7 is to Get Roadside

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.560
Assistance

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:02.960
When something goes wrong with your bike,

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.539
like a flat, a dead battery, or running out

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:07.540
of fuel, road side assistance can help.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:09.970
Also, a first aid kit would come in handy

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:11.540
if you are stuck in the middle of nowhere

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:12.540
with an injury.

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:14.740
It also helps, to tell someone about your

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:17.060
road trip so that they know the route

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:18.060
you’re taking.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.850
In case you end up in a ditch somewhere,

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.960
they have an idea where to look.

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.320
Anyway guys and gals, the point of this

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:25.560
blog is not to eliminate fear, but to

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.560
manage it.
