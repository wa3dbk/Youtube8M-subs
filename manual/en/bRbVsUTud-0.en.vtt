00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
I begin this duel by summoning Roid-Rage, Guardian of Testosterone!

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.500
YEAH!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Prepare to get dominated, Yugi Sparkle!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.500
You're not going to get away with this Pinkie Kaiba!

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.000
I summon Derpy Hooves, and equip her with the Muffin of Deliciousness!

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
The baked goods increase her Friendship level by 20 Percent!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.500
WHAT!?!?!?! No way!

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.000
Derpy obliterates Roid-Rage, sending him to the graveyard!

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Next I'll place one card face down. Your move, Pinkie.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Your childish endeavors are pathetic!

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I summon the Blue-Eyes White Scootaloo, in attack mode!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.500
Next, I use Wrath of the Hater!

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.033
This magic card uses Hatred and Pessimism, causing Derpy to change to defense mode.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Not so fast! You activated my trap card: Love and Tolerance!

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
It causes Derpy to love and tolerate your Hater card, negating it's effect!

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.500
Nice try, but my Blue-Eyes White Scootaloo is still more powerful than Derpy Hooves!

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.000
Scootaloo, attack with White Lightning!

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.500
Oh No! If I can't get a good card, I'm going to lose!

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.000
If I can just believe in the Friendship of the Cards, I can win.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.500
What's taking her so long?

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.000
Woah! My thinking voice sounds funny!

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
ECHO!!! WOOOO!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Oh! I almost forgot! I'm still in a duel.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Quit stalling and play your last pathetic card!

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I call upon Celestia, GODDESS OF THE SUN!!!

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
WHAT?!?!?! That's impossible!

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Harnessing the power of the Elements of Harmony, Celestia utterly ANNIHILATES Scootaloo

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
bringing your Friendship points to zero!

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.000
NOOOOooooo!
