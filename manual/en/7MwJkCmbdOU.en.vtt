00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.410
one more somewhat racial is attacked as
more mean-spirited than any other sport

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.000
so at the same time understandable

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.729
begins present all bomber on the issue
of dogs now

00:00:10.729 --> 00:00:14.170
it's understandable because mitt romney
has been taking a lot of heat

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.480
for police she misses family dog

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.240
on the roof risk our nineteen
eighty-three for twelve hour ride the

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.330
strap report doctor lou

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.359
but yet they have open it at all

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.199
somali state ahead i so they got to
divert attention they noticed that in

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.539
dreams of my father

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.640
uh... president bomb wrote in his book
ten two thousand four yet that weight he

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.460
was in indonesia is a six or seven year
old

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:42.260
that his stepfather had better some
questionable stoplight biggest mate

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.159
adding that in a dog because it's partly
indonesia culture et cetera fifty he's a

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:51.030
kid he has no say in this he's not
prepared meals

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.759
it's not like he's like a kiwi regarded
here

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:56.920
right now and i know that but of course
nonetheless

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:58.749
here come the republicans

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:01.599
that's going to hit a couple things
today and diverted attention from the

00:01:01.599 --> 00:01:03.220
shame is controversy

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.140
and plus there is a you know i don't
know if it's a racial overtone whatever

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.940
it is

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.520
so let's show you some of the pictures
is the barbarians not like yes exactly

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.220
analogous porter morbid

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.210
for now rather than racial rage

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.920
so value they get a picture of a up here
they've been doing imeem on this he got

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.680
a million of these here's one bono's
barbecue

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.090
and in that president obama chasing down
as poor dog haha kiki they've got a

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.810
bunch of the pictures were he's eating a
hot dog with us in the shape of a dog

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.479
and is applied that bothered me

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:35.150
uh... john mccain send out a tree down
this yeah

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.960
you've got a b above this exceed john
mccain's campaign

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.190
very it was not racist against president
while making the samples from all racial

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:45.580
stop no question

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:49.690
but i'll let me john mccain of from
police have gone from bangladesh he

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.750
didn't like the one aids through the
racial suffered and the man

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:55.250
the bush team did but here he trys out

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.210
good pick up my son jimmy's bulldog
apollo

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:01.390
i'm sorry mister president he's not on
the menu

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.140
accommoda

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.710
don't do that don't do that you know for
michael

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:10.099
gridlocked you know we spent a lot of
time on the show we have since united

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.099
star due in two thousand two like try to
figure out what people want

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:17.890
dreaded outright arnaud mileage is john
mccain just thought that was funny

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:21.170
like you shave a storyline at nine oh
but he's going to be there for a little

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.979
bit boesak here's what john mccain
doesn't even though he's in general

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.269
much better than most republicans on
race

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:28.569
one of these guys

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:29.450
i think it through

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.379
none of them are sensitive

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:34.419
yet either john it seems hard to the
right place obviously

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:37.920
means uh... served with uh... with black
eyes answer

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.720
with uh... hispanic guys and they've
served under of the trust you know that

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.179
he's all right on it but still is just
not

00:02:44.179 --> 00:02:47.539
uh... i might just doesn't believe in
colonel managed by irritated that

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:48.890
there's this response

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.700
yet an answer to a party was asked about
this whole white house spokesperson

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.740
uh... hit a funny retort i think we're
talking about a reference in this book

00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:02.089
to period when he was six or seven years
old

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:04.909
making a big deal out of it sounds like
somebody is trying to get out of the

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.699
doghouse on something

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:12.060
now recision it was the same error

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.589
market

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:18.019
inbounds out about satire about uh...
pass from the book

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.499
i mean irrelevant

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:22.949
i don't think so i think it's meant i
hate that chandrika

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:27.629
acting all really hate decade stuff i
hate sounds from formulaic to me it's

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:28.209
like

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:31.450
that you are referenced shameless but i
would reference

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:36.489
out of the nineteen sixty seven years
old the electrons dog to the car

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:37.799
acquitted exported

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:39.089
right uh...

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:42.630
i'm afraid fighting is out of balance
idea why they did it

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:46.399
pays out about us because it's really
gonna feet into the hallway side

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:48.329
of the right wing in this country

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.459
you know how many emails in the center
on on that

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:53.790
yeah all this kind of stuff that they
love it's the same guides us on the girl

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:57.149
email someday they keep this up

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:58.000
so a lot

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.909
i have

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.379
no i i agree with you thought about that
oh i don't think i think because there's

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:03.349
a

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:07.120
because of the shame is connection a
number of the people would be a genetic

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.870
again doesn't occur to them in any way
that you know i i i will give john

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:13.230
mccain pass out that he would be in
racial

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.380
right at all but the other over but the
guys like the good guys is something to

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.000
really emails around that's that

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.549
bells and whistles until aristide
