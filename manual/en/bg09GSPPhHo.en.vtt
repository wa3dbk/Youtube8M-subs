Hi my name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of
Expert Village. Today I'm going to show you

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:09.080
my favorite way to cook king crab legs. Alright
for this one we're going to need our shallots,

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:16.910
our sour cream, out butter, our flour, our
salt, and our pepper. And you're also going

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.830
to need, even though I forgot to mention this
earlier, I feel terrible, you're going to

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:26.800
need a small saut? pan to saut? your shallots.
I apologize. You're also going to need a spatula.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.890
That being said, let me show you how to do
that one. Put your saut? pan over some heat,

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:40.940
take our tablespoon of butter, drop it right
in. As soon as this melts a little bit, not

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.440
completely, just a little bit, so we can get
some oil in the pan. What I always like to

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.180
do is also something you can do, is break
it into smaller pieces. It will melt faster.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.450
What I always do is just to give my vegetables,
or my aromatics, or whatever I'm choosing

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.000
to do, more face time in the pan I guess is
a good way of putting it. A little face time.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.570
Is I just go ahead and drop them right in
there while the butter is melting. Reason

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:12.920
being, is that this will actually go through
a sweating, then a cooking stage, which is

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.660
good. It'll soften it up. If you threw them
at the very end when it was already hot, you'd

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.880
go pretty much right into cooking, and you'd
probably lose some of the subtleties of the

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.530
texture of the shallot or whatever it is you're
cooking. Because you'd go right into high

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:33.840
heat cooking, and not really leaching any
of that extra flavor out. Little bit of salt.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:41.790
Touch of pepper. Alright we're going to let
this saut? here for a couple of minutes. We'll

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.540
come back when it's a little more done, and
at that point we'll make the rue and things

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.170
like that. So see you in a couple. Alright
so here we are. It's been a couple of minutes.

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.060
Our shallots have softened up. The reason
you want to soften them up is because these

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.229
are going right into that sour cream mixture.
If they were crunchy or hard it wouldn't be

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.729
very tasty. I like to get a little color in
these before I drop them in there. It's just

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:09.140
a nice color contrast, so I want them to turn
a little browner on the edges before I throw

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:15.520
my rue in, which it's just starting to do.
I'm not trying to turn them into crispy onion

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:24.050
strips or anything. That looks about right.
Just a little tiny bit of color there. Now

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.990
we're going to sprinkle our flour across the
top. And this making the rue. What this is

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:37.870
going to do is soak up all that butter, and
give us all that buttery flavor without all

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:45.160
that oily, buttery texture. Right now it doesn't
look like it's going to, but when it cools

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:51.650
off it really will. So what we're going to
do now is go ahead and kill our heat on this.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.020
Set this aside to cool, and then later, right
before service, we'll mix it in with the sour

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:59.500
cream after it cools. So I'm actually going
to take this right here and just set it off

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:03.090
to the side, and we'll come back to it later.
In the meantime, let's check on our fortified

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:03.440
butter.
