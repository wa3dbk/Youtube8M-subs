00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.839
What we call static stretching is best used
after the activity is over. Especially after

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.190
running, especially after lifting. Another
various of that is Yoga, and that's a real

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.799
effective way to enhance your recovery from
the work out and also build some flexibility.

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.690
With Yoga, you also build some strength. This
is called the Sun Salutation. Start with a

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:31.910
tall stretch. Just really lift and reach up
towards the ceiling, head comes back. Inhale,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:45.090
legs apart, exhale, just kind of dangle. Just
relax, you never want to force a pose in Yoga.

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:55.160
Let the hands come down further, and further,
and further. Called a Downward Dog. Downward

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.190
Dog's a really good stretch for the calves.
Kind of distribute your weight equally between

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:11.139
your hands and your feet. All the poses get
held for about fifteen seconds. Little less

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:15.670
on some of the strength ones. Move into an
Alligator pose, which is a three inch push

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:25.369
up. Lifting onto the front of your feet, Cobra.
Stretch for your lower back. Back into a Downward

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:39.710
Dog. Left leg comes forward, shin perpendicular,
drop the knee on the front part of the foot,

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:58.669
look up. Downward Dog. Other leg, shin perpendicular,
drop the knee to the front part of the foot,

00:01:58.669 --> 00:02:09.590
look up. I kept my shoes on, but it's a good
thing to take your shoes off for it too. And

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:09.609
then Downward Dog.
