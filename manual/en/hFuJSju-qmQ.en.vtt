00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.840
We’re here today with Dr. Lisa Kelledy,
Director of Engagement and Retention Services

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:15.271
in the School of Marriage and Family Sciences.

00:00:15.271 --> 00:00:17.290
Lisa, thanks for being here today!

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.290
&lt;&lt; Thank you for having me.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.950
&lt;&lt; So, we want to talk to you today about
the benefits of the NCU’s one-to-one teaching

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:24.020
model.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.830
&lt;&lt; Well, the unique model that Northcentral
offers for the one-to-one teaching model offers

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:35.580
students the ability to have, like, an apprenticeship
with a faculty member that it creates this

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:44.030
relationship a very in depth, very meaningful
relationship with the faculty members in which

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.379
they are moving through their activities and
they're getting feedback, substantial feedback,

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:52.159
just from their mentor solely of their own
that they can then take and keep incorporating

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:54.120
into the following activities.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:03.199
With that relationship in itself, that one-to-one
mentor model just brings a very unique relationship

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:05.199
between faculty and students.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.560
&lt;&lt; It's not that one-to-many per se you're
really just working solely with your faculty

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:11.560
member.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.969
You're able to reach out directly to them
and know that you're getting that individualized

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:15.969
feedback.

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:16.969
&lt;&lt; Yes.

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:19.780
In our program one of the things that we like
to tell the students and the students have

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.259
actually been the ones who have actually helped
us with this metaphor is that we don't teach

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:26.779
a class, we teach a student.

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:29.090
&lt;&lt; Oh that's great!

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.340
So, what does the concept of mentoring play
into education experience at NCU especially

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.509
in MFT programs.

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:43.890
&lt;&lt; Well, you know what how the marriage a
Family Therapy field we work about in relationships

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.270
work with individuals.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.020
We work with, you know, building relationships
and connections and, you know, we meet people

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:55.319
really a tough times and so - but having this
apprenticeship model and the MFT program specifically

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.429
really helps students be able to engage in
such a way that they can learn the material

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:05.100
and then apply these skills just solely without
having to focus on what's happening with the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.020
other group members or other, you know, students
in the class they can focus solely on their

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.550
educational experience and for our field that
makes it a very rich experience because they

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:20.349
can then take that apprenticeship information
and to take that into the field with themselves.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.780
&lt;&lt; Apply it directly into their daily life
to their communities where they're living

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.909
and know that it's applicable to them.

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:27.909
&lt;&lt; Exactly.

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:30.920
You know and one of the things is sometimes
in a traditional setting, you know, they may

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.590
be afraid to raise their hand in the class
and ask a question.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:35.019
They don't have that fear here.

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:40.780
They have the, you know, the accessibility
to their faculty member and that worrying

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.720
about what everybody else is gonna be thinking
about this question they're asking, they can

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.060
ask any question any point in time.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.849
And we have the multiple mediums of Skype
or email or, you know, we have WebEx and all

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:55.530
the different programs that we use to build
face to face with them and that in itself

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.159
just creates this whole other level of experience
that they can take with them forward.

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:02.159
&lt;&lt; Sure.

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:08.890
Yeah, so how does NCU’s one-to-one teaching
model really differ from a student's experience

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:12.730
at any of the other maybe brick-and-mortar
traditional schools.

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.290
&lt;&lt; I can probably best answer that with an
example.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.920
So first I'm gonna explain how and then I'll
give an example that I think really drives

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:23.140
it home.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.950
The relationship that we're able to build
with this one-to-one Mentor model is just

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:29.519
unlike any anything else.

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:35.219
I was trained in a brick and mortar, but when
I look at the educational experience that

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:39.409
they're having, I sometimes am very envious
of what they're having that I wish that I

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:45.500
could possibly have had that because, you
know, to find my faculty when I was in my

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:52.519
in my training, it was either in their office
hours, it was in the hallway, maybe if I could

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:57.180
try to catch them between classes, yes exactly
or you know maybe a few minutes after class

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.330
but they're off to another class.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.760
And so there's very limited time.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.909
This one to one mentor model at Northcentral
what it has done has opened up a complete

00:04:06.909 --> 00:04:11.140
new arena of being able to get in touch with
your faculty.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.519
So we have Skype where we meet with them at
the beginning and all throughout their course.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:18.799
We meet with them on WebEx.

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.390
We have office hours where they have a link,
they click on the link, they can get to us.

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:27.410
With the Skype and all the faculty that we
all do this.

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:32.000
That we all tell them that, listen if you
happen to be up on and you see in Skype and

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.040
you see us on, consider that my open door
to my office.

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:40.190
So if you see that I'm on Skype and I'm available,
call me even if you don't have an appointment.

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.190
Just stop in.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.190
&lt;&lt;Sure.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:46.220
&lt;&lt; And so that really welcoming to students
and students really like that idea that if

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.590
they say and that's happened several times
on a Sunday afternoon and maybe just popped

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.890
on and all of a sudden my Skype will ring.

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.060
And it's just a two-minute conversation.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.110
And so it's very meaningful to a student to
say “Hey, could have a two-minute conversation

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:01.000
with you?” and I tell them if I'm in a meeting
and I can't answer, I won't answer, but you

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.020
know I'll call you back, or I'll send you
an email.

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.310
So you know that's one specific way that I
think that it's very different than what I

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:10.020
encountered.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.620
So another thing before I give the example,
is that the relationships that we build with

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:17.940
our students.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:25.010
I have this ability, this position has given
me this mentor model, has given me the ability

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:29.920
to be able to connect with students in a way
that I would not have been able to.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:33.640
What I mean by that is, I'm in their homes
because I'm in Skype.

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:39.381
I'm in their homes, I'm seeing their surroundings,
I am meeting their significant others, I am

00:05:39.381 --> 00:05:40.750
meeting their children.

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:45.690
I just had an interview or a face-to-face
on Skype the other day and her son was home

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.410
sick from school and I was like don't worry
about it that's fine.

00:05:48.410 --> 00:05:51.540
And I've had a conversation with him for a
few minutes.

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:55.080
One of the examples that I want to give this
probably was the most meaningful was with

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:59.840
a doctoral student and she had set up a Skype
meeting and then sent me an email and said

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.180
“Oh my goodness I forgot I'm gonna be traveling”.

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:05.380
And I said that's fine, I'm so you still have
access to we can still meet.

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.640
And when she's said traveling she literally
meant driving traveling.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:15.010
And so she was Skyping me on her telephone,
and so I'm literally traveling with her, and

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:16.730
I could see the trees passing by.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:19.700
We're driving down the road together, having
our conversation.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.000
And then she said you know her dogs had popped
over the car seat, so she said “There's

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.610
my dog Skippy”, and then so, then she turned,
I don’t know if it’s her dog's name, but

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:28.810
she there's my dog!

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:32.010
And then I met her daughter, and then she
turned and said and there's my husband!

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:35.390
So I get to meet each and every one of them
and so, right there, that's something you

00:06:35.390 --> 00:06:37.320
would not..&lt;&lt;Bring into a whole new level!

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:41.490
&lt;&lt; Is a completely new level, and that is
just one example but I mean that's like one

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:46.210
of many I've had of where I get to meet the
these spouses the children, you know, there's

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.490
been one other one pops my mind is the wife
had walked in the background she's like “Oh

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.780
I'm so sorry!” and so the, and I said “No!

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.200
My goodness come over!” and so, she came
in.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:56.200
“My children!

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:57.200
You want to meet my children too?”

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.920
And so, this is my student which was the husband
was like “Is this okay?”

00:07:00.920 --> 00:07:02.120
I'm like “This is wonderful!”

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.580
And so, that really brings in a completely
different level, because it just, it's not

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:12.340
just about the individual relationship, but
it's now - what we do at MFT is about systems,

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:13.889
and this is my entire system.

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:15.250
&lt;&lt; Because you need that.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:17.150
They need that support to make it work.

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:20.990
They're all part of it, so bringing them in
just makes the whole a complete picture.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:21.990
&lt;&lt; Exactly.

00:07:21.990 --> 00:07:24.580
And I think it just, it really it just enhances
their learning.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:25.580
&lt;&lt; Absolutely.

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:28.101
And you wouldn't really get that, like you
said, at a brick and mortar school, if you're

00:07:28.101 --> 00:07:31.100
trying to travel between classes, you're trying
to catch somebody.

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:36.490
This just brings the human element, that connection
to a whole new level where it's so much almost

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.240
more convenient which some people may not
think you would get that online, but in this

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:41.240
you really do.

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.240
&lt;&lt; Absolutely.

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:43.240
&lt;&lt; Well, this is very exciting.

00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:48.460
I'm excited to see where we're MFT goes next,
and, you know, what kind of opportunities

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.789
we have in the future, so we'll definitely
have you back here for more.

00:07:51.789 --> 00:07:52.789
&lt;&lt; Thank you!

00:07:52.789 --> 00:07:53.789
Okay.

00:07:53.789 --> 00:07:54.789
Love to!

00:07:54.789 --> 00:07:55.789
Thank you so much!

00:07:55.789 --> 00:07:56.789
&lt;&lt; Great!

00:07:56.789 --> 00:07:56.791
Thanks, Lisa!
