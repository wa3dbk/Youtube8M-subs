hello My Name is Tony Romiraz from Tampa Florida
and on be half of Expert Village These are

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.450
the optional usage of a Play Station III.
Not just playing video games this is a lot

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:18.429
cooler. Alright here we go basic settings.
The basic setting of a Play Station III are

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:22.909
of course described in your user manual so
I wont go to in depth in this section of the

00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:27.259
video because I want to talk about all the
extra stuff that Play Station III has, But

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:33.100
of course in the setting section you can pretty
much do anything. Set up of course your video

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:39.131
preferences your audio what ever you are going
to do so let's just go through. So I'm not

00:00:39.131 --> 00:00:42.970
going to do games we are not going to focus
on games for this one but we'll say here is

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.440
your DVD and Blue Ray settings. This is all
the default stuff that you want. if you want

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.839
things to play in English, Spanish, French,
and German, what ever you want you can do

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:56.539
all the settings in here of course. Music
settings let's see what we got here, this

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.339
is how to import the CDs if you want to import
them in a certain way of course this right

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:08.380
here shows AAC at 128kbps then playback stuff
as well that you can setup all in there. What

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.260
else? We have chat settings, System Settings.
This is a great way to back up your System.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.890
Do other things like that of course We will
talk about that later on. Of Course your Themes,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.490
That's the background how everything looks,
your date times, if you are going to be printing,

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:26.150
The display on is probably the most important
one if you are going to be using your TV,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.780
excuse me your Play Station III in high Definition
this is where you want to change everything

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.670
right here it says current resolution out
put is 10ADI that is because I am doing this

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.461
through the video so i have everything set
at pretty much it's lowest this is for the

00:01:37.461 --> 00:01:43.260
standard Definition TV. In here you can actually
set it up to 10ADP if you have to capability

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:48.950
on your HDTV Watch everything in beautiful
high definition something with the audio if

00:01:48.950 --> 00:02:00.350
you want it to go set up if you have your
optical out for true surround sound you would

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.490
also do this in here. but these are the basic
settings check your user manual for some more

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.710
information that's about it.
