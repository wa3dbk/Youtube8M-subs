00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:12.420
[Laughter/eating] Let me indulge just a little bit, I tell ya.  I cannot get enough of this Duck Fat Butter!  It's so good.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:20.300
Too bad you're on a diet, Ray.  It's your loss man [they laugh more "at him" than "with him"]
Well I think Ray looks fantastic.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.769
He's lost almost 40 pounds.

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:30.769
Okay, well we all know that men shed pounds faster than women. [Silence]

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:32.939
Ray, don't you want to try one of my specialties?

00:00:32.939 --> 00:00:36.010
Bacon wrapped Figs.  OH MY GOD THEY'RE AMAZING!

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.090
No, if I go off diet for

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.140
just a little bit, I balloon right up.
You used to eat so many of these

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.120
DId I do something wrong?

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.750
Honey you're being rude.
Come on Ray.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.520
Don't be such a f'ing baby, eat a f'ing fig.
Okay, alright.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.500
It's okay, you can cheat a little bit.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:04.500
Oh my god that is so good!  Thank you so much.  Look at that face! [We hear him getting fatter]

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:13.580
RAY?

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.880
IT MUST HAVE BEEN THE BACON!

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.979
Think POSITIVE.  Remember, Positive Thinking.

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:23.120
Yeah yeah yeah, I can do this I can do this.  There is

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.050
A beautiful

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:25.959
skinny

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:28.460
person inside of me.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.470
Uhh, I can be that person.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:31.920
I can be that person.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.860
I can be that PERSON.   [We hear him get skinny again]

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.680
THAT WAS NEAT!

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.160
How did you do that Ray?

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.810
Ah, well I guess it was

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.930
a few months ago I saw this bumper sticker that said uh... If you can THINK it you can DO it.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.460
So I used the Power of Positive Thinking

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:54.160
I pictured myself skinny and I lost all the weight.
Hell of a bumper sticker!

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.350
He's been like a completely different person.
Fantastic, but ah, what does dessert look like?

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.590
[Laughter and over talking] It's chocolate moose.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:11.590
[Singing] Chocolate Mouse!  Chocolate Mouse!
It's your favorite Chocolate Mouse, you have to have a bite.  YOu're not NOT having any!?  Ray-

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:14.850
It's fluffy

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.319
so it has fewer calories.

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:22.599
Hey that's good for you Senior Diet.
NO, if I just LOOK 

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:26.059
at chocolate I gain five pounds.
Don't be ridiculous.   [We hear him getting fatter] 

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:30.189
RAY!  BURP!

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:32.280
Oh Jesus Ray!

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.639
A little warning next time.

00:02:34.639 --> 00:02:35.499
Are you alright?

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:36.819
BARELY.

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:41.059
THINK POSITIVE.  Don't let anybody tell you 'you can't do it'.  Just think positive thoughts.

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:42.849
Get going.

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:49.849
I'm beautiful.  I can be that person again.   [We hear him getting skinny] [They all clap]

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:57.180
This is all so much fun.  Ray!  Do it again.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.059
I don't think it's good to keep

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:00.809
fluctuating like that no

00:03:00.809 --> 00:03:04.680
Shut up.  Do it again balloon boy.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.430
I think it's kind of Sexy.

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:08.409
CARLA!?

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:15.169
[They all chant "RAY"]
Come on, Ray, don't disappoint our friends.

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:22.169
Do not embarrass me.  EAT THA CAKE!  MAKE YOURSELF FAT!   
[We hear him getting fatter and CHEERING]
THAT's MY RAY!  That was the best one yet, because it was SO VIOLENT!

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:40.409
Hey...

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:43.009
What else can you do with a positive attitude?

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:46.439
We've been so focused on the weight loss, we haven't thought about anything else.

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:47.919
Well, lets start thinking.

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.859
I have a thought.

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:53.829
You're not exactly at your fighting weight anymore.  Why don't you try a little

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:56.349
Positive Thinking?

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:03.349
uh... [DEFENSIVE LAUGHTER]

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:07.019
Okay.  Okay.

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:09.930
It will happen.

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:16.930
I know it's possible.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.790
YESSSSS!

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.160
OH THANK YOU GOD!

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.160
You're an asshole James.
Oh, let me try I wanna try I want to try.

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:33.899
I live in a world

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:36.300
where everybody's happy.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:37.699
There's a sense of fashion, 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:39.340
everybody looks really good, 

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:46.340
and they dress really sharp.  And they're really stylish like my BARBIE'S use to be when I was little.

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:48.759
[The sound of Magic Happening and everyone's reactions.]

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:49.619
Seriously?

00:04:49.619 --> 00:04:54.300
Maybe later.  Okay.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:01.300
Can I just get cake to go?  Wait, why didn't I get that hat?  Ray, that's a great hat!

00:05:01.559 --> 00:05:03.490
Oh, but it's not really for a fat person.

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:08.360
No it's not.  So, just do that thing and make yourself skinny again.  YEAH.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.360
Can you isolate parts of your body and do it like that?  Can you give yourself, like a Horse Cock!?  Add any muscles while your at it?

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:20.260
Honey this is for us, this is for our relationship.  Please Ray.  Can you INNER BOTOX?

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.110
Don't be stupid. [Lots of talking builds!]
I am not against having sex with you if you can turn yourself into a woman!

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.350
Look at me.

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:33.240
I WILL GO IN ON THAT.  Please.  If you loved me.  I can make this happen.  I will make this

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:40.240
happen.  I CAN MAKE THIS HAPPEN!  [Silence]

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:00.409
 [We hear him getting fatter]
