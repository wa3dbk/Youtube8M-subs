I'm Casey from LowCostMacs.com, and this is
the 11" MacBook Air with a 2 GHz i7 processor,

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:17.820
4GB of RAM, and a 256GB solid state drive.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.400
My monster hand gives you a good reference
of just how tiny this laptop is. It's incredibly

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.220
thin and light, and you definitely won't notice
it as you carry it around with you.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.580
Boot up time is incredibly quick, even with
FileValut 2 enabled, as it is on this MacBook

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:35.449
Air. Sleep and wake are instantaneous. Apps
open quickly, and the whole system is very

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.620
responsive.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.229
Scrolling is incredibly smooth, and it's one
of the reasons I find it incredibly difficult

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:44.829
to use any other Operating System than Mac
OSX.

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:51.829
iTunes 11 is also very responsive, and its
layout is perfect for this 11" display, especially in full screen mode.

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:59.289
The GeekBench 64-bit test shows modest results.
The 2 GHz i7 MacBook Air scored 7676. On the

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:06.479
OpenGL Cinebench test, it performed at 19.24
FPS. The Cinebench CPU test reported 2.95

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.700
points.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.170
According to most of the websites hawking
development software today, it's becoming

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.610
increasingly popular to do your web development
on a MacBook Air. I messed around with writing

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:21.830
a bit of PHP in TextMate 2 on the 11" MacBook
Air, and although switching between full screens

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:26.030
could become natural to me, I'm still a fan
of gargantuan laptop displays for juggling

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.610
multiple programs.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.450
The keyboard deserves mention, as it is one
of the best keyboards on a device this small.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.820
I've attempted to type on netbooks, and this
keyboard blows them out of the water. Except

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.860
for the half-sized function keys, this is
a full-sized keybard, and it works fantastically

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:41.980
well.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:46.380
Overall, this is a fantastic notebook for
someone looking to do some light computing.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.300
I can't fully recommend going with the decked
out 2GHz i7 model, however, because I just

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.840
can't imagine doing enough work on this to
warrant the monster dual-core processor.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.840
This is Casey from LowCostMacs.com. Thanks
for watching!
