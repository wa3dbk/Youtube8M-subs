00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.800
[long note]

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.772
- [Thomas Jenkins] What I'd like to demonstrate today

00:00:10.772 --> 00:00:13.439
is something called a fuel cell.

00:00:14.354 --> 00:00:17.170
You've probably heard a
lot about it in the news,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:18.561
but a fuel cell is a device

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:22.689
that will take hydrogen gas

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:25.520
and convert that into electricity.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.578
But it doesn't burn the hydrogen.

00:00:28.578 --> 00:00:31.135
The hydrogen is not burned as a fuel.

00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:33.932
All we're gonna do is use the electrons

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.840
off the hydrogen gas to
be the electric current that we need.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.040
The nice thing about a
fuel cell is we can use

00:00:42.042 --> 00:00:46.755
plain water as our source of fuel.

00:00:46.755 --> 00:00:49.819
We're gonna put some
energy into the water,

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:53.447
and separate the water into
its two component parts,

00:00:53.447 --> 00:00:55.581
hydrogen and oxygen,

00:00:55.581 --> 00:00:57.405
and that's what we've done here.

00:00:57.405 --> 00:00:59.284
And the nice thing about it,

00:00:59.284 --> 00:01:02.838
is the source of energy
can be a solar cell,

00:01:02.838 --> 00:01:05.280
solar energy, the sunlight.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.318
Sunlight hits the solar cell,

00:01:07.318 --> 00:01:09.457
it's converted to electricity,

00:01:09.457 --> 00:01:12.699
which then converts our source of water

00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:16.132
in these tubes into its component parts,

00:01:16.132 --> 00:01:18.316
hydrogen and oxygen.

00:01:18.316 --> 00:01:21.166
Then I can use the hydrogen to go through

00:01:21.166 --> 00:01:26.740
a fuel cell and create
electricity to run some device,

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:30.377
a fan, anything in your home,

00:01:30.377 --> 00:01:34.415
it's just like anything
that runs off electricity.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:37.300
The byproduct of a fuel cell,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.660
interesting enough is water.

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:42.820
The hydrogen will recombine with oxygen

00:01:42.822 --> 00:01:44.401
either from our other tank,

00:01:44.401 --> 00:01:46.828
or oxygen in the atmosphere,

00:01:46.828 --> 00:01:49.343
and our byproduct will be water.

00:01:49.343 --> 00:01:51.042
Pure, clean water.

00:01:51.042 --> 00:01:55.187
That's a very nice byproduct
from energy production.

00:01:55.187 --> 00:01:57.329
Interesting enough, a lot
of the development of fuel

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.920
cells has been from NASA, our space agencies.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.720
They use fuel cells on the space shuttle,

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.713
and the byproduct of
their energy production

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:09.560
is drinking water for the astronauts.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.020
So what I've done is I've
placed this in the sun.

00:02:13.023 --> 00:02:16.362
I've separated the water
into its two component parts.

00:02:16.362 --> 00:02:19.533
We have hydrogen and oxygen
that go through these tubes

00:02:19.533 --> 00:02:21.304
into my fuel cell.

00:02:21.304 --> 00:02:23.702
When I give them a place to go,

00:02:23.702 --> 00:02:25.949
the hydrogen goes through the fuel cell,

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:28.647
the electrons are stripped
off the hydrogen atom,

00:02:28.647 --> 00:02:31.511
become the electric for the motor,

00:02:31.511 --> 00:02:34.255
and I can run a little
fan or any other type

00:02:34.255 --> 00:02:36.295
of electrical device,

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.600
and the output from that
is clean drinking water.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.457
Fuel cell, a lot of people
believe this will be

00:02:42.457 --> 00:02:45.409
one of the fuels of the future,

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:47.740
what's called a hydrogen economy.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.952
Where we use hydrogen

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:53.040
as electric energy source,

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.040
because it's non polluting.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:02.159
The source of energy
to create the hydrogen,

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.039
will be solar, wind, other
renewable energy sources.

00:03:06.039 --> 00:03:09.132
So we're not burning fossil
fuels or anything like that.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.900
And then we have our clean water,

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.620
very nice.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.420
