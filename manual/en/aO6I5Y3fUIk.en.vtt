00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:09.929
OK, now a very important, crucial aspect of
maintaining a clear tank is the water changes.

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:20.570
This aspect of having an aquarium is as important
as changing the oil on a car is to having

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:28.900
a good car. I can't stress the importance
enough of doing frequent water changes. What

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.960
you?re going to want to do is change about
twenty or thirty percent of the water every

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:44.390
two weeks. This is very important to maintaining
good water quality and a healthy fish environment.

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.750
Can't over emphasize it enough, you got to
do it. Once you figure out how to do it, it's

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:59.210
done rather quickly. And what happens is,
there's a couple ways to do it. You could

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.340
suck this out like your sucking gasoline and
get a stream going. However, if you get good

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:14.290
at it, what you can do is get a stream going
here. Show of how we do this here, get that

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:20.900
going and there we have the water going. And
what we're going to do is, we're going to

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.090
and of course you don't want to suck the fish,
of course. We're just going to go in the corner

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:34.320
and as you see it creates turbulence and you're
going to suck that, the debris out and it's

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.150
going to go into your bucket here. Now believe
it or not you don't want to get all the dirt

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:49.530
up. That sounds odd but you don't want to
get all the dirt up because that dirt affords

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.450
some biological filtration. So you don't want
to clean all the dirt up so only go about

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.610
half way down and leave that dirt that you
won't be able to see anyway in the gravel.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:11.400
Where you can't see it and yet it provides
the function of allowing biological filtration.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.640
Now towards the front of the glass you can
get all that dirt out so that you don't have

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.780
to be looking at it. So what you want to do
is go in the corners, go all over your gravel

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.690
and let the hose in the water just do its
thing. You just kind of disturbing the gravel

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:39.480
gently, not going down all the way, sucking
that debris and loose particles up. And when

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.659
you get to the point where you've got about
twenty-five percent of the water, you've done

00:02:44.659 --> 00:02:50.049
your job. You simply lift up the hose and
it'll stop by itself, of course. Now you've

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:58.219
got the dirty aquarium water down there, you've
changed the oil on your tank basically and

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:07.439
you dump that and then after that you?re going
to replace this water with water that has

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:14.740
been dechlorinated properly and temperature
approximately the same as the temperature

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.879
of the water that it's going into. Remember,
we're being very conservative about every

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.169
aspect of dealing with your aquarium, very
slow.
