dj bbq iin the house in my house and ive got something a bit more comfortable today because i  

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.099
kind of a cross between a 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:24.579
buddhist monk and david bowe we are going to do the best

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:29.980
side you will ever feast upon Woodstock dans green beans 

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:31.510
and to accompany 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.600
this recipe weve got

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.800
dans pans cam look at this bad boy 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.490
whats up dude 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:42.030
oh yeah alright 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.020
i got a bit of olive oil 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.010
but you know we also want the flavour of the butter but we dont want to the butter to burn 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.830
thats why we mix up the olive oil and the butter onion 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.590
were going to shop this bad boy up 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.480
now woodstock dan he worked in a restaurant 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.290
back in the 

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.980
late eighties early nineties and he is probably one of my favorite chefs i have ever worked with 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.460
and he had this big batch of green beans and he used to eat them up all the time man and 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.540
i was like why are these so good dan he said nutmeg nutmeg and cracked pepper 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.710
its the key man 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.729
so theres our onions nicely finely chopped get these things kind of softened 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.550
up

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.230
little sea salt in there 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.070
so they gotta cook

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.860
four about

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:26.470
five minutes

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:31.070

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.290

i should have put my goggles on where are my goggles dude there we go now i can do it i can talk to pan cam 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.740
they're saultating good 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.330
now you need 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.220
freshly cracked pepper they are going everywhere 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.760
its armageddon here

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.310
perfecto its time 

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.510
for the side ive taken a good portion of green beans probably about

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.290
thirty of those bad boys because im going to serve about 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.409
three to four people i boiled them 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.839
for 4 minutes not to long because i want to keep the crunch 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:11.959
okay secret ingredient

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.919
nutmeg you have got to be careful with nutmeg because the outer kind of webby stuff 

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:19.109
is mace its kind of poisonous 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:23.870
there has been two reported deaths from overdoing nutmeg so yeah remember that 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.259
get rid of the textured layer and 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:29.400
pick the fruit 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.429
give it a couple of good thrashings 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:36.129
and you can of course use ground nutmeg that you can buy at the store but 

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:41.239
i tend to do it with this bad boy it tastes better and you get more flavour so now i'm going to add more pepper 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.499
the the concoction 

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:47.629
and then a pinch more salt 

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.409
we are going to let them mosh into pit throw in some elbows there is a guy in there 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.559
with two double mohicans so the green bean throws an onion at
