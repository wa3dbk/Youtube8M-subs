00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.000
To live the promise

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.449
is to give students opportunities so
that they can discover their potential

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.070
and so that they can discover how they
can transform their world

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.710
The Lick Observatory belongs to the
University of California

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.040
and this is a place where a lot of very
exciting research is still being

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:41.360
conducted

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.170
one of the great advantages of being a
graduate student pursuing astronomy at

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.910
UCR is that you have this at your
disposal.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.020
We're at the Shane

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.950
telescope, the three meter telescope.
this is the telescope that belongs to

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:57.990
the University of California.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:02.090
One of the things that I've had an
opportunity to do with this telescope is

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.010
to observe quasar host galaxies.
These are the galaxies where

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.049
supermassive black holes

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:10.070
live.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.690
And these are supermassive black holes

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.140
that are active. What we mean by active
is that they're accreting matter

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.410
and because they're accreting matter

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.330
some of the energy becomes radiative
energy. They light up

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.150
and they become very bright

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.180
Hey, how are things at UCR? 
Pretty Good, we're all set up here.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.420
How's the weather at Mauna Kea?

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.810
Here at Keck it's pretty good.
The weather forecast is that

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:38.810
it's going to be clear, and we're
going to have a good scene tonight.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.810
Sounds Good.

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:56.180
the Keck telescopes are two telescopes on
Mauna Kea in Hawaii.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.510
They also are part of the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.830
University of California facilities.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.610
They're some of the biggest optical
telescopes in the world

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.690
and I do some of my research there
and of course they're very powerful.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:14.730
They have been the most productive
telescopes up to date.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.709
One of the most exciting discoveries in
my field in the last decade or so

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.449
has been the discovery that
every single galaxy in the universe has a

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.169
supermassive black hole in the center.

00:02:28.169 --> 00:02:32.620
Not only that, but they seem to
have some kind of a relationship where

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:34.579
the mass of the black hole

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:38.749
is related to some of the properties of
the galaxy as a whole.

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:43.129
We know now that we need to learn more
about black holes and their interaction

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.639
with the galaxies in order to understand
how galaxies got to be the way they are

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:48.849
today.

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.159
When you do research in astronomy 
you're actually bringing new knowledge into

00:02:54.159 --> 00:02:55.359
humanity.

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:59.859
Things that nobody had ever seen before.
Things that nobody knew before.

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:05.500
You're making history in that sense. So
when I give students the opportunity to

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.909
do research

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:08.559
they are discovering their potential
