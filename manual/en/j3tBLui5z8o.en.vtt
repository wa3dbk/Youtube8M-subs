Hey guys John here with accessorygeeks.com.

00:00:09.542 --> 00:00:11.592
We have the new Samsung Continuum in front of you

00:00:11.593 --> 00:00:15.574
But I wanna show case, a couple of silicone cases that we got in for the phone.  

00:00:15.575 --> 00:00:18.622
We’re gonna go ahead and move this, you know rather really, really quick. 

00:00:18.623 --> 00:00:21.511
And we move our accessorygeeks.com, this is card. 

00:00:21.512 --> 00:00:23.846
Now as you can see we have 4 colors in front of you. 

00:00:23.847 --> 00:00:27.517
We have black, pink, blue and smoke

00:00:27.518 --> 00:00:31.542
We also have the white one which is on our Samsung continuum. 

00:00:31.843 --> 00:00:35.513
Now this can be your standard silicone case

00:00:35.514 --> 00:00:38.571
This isn’t TPU which is the harder silicone case 

00:00:38.572 --> 00:00:41.455
but those are on the ways so please at tight if you guys  waiting for those. 

00:00:41.456 --> 00:00:46.386
But like I said these are really durable, and really flexible, they’re not gonna really rip on you. 

00:00:46.387 --> 00:00:50.189
And they’re not gonna add any bulk to your phone.

00:00:50.192 --> 00:00:53.623
So that’s all the benefit or plus.  

00:00:54.024 --> 00:00:57.036
Now the phone or the cases already on the Samsung continuum.  

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:00.179
As you can see all the necessary cut outs are there for your speaker on the top

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.510
your sensors, I believe that proximity sensors.

00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:09.511
You have your camera in the back with the speaker phone 

00:01:09.512 --> 00:01:12.312
As well as your 3.5 mm Jack on the top. 

00:01:12.315 --> 00:01:19.785
You have your micro USB charging port, and your micro sd memory card slot.  

00:01:19.786 --> 00:01:24.587
All the camera button as well as the dedicated volume buttons. 

00:01:24.588 --> 00:01:27.589
And your power buttons are all embossed within the silicone case. 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.586
You have access to all of that. 

00:01:29.587 --> 00:01:31.479
So everything still remain fully functional. 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.779
And you can see looks pretty nice on the Samsung Continuum

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.979
