00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:06.339
What's poppin' guys? Today, I'm going to
show you how I do this really cute protective

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:10.690
style. And if you stay tune till the end,
I'll show you four, quick and easy styles

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.580
that can spice up this look just a little
bit. So, let's get started on this Mini

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.960
Twists Tutorial.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.960
So I went ahead and wash my hair off camera
using this Suave Natural Infusion Anti-Breakage

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.150
Shampoo and Conditioner. And now, I'm ready
to get started. So as you can see, I have

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.449
my hair braided up into four sections, and
that just helps me stretch out my hair and

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.269
while I was stretching it, I wore this really
cute beanie just so I was looking cute while

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:45.640
I was stretching my hair underneath. Nobody
knew girl. And so now, I'm getting ready

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.820
to start just by unloosing the first braid.
And this is what my hair looks like after

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:57.030
I unloosed that braid nice and define, ready
to go. All stretched out. So I'm going to

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.059
spray some of the Motions Marula Natural Therapy
Hair and Scalp Oil for an extra boost of moisture

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.310
because that's what I'm going to for with
this whole protective cell. I really want

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.590
to keep my hair moisturize, so I spray that
on my roots, and especially on the ends of

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.750
my hair because that's where it gets the
driest.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.680
The next thing I'm going to do is just spray
my hair with a little bit of water, and you

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.579
don't want to spray it too much because
that is just going to make your hair shrink

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:30.409
up and revere, and it's just going to undo
all that stretching that I've already did.

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.930
But I do like to make it a little bit more
wet so that the ends curl up when I twist

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.670
them, and swish it a little bit more pliable.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.079
So now, I'm going to go ahead and section
off my first row for twist. And as you can

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.549
see, it's a pretty small row and then I'm
going to go ahead and twist with the Motion

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:52.600
Shine Enhancing Pomade. So this is just again
really great for shine and moisture which

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:57.810
is very important to me in this style. Now,
as you can see here, my twists are pretty

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.039
small. And honestly, a lot of people do their
twists even smaller than this. But girl, I

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:11.039
didn't have the patience to do it any smaller.
So this size is really worked for me.

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:18.769
So I'm pretty much done with my first two
twists. And as you can see, the ends are little

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.900
bit fuzzy which I do not like, so I'm just
going to spray them with a little bit of extra

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.260
water to get them to curl up. And sometimes,
I even like to add a little bit more of the

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:36.830
Shine Enhancing Pomade just to make it curl
up and just really smooth it out because the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.450
ends are really important for this style and
you want to keep them moisturize while you're

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.180
protecting them. So now, I'm just going
to do the same thing on the other section

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.019
of hair, and I went ahead and parted another
section, pretty much the same size as the

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.420
other one, and I'm just wading the ends
a little bit and advance, and then I'm going

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.420
to get ready to start twisting the same exact
way using the Motion Shine Enhancing Pomade.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:12.080
[Demonstration]

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:19.080
So I'm done with the first section and this
is what it looks like, nice and shiny, really

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:34.280
moisturize. And as you can see, once you get
the twist a little bit of time, they plumped

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.739
them up and they're not so stringy and thin
like they look when you first twist them.

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:43.299
So now, I'm going to get ready to start
on the second section and I'm just undoing

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.470
that braid and then again, I'm going to
apply the Motions Marula Natural Therapy Hair

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.530
and Scalp Oil on my scalp and a long strand
of my hair and especially on the ends. Then

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:59.689
I'm going to wet it just tiny bit, just
to make it pliable and just to get the ends

00:03:59.689 --> 00:04:04.769
to properly curl up. Then apply a little bit
of the Motion Shine Enhancing Pomade to the

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:09.939
entire section and then you can go ahead and
start twisting, and make sure that you wet

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:15.049
your ends, curl them around your finger and
even apply a little bit more of the Shine

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:18.440
Enhancing Pomade if you need to get it to
curl up.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.200
So the entire back section is finished after
what seems like forever, and I'm not going

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.040
to lie. This style does take a couple hours,
so be ready to be patient, but the end result

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.250
is really nice. And as you can see, my twists
are already looking bomb.com.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.870
So I'm pretty much done twisting up all
of my hair and it's nice and shinny. And

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:44.700
it better be after all of that time that it
took to do. But it's also nice and stretched

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.380
out which is exactly what I was going for.
So if you're wondering why I have this hair

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:54.000
section dot at the front is because I've
been experiencing a little bit of breakage

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.360
towards the front of my hair, basically at
the edges. And I think is it's because of

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:04.290
the pops and too much brushing and gel. So
I really just wanted to twist up the front

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:09.160
a little bit differently so that I don't
have to manipulate it at all during the week.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:14.050
So I only parted out about one inch of the
hair that's framing my face, and I'm just

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:18.970
going to go ahead and flat-twist it back and
then twist the rest of the hair all the way

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:20.360
down to the ends.

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.800
So they're just really simply flat twist.
It's really sure and easy. But if you can't

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.670
do this, you can't of course just twist
up your whole head. But I just wanted to flat

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:34.690
twist my edges so that they're a little
bit less in my way and I won't have to manipulate

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:41.690
them throughout the week.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:49.570
[Demonstration]

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:55.070
So once I was done with all of that tedious
twisting, this is what my hair look like and

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:59.880
I really like the results. It came out really,
really nice, and it's going to last me all

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:05.120
week. And to maintain the style, all I did
was sleep with the satin cap, basically tied

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.460
on my hair just to make sure it didn't rub
against my cotton pillow or anything like

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.330
that and so that I have waded any freeze.

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:17.560
Now, for a couple, easy, mini twists styles
that you can rock just to spice up the look

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:23.190
a bit. So the first one I just picked up,
the two sides of my hair, just a couple twists

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:28.160
about by one each side, and then I pulled
them towards the back and then tie it with

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:34.300
a little elastic, scrunchie head tie, headband
whatever you want to call it, and that was

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.670
the first style.

00:06:35.670 --> 00:06:40.460
And the second one is just a low ponytail,
and this is really simply and easy, so I didn't

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:46.200
show you guys how to do it. It's just a
cute style idea if you want to spice up your

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:52.530
twists. And the third style is also really
simple. It's just a high band. And as you

00:06:52.530 --> 00:06:56.990
can see, I'm just flipping my hair upside
down so that I can pull it all towards the

00:06:56.990 --> 00:07:02.250
top, and I'm just making a little cute messy
band. It's nothing too structure, nothing

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:06.390
too neat. I know there's a little pieces
flying around but it's all good. It's

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:12.760
okay. I'm doing my happy bands, and there
is a really cute high top knot band.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:18.170
And then the last style is basically just
half path down and then I decided to put the

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:23.580
top path in a little messy band once again
because I think it just looks like really

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:28.930
effortless, nothing too fancy. But yeah, just
really spices up this style.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.940
I hope you guys enjoy this video, and I can
wait to see you in the next one. Peace out!
