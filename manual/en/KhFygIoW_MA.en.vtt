00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.810
This week, we’ve got a special video from  our friends

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.010
at the American Association of Chemistry Teachers,

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.070
Featuring Sam Kean, the best selling author

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.160
behind The Disappearing Spoon.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.520
Enjoy!

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.780
While science has done wonders

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.260
in solving mysteries about the world,

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:20.190
sometimes people twist those discoveries

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.789
into outlandish conclusions.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.000
Instead of using evidence to prove a point,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.410
people who believe in what’s called

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.999
pathological science use ambiguity as evidence

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.579
claiming that scientists don’t know everything,

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.020
and therefore there’s room for my pet theory, too.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:39.620
That’s exactly what happened

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.670
with manganese and the megalodon.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.940
In 1873 a research vessel called the HMS Challenger

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.329
set out from England to explore the pacific ocean

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:55.489
and pulled in tons of rocks, some shaped

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.320
like mineralized ice cream cones.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.480
They were made of manganese.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.480
When the crew cracked open the cones

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.160
they revealed the biggest, most pituitarily

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.660
freakish five-inch shark teeth they’d ever seen.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.690
These teeth were later discovered by

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.500
paleontologists to belong to the long extinct,

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.340
fifty-foot long, fifty-ton megalodon.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.820
All fine science so far.

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.400
The pathology started with the man- ganese.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.310
It’s not clear why manganese galvanizes shark

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.700
teeth—that is, why thin layers of this metal

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.310
deposit themselves on the teeth over time.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.200
But scientists do know how quickly

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.680
the metal accumulates, and they deduced that

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.710
the teeth date from at least 1.5 million

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.970
years ago, meaning the megalodons

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.330
probably died out around then.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.140
But some megalodon teeth had a

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.350
mysteriously thin manganese plaque,

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:53.000
about eleven thousand years’ worth.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.680
Evolutionarily, that’s an awfully short time.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.340
And really, what’s to say scientists won’t

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:00.780
soon find one from ten thousand years ago?

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.880
Or eight thousand years ago? Or later?

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.450
In the 1960s, a few enthusiasts with Jurassic Park

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.500
imaginations grew convinced that rogue megalodons

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.129
still lurk in the oceans.

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:15.640
“megalodon lives!” They cried.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.480
So why do people never see them?

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.840
Well, this myth suggested that megalodons

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.709
are supposed to be elusive, which gives people

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.010
a convenient escape hatch when asked why

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.950
the giant sharks are so scarce nowadays.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.840
Unfortunately for big shark dreamers,

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.340
the idea crumbles under scrutiny.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.180
Among other things, the teeth with thin

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.969
layers of manganese were almost certainly

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:40.439
torn up from old bedrock beneath the ocean

00:02:40.439 --> 00:02:43.799
floor and exposed to water only recently.

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:45.489
They’re probably much older

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:47.870
than eleven thousand years.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.640
And although there have been legendary

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.680
eyewitness accounts of the beasts,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.790
they’re all from sailors, notorious

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.909
storytellers, and the megalodons in their

00:02:56.909 --> 00:03:00.370
stories vary manically in size and shape.

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.989
Overall, such stories depend on subjective

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:05.530
interpretations, and without objective

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:07.719
evidence, it’s not plausible to conclude

00:03:07.719 --> 00:03:10.579
that megalodons, even a few of them,

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.079
slipped through evolution’s snares.

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:19.200
The Disappearing Spoon by Sam Kean is

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:24.450
available at fine book stores everywhere.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:25.379
Want more episodes of The

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:26.870
Disappearing Spoon series?
