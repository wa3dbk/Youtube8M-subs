00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.950
 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.040
 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.530
 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.869
What do you see in nature? Are the shapes and colors simply pleasing to the eye,

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.810
or do the forms and functions of nature
also inspire the mind?

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:25.340
Denver Botanic Gardens invites people to
explore beautiful and meticulous design

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.509
influenced by the world that surrounds
it.

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:32.969
The five thousand two hundred and fifty eight square foot Science Pyramid has 16 sides

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:36.040
consisting of hexagonal panels in a
honeycomb pattern

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.320
with painted steel and angular windows.
The building shape is almost

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.770
a mirror image of the amphitheater it's nestled next to,

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.449
and shows visitors how their own
backyard is connected to the natural world beyond.

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:47.399
 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.359
The breathtaking design is based on
architecture that is

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:52.079
thousands of years old.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.920
But the pyramid shape presented unique
challenges in contemporary construction.

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.730
DELTA was up for the challenge! The
challenge of

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.579
maintaining a watertight exterior

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.090
whose enclosures are both roof and wall
while managing

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:08.729
the moisture generated within

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.330
through high performance air and water barriers. The challenge of open joint cladding

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.670
that exposes a water-resistive barrier
to the sun's rays

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.320
and the impact of wind, rain and snow. And the challenge of being able to withstand

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.060
Denver's extreme winter and summer
climates.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.789
Because DELTA-VENT SA is highly vapor permeable

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.500
it prevents interior moisture buildup
while remaining watertight.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.969
It is fully adhered and more airtight

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:37.810
than mechanically attached air barriers.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:41.860
And because DELTA-FASSADES has extremely high UV resistance

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:46.119
its weatherproofing qualities will not
degrade, keeping the insulation

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:47.979
that lies underneath reliably dry

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:53.009
and functioning at maximum R-value. The
matte black color also adds depth and

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.619
dimensionality to the striking beauty of
this landmark building.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:02:00.560
DELTA protects the Science Pyramid as a
space for nature

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.970
that's both pleasing to the eye and
inspiring for the mind,

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.700
giving architects designing to a higher
standard

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.860
the long-term peace of mind they strive for.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.970
