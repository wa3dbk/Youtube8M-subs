00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:10.470
Dr. Bob: In the cotton world, have you heard
of long staple?

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:11.470
What's a staple?

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.850
It's a fiber.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.130
You have this beautiful cotton plant, and
at the top of the cotton plant you've got

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.789
this fluffy two or three inch cotton boll.

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.980
And when it's nice and opened up you have
all these fluffy white fibers, one cotton

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.980
boll...250,000 fibers.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.840
The length of those fibers is what determines
the quality of the cotton.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.860
We've all heard of long staple, but we usually
don't hear the words, short staple cotton,

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.030
buy me.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.690
Nothing to brag about, right?

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.100
If you ever see a label on cotton thread that
says 100 percent cotton, guess what staple

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.100
length it is?

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.100
Participant: Short.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.309
Dr. Bob: Always.

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.580
Because if it is long, they will brag about
it.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.530
The price is higher.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.530
That's the bragging point.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:00.460
It really doesn't matter the length of the
fiber if you're turning that cotton into clothing,

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:08.790
bed sheets, towels, because you can take a
short staple, lower grade cotton, and by the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.220
time you weave it, you can put a nice dense
weave on it and still come up with very good

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.460
clothing, or bed sheets, or towels.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.689
But in the thread world it's a different story.

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:24.080
In the thread world we need to take those
fiber lengths, spin them together, make it

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.869
very, very fine and yet make them run through
a machine at high speed without problem.

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:33.460
That's where the length of the fiber is so
important, and that's where we talk about

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.290
long staple.

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.430
Long staple cotton has been around for about
140 years.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:47.490
But about a dozen years ago they were finally
able to develop consistently a longer fiber

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:48.920
than long staple.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.789
What could be longer than long staple?

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:53.840
Extra-long staple.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.890
Yes.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:02.500
The thing to remember now is if you see thread
that is labeled long staple, it's medium grade.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.689
The no label, which is just cotton, is going
to be short, that's the low grade.

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.039
Long staple is medium.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.680
Extra-long staple is as good as it gets.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.010
For the scientists here, here's the difference.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.480
Short staple is an inch and an eighth.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.270
That's the length of that fiber of the cotton
plant and the cotton boll.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.410
That's the length of the fibers.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:24.930
An inch and an eighth is short staple.

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.950
And about 85 percent of all cotton grown is
short staple.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:35.260
In order to qualify as a long staple, it must
be longer than one inch and one eighth.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.810
It must be an inch and a quarter.

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:40.709
Woo-hoo.

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:42.230
An eighth of an inch difference.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:43.230
Yes?

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.090
Participant: What is Egyptian cotton?

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.090
Dr. Bob: Egyptian cotton?

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:47.900
We'll get to that in just a minute.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.370
The long staple goes from an inch and an eighth
all the way to an inch and a quarter, one

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.310
eighth of an inch difference.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:58.310
You almost need a microscope to distinguish
the difference.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.390
But in the thread world that's big because
it's a little bit longer.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.060
It takes fewer pieces spun together, which
means stronger thread, less lint, cleaner

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:14.600
machine, fewer frustrations, and a happier
quilter.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.750
But it gets even better because now we have
extra-long staple.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.980
The longest fiber developed consistently in
cotton is now two inches long, and that's

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:26.980
a huge jump.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.270
We go from an inch and an eighth which is
short, an inch and a quarter which is long,

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.900
as long as two inches to be an extra-long.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.220
Minimum, it must be an inch and three eighths,
but it is as long as two inches.

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.500
Now we have these cotton fibers in the plant
that are almost twice as long as the short

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.180
which means it takes only half as many fibers
to spin it together, cleaner thread, stronger

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.909
thread, cleaner machine, happier quilter.

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.620
Every time you go from one grade to another,
your price goes up 50 percent.

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.700
You will go from a short staple to a long
staple, your price, 50 percent up.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.520
To go from a long staple to an extra-long
staple, another 50 percent increase.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.330
It's worth it in the thread world.

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:10.230
Clothing, bed sheets, towels, no.

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:12.760
Don't spend money just because it says long
staple on it.

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.710
You can get a good quality without long staple.

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:19.600
But thread, this one we need high speed run
through a machine, keep it clean, keep it

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.040
strong, huge difference.

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.850
The one in your hand is our King Tut thread.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:27.980
It's an extra-long staple cotton thread.

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:30.270
Hold this one up to the light.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:35.660
This one you should see a little bit of fuzz
on it, that tells you it is not...what?

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.880
Participant: Coated.

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:38.710
Dr. Bob: Right.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.660
No coating which means this is great for machine,
and yes, it's fantastic for hand quilting.

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:45.750
Let this one hang.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.980
No memory.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.330
That hang is nice and smooth without all the
kinks that a tightly wound or coated thread

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:53.330
has.

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:54.990
No memory.

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:55.990
Fantastic.

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:57.940
The question we had was on Egyptian cotton.

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.640
Do you have a question?

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.820
Participant: Is memory always bad in thread?

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:02.820
Dr. Bob: Is memory?

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:03.820
No.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:07.690
Memory isn't bad, but it tends toward tangling,
and it's a sign that it's either coated or

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.910
is wound too tight.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.200
Metallic is common, not good.

00:05:12.200 --> 00:05:14.230
A coated thread is not bad.

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:18.300
It will have memory if it's a coated cotton,
and by the way, the only fiber that they coat

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.300
is cotton.

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:20.670
You don't coat poly and all the others.

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:23.291
You'll put a lubricant on it, but not the
coating.

00:05:23.291 --> 00:05:25.100
So it's not bad in cotton, just remember it's
for hand.

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.100
Yes?

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:34.900
Participant: Bob, you said this is not coated.

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:36.920
Is hand quilting thread okay if it's not coated?

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.412
Dr. Bob: Is hand quilting thread okay if it's
not coated.

00:05:38.412 --> 00:05:39.650
Yes, if it's strong enough.

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:41.500
This one is strong enough.

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:45.250
We put a lot of tug when we hand quilt, and
we don't want breakage.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:49.250
So if you have an extra-long staple, very
high quality non-coated thread, you'll be

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:49.940
perfectly fine.
