00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.240
Hello everyone. So, if you're wondering why I'm on a really weird camera

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:06.160
it's because I'm doing the PhotoBooth challenge with my friend

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.100
Dodie, hello. Dodie Clark, Doddleoddle

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.560
So the rules are we have to see how long we can last

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.700
with these different filters without laughing

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.910
the first one who laugh loses.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.260
So, lets go for it. Lets go.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.110
Hey, you guys wanna go fishing?

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.360
I got lots o' pond back there. Yerp, Christmas.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:24.100
Huh huh, huh huh.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.460
Hey. It's your uncle Dan.

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:29.700
You guys wanna play Poke-man.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.930
I got me a squirrel. Huh huh huh huh.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:34.000
Oh my god.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.000
Why do I look sad now?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.330
Angry? Good morning John.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:52.040
Today I'm going to give you lots of pizza facts.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.240
One, my nipples are pepperoni. Hah [snarls]

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:04.560
Uh, good morning Hank. It's Sunday, yes.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:07.000
So, I like sitting on the beach.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.530
Enjoying long walks.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.960

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.900
Pip pip, cheerio.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:16.460
Oh, oh no!

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.700
Oh, that's horrendous.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.000
I'm a butterfly.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.000
The ball, gimme the ball.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.600
My neck is so buff. Agh! Yeah!

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.060
I look like Professor Crocker from Fairly Odd Parents.

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.800
You know, my ear on the side of my neck.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.140
You're laughing it up.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.000
Stop laughing.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.760
Oh God, there's spit everywhere.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.400
It's like a geyser. Woah.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.730
Thanks very much. Bleugh.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.960

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:15.200
Huh huh huh huh huh. You have a big mouth anyway.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.460
That's in my nightmares.

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.660
I'm dancing.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.800
I look like... I look like another human.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.160

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.250

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.600
Oh, no. Oh yeah. That was a stretch of a joke.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.260
My eyebrow game is strong.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.910

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:01.160
and all the beautiful beauty gurus.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.840

You seemed a bit ruffled up. Ruffled your feathers.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.250
No, no no.
