00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:13.500
(music playing)

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.100
I've always had a desire to

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.300
be a part of the bigger picture.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.500
And I’ve always felt the need to be of use to other people.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.300
So I immediately felt this need to get involved

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.500
and connect and I found like I’ve really found a fit

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.000
here at Starkey.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.000
I was blown away by the work that they do in the world.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.000
To not only help people with hearing loss but connect to people.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.800
And that really struck a chord with me because

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:55.000
my life has been marked by hearing loss.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.200
My eustachian tube is not really strong enough to stay open by itself

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.300
so I have to have permanent tubes in my ears

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.900
and I can identify with how frustrating it can be

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.500
to not fully hear sound but also what a joy and relief

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.500
it can be when you are able to use all five of your senses.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.000
Maria is 86. She had severe hearing loss in both ears

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.200
and once she connected, she had so much to say

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.800
and so much to share and we connected.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.000
I really hope that when kids my age watch

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.000
the work that we’re doing in Peru, or wherever Starkey is

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.500
that they feel inspired to do the same.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.500
And see that you’re one piece of a really big picture.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.700
And that you can contribute, and you can start now.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.800
No matter where you are in the world, you’re important

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and you matter and your life is of use.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.800
And if I can keep spreading that message, that would make my heart really happy.
