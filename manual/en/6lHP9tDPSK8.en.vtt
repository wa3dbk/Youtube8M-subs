Hello everybody, and welcome to Embellish.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.940
I'm Tracy O'Connor, here on eHow Home to show
you guys cool designs, highlight fun trends

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:16.170
and introduce you to creative minds.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.189
Now I'm might not be a designer, but I'm an
enthusiast, just like you.

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.800
And, like you, I'm often inspired to tap into
my inner design guru and just kinda go for

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.800
it.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.609
Last time on the show, I talked to interior
designer Kishani Perera, and I went to her

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.570
boutique in Los Angeles and got an amazing
tour.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.590
And while I was there, I saw this incredible,
stylish piece that just caught my eye.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.712
Look at this: It's beautiful.

00:00:40.712 --> 00:00:44.520
It's kinda got this tie-dye, this horizontal
kind of tie-dye Balinese effect.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.579
The price tag, unfortunately, was a little
bit steep.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:55.039
So I decided to go for it and make my own
version on my front lawn with absolutely no

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.820
prior experience.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.870
Seriously, I had absolutely no idea what I
was doing.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.500
So you might wanna stick around to watch this.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:11.040
It's a little embarrassing, but you might
learn something.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:16.370
Okay guys, so let's get started: I have never
done this before, so I'm not gonna lie, I

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.370
don't really know what I'm doing.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:19.370
This is my assistant: I want you all to meet
Pilar.

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.780
Vamonos, you're gonna help.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:21.780
You're gonna stay.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.360
I'm gonna start first by folding the muslin.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.130
So what you should have is something kind
of like this.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.310
Okay, then you fold this way, just like you
did the other side.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.470
Kinda like an accordion, like an accordion
file.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.160
Now once you have your fold -- super easy
-- grab two rubber bands, and then you'll

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.710
just wanna take your rubber bands and put
it like that.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.560
And we're gonna do the other rubber band.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:49.370
What's cool about muslin is that it will absorb
the material, the dye, really quickly.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.230
So once you've got your rubber bands in place,
then you're just gonna wanna submerge your

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:54.140
fabric in water.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.350
Now once you've wet your fabric, now it's
time for the fun stuff: We get to color.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.490
These tubes are great because it's really
easy to apply the color.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.290
And don't be precious about it, I mean, this
is not, you do not have to be perfect.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:12.510
Okay, now once you have this, you're just
gonna wanna let it sit for about 10 minutes.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:18.820
So once the dyes have had time to set, then
just go ahead and take off the rubber bands,

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.580
and then we're gonna go ahead and place the
tie-dyed fabric into cold water.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.810
And see, guys, this is when you really want
gloves.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:26.860
I don't know what I was thinking.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.250
I told you I didn't know what I was doing.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.890
Now once you've wrung out all the water, then
you can kinda shake it out and start to see

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:35.890
the design.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.430
Now the color is really saturated when the
fabric's still wet, but I already like it.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.850
I really like the way this turned out so far.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:45.630
I know that once it drys, it's gonna get a
little softer, the color.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.620
And I like the muted hues.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.570
But if at home, you want something that's
more bold or makes a bigger statement, then

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.410
just saturate the fabric in the color for
a little bit longer, and then you're gonna

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.730
get bolder hues and something that's more
of a statement.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.470
So we're finished up here, back to you in
the studio, Tracy.

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.470
Thanks, Tracy.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.870
So, what do you guys think?

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.410
I actually think it turned out pretty great,
thanks to my furry helper.

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.420
I had so much fun that I actually made this
version just for myself, and I let Pilar keep

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.420
the other one.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.960
What's cool about a project like this is that
it has so many uses.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:25.970
Okay, so you can obviously use it on a couch
or a sofa or even the back of chair, and it'll

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:29.290
add a lot of color to kind of a boring environment.

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:35.540
But you could also make scarf out of it, which
is amazing.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.070
You just need to put it around your neck,
like this, and you can sew it or tie it here.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:45.840
And when it's the summertime, then you can
just take it off of your couch and wrap around

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.370
your body, wear it like a sarong around your
swimsuit.

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.810
Oh, or you could hang it on the wall, so it
could be kind of a cool wall hanging.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.310
If you have a white wall, or even you could
hang it on bricks -- that would be really,

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:58.310
really cool.

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:59.310
I would like that.

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.620
Oh, and you know who else has some great tips
for wall hangings?

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.620
P. Allen Smith.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:05.319
So you should check out his videos.

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:10.100
What you wanna do is you wanna take an ordinary
bottle, and just take some string, and then

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:13.660
amplify the heat in the way of finger polish
remover.

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.170
Bring it back and put it on top.

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:19.919
And what I'm gonna do is start a fire, and
as soon as the fire goes out, I'll plunge

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.639
it into the water.

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:23.639
Ta-da!

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.300
You can plate up your favorite food, or you
can plate up your favorite wall.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.529
If you look closely, you can see, they have
a beautiful glaze.

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:32.610
They have a little foot on the back.

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:39.529
So the zip tie allowed me, then, to take it
and hang it on one of these just picture hooks

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:40.909
that I used here.

00:04:40.909 --> 00:04:43.740
I've shown you mine, now you show me yours.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:49.160
Send me a video response of any kind of tie-dying
or other kind of creative scarf-throw-wall

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.080
hanging-bikini cover up project that you guys
have done at home.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:56.539
And then, also, leave me a comment to let
me know if there's anything else that you'd

00:04:56.539 --> 00:04:58.669
like me to cover maybe in a future episode.

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:00.729
Now that's all the time we have for today.

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:05.879
I'll see you next time.
