And this week, we are going to make Moroccan Rice Pudding

00:00:31.724 --> 00:00:34.737
So Moroccan Rice Pudding is . . . the best!!!

00:00:34.737 --> 00:00:39.401
Is basically rice containing milk flavored with Orange Blossom Water

00:00:39.401 --> 00:00:43.065
Which is my favorite flavor in the whole entire world

00:00:43.065 --> 00:00:45.466
And it is perfect in Morocco

00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:50.161
we serve it at the end of the meal 
 before the dessert or as a dessert

00:00:50.161 --> 00:00:52.691
But of course, you can eat it any time you want

00:00:52.691 --> 00:00:55.449
in breakfast or as a snack or whatever

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:02.017

Just click the subscribe button. someone here around the video

00:01:11.371 --> 00:01:13.808
And that's it !!!  And let's start !!!

00:01:13.808 --> 00:01:16.117
First, wash the rice with water 

00:01:16.117 --> 00:01:19.658
and change the water a couple of times until the water becomes clear.

00:01:19.658 --> 00:01:24.562
It really makes a difference in the taste when 
 you take a minute to wash the rice.

00:01:24.562 --> 00:01:27.100
In a saucepan add the rice and water.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.955
Just remember, for every cup of rice, you use 2 cups of water 

00:01:30.955 --> 00:01:33.750
whatever the size of your cup is.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.266
Add a piece of lemon peel and a cinnamon stick. 

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:43.160
Cover your saucepan, leave a little opening for the steam to come out,

00:01:43.158 --> 00:01:45.340
and cook the rice on medium heat.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.080
Stir from time to time, so that the rice 
 at the bottom does not burn. 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.050
And it happens… so be careful!

00:01:52.052 --> 00:01:55.350
Once the water has evaporated, add the milk

00:01:55.348 --> 00:01:58.750
again 2 cups of milk for every cup of rice you used.

00:01:58.754 --> 00:02:03.810
Cover and continue cooking and of course stirring from time to time.

00:02:03.807 --> 00:02:06.560
When the milk has evaporated, taste your rice… 

00:02:06.562 --> 00:02:08.760
it needs to be really soft

00:02:08.755 --> 00:02:13.100
if it’s not, add a little more milk and continue cooking. 

00:02:13.103 --> 00:02:19.370
When your rice is ready add sugar and butter. Mix well.

00:02:19.374 --> 00:02:22.900
Turn off the heat and finish with orange blossom water.

00:02:22.902 --> 00:02:25.460
Now, that is it

00:02:25.462 --> 00:02:29.860
Serve warm or cold in a cup, and decorate with ground cinnamon. 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:34.880
Yummmyyy…. Bon appetite!
