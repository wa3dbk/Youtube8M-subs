00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:11.320
I am here on behalf of Expert Village today.
I am putting together the last portion of

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:18.860
our romantic dinner for two on the Italian
segment. What is missing from this Italian

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:26.750
meal, well it is an antipasti, no Italian
dish would be good without it. We have got

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:36.989
some salami, 2 different types actually that
we will put on the dish, some prosciutto which

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:46.769
is my favorite. When I was in Italy, at 19,
I used to shave it right off the bone, it

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:58.911
is delicious off of a ham. Some capagol, which
is another favorite of mine and then some

00:00:58.911 --> 00:01:08.040
mozzarella cheese. This is fresh mozzarella,
so we want to add that and make a little pretty

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:28.860
dish. Cut it out, lay those down like that
and we are going to add for color, some red

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:54.729
peppers and some black pitted olives. I am
always into Italian seasoning and Bio Trace

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:08.429
harvest spaghetti sauce and sprinkle lightly
over top.

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:20.860
Put a side dish of Parmesan Reggiano cheese
that we can eat right off with a clever. Bon

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:31.930
Appetite. Take a look at that, clam, red clam
sauce over linguine with an antipasti and

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:39.309
the bread. Could not be any better for a wonderful
romantic dinner for two. Bon Appetite.
