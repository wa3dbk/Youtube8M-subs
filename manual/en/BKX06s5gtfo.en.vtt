00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.600
Some folks freak out when the Check Engine
light comes on in their car.

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:09.090
Sometimes it’s a big deal.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.210
Sometimes it’s not.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.889
What gets people riled up is that they think
they have to go back to the dealer to get

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:16.610
those codes read.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:17.610
And you know what?

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:19.179
That’s not true anymore.

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.400
Now local auto parts stores have started offering
free OBD scans.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.180
That’s cool, if you have a good auto parts
store and you trust them.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.240
Go in there.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:34.460
You can also read OBD codes with an app and
an iPhone or an Android device.

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:38.620
Now I have an iPhone, an older iPhone, that’s
what I use.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.530
And you also need a way to get the information
from the OBD port under the dash into your

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.199
device.

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:50.949
Now I use a GoPoint cable, just because, that’s
what I have.

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:53.270
There are WiFi dongles, there are Bluetooth
dongles.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.050
There’s a bunch of stuff out there and if
you look around you can find some things that

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.550
are pretty inexpensive.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:00:59.969
The apps don’t cost much.

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.020
I like Carbonga as an app, because it doesn’t
just show you the codes, it shows you what

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.020
the codes mean.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:13.020
A lot of devices will just tell you it’s
a 1753241 and you have to go to the Internet

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.020
and look it up and that can be kind of a pain
in the neck.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.950
With Carbonga it shows you the code number
and it tells you exactly what’s going on.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:27.970
We’re going to hook up the Battlewagon and
find out exactly what’s going on.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.560
I have an idea it might not be too pretty.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.180
You can see the dash is lit up like a Christmas
tree.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:02:06.610
One Hundred and Seventy Something miles on
it.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:13.709
First thing we’re going to do is go to GoLink
and make sure the link is working.

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:17.430
We’ll do a quick scan.

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.090
Ooops, can’t find it.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.420
This is a problem with this cable.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:32.170
We’re going to exit out of this, disconnect
the cable and connect it again.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:42.260
And go back to GoLink and do a quick scan.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.159
Okay.

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:48.159
It sees it, right?

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:55.069
We have all these stats loading up.

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.160
Cool stuff.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.740
I like to initialize by running GoLink.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:10.590
Now we’re going to go to Carbonga.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:13.430
Come on.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:20.659
It takes a little while.

00:03:20.659 --> 00:03:30.840
Battle wagon.

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.249
Ooooh, we got a lot of stuff.

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:41.540
A lot of stuff going on there.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.959
Camshaft Position Sensor
Incorrect Gear Ratio

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.239
Shift Error
EVAP Emission Control System

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:49.400
This thing is loaded up.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.599
It gives you all the codes.

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:59.330
Camshaft Position Sensor ... that’s an interesting
one, eh?

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:04.930
Incorrect Gear Ratio ... the transmission’s
been feeling funny.

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:10.010
A Shift Error ... same deal there.

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.870
And an Emission Control System leak.

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:14.859
What do you say?

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:17.959
SO that’s it, we know what’s wrong with
it.

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.140
Transmission, Engine, 170,000 miles.

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:26.790
What do you think, can we hit 200?
