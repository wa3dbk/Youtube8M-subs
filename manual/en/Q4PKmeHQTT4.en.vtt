00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.959
Probably lot of ways to do bicep, tricep on
the playground. Many ways I can show you where

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:10.220
I actually incorporate a lot of the equipment.
Let me show you something really basic, really

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.120
easy, so you have at least something to use
no matter where you are. Because you can take

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.150
this even traveling, right? Alright, basic
bicep curls. The key on this, is that you

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.669
have enough resistance. I have a pretty hard
tube, tight tube. So my feet are close together.

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:31.849
So just curling up, with my elbows in, is
pretty difficult. If this was a tube that

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:38.050
perhaps was stretched out, I would have to
step apart further. Right? I'd have to step

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:43.900
apart further to get more resistance. Another
variation on the bicep curl, would be to take

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:51.830
it both, one arm. Definitely difficult. I
can also twist it where my thumb is on top,

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.980
and I'm coming up with a hammer curl. There's
a lot of variations. I can take it out to

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.260
the side more. But this is your basic bicep
curl with the tubing. Lets move to tricep,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.440
which is the opposing muscle. And I'm going
to show you from the side. Now, again, resistance

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.251
is critical, it's key. It depends where you
step on the tubing. If I step closer to the

00:01:15.251 --> 00:01:23.740
handle, harder to do. If I step further away
from the handle, easier to do. I'm going to

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:27.979
try just right in the middle to start. I'm
going to keep my elbow in, by my side, I'm

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.080
going to bend both knees, I'm going to look
straight ahead, and I'm going to simply kick

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:38.720
it back. Notice my wrist position, and now
notice my wrist position is going to change,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:46.990
look at it now. See the change? Palm back,
and then palm facing the body. Can I do both

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.380
arms at the same time? Yes I can. Is it much
harder? Absolutely. Bend your knees, straight

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:58.250
back. Now, for this I'm twisting in and out
with my wrist. A lot of ways to do it. Here's

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.170
the key. Be careful not to take it out to
the side, keep it in tight. Upper part of

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.650
my arm does not move. A kick back, simply
means that you're kicking back your arm. Okay.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:17.200
A kickback. I have other exercises with the
tubing for tricep, and we'll get into that

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.250
at another time. Right now this is enough
to really work your bicep and your tricep.
