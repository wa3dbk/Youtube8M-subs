00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:07.069
Hi! I’m David Kaynor for expertvillage.com.
I’m going to talk about conditions to avoid

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:15.769
in the violin. The overall watchword is never
subject a violin to anything that would be

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:25.600
intolerable for a human being. So a violin
should never be left in a hot car, ideally

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.349
it wouldn’t be left in a cold car either,
it would be protected from extremes of temperature,

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:42.530
also from extreme rapid changes in temperature.
There’s an ideal humidity range for violins,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:53.760
and I have forgotten the exact numbers, but
basically extremes of too much humidity or

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.030
too little humidity, it’s considered a bad
idea, and rapid changes are to be avoided

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:07.990
as well. Some violin players and fiddle players
will actually moisten a sponge and put it

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:14.071
inside a film can, which has had holes drilled
in it and keep that in the fiddle case and

00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:21.790
the idea is that, that moist sponge releases
water vapor into the environment of the fiddle

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:30.240
case, which maintains some degree of humidity,
and that’s considered an especially a good

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:37.830
idea in the middle of a cold snap when central
heating causes air to become unusually dry.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:50.090
There are a number of good commercially available
humidity stabilizing products, including the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:02:01.259
much discussed Damp-it, which is an actual
long rubber tube with holes in it and long

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:08.789
tubular piece of sponge inside, and when that
is immersed in water and the sponge is moistened

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:17.390
and then the tube is dried off, it can actually
be inserted into the f-hole of the violin,

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:26.450
and it releases water vapor to the inside
of the instrument. And that has had wide spread

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.550
use, and a lot of people feel that it’s
a very good way to protect the fiddle during

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:40.670
the winter. It’s good to avoid leaving a
violin in direct sunlight, because the direct

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:47.379
sun, the violin, the darker it is the more
it can act like a solar collector, and it

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:55.250
can get hot enough to actually cause glue
to fail within the instrument. And I’ve

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:05.879
heard stories of violin’s literally imploding
when a lot of the glue holding the top ribs

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:13.500
and back together failed all at once, and
the string tension literally pulled the instrument,

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:14.969
parts of the instrument apart.
