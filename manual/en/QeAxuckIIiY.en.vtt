00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.700
welcome to italian cuisine at home

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:08.610
today a recipe of mine,
cuttlefishes filled with

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.679
rice and blue mussels

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.229
a recipe easy to make

00:00:13.229 --> 00:00:17.239
without difficulties, but I think
suitable also for an important dinner

00:00:17.239 --> 00:00:19.859
if you like it of course

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.679
begin with  preparation of

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:25.550
risotto with blue mussels

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.689
so while it's cooking

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:30.880
we will prepare the cuttlefishes

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.410
trying to optimize the working times

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:40.400
in this case you can use
olive oil instead of butter

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.820
for coooking risotto

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.730
very few is needed

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.460
just a little for toasting it

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.589
we will use also

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.320
for risotto preparation

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.740
cuttlefishes tentacles

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.320
which i already cleansed and rinsed

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.960
as soon as the olive
oil is hot add rice

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.400
and make it toasted

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.810
it takes

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.100
few seconds

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.130
add

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:22.130
half glass white wine
and make it reduced

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.020
so the risotto begins cooking

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.600
in the meantime begin
with cuttlefishes

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.830
now as soon

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.760
as the white wine is evaporated

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.380
add all the blue musssels stock

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.670
already filtered

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.510
I have filtered twice,
better more than less

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.570
low heat and boil the rice

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.840
in the meantime I boiled some
water sould it not be

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.060
enough, it is possible

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.120
in the same time pre-heat

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.530
the cuttlefishes

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.000
we put them with remaining part

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.930
of white wine

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.989
in a large pan, which we
will be using also later

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.709
add some hot water again

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.109
cover

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:21.349
and let them cook, so when the rice
will be ready also cuttlefishes

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.019
will be ready

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:23.900
while

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.019
the risotto is cookng I
prepare the blue mussels

00:02:27.019 --> 00:02:34.019
which, being already open, we'll add to
rice at the end of cooking with safron

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:40.559
add water ti rice a little et
time for finishing cooking

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:43.529
stirring as less as possible

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:49.019
for avoiding the amid to
spread all over the pan

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.829
when the risotto reaches 3/4 of total
cooking add a pnich of hot pepperq

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:57.769
if you like it

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:00.399
but it gives the risotto personality

00:03:00.399 --> 00:03:03.219
it is also a good time for controlling

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:06.069
whether it is correctly salted

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:07.439
then add

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.319
parsley

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:11.719
that I prepare

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:13.509
generally

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:17.129
already frozen, few photogenic,
but i make you sure,

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:21.139
very useful

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:28.139
when the risotto is very "al dente",
but cooked, start with adding safron

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:39.419
last the blue-mussels

00:03:40.689 --> 00:03:43.539
stirr again the risotto

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:46.819
let it rest for 1 minute

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.200
waiting for

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.849
end of cooking

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.759
completely

00:03:51.759 --> 00:03:55.199
in the meatime as you can
see the cuttlefishes are

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:56.139
ready

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:58.199
and tender

00:03:58.199 --> 00:04:03.379
and we can stuff them, if you
want to keep the rice hot

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:08.809
or warm up later keep
apart the cuttlefishes

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:10.719
cooking water

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:17.719
stuff cuttlefishes with risotto

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.729
garnish

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:26.099
cuttlefishes with some parsil leaves

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:28.819
that we had kept apart

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.229
and one blue mussels in its shell

00:04:31.229 --> 00:04:35.710
ready to be served, see you soon
