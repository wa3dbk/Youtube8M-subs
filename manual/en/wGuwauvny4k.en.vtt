Hi, we are today in Burnet Texas, and we're
going to show you what we have.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:17.700
This property is for sale. It's on the market,
and it's pink. The surround is pink

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:25.970
and the tub is a gorgeous cast iron tub, it's
in excellent condition, but it's pink.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.900
And you know, pink nowadays is not a good
thing to have in a bathtub because it's

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.030
outdated.
So, what they decided to do was, leave the

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.910
pink on the surround, and just leave it the
way it is. They were going to resurface it,

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:46.030
but they changed their mind, they said
probably they don't need to do that.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.610
And they're only going to do the tub - or
we're going to resurface the tub. It's

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.239
going to be in porcelain white because that's
going to match to the toilet, that's

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.010
the color they have.
And so everything else is good, we're going

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.600
to take care of the caulking, we're
going to make it nice and shiny and when we

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.760
have it, we're going to be more than
happy to show you.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.110
So we're done refinishing this tub- and we're
ready to show you the difference.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.790
So here's the pink surround that's going to
remain, as we told you, and here's the

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:23.330
tub.
Porcelain white tub, it's gorgeous, and by

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.440
the way: the drain the gentleman
had here before was damaged, so we put in

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.120
a new glue-in drain and that makes it
very nice.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.640
We don't need plumbing - messing around with
the plumbing, or anything like that.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.940
We just get it done right now and it's done.
We also removed the old caulking, applied

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.951
new caulking, and here it is.
Pretty nice, pretty glossy, long lasting.

00:01:47.951 --> 00:01:56.040
It's not new, it's just beautiful, easy to
clean, and long lasting with the proper care.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.240
Thank you for watching.
