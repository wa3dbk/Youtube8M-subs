SST Software is located a few miles west of main campus of OSU at Stillwater. With me is its CEO David Waits.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:34.449
David you are a graduate of OSU. You are more than that, you used to be on our geography faculty. Take us from how

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:44.250
a farm boy from Kansas, gets an OSU degree in geography. I did a masters degree in economics and a master in 

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:56.370
geography from OSU. I was with the NASA commercialization center and began my quest to commercialize geo-techniques

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:08.419
into production agriculture. Then had the opportunity to join the faculty at OSU and continued to figure out how to

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:18.669
take these tools we give students and make them work in the real world. This company is the result of that. The 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:27.689
research that you did at OSU resulted in this company. Very much. The support of OSU has been critical here.

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:39.289
We have a great partnership, we do we do. You hire a lot of our grads. We have 48 employees and 29 are OSU grads.

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:51.489
We are proud of that. Where do you do business outside the US? We do business in 28 countries but we are focusing 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:02:00.809
heavily on Australia and moving rapidly into Brazil. Lets go have a look at this technology, its fascinating.

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:08.209
We're here in David's office at SST Software to learn a little about how this works, we've been joined by someone 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:25.339
else. Danilo Barros. Where are you from? I'm from Sao Paolo state in Brazil. How did you go from Brazil to OSU to SST?

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:35.539
I went to OSU-IT in their precision agriculture program. They have a partnership with two of the main colleges in 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:48.889
Brazil. One of their meetings in Brazil, I attended and heard about OSU. So you are training to represent SST in 

00:02:48.909 --> 00:03:00.489
Brazil? Yes I am helping them understand the markets in Brazil and the needs before approaching that market.

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:11.709
for years a farmer would apply an even amount of seed and nutrients to the soil. The old approach was to take 2 or 3

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:22.719
soil samples from a field, mix it all together and get an average for the field. It ends up in over application for

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:30.069
an area and under application in others. You get the data then what happens? We provide an online data processing 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:41.469
service. Our clientele use our software out in the field, collect our data. They organize the data here on our 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:48.219
software then synchronize the data to our servers and we place an order on the data. That order may be a fertilizer

00:03:48.239 --> 00:04:03.120
organization. Using their agronomy and their methods, whatever they would do otherwise. We take a grade of phosphorus

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:12.620
or pot ash or potassium or whatever they are sampling for. This is the absolute model for the technology transfer

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:27.239
we are going for with OSU knowledge and research. You've done it and now its spreading worldwide. Congratulations.

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:40.340
We're glad you went to OSU IT, and I hope you'll send us more students.	This is pretty exciting and its happening 

00:04:40.359 --> 00:04:48.359
here in our hometown. Thats another edition of Inside OSU. For David Waits and Danilo Barros at SST Software.

00:04:48.359 --> 00:04:50.000
We'll see you next time.
