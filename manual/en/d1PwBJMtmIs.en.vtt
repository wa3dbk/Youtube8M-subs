Hi, I'm Mike Lais on behalf of Expert Village.
Today we are going to be talking about getting

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:13.080
familiar with the guitar. The different parts
of the guitar. Everybody likes to sound smart

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.141
when they are talking about their own stuff.
Right? So, here is my gift to you so that

00:00:17.141 --> 00:00:22.660
you can sound smart. We'll start with the
simple stuff. These right here are the strings

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:29.290
obviously. This is the first string and then
the numbering system just goes up: 1, 2, and

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:37.880
3,4,5,6. Six being your thickest string. The
next part of the guitar that we have are these

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:44.760
little strips right here on the finger board.
These divide the guitar up into half steps.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.530
So that when you're playing, you're actually
going to get your tone from placing your fingers

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.810
just above these frets. Then when we move
up here further, we get something called the

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.470
head stock. This is where you're going to
place a lot of your strings. It holds the

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:06.149
tension of your guitar. It keeps everything
nice and straight, and where you can also

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:11.660
place your tuning pegs. Which is the part
of the guitar in which you're going to tune,

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:15.700
or you're going to turn these things left
or right depending on which way you need to

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.060
go to tune your guitar. They come in different
ways and everything like that. For a Stratocaster

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.749
you're going to see 6 all the way across,
or you will see this for a Martin or for some

00:01:27.749 --> 00:01:33.460
other's like Les Paul's you're going to see
it on both sides like this. The next part

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:39.429
that we're talking about is the nut. This
is what holds the strings in place for your

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:45.270
guitar, so that you don't have as much tension
going on (on just the tuning pegs). It allows

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.009
your guitar to stay in tune for a longer period
of time. If you move on down the fingerboard

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:58.299
here, it takes us to the body. This on an
acoustic guitar (as most acoustic guitars)

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.070
is a hallow body, which means that you have
a sound hole here. This is where your sound

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.330
is going to come out and you have the most
sound if you strum over the sound hole and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.370
everything like that. I have a cutaway on
this body here to make it so that I can reach

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:18.560
my higher notes when it comes time to do that.
Not all guitars have that, again that's personal

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.260
preference on how you wish to play. We follow
down here. This is the bridge of the guitar.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:32.720
This is what keeps your guitar in place with
the body. These pin pegs is what will hold

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.890
the string to the bridge on an acoustic guitar.
Which applies enough tension where you can

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.469
keep it in tune when you put it in tune? The
next part we have is the pick guard. This

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:49.760
is just basically (when you're strumming)
and you hit your guitar it will protect your

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.871
wood from any scratches that you're going
to put on it. That's basically your guitar

00:02:54.871 --> 00:02:59.680
right there. Now you can sound like a genius
when it comes to telling mom what you just

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.890
bought.
