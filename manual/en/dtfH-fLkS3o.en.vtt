Hi this is Nigel Gregory with Blue Griffin
Handyman. Today we're going to show you how

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:10.620
to use a chisel. Now chisels come in various
sizes. This one is a one-inch chisel. And

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:16.280
you want to be careful with the chisels because
the blade is pretty sharp, so be careful when

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:21.470
removing them and using them in general. Now
you want to make sure you always have your

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:30.190
eye-protection when using a hammer, and especially
a chisel. When using a chisel to cut out of

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:38.710
a piece of wood look at the grain of the wood.
Notice how the grain goes longways on this

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.399
board. You want to work with that. You want
to use that when you're using the chisel.

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:49.870
Because if you're trying to chisel against
the grain it's going to come out, here I'll

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:57.280
show you. I'll demonstrate. It's going to
come out splintered like that. And you want

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.760
to avoid doing that. So what you want to do
is draw out the space that you want chiseled

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:13.409
out, place the blade at one end against the
grain, but go straight down with it. Once

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.810
you've made a good indentation into the wood
then you can come at an angle and go with

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:28.110
the grain and it'll pull it out. Here let
me make the other, and now we'll go straight

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:34.420
on down. You might even want, if you want
a really exact hole, go along all lines and

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:41.710
go straight down. Mark it out. Delineate the
area you want chiseled out by going straight

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:55.799
down with the chisel.
Then take it at one end against the grain,

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:05.030
and chisel toward the other end of the board.
Notice how the wood is just lifting right

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:11.370
up. And if you get a good leverage you don't
have to tap very hard and you can lift, you

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:19.890
can leverage up that piece of wood. Kind of
like with fulcrum. Keep tapping it and it

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:27.060
should come right out. Leverage up. Notice
how that piece of wood that I just marked

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.700
out came right out. Of course you can perfect
it a little bit and come back over here. Leverage

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.310
it out. And if you want it deeper if it's
not deep enough just keep working it. Keep

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.930
going straight down and then go at an angle
with the grain and you should get a really

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.840
good piece out of the wood. And that's how
to use a chisel.
