00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.410
The modern primates are descendents of those
first mammals, those tiny insectivores that

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.530
hid in the jungles of Gondwana. Today, they
have colonised all the continents, and the

00:00:20.531 --> 00:00:25.231
most adaptable species of all, man, has conquered
the entire planet.

00:00:32.411 --> 00:00:36.971
In South America, still separated from the
lands to the north, the primates were isolated

00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:42.781
and produced the so-called New World monkeys,
such as the howlers and these capuchin monkeys.

00:00:49.581 --> 00:00:54.160
But in Africa and Asia a group which scientists
have called Old World monkeys, culminated

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:00.081
in the appearance of man and the large modern
pongids: the chimpanzees, the African gorillas

00:01:00.081 --> 00:01:02.761
and the agile orang-utans of south east Asia.

00:01:15.471 --> 00:01:20.770
The large simians, up to then the most intelligent
animals in creation, had developed from ancestral

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.660
primates subjected to constant processes of
natural selection in permanent competition

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.940
with other species.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.800
But at a time when mammals had not even begun
to develop their incredible capacity for generating

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.071
new species, Madagascar had separated from
Africa and had remained isolated in the Indian

00:01:54.071 --> 00:01:59.160
Ocean. How then can we explain the existence
there of the enigmatic pro-simians which we

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.920
now call lemurs?

00:02:10.171 --> 00:02:15.411
A broad-billed roller stands watchful guard
in the Analamazaotra jungle, in the east of

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.040
Madagascar. For the birds, it was easy to
fly to the island, crossing over the Mozambique

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.500
Channel, but when they arrived, they found
Madagascar already had other inhabitants.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.540
And some of their descendents are those this
roller is observing.

00:02:37.891 --> 00:02:43.050
Today, there are almost 85 species of snake
in Madagascar. When the island formed, among

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:47.760
the snakes that remained here there was not
a single poisonous one, and their descendents

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.800
to this day remain loyal to their origins.
But what worries the roller, which has just

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:59.300
completed its nest, is not the poison. Almost
all Madagascan snakes like eggs, and some

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.940
have developed into skilful climbers.

00:03:13.771 --> 00:03:19.371
This Ithycyphus, which the locals call the
“fandrefiala” is one of the most agile

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.591
tree-climbing snakes in the jungles of Madagascar.
Despite the thorny bark that surrounds the

00:03:25.591 --> 00:03:30.151
nest of the roller, the snake climbs up, testing
the air with its forked tongue.

00:03:37.651 --> 00:03:43.231
But what the Ithycyphus does not know is that
the mother is watching his every move, and

00:03:43.231 --> 00:03:47.941
it is one thing to steal the eggs from a nest,
quite another to challenge a broad-billed

00:03:47.941 --> 00:03:50.321
determined to defend her offspring.

00:04:04.081 --> 00:04:08.500
When Madagascar became an island, the animals
in its interior adapted to the conditions

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.530
of its different ecosystems in order to avoid
falling prey to the enemies that shared their

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:18.130
isolation. And one of the most effective adaptations
of all was camouflage.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.841
The constant vigilance of the roller detects
a small gecko. These inoffensive reptiles

00:04:30.841 --> 00:04:35.520
were one of the groups that chose camouflage.
But in the jungles of Madagascar, you need

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:39.860
to be constantly on the alert, because your
enemies too may have learnt to hide.

00:04:50.861 --> 00:04:57.030
Looking just like a branch moved by the wind,
this hognose snake knows how to wait patiently,

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:59.330
trusting in its extraordinary disguise.

00:05:08.731 --> 00:05:15.370
Among the dense vegetation, death slowly approaches
its prey, advancing slightly then freezing,

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.670
again turning into a branch, while the roller,
knowing her eggs are safe, is a silent witness

00:05:20.671 --> 00:05:22.751
to the drama unfolding below.

00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:37.824
the drama unfolding below.

00:05:36.091 --> 00:05:40.351
The gecko feels safe among the leaves and,
without realising, stands right in the jaws

00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:47.351
of its mortal enemy. And in the isolated world
of Lemuria there are no second chances.

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:16.140
The hognose snake is not poisonous and so
cannot rapidly kill its prey, and has to attempt

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.500
to choke it or swallow it alive.

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.971
Little by little, the hunter moves the head
of its prey into a position which makes it

00:06:31.971 --> 00:06:34.071
possible to begin swallowing it.

00:06:44.231 --> 00:06:49.051
The gecko fights with the last strength of desperation,
because once its head is inside the snake

00:06:49.061 --> 00:06:56.061
it will be impossible for it to breathe and
it will die. A futile struggle. The hognose

00:06:56.061 --> 00:07:03.251
snake now holds it firm, and is an expert
hunter. It knows time is on its side, and

00:07:03.251 --> 00:07:09.922
again it waits. Now, its prey cannot breathe
and realises its strength is running out.

00:07:09.931 --> 00:07:13.551
Before it has been swallowed entirely, the
little gecko will already have died.
