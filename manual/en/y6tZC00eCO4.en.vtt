Hi! In today’s tutorial, I will show you how to apply jewels on your nails.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.720
You'll see how to apply it with glue or some gel.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.840
And I will show how to make a cute design to go with it.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.190
I hope that you'll enjouy this fresh new nail art design.

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:30.980
Here are the jewels I'm going to use, they are actually made with plastic and they are about 8mm in length and 1-2 mm in height.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.960
I have made today’s design on natural nails with the participation of Yoko.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.970
To do this, we’ll need a square brush to make a one stroke.

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.310
I dip one side of the brush in the nail polish.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:46.810
Only dip the tip on the brush

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:51.720
Then twist the brush between your fingers to make a circle.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.380
Like in my previous video about disco nail art design.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.490
I make circles of the same colors as the jewels I will use.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.580
Most of the time Jewels are applied mainly on artificial nails because they are fixed with gel.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.900
They should be applied just before finishing the design.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.640
Keep in mind that you should not lay the jewel while making the design.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:21.160
Only in the case of round or oval-shaped jewels, you can lay them while making your design.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:26.720
But big jewels like these ones should be put on once you finish the design.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.180
So then you complete your design by laying the jewel.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.230
Here, I will put it on natural nails.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:41.210
On natural nails Jewels don’t last as long. They tend to come off easily.

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:51.610
Here I’m using top coat but you can also use artificial nail glue, which would last longer.

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.480
Then I grab the jewel with a pair of pliers and apply it on the nail.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.750
Now I apply some top coat, all around the jewel but not on it.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.780
The top coat will make it hold better.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:07.650
So that’s how we apply a jewel.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.110
It's the kind of jewel that you can wear for an evening.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.370
It's not made to last for weeks.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.610
On artificial nails, it may last a bit longer if you are very careful with your nails

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.780
And if you don’t do stuff like gardening.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.280
That’s it! I hope you enjoyed this video! Tell me about it, subscribe for two new tutorials each week
