Hey Toy Tubers! Surprise Toy Collector here!

00:00:05.201 --> 00:00:09.521
Today I am going to show you Thomas and Friends - Roaring Dino Run!

00:00:13.183 --> 00:00:14.623
Let's put it together

00:00:31.612 --> 00:00:33.772
Here are some of the small pieces

00:00:57.825 --> 00:01:00.065
and it has a lot of track pieces too

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.000
Let's open the bag of smaller pieces

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.400
There's some dinosaur bones...

00:01:25.767 --> 00:01:26.887
track pieces...

00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:31.954
and a dinosaur head

00:01:41.516 --> 00:01:42.796
And here is Thomas!

00:02:07.654 --> 00:02:10.134
The track pieces just snap into place

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.360
You can drive Thomas all around the track

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.980
and even find some dinosaur bones

00:04:41.968 --> 00:04:44.528
Now it's time to race down the mountain

00:04:52.734 --> 00:04:54.494
Looks like we woke up T-Rex

00:04:57.594 --> 00:05:02.874
and when you are finished playing, the set fold right up so you can carry it away!

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:28.540
