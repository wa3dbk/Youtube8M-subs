hey boys and girls I'm Rhino and welcome
to Le Chef Paresseux

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.940
Today we're making a scotch egg. I was
really excited to tackle this

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.490
because when I was looking up recipes like
on the Food Network

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.440
it wanted me to take two days

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.470
Two days to make a Scotch Egg

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.550
I don't have two days to make an egg

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.180
Oh, no, no. I would never do that to you guys. Never.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:35.180
We can do so much better.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:41.520
 if you're unfamiliar with the Scotch egg

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.520
it's basically a hard-boiled egg
that's wrapped

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.200
in meat and then deep fried

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.900
yeah only problem is I don't eat meat
and I don't eat

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.110
breadcrumbs. but if you do eat

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.720
regular bread and you do eat meat don't
worry

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.480
it's very easy to follow along. so
basically

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:06.330
you're going to want to first boil your eggs.
if you don't remember from

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.070
our deviled egg lesson in order to hard
boil an egg you're going to put all of the eggs

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.479
into hot water then you'll bring that to
a rolling boil

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.940
so that the surface is bubbling. then as
soon as it starts rolling boil

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:24.580
turn the heat off put the lid on and let
it sit for 10 to 12 minutes

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.090
then strain it rinse it under some cold
water

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.380
and put it in beer steins with ice and
water

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.100
Yay! you're making an ice bath it just
happens to be that may beer steins work

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.570
really well for it. Let them sit in the ice
bath for about another 10 minutes

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.170
so that their cool to the touch. if
they're hot to the touch

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.310
it's just going to be really uncomfortable
for you to peel them

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.800
the whole process of hard boiling the eggs
is the longest portion of this recipe

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.600
which is the opposite of every recipe for
Scotch eggs you find online

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.259
You're welcome for that, and I will tell you why. 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.220
Usually they want you to deep fry it. Which is a lot of effort, and last time I tried to deep fry something

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.200
my house smelled like burnt funnel cake
for a very long time

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.220
on the other hand if you bake it

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:15.270
they want you to bake it for like an hour. 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.360
I am not going to bake for an hour people. I got

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.260
10 minutes to cook this. So here's what
you do

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.550
you need Gardein

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.980
this is fake ground beef. It is also gluten free. 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.390
Yay! or you can use regular

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.190
sausage,  regular ground beef, whatever you like

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.950
point is: this is cooked already. so if
you're using sausage

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.370
just cook it up in the fry pan with some olive oil

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.020
you want it to be in small mashable
pieces

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.250
and you want it to already be cooked. That's important. 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.350
Then you're going to mix about 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.900
three-quarters of a cup with

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.710
one to two full tablespoons of hommus

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:07.720
per egg. So I'm doing four eggs, I am going to use three cups of ground beef

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.680
and about 3 to 4 tablespoons of this hommus. Now the hommus is the emulsifier that's what

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.910
going to make all the ground beef

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.750
stay together. now there's a lot of
vegetarian recipes out there that use

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.460
chickpeas in a food processor

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:23.170
I love my food processor but I don't
have time to wash another dish

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.990
so we are going to use hummus. this is red pepper
hummus by Cedar's

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:30.650
it is gluten free, organic non-gmo

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.310
win, win, win. we're using tapioca flour

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.540
but you can use regular if you eat regular
flour there's a couple different ways to do it

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.420
but basically

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:42.520
you need to flower the egg

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.640
so that our stirred up concoction of hommus and fake meat

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.740
will stick to the egg. so you can make a
flat

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.990
circle in your palm and then put the egg in and fold it over. Put some on the

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.510
other side mash it together you'll be
amazed how well it sticks to the Egg when

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.810
that

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.810
flower is there and also the hommus is
really helping at all stick together

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.350
roll it around like a ball, toss it
between your hands a few times

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.690
that will help pat down gently without
crashing anything

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.750
then roll it in an egg wash

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:20.030
that's one single large egg that has been whisked

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:23.980
you roll in breadcrumbs. We are using Glutino

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:27.910
gluten-free bread crumbs now these taste
really good

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.110
they're made basically of just cornmeal and
sugar and that's it

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.610
but they're not gonna brown like a dark
brown they can stay pretty golden

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:41.760
so if you are anticipating its gonna come out
looking really dark

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:45.210
it's really. not yeah I think the egg
having four

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:49.700
sides. just we're gonna broil the top

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.830
for two and a half minutes and the
bottom for two and a half minutes

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:56.820
then flip it onto the side for two and a half minutes then flip it all the way over again

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.060
for two and a half minutes

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:02.730
Now that's 10 minutes of broiling. I am also going to put a little olive oil onto

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.300
each piece just to make sure that it
stays moist

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.660
Cut her open. I recommend using a bread knife
that will make it easier

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.710
And there you have it: a scotch egg.

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.030
amazing so

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.280
so tasty I don't know why I didn't try this sooner. 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.580
yes I do, because it looked daunting. but hey
only 10 minutes

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:28.250
cook time: maybe 10 minutes of prep. and than yeah ... 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.060
you have to make hard boiled eggs but
all and all

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:35.930
I made it much simpler. So hurray!

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:39.070
go out try it. be merry. I am going to go eat this now. 

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.250
