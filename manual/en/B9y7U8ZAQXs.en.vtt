00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.819
there are several ways in which we make
the Passion Spa

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:11.790
planet friendly for you and in the
process will allow you to save money

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.139
because of the efficiency of the spa. We
start with the insulation it's a three

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:17.430
step process

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.740
each Spa Shell is fully insulated with a
high density foam

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.960
to retain the heat within the shell but
secondly

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.119
we wrap the entire cabinet of the Spa

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:31.660
with this insulating blanket which fully
retains that heat

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.090
and then a third step is the back of the panel

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.460
has a full three quarter inch of
insulation around the entire Spa

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.510
as well as on the corners of the spa
cabinet. So we have the Spa Shell insulated

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.700
we've got a blanket and then we've got
the back of the panel that's insulated

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.960
providing a full energy retention system

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.600
that keeps the Spa very efficient for
operational costs

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.969
in addition of the the three layers of
insulation that are on every Passion

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:00.600
Spa

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.790
we also utilize the pumps to make the
spa more energy efficient for you

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.150
we start with air filtration pump which
is low wattage

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.380
and draws a minimal amount of
electricity to keep the energy costs low

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.670
we further utilize the heat that's
generated from the performance pumps

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.110
we retain that heat between the wall of
the cabinet and the shell

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.280
which are both insulated and allows the
heat from those pumps to circulate below

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:29.229
the Spa. In addition the control system is
programmable

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:33.400
what that allows you to do is have the
filtration pump come on and off

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:38.140
when you want and how often you want
thereby reducing your energy costs

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.820
even further. Of course all the energy
and efficiency in the world

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.759
is not going to do any good if you don't
have a good cover heat rises and so it's

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.820
very important that we retain that heat

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.729
the passion spa cover is thick its 5 to 4

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:55.860
with a little bit of a taper to allow
the runoff

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.020
it's very thick but it's also very
effective

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.969
because at the center we have this
center strip

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:06.490
which allows the gap between the two
halves to seal

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.629
and so that when you close the cover
that centerpiece gets sandwiched in

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.110
between and creates a

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:19.000
nice tight barrier furthermore the
covers very strong if you are one of those

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.700
customers who lives in a northern
climate with a lot of snow you don't

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.100
have to worry about weight load

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.220
because this is a strong cover so the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.900
combine package of the insulation the
pumps

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.730
the heat retention and the cover create
a Spa that is very energy efficient for

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.000
you
