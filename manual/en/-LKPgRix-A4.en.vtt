Hi it’s Emily from Bite Size Vegan and welcome
to another vegan nugget. Today’s video is

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.020
another installment of my interview with vegan
activist Gary Yourofsky. Now, if you’re vegan

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:13.749
or even considering being vegan, chances are
you’ve come up against some anti-vegan

00:00:13.749 --> 00:00:17.950
arguments. Perhaps you’ve even
posed some of them yourself in the time leading

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.410
up to being vegan. While legitimate questions
and concerns from non-vegans can serve as

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.350
teaching moments and are valuable opportunities
for education, some anti-vegan arguments are

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:32.390
purely baseless and made only to provoke.
In his vast experience working with non-vegans,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:36.670
Gary Yourofsky has probably heard every line
of reasoning in the book. So, I decided to

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.600
ask him what is the best anti-vegan argument.
Let’s check out his answer and then I’ll

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.449
jump back in with what I think is the strongest
argument against veganism.

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:53.099
Emily: So you would know more than anyone
else that there are a lot of stupid arguments

00:00:53.099 --> 00:00:58.739
against veganism. What would you say is the
best argument against veganism, if there is

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.629
one?
Gary: There’s not, honestly. I swear I racked

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:08.860
my brain over this, there is none. In fact
I had a professor down here, from university

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.830
of central Florida, who once told me the only
reason he became veg is because all the arguments

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.740
he heard against it were stupid. That was
his reason. He was a philosopher, he said:

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.700
“I cannot continue to do this because
everyone’s reason for eating meat, cheese,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:31.170
milk, eggs and honey is absolutely fucking
stupid” I really don’t know of one good,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:37.050
logical argument. It doesn’t exist. But
do¬n’t think that I’m exaggerating or being

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:42.510
hyperbolic when I say this, because there
is not one good argument for raping a child.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.920
There is not one good argument for murdering
a homosexual in Uganda. There is none justifiable

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.890
argument for denying women the right to be
quality in Afghanistan, to right to go to

00:01:52.890 --> 00:02:00.380
school, the right to vote in Middle Eastern
countries. So there is not one logical reason

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.520
to enslave, murder and oppress the animals
and consume their body parts.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.818
Emily: I hope you enjoyed hearing Gary’s
take on this matter. I have to say that my thinking

00:02:08.818 --> 00:02:13.230
is rather in line with what Gary shared. In
my recent interview with the popular blog

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.930
Vegan Street, when asked what I thought was
the biggest strength of the vegan movement,

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.620
I said it was that we have the truth on our
side. There’s no way to logically justify

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:27.829
what we do to animals for our food, fashion,
medicine, and entertainment. All the facts

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:32.079
and all the legitimate arguments are on our
side. This is reflected in the absurdity that

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.290
often arises when people try to justify their
behaviors.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.840
You can read my answers to the other 9 questions
in the interview on the Vegan Street blog,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.150
which I’ve linked to in the video description
below.

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:46.849
Now all of that said, I do have to admit there
is one argument someone can lay down for eating

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.609
animal products that I have absolutely no
defense against. And that is the statement

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:56.950
“I don’t care.” If someone simply does
not care what happens to the animals, the environment,

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.060
or even their own health by the continued
breeding, torturing, exploitation and slaughter

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.040
of billions of animals, I certainly can’t
say anything that's going to change that. Complete

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.769
and utter apathy cannot be argued away.

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.109
Now of course it’s not an actual defeat
of vegan principles. As Gary and I have said,

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:20.489
veganism has logic on our side. All the arguments
against it are shell games, admittedly by some

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:25.889
honestly curious, well-intentioned individuals
genuinely wanting to know if this way of life

00:03:25.889 --> 00:03:30.150
is possible. And for those people, I will
always have time and patience

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.209
Now I’d love to hear from you on this. Have
you ever come up against a formidable argument

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:40.589
against veganism? Perhaps you have one yourself?
I’d love to hear it. …Unless it’s “bacon.”

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.579
That’s a word, not an argument. But
someone’s going to post it anyways.

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:51.730
Oh YouTube's comments section, you are 
the bathroom wall of the internet.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:54.699
Anyways, let’s go close it out with Gary!

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:58.809
Gary I just want to thank you so much for
giving us your time and I've been asked on

00:03:58.809 --> 00:04:04.430
behalf of so many of my viewers to just thank
you for everything that you do. So, thank

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.760
you so much.
Gary: Thank you. Keep on. Everybody, pass

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.219
