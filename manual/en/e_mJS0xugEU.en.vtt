(cheerful music)

00:00:09.293 --> 00:00:10.557
- Hi guys, it's me, Ann.

00:00:10.557 --> 00:00:13.275
So in today's tutorial,
I will be showing you how

00:00:13.275 --> 00:00:15.699
to make these big flowers right here,

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:18.417
where you can put them on toss pillows,

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:20.774
or you can do whatever you want with them.

00:00:20.774 --> 00:00:23.199
But I was inspired from an Etsy seller,

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.834
and she specializes in
making these huge big flowers

00:00:26.834 --> 00:00:30.999
that you can put on canvas or on pillows

00:00:30.999 --> 00:00:33.019
and they just look so pretty.

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:35.212
So if you guys are too
lazy, or you don't have

00:00:35.212 --> 00:00:37.477
the time to make your own,

00:00:37.477 --> 00:00:38.915
you can totally check out her store.

00:00:38.915 --> 00:00:41.295
I will put the link on
the bottom of this video.

00:00:41.295 --> 00:00:44.140
Other than that, I'm going to
show you how I make my version

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.774
and this is just a great
way to incorporate prints

00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:49.144
and color into, you know, one room.

00:00:49.144 --> 00:00:51.559
Okay guys, so let's
start with the materials,

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.657
and first of all, I will be
using one yard in felt fabric.

00:00:55.657 --> 00:00:59.082
Now I found these different
colors from Joann's Fabric store

00:00:59.082 --> 00:01:01.635
and the reason why I am
using felt is because

00:01:01.635 --> 00:01:04.317
felt is easier to form.

00:01:04.317 --> 00:01:06.441
Next I will be using a throw pillow,

00:01:06.441 --> 00:01:08.938
and I found these from Ikea,
but you can get creative

00:01:08.938 --> 00:01:12.002
and use anything you like:
different prints or colors.

00:01:12.002 --> 00:01:13.755
Just get creative with this.

00:01:13.755 --> 00:01:17.401
Next, for tools I will be
using a hot glue gun of course,

00:01:17.401 --> 00:01:19.619
and some glue sticks to go with it.

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.822
You will also need a
pair of sharp scissors.

00:01:22.822 --> 00:01:24.877
Sharp scissors are a must because you will

00:01:24.877 --> 00:01:26.874
be doing a lot of cutting.

00:01:26.874 --> 00:01:29.301
Next, you will need some
templates, and these templates

00:01:29.301 --> 00:01:32.412
are available on my
blog, Lifeannstyle.com.

00:01:32.412 --> 00:01:34.793
You can go to my blog,
I upload it for you,

00:01:34.793 --> 00:01:37.381
I drew these out for
you, all you have to do

00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:41.154
is print them out, and cut them.

00:01:41.154 --> 00:01:43.673
Okay, so have your template ready,

00:01:43.673 --> 00:01:46.796
and use that as a guide
to cutting the petals.

00:01:46.796 --> 00:01:48.457
Place the template on the felt,

00:01:48.457 --> 00:01:50.802
and cut out the shape around it.

00:01:50.802 --> 00:01:52.753
To save fabric, flip the template

00:01:52.753 --> 00:01:55.817
around like so along the way.

00:01:55.817 --> 00:01:57.814
I cut out nine of the large petals,

00:01:57.814 --> 00:02:01.273
six of the medium, and
ten of the little ones.

00:02:01.273 --> 00:02:04.536
You don't have to use the
same exact amount I use.

00:02:04.536 --> 00:02:07.031
This is just what I felt worked for me.

00:02:07.031 --> 00:02:09.619
So, get creative and do whatever you like,

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.279
but this is just my foundation
on how to get started.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.011
So now it's time to start building

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:19.751
up the flower from the inside out.

00:02:19.751 --> 00:02:24.194
Take three of the small triangle
that you cut out earlier,

00:02:24.194 --> 00:02:28.995
and one-by-one curl the tip
together to form a cone.

00:02:28.995 --> 00:02:31.953
Flip the cone over and fold down the tip,

00:02:31.953 --> 00:02:34.564
then glue it inward.

00:02:34.564 --> 00:02:38.094
Go ahead and cut out any
of the angles sticking out.

00:02:38.094 --> 00:02:40.927
Repeat this for the other two petals.

00:02:42.947 --> 00:02:47.116
Next, it's time to layer
one on top of the other.

00:02:47.116 --> 00:02:48.742
I will be forming a bud.

00:02:48.742 --> 00:02:51.922
As you can see, I am
taking each cone I made,

00:02:51.922 --> 00:02:54.361
and topping it one on the other,

00:02:54.361 --> 00:02:55.999
almost like a tulip.

00:02:55.999 --> 00:02:59.604
You want the petal to be placed
evenly all around the base.

00:03:02.314 --> 00:03:04.656
As I'm going toward the center of bud,

00:03:04.656 --> 00:03:07.789
I want to make a smaller
triangle, so that way

00:03:07.789 --> 00:03:10.670
the inside of the bud can look smaller.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.073
So basically what you
will need to do is just

00:03:13.073 --> 00:03:17.194
trim your existing triangle
to make it look smaller.

00:03:17.194 --> 00:03:19.271
So I'm basically doing
the same thing here,

00:03:19.271 --> 00:03:21.977
except I'm just making
it in a smaller form

00:03:21.977 --> 00:03:25.274
as I go in toward the center.

00:03:25.274 --> 00:03:28.653
Now it's time to take the
rest of the small triangles,

00:03:28.653 --> 00:03:31.751
put two dabs of hot glue
on the inside of triangle,

00:03:31.751 --> 00:03:34.235
and then pinch the sides in together.

00:03:34.235 --> 00:03:36.754
Just like how I am doing it right here.

00:03:36.754 --> 00:03:40.656
This will give the petal
volume and texture.

00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:41.806
After making the petals,

00:03:41.806 --> 00:03:44.151
glue them to the bottom of the flower.

00:03:44.151 --> 00:03:47.633
Cut one-by-one, alternating the tops to

00:03:47.633 --> 00:03:50.966
make it look like a flower.

00:03:50.966 --> 00:03:53.926
You can also do this by
flipping the bud upside-down

00:03:53.926 --> 00:03:56.262
and then glue around the bottom of it.

00:03:56.262 --> 00:04:00.960
(cheerful music)

00:04:16.911 --> 00:04:18.631
Next it's time to continue the learning

00:04:18.631 --> 00:04:20.128
with the medium petals.

00:04:20.128 --> 00:04:22.530
Like the small petals,
put two dabs of glue

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.177
in the petals and then
cinch the side together.

00:04:25.177 --> 00:04:27.255
Remember that this does
not have to look perfect

00:04:27.255 --> 00:04:29.136
because the less perfect it look,

00:04:29.136 --> 00:04:31.178
the more realistic it will look.

00:04:31.178 --> 00:04:34.238
Make sure to glue these petals one-by-one,

00:04:34.238 --> 00:04:36.397
wrapping it around the flower cup.

00:04:36.397 --> 00:04:40.837
(cheerful music)

00:04:54.947 --> 00:04:58.020
After finishing the layer
of the medium petals,

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.102
finish it up by using the same technique

00:05:01.102 --> 00:05:02.819
to the large petals.

00:05:05.657 --> 00:05:10.378
(cheerful music)

00:05:19.391 --> 00:05:21.306
Your finished flower can be used for

00:05:21.306 --> 00:05:22.769
more than just pillows.

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:25.555
You can either pin or hot
glue this to your pillow,

00:05:25.555 --> 00:05:28.853
depending if you want this
to be permanent or not.

00:05:28.853 --> 00:05:32.093
You can also use this as a wall art,

00:05:32.093 --> 00:05:34.449
or whatever you like, enjoy it.

00:05:34.449 --> 00:05:36.608
Thank you guys so much for watching.
