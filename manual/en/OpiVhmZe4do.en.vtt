00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:07.310
With the Mamiya

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:11.650
RB67 to EOS lens adapter from Fotodiox Pro

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:14.670
now you can mount a Mamiya RB lens

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.859
onto your Canon EOS camera body. This

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.329
all-metal adapter includes a tripod mount that
balances the weight of the lens with the

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:22.890
camera.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:26.720
The adapter also includes a built-in
focusing barrel.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:29.839
Rotate the barrel to adjust the focus of
the lens.

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:32.940
An aperture ring on the adapter allows
you to

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.010
unlock the lens's aperture controls. Turn
the ring counterclockwise till it cocks,

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.460
then clockwise to unlock the lens. Our
pro adapter

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.260
is made with premium materials and
workmanship. Mounting the adapter is simple.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.900
Make sure the breech locking ring on the
lens is set to open.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:54.000
Position the red dots on the lens adapter,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.420
place the two together and rotate the
breach locking ring on the lens.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:01.800
Attach the adapter to your camera and
you're ready to shoot.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.390
