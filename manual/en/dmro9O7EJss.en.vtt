00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:03.780
The UK Home Football season is about to begin.

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:08.620
Someone has to tell us who made the tackle
or what down we're on.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:10.080
Who Does That?

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.050
Hello, my name is Carl Nathe and I work in
Public Relations and Marketing here at the

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:15.240
University of Kentucky.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.089
And I'm also the public address announcer
for home football games at Commonwealth Stadium.

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:21.460
It's a lot of fun.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.210
You just want to be there.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:25.409
You arrive at least two hours before the game.

00:00:25.409 --> 00:00:27.589
There are four of us working together.

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:29.339
To my left is Donnie Atkins.

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:30.339
He's my spotter.

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.149
I'm watching the offense and watching the
ball and it's kind of hard if you don't have

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.559
somebody watching the defense who's coming
in to make the tackle.

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.809
So he will give me that information by means
of a number, and I've got charts in front

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:43.670
of me and I do my homework.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:48.010
We'll say pass from Jones to Smith, gain of
five yards, 2nd and 5 at the 35.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:55.820
Of course, we have a lot of fun when we get
a FIRST DOWN KENTUCKY.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.089
Oh, I love it.

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:01.089
Sure.

00:01:01.089 --> 00:01:06.490
But I love saying, TOUCHDOWN KENTUCKY.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:07.490
That's the best.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.490
You cannot script it.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.330
It kind of becomes second nature.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.860
I find if you've done your preparation beforehand
it makes it a lot easier.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:20.020
I try to go to the coach's news conference
to listen to what Coach Stoops is saying and

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.310
also to get the information on the other team.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:26.990
After you get into the season, you pretty
much know Kentucky's personnel quite well.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.719
But it's a different team each home game so
you've got to prepare on that.

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:36.159
Later in the week, I will make my charts out,
which I use is the - what they have is the

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:39.210
game day flip card that's distributed in the
press box.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.140
I'll take that and I'll actually blow it up
on the copier so that it's in a bigger form

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.200
and I kind of do a little literally cutting
and pasting.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.219
The kind of stuff you learn in kindergarten,
I'm still using it.

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.040
You don't want to necessarily memorize.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:59.149
But you want to be familiar with it so when
you see somebody like number 14 walking on

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:00.750
the field, you know that's so-and-so.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.350
You want to get prepared.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.359
You want to set the mood.

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:08.730
You have a home audience that's rooting for
the team.

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:11.610
You are supposed to stay objective, according
to the Southeastern Conference and the NCAA,

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.160
although you do have room for enthusiasm and
getting excited about your team.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.140
I try never to insult the other team or do
anything that would be condescending to the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.120
other team but obviously I'm gonna show more
support, if you will, through my voice.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.290
I have to be conscious of gauging myself so
I don't totally lose it because you're gonna

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.360
get caught up in the crowd.

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.500
The crowd is on their feet in a play like
that; your voice is on its feet, if you will.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:41.980
I can't cheer, but what I do is I get kinda
like I get kinda edgy when there's a great

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:42.980
play unfolding.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.480
You can see oh something good is gonna happen.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.510
When it actually happens, when they cross
the goal line, you erupt just like anybody

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:50.510
else.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.230
I try to be a fan talking to other fans and
hopefully we get the information right.

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:01.370
But we have fun and hopefully put a smile
on people's face when the action calls for

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:02.370
it.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.370
I'm Carl Nathe.

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.750
Helping fans stay informed and entertained
by doing the public address announcing at

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:21.349
Commonwealth Stadium for UK home football
games is how I see blue.
