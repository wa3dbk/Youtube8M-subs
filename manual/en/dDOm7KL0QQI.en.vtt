00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.120
Hi there

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.960
and welcome to
Hydrofarm's Out Of The Box!

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.830
Where we unpack, unwrap

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:17.620
and share the latest products
and innovations from Hydrofarm.

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.460
Today we're talking about

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.210
the biggest and baddest
reflector on the market

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.330
- the Raptor!

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.040
Seriously,
this thing is huge!

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.880
And given its size

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.620
you know it's going
to deliver big results

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.750
in your grow room

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.170
- yet it's the most efficient
reflector in it's class!

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:34.380
It's exclusively
engineered for Hydrofarm

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.670
by Lighting Sciences

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.380
and there are currently
3 models to choose from.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.710
Alright, lets take a
look at the Raptor 8,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.170
a real beast.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.960
As you can see
it's really low profile,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.960
and the broad,
even light spread

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:49.960
allows you to place the
Raptor closer to your plants

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.620
for maximum light delivery
in low-clearance locations.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.170
The Raptor is
strong and durable

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.880
and is constructed using a
multi-point reinforced design

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.330
that features
pre-galvanized steel

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.080
and corrosion-proof
electro coat paint.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.250
There's also a
hinged lens system

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.580
which makes
changing bulbs easy

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.960
and features
a wire safety stop

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.710
which prevents the lens
from swinging open all the way.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:14.710
All the hinges and latches

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.290
are made of high grade
stainless steel.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.830
So lets take
a look inside.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.540
The high-efficiency
specular is a 4-sided,

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.330
European
hammer-tone aluminum,

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.790
that's 95% reflective

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.460
and is completely sealed,
with gasketed tempered glass,

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.540
for effective heat
isolation and cooling.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.960
An aero-dynamic column supports
a built-in socket and cord set

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.250
with a 15 foot
pre-wired lamp cord.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.170
And...

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.580
the Raptor accepts both
sodium and metal halide bulbs!

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.040
All Raptor reflectors
come with a 5 year warranty,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.790
and are rigorously tested
to CSA/UL safety standards

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.920
for the US and Canada.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.500
So that's the scoop on
our biggest reflector out there.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.830
In short, if you want
size and efficiency

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.040
then the Raptor is the
very best option for you.

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:10.960
