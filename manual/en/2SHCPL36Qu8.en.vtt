00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.859
hey guys so in this video I wanted to do
just this look from new girl and this is

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.519
my first Halloween video of this year
and I usually either choose to do

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.360
something really cute or something a
little more scary for Halloween so this

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.250
is the first look I have it's very cute
and simple and I've been really loving

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.910
new girl this past year I've been
watching that so I wanted to do a look

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:36.900
from that TV show so let's go ahead and
get started so the first thing I'm

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.010
starting off with is my Revlon
Photoready airbrush foundation and I

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.720
really love this foundation I recently
picked it up and have just completely

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.649
fallen in love with this foundation that
sounds weird so anyway after that I'm

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.399
gonna grab my concealer and also set
everything with this powder from went

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.329
wild and then after that I'm grabbing my
Maybelline Dream bouncy blush in this

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.309
beautiful pink color and this is a very
simple wearable makeup look I don't

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.729
think I've really seen any episodes
where she uses like really dramatic

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:10.920
makeup so this is again very wearable
and moving on to my brows this is a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.120
marker from NYX Cosmetics and I've
recently been using this a lot lately so

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.799
I thought I'd use it in this video and
after that I'm gonna grab my primer this

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.119
is my eyeshadow primer from Sedona lace
and I'm gonna bust out my CA OH

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.510
cosmetics eyeshadow palette and I'm
sticking with a nude shade that's gonna

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.200
go over my brow bone and my lid and then
this darker brown color is gonna go in

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.640
my crease
so after that I'm going to grab a dark

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.510
brown eye pencil and this one's from NYX
Cosmetics and this is what I'm going to

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:48.600
use to line my eyes top and bottom so
I'm getting my top lash line and then we

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.360
go back in and do my bottom waterline
and after that and we're just going to

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.860
curl my lashes and then use my beauty
addicts show-off mascara and this

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.500
mascara is insane if you like volume in
length it is like it gives you it looks

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.290
like fake lashes
anyway I'm moving on this is the

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.740
lipstick that I'm going to use and also
the gloss on top of that and I'm gonna

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.650
link the products down below so you can
check it out but this is just a really

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.850
pretty pink color I think goes well with
the blush again it's very simple not

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:22.980
dramatic all pop in my glass up on top
of that and there you go I want to bust

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.250
on my glasses already but it's not quite
time for that

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.750
they're so cute though look at these
look at our classes I'm gonna move on to

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.930
my hair now and as you guys can tell my
hair is this length which is not long

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.580
enough so this is where more if my
costume comes in is just adding some

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.670
hair and this these hair extensions ow
that one's caught okay now that was a

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.400
beautiful face anyway I just popped
those in and these ones are from

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.500
irresistible me these are my favorite
extensions I've ever used and that is my

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.730
hair length and now super long right so
now I'm just gonna grab some heat

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.510
protectant this has got to be guardian
angel and this is one of my favorite

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.260
drugstore heat protectants for your hair
so after that I'm going to take my new

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:13.140
may new may brush I always say it weird
like that new my anyway I want to grab

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.519
my brush and I'm going to gently brush
my hair and I'm gonna hold on to my

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:22.980
extensions while I brush out my hair and
the extension her and so after that I'm

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:27.630
just going to part my hair off into two
sections keeping the lower half away

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.220
from the top half so I have a little
cute messy bun going on and I grabbed my

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.840
Marcel curling iron I'm just going to
start creating some waves away from my

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.720
face and I'm gonna do this all over my
head so I'm gonna speed up the footage a

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:46.900
little bit
so we can get to the end of this hair

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.140
look

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.910
so the hairspray I'm gonna use is from
big sexy hair and this is they're

00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:01.050
spraying play this is a really popular
hairspray I've tried it I love it

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.410
just because some of my friends have
been obsessed with it so I was like okay

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.080
I gotta try that so here we go I'm just
gonna spray down in my hair and she's

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.099
gonna keep my curls elastin all day or
my loose wave so now I'm just gonna take

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:19.530
off the top section of my hair or take
down the top section of my hair and do

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.630
the same thing just gently brush it out
and wrap my hair around my Marcel

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.520
curling iron and just create the same
kind of flowy waves so this is what my

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:35.490
hair looks like now and after that I'm
just going to mess with my actual hair

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.900
which needs to blend in more with the
extensions and I'm also creating things

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:44.520
my bangs are a little bit longer because
I'm growing them out so I'm gonna try to

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.630
shorten up the length a little bit by
curling the ends of them so they still

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:52.830
kind of look like shorter bangs anyway
so and then I'm just gonna try to blend

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.560
my hair a little bit more with the
extensions just because the extensions

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:00.450
are so long and my layers on top are so
short so I'm gonna kind of blend those a

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.870
little bit just with my flat iron and
then after that it's finally time for

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:11.310
the glasses yes these things are so cute
and they were super cheap so yeah this

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.850
is more creates the look and I know she
doesn't usually wear glasses in every

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.850
episode but I think this kind of
completes the look

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:28.990
so moving on to the outfit this is again
very simple and just a very cute outfit

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.910
she actually wears a lot of very
colorful clothes like colorful tops and

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:38.169
pants and skirts and very colorful
dresses this is just something I had in

00:05:38.169 --> 00:05:41.590
my closet that looked similar to an
outfit that she wore and I'll put that

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:45.310
picture down below so you guys can check
it out but my dress is from forever 21

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:49.690
my shoes are from forever 21 and the
glasses I'm wearing our fakes and

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:53.590
they're actually from a Hollywood Walk
of Fame like from a random gift shop my

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.830
mom actually bought these for me when
she was in town and we just saw I

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:01.570
thought they're super cute they were
super cheap and ya had to grab one and I

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.889
think it really completes this look for
Jess so and they're pretty cool and the

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:09.850
belt that I'm wearing is actually from
Sami dress calm and then of course again

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:13.990
my hair extensions that I'm rocking or
from irresistible me I'll put their link
