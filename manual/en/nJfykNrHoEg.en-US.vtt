Hello boys and girls, this is Aunt Frenita

00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:05.746
And I have a wonderful story for you called "Passing the Test"
Hello boys and girls, this is Aunt Frenita

00:00:05.746 --> 00:00:11.453
And I have a wonderful story for you called "Passing the Test"

00:00:12.546 --> 00:00:18.500
Today's memory verse is from Isaiah 7:15

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.373
It says 'reject the wrong and choose the right' 

00:00:23.653 --> 00:00:29.613
The message for today's story is we worship God when we choose good things

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:31.746
What is your favourite food?

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.026
What is your favourite song?

00:00:34.946 --> 00:00:37.960
Are all of these the best choices for you?

00:00:38.466 --> 00:00:41.773
Daniel and his friends made a good choice

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:48.640
 Daniel and three of his friends stopped and stared up at the huge and beautiful palace

00:00:49.146 --> 00:00:55.173
But they weren't excited. In fact, they were very tired and very sad

00:00:55.746 --> 00:01:02.173
Strangers in a strange country. They were captives of the King of Babylon

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.573
Once inside the palace, servants took the boys to big bathtubs

00:01:08.013 --> 00:01:14.693
 After their baths, a servant handed each one fancy new clothes and showed them to their new rooms 

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:18.080
'Dinner will be ready soon.' ,the servant said

00:01:18.626 --> 00:01:21.973
Daniel and his friends knelt beside their new beds 

00:01:22.173 --> 00:01:30.026
They prayed that God would help them be strong and choose good things in this strange country where people didn't worship him

00:01:30.306 --> 00:01:33.600
Soon, the servant called the new captives to dinner

00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:37.040
Daniel and his friends followed him into the dining room

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.173
Delicious food covered the tables, food that came from the king's table and had been offered to idols

00:01:44.506 --> 00:01:48.080
Daniel and his friends looked at one another with wide eyes

00:01:48.373 --> 00:01:54.066
 What should they do? This wasn't the kind of food they knew God wanted them to eat

00:01:54.573 --> 00:01:58.386
Daniel went to the chief official in charge of all the captives 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:05.160
'May my friends and I eat the kind of food our God had told us to eat?', he asked politely

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:08.173
 The official was afraid of Daniel's idea 

00:02:08.426 --> 00:02:13.200
'The king ordered you to eat his food and drink and his wine', he answered 

00:02:13.693 --> 00:02:19.613
'If you get pale and sick looking, the king will kill me for not doing my job'

00:02:19.613 --> 00:02:21.610
Daniel thought about the problem

00:02:22.013 --> 00:02:26.373
He spoke to Melsar, the guard appointed to care for Daniel and his friends

00:02:26.786 --> 00:02:30.306
'Will you test us for 10 days?', he asked Melsar 

00:02:30.586 --> 00:02:36.600
 'Give us only simple food to eat. Fruit and vegetables, and nuts and grains.'

00:02:36.786 --> 00:02:42.306
'And give us water instead of wine. You can see how we look after 10 days' 

00:02:42.373 --> 00:02:44.520
Melsar agreed to the test.

00:02:44.666 --> 00:02:49.200
For 10 days, he gave the boys simple food and water to drink 

00:02:49.426 --> 00:02:57.986
When the 10 testing days were up, Daniel and his boys looked healthier than the boys who had been eating the king's food and drinking the king's wine 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.746
Melsar decided Daniel and his friends had made a good choice

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.226
He let them continue to eat the simple food

00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:13.610
God blessed Daniel and his friends. He helped them learn all the things they studied in King Nebuchadnezzar's school 

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:16.493
And three years later when the king tested them

00:03:16.706 --> 00:03:25.493
He discovered that Daniel and his three friends had learned more and were wiser than all the other wise men in his kingdom

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:30.106
Daniel and his friends had chosen good things for their bodies 

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:35.666
They had worshiped God by their choices, and you can do the same

00:03:39.866 --> 00:03:51.786
