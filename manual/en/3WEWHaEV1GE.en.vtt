00:00:07.646 --> 00:00:12.336
&gt;&gt; Mike and I are the co-winemakers for
the 2007 harvest of the Cal Poly wines.

00:00:12.566 --> 00:00:15.976
&gt;&gt; These wines were entered in the San
Francisco International Wine Competition

00:00:16.346 --> 00:00:22.616
and our Mustang Red blend got a double gold
medal, the Syrah got a single gold medal,

00:00:22.616 --> 00:00:24.616
the Chardonnay and Pinot
Noir both got silver medals.

00:00:24.826 --> 00:00:28.976
Since graduating, I'm now the enologist
at Chamisal Vineyards in the Edna Valley.

00:00:29.076 --> 00:00:32.506
&gt;&gt; And since graduating,
myself and my business partner,

00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:35.146
Andrew Macaluso, created this product, Santasti.

00:00:35.436 --> 00:00:39.346
It is a palate cleanser that we've
made for the wine and food industries.

00:00:39.476 --> 00:00:42.976
&gt;&gt; Well, I was attracted to Cal Poly
because it was this burgeoning new program.

00:00:43.046 --> 00:00:48.556
I met with several of the professors before
I came down here and I saw the vineyards,

00:00:48.556 --> 00:00:49.936
I saw how much potential they had.

00:00:49.936 --> 00:00:53.346
&gt;&gt; It's really nice weather here, too.

00:00:53.346 --> 00:00:53.413
[laughs]

00:00:53.413 --> 00:00:57.846
&gt;&gt; Yeah, and I mean, that was the other
thing, the proximity to a wine-growing region;

00:00:58.346 --> 00:01:02.916
some of the vineyards and wineries in this area
are the best in California if not the nation.

00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:09.426
&gt;&gt; I think the advantage of the enology and the
wine and vit program at Cal Poly is the fact

00:01:09.426 --> 00:01:14.966
that it is very multidisciplinary and that's,
I think, what we pride ourselves on is that,

00:01:15.036 --> 00:01:17.936
you know, you take classes in wine
business as well as viticulture, enology,

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:19.976
to get the whole spectrum, whereas other
schools you may only focus on one area.

00:01:20.996 --> 00:01:23.186
&gt;&gt; But we'd also analyze our wines.

00:01:23.826 --> 00:01:25.916
&gt;&gt; We'd try to do as much as we
could on the wines ourselves,

00:01:25.916 --> 00:01:30.986
as far as the day-to-day operations, you
know, pump downs, pump overs, punch downs.

00:01:31.406 --> 00:01:33.816
The chardonnay, I think is
a really great food wine.

00:01:33.926 --> 00:01:38.036
It has a acid profile with some
great apple fruit in there,

00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:42.416
and the pinot noir is a very delicate
wine; it has a nice floral aroma,

00:01:43.446 --> 00:01:49.356
&gt;&gt; But it has rich acidity and a fantastic
tannin structure to it; very dusty,

00:01:50.186 --> 00:01:51.976
really reminds you of a classic burgundy.

00:01:52.866 --> 00:01:57.896
&gt;&gt; And then our, besides the wines we have here,
we made a Syrah which is my personal favorite...

00:01:58.336 --> 00:01:58.646
&gt;&gt; Mine too!

00:01:58.936 --> 00:02:04.496
&gt;&gt; Yes, we, Mike and I fought very hard to, you
know, keep those, that wine in barrels as long

00:02:04.826 --> 00:02:10.086
as we could, to develop the tannin
profile and it is a great wine

00:02:10.086 --> 00:02:11.806
that I can't wait to taste out of the bottle.

00:02:11.936 --> 00:02:16.426
&gt;&gt; The Mustang Red is a fantastic
blend and it received double gold

00:02:16.426 --> 00:02:18.516
at the San Francisco International
Wine Competition.

00:02:18.586 --> 00:02:22.806
&gt;&gt; And they are going to be released in October,
during Homecoming, and the first pouring

00:02:22.806 --> 00:02:25.906
of them will be at the alumni
Homecoming wine tasting.

00:02:25.906 --> 00:02:29.876
And the wines are available for sale
on our website, Cal Poly wine dot com.
