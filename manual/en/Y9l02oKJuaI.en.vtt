ANNE MOONEY: Hi. I'm Chef Anne Mooney, also
the food writer for Simply The Best Magazine

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:12.760
out of Delray Beach, Florida, and today I'm
here on behalf of Expert Village. I had the

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:19.100
good fortune to be in Paris about two weeks
ago, and, as I was strolling down the street,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.500
some wonderful little tree-shaded street,
there was a crepe vendor there. And I had

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:31.960
been thinking about crepes and studying about
crepes, and there she was with a little burner

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:38.840
and a little cart, and she was making crepes
and flipping them out as fast as she could.

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.489
I never saw anything more wonderful in my
life. And so I bought a crepe from her, and

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.990
all she did to garnish that crepe was to put
some butter and sugar on it. You can do the

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:56.520
same thing with sugar and--sorry, butter and
honey. But this is the Parisian street vendor

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:05.429
crepe, and it's the classic, and nothing ever
tasted better. So you take a crepe; spread

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:14.090
it with butter. This is sort of like butter
sandwiches after school that we used to have

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:20.009
when we were kids. Sprinkle it with a little
granulated sugar. I would say maybe that's

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:28.969
a teaspoon; more if you want. And then you
fold it, first, up this way, and then across,

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:35.429
and then across to make a little envelope,
and then you eat it. And then, you keep eating

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:45.539
and eating and eating. They're so good. The
honey ones are just as tasty. Again, spread

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:55.560
it with some butter; put a little honey on
there. Not so much that you get it all over

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:04.869
yourself; just drizzle some on there. Again,
fold it like an envelope, like so. If you

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:12.700
do this for your children after school, they
will think that you are truly a heroine. If
