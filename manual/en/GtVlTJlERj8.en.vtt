00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.210
how's it going guys, this is thec0re3

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.529
from fighting games online

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.820
.info and I'm just going to over a..

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.650
quick installation tutorial for
installing GGPO

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.109
this is gonna be pretty quick so lets get into it

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.189
so, of course, first you want to
make sure that you've already installed

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.699
Adobe Air

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:31.449
that is the first thing you want to do.

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.270
next you are ready to install..

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.010
GGPO

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.210
..so it is 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.219
in what you call a zip file

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:48.450
So if you have not download..

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.789
downloaded maybe a WinZip or WinRar, I
recommend you do that

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.710
because you won't be able to get if you don't

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:00.920
so let's go ahead 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.449
I'm going to put this on the desktop

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:11.150
it's up to you with where you
want to put it but I'm putting it on the desktop

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.939
give it a name

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.040
and this is going to create a folder for
me

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:25.040
with GGPO

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.860
the next thing you want to look at 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.720
we have a few files

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.270
with have GGPO, ggpofba,

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.850
and then you have ggpoair

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:47.840
your going to launch the program through GGPO

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.590
but if you notice there is supposed to be a roms folder

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.340
so if it does not show up for you,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.869
 you need to go into ggpofba

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:06.320
okay

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.390
once you've done that, 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.709
you should see a ROMS folder come up

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.709
and this is where you're gonna put all of
your games

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.040
into the ROMS folder

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.040
another thing that you're going to want to do 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.120
is load the game up 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.430
and go ahead and set all your controls

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.650
before hand. So that when you..

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.530
pick up a match the challenger doesn't have to wait on you..

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.940
to set up your controls. It's something you really want to do

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.349
before you start GGPO

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:52.660
other things you want to think about

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:57.700
make sure the correct ports are open, through port forwarding

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:02.080
if you do not know about port forwarding..

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:05.519
I do have a tutorial in the improve your connection section. 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.170
okay so

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.250
after that you've done everything on the checklist.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.680
opened up ports, set up controls

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.680
now you just have to go into GGPO

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.220
It might ask if you want to block the program

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:35.220
you're going to want to allow it to communicate. Allow access 

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.570
and you are here at..

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.830
the  log in screen of GGPO

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.830
I already have my own user name

00:03:53.830 --> 00:03:58.190
you have to go here to create your own. It's was pretty simple

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:01.240
pretty straightforward shouldn't take you 
to long...

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:05.690
to set up a GGPO account

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:08.770
Well alright, that is it. 

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.970
have fun enjoy yourself and as usual
take it easy.
