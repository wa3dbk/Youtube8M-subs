00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.480
These are the only images that exist of this
catastrophic event.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.590
But this sequence was not shot by a video
camera.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.910
Instead, it was created by USGS scientists
and graphic artists based on a series of extraordinary

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.550
still photographs

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:24.000
taken by an amateur photographer named Gary
Rosenquist.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.960
On May 18th, 1980,

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.180
he was standing ten miles away from the mountain
next to local resident Keith Ronnholm.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:37.449
He was on a tripod with a motorized drive
and just was ch, ch, ch

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.400
and took a very much time based sequence.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.320
I don't think he was trying to, to make a
scientific record but it turned out to be

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.620
a very good record of the event.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.190
And I know it was used by many scientists
to try to time the event

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.590
and to measure how fast the, the landslide
occurred.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.829
The landslide and the, the explosions begin
and they get very large very quick.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:04.589
So it helped to understand what had happened.

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:11.500
The first frame of the Rosenquist sequence
was taken at 8:32 AM and 21 seconds.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.210
It reveals an intact volcano.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.800
But what the image doesn't show is what was
happening inside.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.400
Magma was forcing its way up into the volcano.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.500
And to make room for itself, it was starting
to shove rock aside.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.560
So those rocks sliding across each other was
causing some of these earthquakes.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.060
It wants to get out somewhere and the north
side seems to be the weak side.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:34.790
And it starts bulging there.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:38.400
This looked like a big bad blister on a tire.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.780
Inside, the earthquakes and super heated magma
have forced the north wall of the mountain

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.320
to collapse.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.500
The second frame is taken 26 seconds later,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.960
capturing the weakened north flank and summit.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.430
The video morph shows the mountain collapsing
into two huge landslide blocks.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.700
Six seconds later,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:08.590
Gary's third photo shows the top landslide
block as it begins to plunge down the volcano.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.870
The sequence depicts its movement at nearly
200 miles per hour.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.150
Still frame four shows the landslide after
it has removed the north flank,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.850
depressurizing the magma and boiling ground
water.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:29.329
The video morph reveals a series of sudden
violent explosions of gas, steam and rocks.

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.890
This is known as a lateral blast.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:38.090
Gary's final frame is taken about 15 seconds
later.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.690
The lateral blast accelerates to 336 miles
an hour,

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.529
completely obscuring the landslide.
