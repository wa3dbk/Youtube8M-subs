00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.800
The key's in the name.
It's open, to people, to places.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.080
It's open to all nationalities or groups.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.560
I am Brazilian, for example,
and I'm here.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.680
To methods and to ideas.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.720
When you work with people here,
you realise they are open to ideas.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.800
They are open to fundamentally
changing the way that the university

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.080
is delivering its teaching
and learning experiences.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.240
The OU is the only truly
global university.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.760
It never ceases to amaze me that
wherever I go and mention

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.120
Open University, people have heard of it.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.880
The brand stands for quality.
The brand stands for integrity.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.160
What we do is not just straight distance
learning, it's blended learning.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.040
Because our students are spread all
over Britain and, in fact, increasingly,

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.800
all over Europe and the rest of the world,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:01.040
we can use technology to help students
compare their experiences,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.840
all their local environments,
with each other.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.280
We have a tradition that
we've developed, I suppose,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.200
of using technologies to support
and overcome that sense of isolation

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.520
that can be felt with distance learning.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.520
You and your students need to look at
knowledge and media

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.400
and how they work together.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.080
The Open University is doing that.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.960
We are often training people who,
in their own countries,

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:27.960
are also running large institutions.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.480
So, we've had a lot of impact,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.920
not only through
our undergraduate student base,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.200
but through
our postgraduate student base, too.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.640
In every sector of the
Ethiopian economy,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.680
you will find people who are trained
by the Open University.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:50.520
Open University model of teaching
is very new and very popular in Russia.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.920
The Open University is seen as a
leader in quality,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.400
in terms of distance education
and distance learning.

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:02.360
I keep on telling to everybody that it's
really nice to work with them.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.880
But I had no idea of the infrastructure
that it has and how big it was.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:13.320
The particular thing that I'm
impressed about

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.480
is the very comprehensive
learning materials.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.920
Indeed, if a student were to study
on his own,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.120
he can actually do it using the
OU UK materials and pass the exams.

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.240
Life is really fast paced,
and many people have to work

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.440
and want to improve their
standard of living

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.040
and improve their skills
at the same time.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.440
So, I think the course that OU offers
are actually ideal for people

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.000
who want to work
and also study at the same time.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:45.920
It gives room for those who are still
working in government,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.160
who have a busy schedule,
to adjust their programme

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.280
to attend this high level education.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.800
The world is changing.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.680
It's always been changing,
it's in its nature.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:59.960
But it changes so fast now

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.680
that you can't be looking at
a conventional view of higher education.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.080
The OU, in a sense,
is a child of technology.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.640
And one of the most impressive things
is the way the OU

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.040
has managed to stay at least with, and
sometimes even ahead of, the curve.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.120
You could say that the Open University
has been waiting for the Internet.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.920
The visual landscape of the Internet
is changing dramatically.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.800
And what it does, essentially,
is it makes distance irrelevant.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.440
We've been known as the
University of the Air,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.520
so it's very, very natural for us to be
in that kind of space.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.480
So, a TV based university has genuinely
become a digital based university.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:40.160
We started nearly 40 years ago
by absolutely breaking the mould.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.760
That initial excitement,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.680
the ability to challenge the traditional
way of doing things,

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:53.840
it's still there, it's still inherent in us all,
I think, here at the Open University.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:56.080
For me, absolutely,

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:03.800
Open University is the place where we
came to dream about the real future

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.840
and to approach the future
and our dream.

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.920
The Open University, I think,
is a mechanism for liberation.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.920
For families, for communities,
for different groups.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.800
Because it's through education that
we can actually change people's lives.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.680
That has to be the most powerful
strap line.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.920
An inspiring university
that changes lives.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
I've never had anyone say to me
that it wasn't difficult,

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.960
but I've never had anyone say to me
that it wasn't utterly rewarding.
