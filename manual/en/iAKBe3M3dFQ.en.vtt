00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.712
Hi Everyone, I've got some more Halloween ideas for you today

00:00:03.712 --> 00:00:06.720
But a little bit more extreme than usual

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:12.469
Halloween only comes around once a year so it's okay to go abit cray cray with our nails

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:20.453
So without damaging our nails with acrylics or nail glues, I'm gonna show you some fun Halloween nail designs using fake nails

00:00:20.453 --> 00:00:32.246
why? Becuase first of all my nails will never ever grow to that length and second, even if some how they did, I don't want to chop them off into pieces for a 1 day event

00:00:32.246 --> 00:00:34.637
So Fake nails is the way to go

00:00:34.637 --> 00:00:41.845
I have a few designs for you today, you can wear them as a set, or choose  your favourite design and apply it to all your nails

00:00:41.845 --> 00:00:49.103
I even came up with a background story for your enjoyment. So Watch till the end of this video if you want to hear their story

00:00:49.103 --> 00:00:59.201
So fake nails usually comes in a range of sizes, You can find these ones from My website. They come in white and clear

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:08.959
Go through the bags and find ones that comfortably fits on top of your nail bed and use nail files to help sculpt it into the shape that you want

00:01:11.183 --> 00:01:15.903
for this first set of nails, I'm just going to file down the corners from each side

00:01:15.903 --> 00:01:25.413
and that will give me a very pointy nail shape which will go perfectly with Witches, shedevils,  catwoman or ishuyasha costumes

00:01:26.685 --> 00:01:32.070
You know what else its good for, a self defence weapon against  the other trick or treaters

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:40.170
Once you've crafted the nails for all your fingers. Use some double sided nail stickers  to secure them onto the nail

00:01:40.167 --> 00:01:44.130
Pick a size that's close to your nail size and press it on

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:56.440
peel off the backing paper and stick on the fake nails

00:01:59.442 --> 00:02:05.970
these double sided nail stickers have a strong bond yet it is flexible unlike nail glues

00:02:06.985 --> 00:02:11.890
It can secure the nail for upto 2-3 days, without damaging your natural nails

00:02:13.142 --> 00:02:18.810
They can be easily taken off by soaking in hot water. So no chemicals needed

00:02:19.728 --> 00:02:27.540
You can leave it as it is or paint on a coat of nail polish to give it some color or to match your costumes

00:02:33.251 --> 00:02:37.110
Next I'm going to craft the nail into the shape of a coffin

00:02:37.113 --> 00:02:41.450
Use nail clippers to cut the corners off the nail

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:50.130
next use the filer to smooth out the edges

00:02:54.963 --> 00:03:03.160
Then file the side of the nail at an angle so the bottom side of the nail is slightly narrower to create the shape of the coffin

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:13.710
Be careful not to file your actual nails in the process.  Learn from my mistakes. Just cos it doesn't hurt doesn't mean it won't leave a mark

00:03:18.056 --> 00:03:23.160
Once you're done, Grab your practice finger or anything small to hold the fake nail

00:03:24.096 --> 00:03:35.520
I used some yellow tac to secure the nail so it doesn't move around and holding the jar with my other hand so I can freely turn it in different angles to paint with my right hand

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:40.580
To decorate the coffin, apply a coat of black nail polish as the base color.

00:03:48.837 --> 00:03:54.600
Then use the smallest dotting tool or a toothpick and place dots all around the coffin

00:04:09.734 --> 00:04:17.080
Finally draw in a simple cross in the middle with a detail brush and you have yourself a coffin shaped nail design

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:30.970
I think it looks out of this world normally we would not be able to do weird shapes like this with our natural nails but for Halloween we can do anything and people will think its cool

00:04:30.967 --> 00:04:33.000
Well at least I do

00:04:36.816 --> 00:04:41.080
Next i'm going to show you how to do a batman design

00:04:41.085 --> 00:04:46.850
Use the nail clippers again and cut a square shape from the top of the fake nails

00:04:47.368 --> 00:04:51.980
make 2 cuts going down the nail then a horizontal cut in the middle

00:04:55.017 --> 00:05:04.060
remove the piece and use the nail file to smooth out any rough edges and we have ourselves a batman mask

00:05:04.486 --> 00:05:08.260
Add a coat of black nail polish as the base color

00:05:16.173 --> 00:05:22.220
wait for that to dry then use a beige skintone color to fill in the mouth area

00:05:30.487 --> 00:05:34.990
Use dotting tool or a detail brush to draw in some rectangle eyes.

00:05:37.534 --> 00:05:41.660
And that's it. Super easy batman nails

00:05:43.801 --> 00:05:50.100
Okay so after I did those 3 fake nail designs, I thought how can I make them into a set of nails?

00:05:50.105 --> 00:05:57.130
batman doesn't really go with coffins. So I thought up 2 more nail designs and came up with a background story

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:08.260
Start with a coat of green nail polish as the base color then draw in some opening woulds with a red polish

00:06:08.264 --> 00:06:14.010
any long shape will do as long as the ends are narrower than the middle

00:06:14.967 --> 00:06:18.780
It can go any direction. I fitted 3 on my nails

00:06:19.533 --> 00:06:24.840
then use a black polish and draw in the stitches over the wounds

00:06:24.843 --> 00:06:30.050
You can mix it up with diagonal lines, v lines or cris crosses

00:06:31.282 --> 00:06:35.600
is design is really not that hard to achieve so give it a try

00:06:41.658 --> 00:06:45.600
Then finally I tried to set up batman with his new bride

00:06:45.595 --> 00:06:48.530
ok so here's the goss. Don't tell anyone okay?

00:06:48.533 --> 00:06:53.140
Apparently catwoman sank her clause into batman and he got all messed up

00:06:53.143 --> 00:07:03.780
now he has all these scratch marks on his face and all over his body and he just like became really self conscious and wouldn't go anywhere without his mask

00:07:03.775 --> 00:07:09.610
Then one day he  went to a Halloween party and hooked up with his new bride

00:07:09.614 --> 00:07:18.650
When He saw all those scratch marks and stitched up wounds, it was love at first site.  So they decided to get hitched

00:07:18.652 --> 00:07:25.630
It's a second marriage for her though, she and her ex Frankenstein didn't really workout.  So that was that

00:07:25.628 --> 00:07:29.640
so now they are happily married and both live in a coffin

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:35.040
I guess it's The second best dark resting place to an underground secret cave

00:07:35.045 --> 00:07:40.580
Sure he made some sacrifices for the one he loves.  I hope he doesn't get claustrophobic

00:07:40.585 --> 00:07:44.000
And they lived happily ever after. The end.

00:07:43.998 --> 00:07:46.230
Thumbs up if you like the story?
