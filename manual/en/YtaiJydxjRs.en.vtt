00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:05.660
I have a strong feeling that
in this next category...

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.040
...I will be one of the nominees.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.380
I am a mother.
Everybody knows that.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.540
And a mother's intuition is strong.
You don't believe me?

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.220
Okay. We'll see what happens
in this next category.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.500

Congratulations for the first ever
Indonesian Choice Awards.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.080
Congratulations, Vincent, because

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:59.820

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.580

for Actress of the Year.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.820
That's for tonight.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:38.340
As for tomorrow, you have to watch
Tonight Show at 10 PM.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.800
Why are you keep promoting
the show?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.240
That's right! And don't you dare
to switch channel.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.980
Don't switch channel from this
night until tomorrow night.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.980
That way, you won't miss the show.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.560
Okay, now.../ Tonight Show!/
No, not that.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.200
"Get Married 4".
I played in that movie.

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.360
What?/ So, I'm rooting for Nirina.
She's a co-star.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.540
But that movie is not in the
nomination's list.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.680
But I play in the same movie
with Nirina.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.360
You act in a movie with a nominee
and you boast about it.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:06.280
In my filmography list, I played
with all nominees. You name it.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.980
Pevita Pearce, Revalina S. Temat,
Acha Septriasa,...

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.620
...and Julie Estelle.
All of them.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.100
Wow, can you handle them all?/
Of cou....

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.380
I mean as a co-actor./
Yes, of course!

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.960
What's the title of the movie?/
You don't know?

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.320
I played a movie with them all.
And the title is...

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.240
...99 Thugs Sleeping on
Van der Wijk's Ship.

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.880
All of them in a movie.

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.580
Okay, I admit I lost.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.280
But one thing for sure.
Tomorrow, watch Tonight Show.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.300
Cut that out!
Let's read who's the winner.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:04.500
Hi, I'm Pevita Pearce. I'm sorry
but I can't be there tonight.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.060
Being chosen as the Actress of the
Year, I would like to say...

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:16.320
...thank you to Allah,

your support.

I dedicate this award
to all of you.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.880
This award is a motivation
for me.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.200
I want to give the best in
Indonesian movie industry.

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:41.480

trophy on your behalf.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.300
