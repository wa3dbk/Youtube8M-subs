00:00:08.297 --> 00:00:21.933
After 10 years Audi's Q7 gets replaced, now based on the MLB platform.

00:00:21.933 --> 00:00:34.531
FWD cars from VAG have MQB. For the bigger cars, there's MLB.

00:00:33.954 --> 00:00:39.128
This is the first. The Audi A4 and Porsche Panamera will follow. But first this.

00:00:56.756 --> 00:01:05.198
Thanks to MLB, it has lost 300 kgs. It still weighs around 2000 kgs though.

00:01:05.198 --> 00:01:20.126
But computers and air suspension manage it all. And 4-wheel steering.

00:01:20.126 --> 00:01:38.953
At low speeds, the rear wheels countersteer. At high speeds, the same direction.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:58.024
Under the bonnet: a diesel and a petrol engine, and more to follow.

00:01:58.024 --> 00:02:10.124
Early next year, a plug-in hybrid as well. This is the 333 PS V6, which we know.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:18.830
It's been refined and linked to an 8-speed automatic. It works perfectly fine.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:34.492
No DCT here, the car is too heavy, says Audi. So a conventional torque converter.

00:02:51.299 --> 00:03:02.318
The electronics are up to date too: lane assist, active cruise control and more.

00:03:02.318 --> 00:03:18.384
It's nearly autonomous. There's even WiFi and wireless phone charging.

00:03:21.294 --> 00:03:41.513
You can get plenty of extra's, like special upholstery. It's all very neat.

00:03:42.274 --> 00:03:54.266
All in all, a great car. But it's not groundbreaking. Unlike Bentley, I'd say...

00:03:57.774 --> 00:04:01.932
+ Comfortable ride; Nice transmission

00:04:01.932 --> 00:04:05.366
- Plug-in hybrid next year; Not that innovative
