[music plays]

00:00:13.267 --> 00:00:15.800
[students laughing
and shouting]

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:16.200
&gt;&gt;Coach: 
In and out quick,

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.867
in and out quick, Run into it.

00:00:22.867 --> 00:00:23.900
&gt;&gt;Lauren Hoppensteadt: 
I have two older brothers

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.467
so growing up I always
used to want to do what

00:00:25.467 --> 00:00:28.900
they did, so I kind of started
playing soccer, I think

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.233
when I was around five, and
just kind of stuck with it.

00:00:31.233 --> 00:00:34.200
I played basketball for a little
bit, wasn't very good, so

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.700
then I ended up quitting in high
school, but I played co-ed

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.067
for soccer, I played up levels
through soccer, I just did

00:00:40.067 --> 00:00:44.800
everything soccer,
soccer, soccer.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:47.033
I just think I play so much
through high school, and

00:00:47.033 --> 00:00:50.267
junior high, and as a kid that I
couldn't imagine not doing it.

00:00:50.267 --> 00:00:52.233
I don't know what I would
do with all my free time.

00:00:52.233 --> 00:00:54.233
I 'd probably end up
playing intramurals if I

00:00:54.233 --> 00:00:58.667
didn't play in college, anyway.

00:00:58.667 --> 00:00:59.900
We have a really
young team still.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.733
I mean, I was young when I
came in as a freshman, but

00:01:01.733 --> 00:01:03.767
I think that we are really
starting to progress and hold

00:01:03.767 --> 00:01:07.133
on to tasks that we were
learning when I was younger.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:10.333
I just think this year, all the
pieces are finally falling

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:13.333
together, everything is falling
in to place and everything is

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:16.433
starting to look really good,
coming out in the beginning.

00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:19.433
I mean, we lost our first few
games, but we still came

00:01:19.433 --> 00:01:20.967
up and played, and played hard.

00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:23.600
We were competing, where
like before it wasn't

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.133
so much of a competition.

00:01:25.133 --> 00:01:26.933
We were trying, we were always
chasing the game, and now

00:01:26.933 --> 00:01:28.233
I feel like we are
actually starting to lead

00:01:28.233 --> 00:01:29.467
and people are chasing us.

00:01:29.467 --> 00:01:34.400
[Team chants]

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:37.167
E-I-E-I-E-I-U!

00:01:37.167 --> 00:01:39.033
Our team is a very much
family environment.

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:41.167
Everyone gets along
really well.

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:42.367
We always joke around
in practices.

00:01:42.367 --> 00:01:44.000
We always have inside jokes.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.700
We hang out outside of soccer.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.200
We hang out during practices.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.900
It's more than just like hey,
I played with this person.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:50.867
They are my teammate,
I feel like

00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:52.600
they are a lifelong friend now.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.267
I've shared experiences with
them that I haven't shared

00:01:54.267 --> 00:01:56.100
with a lot of people.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.967
We laugh together, we cry
together, we fight all the

00:01:57.967 --> 00:01:59.900
time, but we get over
it, we move on,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.067
we try to get better, everyday.
