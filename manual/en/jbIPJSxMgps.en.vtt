Hey, guys!

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.620
It's Jeff Cavaliere back here with the ATHLEAN-X
blog.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.600
Today we're gonna talk about something that
a lot of guys have asked me, I think ever

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.480
since I put out that Biceps Blast Workout
on youtube and that's: Jeff, how do you get

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:27.320
the peaks on your biceps?

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:32.210
Now I gotta say, I think a little bit of that
is God given...

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.230
A little bit, because we all have different
shapes of our muscles.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.160
Some of us have longer and leaner muscles,
some of us have shorter muscles...but I think

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.830
there's something that you can do to influence
that in your training and I wanna show you

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:46.950
that today.

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:54.990
Basically I think that it's the way you grip
the bar or the dumbbells, when you're doing

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.990
biceps exercises.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:59.630
I'd like to call it sort of like a hooker
grip.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:07.040
If I was gonna do pull-ups here with an emphasis
on the biceps, I would get a good grip here

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.030
with just my fingertips grabbing on.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.560
So I'm not looking to grab on with a full
grip, because at that point I feel like my

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.469
forearms start to take over, as I pull myself
up on the bar.

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:26.539
If I just have my fingers hooked over the
top, basically what I'm getting is a lot of

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.119
bicep action that has to pull me all the way
up.

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:36.670
So you can see, if I'm doing what I call my
'90 degree chin-up', I kind of get into a

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:44.499
90 degree position of the arms right there...get
down slow, so kind of what we talked about

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:46.869
on our last week's blog about time under tension.

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:48.229
Up for a second...down slow.

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.799
Now how are we gonna take that over to the
dumbbells?

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:59.960
I'm gonna grab a couple of dumbbells right
here.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:06.770
You can't really see in these power blocks,
but the way I'm holding it is down with the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.500
fingertips, way down here.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.610
So when I curl them up, I'm gonna actually
curl up and keep my wrist flat faced down

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.640
against the floor.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.150
Again, right there is requiring more work
for my bicep to hold everything up instead

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:23.240
of letting the weight fall here, where look...

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:29.050
I can hold this thing here for the next 10
minutes, but all I'm gonna do is bore you

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.410
and then eventually make this arm tired.

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:37.000
But laying that back a little bit, holding
with the fingers, now my bicep is working.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.080
And there's nothing I can do, but eventually
lower it.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.880
So how do I apply that?

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.010
Shoulders back, in with the fingertips...wrist
went back, curl up to the top.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.690
You can see right here it's not easy.

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:53.690
...down slow.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:03:04.800
So training like this is going to influence
the peaks on your biceps, even if you're not

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.190
necessarily genetically predisposed to having
them.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.630
Guys, keep coming back here.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.260
I'm gonna keep bringing tips like this for
training...we're gonna get you some of the

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.340
nutrition tips you've been asking for and
a whole lot other stuff that you may not have

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.340
thought about.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.690
In the meantime, make sure you get your copy
of the ATHLEAN-X training system, if you don't

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.170
already have it, where all these things are
spelled out for you and shown in detail to

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.040
get you in the best shape of your life.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:29.510
Thanks, guys!
