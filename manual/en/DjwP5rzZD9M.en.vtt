00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.200
My name's Kyle Baucum, I'm a 2013
Ashford graduate

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.790
and the winner of the 2014 Forbes School of Business

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.349
Senior Project Scholarship. I just started my Master's

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.469
with Ashford last month, and

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.700
I'm an engineer for the BNSF Railway.
I found out about the Forbes

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.040
Senior Project Scholarship through my advisor actually. I was talking to him about

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.980
going to grad school, and he advised me
to

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.710
apply for the scholarship and told me
where to find it online.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.280
I knew I qualified for the scholarship
because once I visited the site, it laid out all

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.559
the instructions and qualifications, and
by being a

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.879
either a senior or someone who has just
graduated within the last

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.379
12 months, I was able to apply for it, and I had 

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:50.429
about a 3.2 GPA. Applying for the Forbes
scholarship really didn't take very long

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.170
at all, it was probably less than a

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.350
two-minute process. I went online

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.559
found the link for scholarships under
Admissions, there was two scholarships

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.269
available so it was easy to find.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:05.219
Two upload tabs, one for my senior
capstone

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:08.540
project, that was already done so it was
easy to upload,

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.630
and the other was for the letter of intent.
I went about choosing what my topic was

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.329
because

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.789
I work for a class 1 railroad, and I've done
so for ten years

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.630
so it was pretty easy for me to bring concepts

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.480
from working for the railroad into what I
was learning in the classroom.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.440
Writing the capstone project impacted
me personally. Despite researching my

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:31.570
company and all

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.590
of the topics that I covered in my
Bachelor's program, it gave

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.850
me a different viewpoint on management
and the organization that I worked for

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:43.770
as a whole. I think it definitely prepared me for

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.939
a future role in the company.

00:01:45.939 --> 00:01:48.439
For researching the capstone project,

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:51.890
I think a key for students is to

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.119
write down a good outline and then you
can go through and

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.409
hit all your main bullet points.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.159
The Ashford Library is great for
researching information.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.179
If you can't find what you need, I found that going in and rephrasing

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.539
what you're looking for can bring up
different search results and

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.799
that worked great for me for 
researching.

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.970
For the letter of intent for the Forbes
scholarship, it's only a 250 word

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.720
document briefly talking about what
you did in your Bachelor's program,

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.129
what your goals are in going to grad school,

00:02:25.129 --> 00:02:28.670
and basically what sets you apart from
everyone else applying for the scholarship.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.250
I definitely recommend all the seniors and

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.099
graduates that are within 12 months of
graduation to submit their capstone

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:37.170
project

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.900
to the website because it's definitely worth a shot at winning the scholarship.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.400
Winning the Forbes scholarship has
allowed me to go ahead and jump right into my

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.989
grad

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.010
degree. I wasn't sure what I wanted to
do

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:55.640
and after being selected the winner, it just gave me the final push to go ahead and jump in.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:02.640
 

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.110
