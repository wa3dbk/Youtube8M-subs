The natural feeling is just without comparison.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.282
Then the vision came to us to produce a playable, highly flexible and authentic sounding phrase instrument.

00:00:49.234 --> 00:00:55.443
To realize this vision we teamed up with Native Instruments combining our scoring expertise with their expertise and software.
