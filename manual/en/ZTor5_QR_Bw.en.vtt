00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.220
Hey, welcome to my potting beds today.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.240
I am Shawna Coronado, The Casual Gardener,
and here with me is my little helper.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.270
And today we are going to show you a really
cool and sustainable idea for growing seeds

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:18.850
and here is how you do it.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.550
We all go to the big box store and buy soda
and water, right?

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.150
And they come in plastic bottles.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.619
Which you should be recycling by the way.

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:34.579
And in here is an empty form.

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.190
I removed all of the bottles without cutting
the plastic off.

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.260
Pretty cool, huh?

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.200
So what we are going to do is plant seeds
in there.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.200
And then cover the ends with cellophane.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.200
And it functions as a little greenhouse.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.450
And it is a really cool and sustainable way
to start your seeds.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:50.450
So, but here we go.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.450
So I need your help.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.450
So you get the stand over here.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.450
And the first thing we are going to put in
here are – it says magellen scarlet zinnias.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.320
So put in – oops there it goes, we dropped
one.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.410
Oh no, we dropped one.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:03.120
Can you put them in there?

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.830
Put them in a little row.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:08.690
One right here.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:10.540
There you go.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.780
Couple more.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.719
Here let me put them in your hand.

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:20.430
Can you hold open your hand?

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.430
Awesome.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:22.909
There you go.

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.240
And here I will do this side.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.780
We are doing it!

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.219
We are planting seeds.

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.810
There you go.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.700
So we are only planting on one side.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.829
And that is because we can plant several rows
of flowers.

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.259
And then what we do.

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:56.039
I have these really cool stickers that I made
with my P-touch, can you see them?

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:02.430
And so I put that magellan zinnia is right
there and then next to it, we can plant the

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:03.430
red zinnia.

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:04.430
And we will put that right there.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.509
So you can see how it all goes together.

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.250
Then, once you are done planting the seeds,
then you have to put water in it.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.700
If you pour your rain barrel water directly
in, all the water is going to mush and go

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:17.700
everywhere.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.709
So what we want you to do, my assistant, is
to –

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:23.709
Squirt through the hole?

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.269
You can squirt through the hole but you can
squirt through it here too it is ok.

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.939
Here a little bit here and there.

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:34.939
Perfect.

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:37.220
And then you squirt it all in.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.360
Very good.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.200
And get them all wet.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.200
And you want to spray it everywhere.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.200
Absolutely.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.200
Are you getting it all in there?

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.200
Yeah.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.200
All right.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.200
Ok?

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.200
And then when you are done.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.200
Ok, let us turn around here and put the camera
back.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.200
So when you are done you will have a little
greenhouse and hopefully your little buddy

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.379
can help you too.

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:54.930
All right so we are signing off and remember:

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:00.790
Make a difference and do something green today,
especially in the garden.
