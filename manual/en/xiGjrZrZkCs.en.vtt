Hi Holy it's time for us to listen to a story from the Bible well well I was

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Waiting for so long for you children. Come on let us start with today's story.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Today's story is about lifelong friendship that David and Jonathan

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Shared. Wow! that sounds nice just like us

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Yes you can learn something about friendship too. But you do remember

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
That you need to answer my question at the end of the story

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Yes yes we know Long time ago A brave young man called David had defeated a Philistine

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Giant called Goliath single-handedly. After this battle when he returned to

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Camp Abner who was King Saul's commander took him

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000
To Saul. Seeing David he was extremely pleased.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:03.000
So asked him Young man Whose son are you? David answered I am the son of Jesse

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
From Bethlehem. Now King Saul's son was Jonathan. David's courage and bravery

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:17.000
That day affected Jonathan very deeply. He was moved to love him like a brother

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
They had many things in common from that day forward they became best friends and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Never let anything or anyone come between them ever

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.000
As a gift of friendship Jonathan gave David the beautiful robe he was wearing

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Along with the robe he also gave him his armor sword and his bow. From that day

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Onwards Saul kept David with him and did not let him go back to Bethlehem. David

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Won all the battles to which Saul sent him and he soon was made an officer in

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
His army. This made Saul his officers and his men

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Very happy. Wow Thank You Holy for sharing with that

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
