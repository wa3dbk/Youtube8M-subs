00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:23.849
We 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:25.820
get to do a lot of things in video games.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:28.980
We get to throw fire out of our hands, in
underwater cities.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.260
We get to blow up zombies with rocket launchers,
because why wouldn’t we?

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.060
We get to stomp on evil turtles, and burn
their friends alive.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.210
Kind of brutal, when you think about it, but
that’s video games.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:44.589
They let us be the badass.

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:46.789
But what if they didn’t?

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:51.079
What if the only fire in our hands was a flare?

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.329
What if, instead of the rocket launcher, all
we had was a flashlight?

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.010
What if instead of making us powerful…

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:19.310
They made us hide.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.329
This is a video game that’s not a video
game.

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:27.920
I mean, obviously, it’s a video game…but
it’s a video game that disregards everything

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.829
about video games.

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.619
Everything they’re supposed to be, it’s
not.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.420
And all the things I’d normally think about
for a review, don’t really apply here.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.560
In this entire game, there’s one real enemy.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:45.490
That’s it, and everything happens in one
place.

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.120
So normally, this is where I’d say something
about, “Oh, a lack of enemies, needs more

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.440
diversity…game review.”

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:57.679
But that one enemy, is the most daunting game
enemy ever.

00:01:57.679 --> 00:02:00.810
So much so that, every step you take, you
take with caution.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.420
Like, genuine caution.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.340
You walk around this one place, legitimately
terrified of what you might see around the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:08.340
corner.

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.340
And that’s the other thing.

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.250
A lot of this game is just…walking around.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.250
Looking for things.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.800
Like, a lot of it’s pretty quiet and uneventful.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.080
That’s where I’m supposed to say it’s
boring, because a game where you might not

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.440
even see anything for a long period of time?

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.440
How’s that a game?

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.519
But that’s what I mean.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:28.620
This is a video game…that’s not really
a video game.

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.210
This is Alien: Isolation.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.370
Despite the name, you don’t have to be a
fan of the Alien movies to appreciate what

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:35.370
it’s doing, either.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.780
It’s not like this is good, for a video
game based on a movie.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.780
This is just good.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.450
And it’s doing some incredibly cool things,
regardless of what it’s based on.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:46.390
Speaking of which, you play as Ripley.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.390
Amanda, Ripley.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.099
Her mom was Ellen, a lady who’s influenced
everything from Contra to Halo to just Samus

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:54.370
Aran, in general.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:00.349
I mean, so much of video games, from outright
references to even general concepts, can be

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:05.310
traced back to the first two Alien movies…that
it just makes sense.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.700
That a movie that gave so much to video games,
would continue to do so…only this time,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:11.700
through a video game.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.019
Like, that’s on a different level than most
movie games.

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:18.910
Movie games go for “okay at best.”

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.910
Alien’s looking for something bigger.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:34.870
And also you.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:37.440
So what is Alien: Isolation?

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.829
Well…actually, I’m not sure.

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.190
I mean, technically, it’s a stealth game…but
“stealth” would imply that you’re sneaking

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.200
up on people, right?

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:55.310
Hiding behind the box, waiting for the bad
guy to turn around, knocking them out cold…like,

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.650
“stealth” implies you’re the hunter.

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.959
That couldn’t be further from the truth
in Alien: Isolation.

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.909
I mean, it has the mechanics of a stealth
game, but this isn’t a game about stealth.

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:07.260
It’s a game about hiding.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:12.150
It’s a game that doesn’t patronize you
with fantasies of power or strength.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.049
There’s no bravery here.

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:17.940
And even if there were, it wouldn’t mean
anything—you’d have a brief little moment

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.280
of adrenaline, of feeling good about yourself…a
real moral victory.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:23.200
And then, you’d be dead.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.510
So don’t fool yourself, there are no heroes
in this world…least of all you.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.949
There are the survivors… and there’s this
guy.

00:04:30.949 --> 00:04:33.990
If you don’t want to be this guy…

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.100
Run.

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:46.560
And you know, speaking of fragility…what
I’ve always loved about Alien…is that,

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:50.970
to me, it’s a really harrowing reminder
of that fragility.

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:53.440
Of our place in the grand scheme of things,
you know?

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.139
Isolation tells a similar story.

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.400
I mean, here’s this huge ship, this technological
marvel.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:05.430
A beacon of human ingenuity, and a symbol
that represents all of the knowledge and wisdom

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.780
we’ve accumulated over centuries and centuries,
as a species…

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:13.310
From fire, to the wheel, to prepackaged food.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.240
Our entire existence…and we have this ship,
you know?

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.560
We have this pretense, that we can understand.

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:26.069
That we’re in a position to understand.

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:30.860
And then we find this.

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.639
This one creature we don’t understand.

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:36.229
And that’s all it takes.

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.410
We tend to think we’ve got this sh*t covered,
as humans, right?

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:41.210
We think a lot of ourselves.

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:44.620
This one creature makes you think otherwise.

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:49.630
And it’s that helplessness, that sudden
reversion to an instinct we lost touch with

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:52.669
a long time ago…this taps into it.

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:56.610
It brings it up and leaves it like a lump
in your throat…

00:05:56.610 --> 00:06:01.520
And it’s terrifying, and uncomfortable,
and that’s why it’s awesome.

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:07.479
I guess if you’re looking for an exciting,
action-packed video game…which, look, I’m

00:06:07.479 --> 00:06:12.539
with you, normally I am, too…this might
not be a game for you.

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:14.570
In fact, it probably isn’t.

00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.030
And it’s not like it’s perfect, either.

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:19.910
It is kind of slow, and it can be very unclear
at times.

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:25.200
Plus, it takes some time to get into, and
there’s issues with the AI…I mean, it

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.280
has some video game problems.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:30.710
But like I said…it’s not really a video
game.

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:36.789
At least, not in the usual sense, not the
way we usually think of them.

00:06:36.789 --> 00:06:42.630
This is something different, something that’s
simultaneously more simple and more complex.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:47.389
And for me, whatever faults it does have are
offset by where it excels.

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.860
The atmosphere, that’s where it excels.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.110
It’s thick, and suffocating…strangely
beautiful.

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:59.819
It’s not a matter of jump scares, or gory
monsters.

00:06:59.819 --> 00:07:02.539
It has real dread…that’s where it excels.

00:07:02.539 --> 00:07:05.539
It’s about what you see, and what you hear.

00:07:05.539 --> 00:07:06.930
And what you feel.

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:09.870
In fact, that’s probably its greatest achievement.

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:14.430
I mean, in a world of big-budget video games
that are all doing the

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:20.280
same big-budget video game, Alien: Isolation
wants to do something else.

00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:23.169
It wants to make you feel something.

00:07:23.169 --> 00:07:23.469
Didn’t say it would feel good, though.
