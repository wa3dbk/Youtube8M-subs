00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:03.190
When it was announced that Pluto was

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.440
no longer a planet a lot of people,

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.160
including myself, were not very happy.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.190
Pluto was the underdog, even though it

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.980
was much smaller than all of its neighbors

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.990
it still was a planet and everybody loved
it.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.630
But one day the evil scientists decided that

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.630
it was too small and must be revoked of its

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.710
rank of planet.

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:26.249
Well, Pluto being too small

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:30.099
is only a small part of the reason it got
demoted.

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.809
The discovery of a 9th planet somewhere past
Uranus

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:35.879
was predicted by astronomers long before Pluto
was

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:37.960
discovered in 1930.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.469
When it was finally found astronomers

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:42.830
noticed that it was smaller than all the other
planets,

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.920
but they loved it anyways and made it the
9th planet of

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.920
our solar system.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.219
For about 75 years children were taught

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:52.350
the 9 planets of the solar system and everyone
was happy.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.510
But things changed as our telescopes got better
and better.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.429
In 2005 Caltech was discovered.

00:00:58.429 --> 00:00:59.440
Caltech is an object that

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:02.040
was found nearby Pluto that was very similar
to it and

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.839
just a little bit smaller.

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:05.839
Astronomers began to worry

00:01:05.839 --> 00:01:08.250
that they might find more objects like these
nearby.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.000
If they were to find one that was bigger than
Pluto

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.870
astronomers would have to reconsider its title
of planet.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.399
The astronomers’ fears came true later in
2005 when

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:21.270
Eris was discovered which was even bigger
than Pluto.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.740
Since then astronomers discovered that Pluto
is

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.439
just one of over 70,000 other objects that
make

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:28.860
up what is known as the Kuiper belt.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.090
To deal with this problem astronomers decided
to

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.600
create an exact definition of the word planet.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.439
They decided that for something to be considered

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.369
a planet it must meet 3 criteria.

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:39.369
One.

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.909
It needs to be in orbit around the Sun.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.149
Pluto orbits around the sun so, so far so
good.

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:44.149
Two.

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:45.530
It needs to have enough gravity to pull

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.090
itself into a spherical shape.

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.130
Pluto is a sphere.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:50.130
Three.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.890
It needs to have “cleared the neighborhood”
of its orbit.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.840
And with this third requirement, the planet
Pluto was Murdered.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.759
Having 70,000 other objects in its orbit disqualifies
it from being planet.

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:07.102
While I want Pluto to remain a planet as much
as the

00:02:07.102 --> 00:02:10.140
next guy it would be impractical to do so.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.140
If Pluto was allowed to stay a planet then
any object

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:15.860
found that was as big as or bigger than Pluto
would

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.410
also have to be considered planets.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.410
This could add

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.660
hundreds of new planets to our list, and no
one wants

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.630
to memorize the 300 planets of the solar system.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.000
So while it is sad to see Pluto go, just remember,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.420
it’s for the best.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.180
Thanks for watching guys, I hope you enjoyed.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.450
If you did leave me a like and subscribe.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:55.720
And as always, keep thinking.
