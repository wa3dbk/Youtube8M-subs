00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:02.880
Hi, my name is Leah Day and this is a video for

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.160
LeahDay.com

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.400
Today we're quilting a t-shirt block with our walking

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.680
foot and I'm going to show you how to do echo

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.620
quilting. It's really fun, really easy, especially with

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.400
your walking foot as a nice guide for every line

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.520
that you stitch. Let's get started, so.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.920
I'm going to get started by dropping my needle

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.940
into the down position, bringing it all the way back

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.600
up again. (I got hooked on the foot right there.)

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.980
Just tug on that top thread and my bobbin thread

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.280
will come up. It's a little tiny string. Pull it all the way

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.180
up and tuck both thread tails underneath the foot.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.280
Drop that needle back to the down position.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.660
The reason that I do that is simply to keep the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:46.820
thread tails on the surface of the quilt

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.720
versus getting tucked around on the back

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:51.440
and making the block look ugly.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.760
Now let's get started. I'm going to basically just

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.900
stitch right around this rainbow shape with an outline.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:06.340
If you ever overshoot your stitching by one stitch

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.680
you can just back it up by rotating the hand-

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.260
wheel backwards on your machine.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.280
Now as I stitch a deep curve like this I'm going to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.519
make sure to stop and rotate the block often.

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:20.760
I'm just stopping with my needle in the down

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.820
position, rotating it around making sure that

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:29.410
whatever I'm stitching is right directly straight

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.660
down the front of that walking foot, as that's the

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.560
only direction that it stitches in.

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.920
It's a little different from free-motion quilting. We have

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.920
to always have the block rotated around to the

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.600
right direction.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.140
One thing that makes walking foot so easy is the

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.818
fact that the size of the stitches are regulated by

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.140
your machine because you're using the machine

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.380
the way it's designed to be used, using the feed dogs.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.140
I don't have to worry about my stitches at all

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:08.520
because the walking foot is making them very nice

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.120
and tiny and consistent. Every single one. I have

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.460
my stitch length right now set at 1.6 mm. It produces

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.840
a very nice, tiny stitch. I think it looks really good on

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.440
the quilt. I'm going to be playing with that

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.080
a lot with these blocks, just seeing different

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.520
effects playing with the stitch length,

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.300
seeing what happens. I plan to try some

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.840
decorative threads just to see what effects that

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.060
would create for the quilt. I think that'll be

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.160
really interesting.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.340
Now I'm starting my echo and I stitched down

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.340
about ½" and I overshot just a bit. What I want to do is

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.760
I want to make sure that I'm lining up the edge of

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.540
that walking foot with the ddge of the rainbow.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.480
Now I'm just going to maintain that. I'm just

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:55.560
going to keep an eye on the edge of that walking foot

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.260
as I stitch straight down towards myself.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.109
The trickiest part is getting inside of this rainbow.

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.440
It's okay if your echo isn't exactly perfect. As usual,

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.300
it's perfectly fine if the echo comes in or out

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.400
of that exact distance a little bit. It's no big deal.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.200
It's nothing that you need to pick up a seam ripper to

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.280
rip out. But you can see how many times I had to

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.360
rotate that, take it in and out of that space. And now

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.260
I can stitch further on down.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.940
As far as knowing how far to stitch down in order

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.860
to come down this direction, this just comes

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.960
with practice and being able to visually estimate

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:39.740
your space. It's kind of like driving a car. You know

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:42.400
how you kind of know exactly when to put your

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.160
foot on the brake when you're turning the corner?

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.560
It's kind of like that. The more you do it, the more

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:49.900
you'll know how far you need to stitch something down.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.420
But until you do it a few times, it's kind of guesswork

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:57.260
like I showed you that tip about backing up s

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.100
one overshoot. It's really no big deal if you

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.520
accidentally stitch one stitch too much.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.200
That's not a big big deal and if you end up doing

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.380
a slightly wider echo, that's not a big deal either.

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:12.760
It's really nothing to panic about.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.060
One thing that I wanted you to notice, and this

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.340
was intentional, is that I am working around this

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:22.960
rainbow shape in a clockwise direction, and there is

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.640
a reason for that. As I work clockwise this is going

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:30.700
to feel very natural. For some reason how this is

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.880
feeding through the machine, it feels like I'm

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:36.720
going to deal with less and less bulk within the

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.980
machine. If I was stitching counterclockwise

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:42.200
it would feel the opposite. That's just something

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.040
that you pick up on after having stitched this a little bit.

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.700
Of course these blocks are not very bulky.

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:52.060
They're not very big so it's not a big deal even if you

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.660
do stitch it the opposite direction. Again, don't

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.420
bother ripping it out or restarting or anything like that.

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:01.340
It's just one of those things that I've noticed. Working

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.420
in that clockwise direction, especially with anything

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:09.400
that spirals outwards like this, really can help reduce

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.940
that bulk and help make it just feel easier.

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:14.180
That's kind of the whole point. It's just to make this

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:15.800
feel nice and easy.

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.640
At some point you're going to reach the corner of

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.060
your block and the echoes are just going to

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:23.880
run up against the edge of the block. Let me show

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:25.740
you how you deal with that. It's just a little bit

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.400
of maneuvering. I stitch my echo down.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.040
With this block as I progressed around I got my echoes

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:36.480
a little wider as I went, and that's fine.

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.140
I'm just estimating about ⅛" between the edge of

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.380
my foot and the edge of my last quilted line.

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:46.600
I stitched down to my marked outline of the block.

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.980
I rotated it around and stitched towards myself.

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.320
Again, just guesstimating that space, seeing where

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.780
that's lined up, the echoes spaced out again.

00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:02.880
This feels a little awkward cuz it's a little bit more

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.480
bulky in the machine, but it's no big deal.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:09.600
Goes by really quick, and then I just keep repeating

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:14.260
the steps: Stitch down and stitch over. It's how

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.820
that corner is completely filled.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.620
Let me show you my finished block. You can see

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.120
all those beautiful rows of echo quilting.

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:39.420
Understand that I did not break thread once

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.620
while quilting this and it only took me about

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.560
five minutes to fill from the center to the outside

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:47.820
edges. It's good to understand just how quick and0

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.380
easy this is going to be. I'm really enjoying walking

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.240
foot quilting. The thing that I keep coming back to

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.640
time and time again is: Quilting does not have to be

00:06:56.640 --> 00:07:00.000
so hard. Make it easy for yourself, make it fun,

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.160
and enjoy stitching this on one of your t-shirt blocks.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.540
