On behalf of expertvillage.com my name is
Carolyn Travisano here to tell you about window

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.759
murals. Okay, these are the smaller windows
that I showed you sketches of earlier and

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:19.100
at this process at this point in the mural
design I laid down all the black paint marker

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:26.890
there and so it's pretty much final, final
as far as the black part is concerned. You'll

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.390
see like a nice foggy hazy effect that is
the sealer that I used and it's a workable

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:39.070
fixative basically so I can still paint on
top of the fixative but it will keep the black

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:47.000
where it is and permanent. So at this point
it's ready to lay in all the colors and add

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:54.360
a little bit more detail and it's almost close
to done. So at this point depending on what

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.130
the owners would like the final product to
be is how I seal it whether there's a polythene

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:06.080
I put over the top of it and it's normally
an acrylic base or just a crystal clear enamel

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.251
coating on top of that. Sometimes we'll also
just take a regular household paint and paint

00:01:12.251 --> 00:01:18.030
the back of it. So when you're on the other
side of the window it'll just be a solid color,

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.100
but when you come outside it'll be the mural.
So when the piece is all completed and say

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.820
it's for an advertisement or a sale that they're
promoting so it'll just be a temporary design.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:38.229
Like I said earlier when you add regular dish
soap into the paint it allows it to remove

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:44.520
very easily with a razor blade when they're
ready to take the mural down. So with this

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.909
particular mural that I'm doing this is to
be permanent so I'm using regular household

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:57.020
acrylics but also tempting with small acrylic
samples that I have that I've been using.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.350
With this design how we're going to take it
off eventually is most likely with a razor

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:09.039
blade. You can very easily soak it down first
with Windex or a spray bottle of some type

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.540
of household cleaner and let it soak there
and basically the paint will just rise off

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.840
the glass because it's a nice smooth surface
and it's not permanently adhere to it, it'll

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.620
just bubble off of it, you take a razor and
just slide down and it comes off in little

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:24.319
sheets of paint.
