00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:05.799
 Hello friends welcome to this my channel 

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:10.699
 this time with another video and this is the starting point 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.400
 this time I will show as the leading edge of the fishing net is made 

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.600
 as we already have leads ready to be placed in the tow rope 

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:24.799
 Now we just leads 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.800
 we take a rhombus 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.299
 and together with rope embrace Lead 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.900
 and knocked into shape 

00:00:41.799 --> 00:00:46.799
 so that will be a ball kind 

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.899
 the other also 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.899
 distance lead to lead has to be the same 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:10.700
 I also remember that the rope where they shall be placed Leads 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.500
 not be too flexible because you'll have the problems of entanglement 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.900
 it is preferably not very flexible 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:34.200
 the string has more domain lead 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.400
 if you place a flexible one you'll have the problem of entanglement 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.100
 because lead will dominate the string 

00:01:43.099 --> 00:01:45.899
 and that should be avoided 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.400
 we continue placing Leads 

00:01:54.099 --> 00:01:57.699
 we have become comfortable in this flat stone to give 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.700
 shock and shaping the lead 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.699
 good lead which is very flexible and easy to work 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.800
 and so we are putting leads in this way 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.800
 with a small hammer hit 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.900
 and it looks good 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.900
 always keeping an eye we grab 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.300
 with rope 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.300
 and now hit 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.900
 then we 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.900
 a lost eye and the following 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.400
 We grabbed the lead with rope and hit 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.099
 so we have left a kind of ball 

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:13.899
 and we have now met with union 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.900
 Rope 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.099
 For this we have selected a bigger lead 

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:24.599
 We have previously cut a bigger lead 

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:28.000
 to embrace the two ropes 

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:36.899
 well now that we have it ready 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.900
 We hit with hammer 

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.900
 We hit really hard 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.900
 and now we proceed to cut 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.900
 cut here 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:14.899
 Like the other end cut 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:27.000
 and we have attached the rope and keep the rest 

00:04:27.399 --> 00:04:31.799
 always taking an eye not forget 

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:51.000
 if you prefer more weight 

00:04:51.899 --> 00:04:57.799
 They may give more weight because one eye is loose 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:05.100
 remember that when we raise to shape the breast 

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:07.500
 were three free diamonds 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.500
 two of them put weights and is free 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.500
 we're done with the leads placed 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.300
 they have to be this way 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:23.300
 lead to lead rather uniform 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.300
 While friends have reached the end point of this video 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000
 see you 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:34.300
 other videos later 

00:05:34.399 --> 00:05:36.899
 until next time.
