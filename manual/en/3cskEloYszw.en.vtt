Summer is not complete without delicious Southern Peas!

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:05.930
I am the Produce Lady, and I am here to share information about Southern Peas
00:00:10.66,00:00:02.72
that can help you and your customers.
00:00:13.38,00:00:03.52
If you're like me, you've never met a pea you didn't like,
00:00:16.90,00:00:03.30
and there are lots of good peas out there.
00:00:20.20,00:00:05.46
Southern Peas are known as field peas, Crowder peas, purple hulls, cowpeas,
00:00:25.66,00:00:03.78
black-eyes, and many other common names.
00:00:29.44,00:00:07.32
Southern peas, one of the oldest crops known to man, originated in India about 3000 years ago.
00:00:36.76,00:00:04.52
Peas traveled to Africa, and then to the Southern United States.
00:00:41.28,00:00:06.58
Many local areas have specialized pea varieties and participate in seed saving traditions.
00:00:47.86,00:00:06.56
A cup of Southern peas contains approximately 120 calories and about 7 grams of protein,
00:00:54.42,00:00:02.90
which is the equivalent to an ounce of meat.
00:00:57.32,00:00:04.48
Like most vegetables, they are a good source of potassium.
00:01:01.80,00:00:06.21
Southern pea varieties are usually picked at first maturity when moisture is the highest.
00:01:08.01,00:00:05.78
For fresh produce safety, remember that fresh pea pods are very perishable.
00:01:13.79,00:00:04.70
Make sure you move them to a shady area immediately after picking.
00:01:18.49,00:00:03.12
When heading to the market, always pack and transport
00:01:21.61,00:00:04.25
with good ventilation to avoid spoilage by heat.
00:01:25.86,00:00:04.70
Peas may also be allowed to dry on the vines and can be used as dried peas
00:01:30.56,00:00:03.06
that will require soaking before cooking.
00:01:33.62,00:00:03.13
Let your customers know that for best quality,
00:01:36.75,00:00:04.05
they need to preserve the peas as soon as they get them home.
00:01:40.80,00:00:03.66
Peas are best when shelled and cooked immediately.
00:01:44.46,00:00:05.81
Although they will keep refrigerated 4 to 5 days, the peas will lose moisture to the pods.
00:01:50.27,00:00:04.26
'The fresher, the better' is the key to ultimate flavor.
00:01:54.53,00:00:05.77
For basic cooking after shelling, rinse peas with cool running water and then simmer
00:02:00.30,00:00:04.17
in liquid with seasonings - like ham, bacon or bouillon.
00:02:04.47,00:00:04.50
A smoked turkey wing or leg also provides an excellent seasoning
00:02:08.97,00:00:02.29
and is lower in salt and fat.
00:02:11.26,00:00:04.37
I personally like to use onions and red pepper for flavoring.
00:02:15.63,00:00:02.93
Cook peas for about 45 minutes.
00:02:18.56,00:00:05.25
If you truly want a flavor of the South, try mixing any type of Southern peas
00:02:23.81,00:00:03.95
with fresh corn kernels the last 15 minutes of cooking.
00:02:27.76,00:00:05.64
Some people like to include a few immature pods broken as 'snaps' in their pot of peas.
00:02:33.40,00:00:04.63
Only the youngest and most tender pods should be used in this fashion.
00:02:38.03,00:00:05.18
Remember to always practice good hand-washing before handling produce.
00:02:43.21,00:00:05.62
