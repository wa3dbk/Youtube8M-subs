00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.830
Hello I'm Bruce Zimmerman Host of the Open Line Garden Show and

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.260
Certified Horticuluralist 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.119
for Rittenhouse.ca.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.640
Today we are going to look at the Chapin 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.099
Pre-Treatment and De-Ice Backpack Sprayer.

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:28.059
Now the Chapin Pre-Treatment and De-Ice Backpack Sprayer is a

00:00:28.059 --> 00:00:31.130
four gallon fifteen litre unit.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.160
It's used to apply liquid De-Icer

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.590
liquid Ice Melt

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.750
and Salt Brine.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.900
It comes with shoulder straps, lumbar support

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.659
and

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:47.670
a torso strap. All are adjustable.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.810
Now

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:50.840
the unit has

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.080
a braided hose

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.450
which goes to a locking trigger

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.650
with a filter it. That's important we are going to discuss that

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.100
in a minute. A plastic wand

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.430
and an adjustable plastic nozzle

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:07.150
because of the materials that your spraying with

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:10.570
you're using plastic.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.140
Now this unit

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.280
has a four

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.810
stage filtering system.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.240
The first stage

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.390
is the basket.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.100
The second stage is inside. You'll see it. It looks like a tall black stick.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.760
You pull it

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.409
straight out

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.159
and

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.020
it is

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.890
another filter 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.090
which has to be cleaned and put back in again.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.340
The third stage filter is actually in the compression chamber. It is right down 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:38.260
at the bottom.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.140
It's the most difficult to clean.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:46.030
So you want to keep the stage 1,2,and 4

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.700
as clean as possible and it'll minimize the amount of time

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.250
that you're going to have to take the unit 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.310
apart to clean the stage three filter.

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.740
Now also on the inside in here on top of the compression chamber is a pressure

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.460
regulator.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.090
You get to choose what pressure

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.280
you're going to operate your backpack on.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.719
You can pump, pump, pump but whatever you set that to

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:13.619
is what you will actually be able to spray at.

00:02:13.619 --> 00:02:16.689
Your choices are thirty psi,

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:18.349
forty-five psi,

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:20.900
sixty psi and

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.099
eighty psi.

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:24.999
Now once you've finished unit and you empty it all out

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:29.719
if you're going you should clean after every use and at the end of the season.

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:32.249
You will fill it up about halfway with

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:33.169
plain water.

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:34.659
You can add a drop of

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:36.639
dish soap in there just to help clean it out.

00:02:36.639 --> 00:02:40.019
It's not absolutely necessary

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.679
and then you'll pump it all the way through until air comes through.

00:02:43.679 --> 00:02:46.089
You will do this several times

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:49.159
and then you're ready to store your unit.

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:52.399
The unit should be stored in a cool

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:53.669
dry

00:02:53.669 --> 00:02:56.329
out of sunlight spot where it will 

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:57.619
not freeze.

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:01.339
The other thing that I would do is I would take the owner's manual

00:03:01.339 --> 00:03:05.439
and I would photocopy it several times and place them

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:10.309
in special places where you

00:03:10.309 --> 00:03:11.729
won't lose them.

00:03:11.729 --> 00:03:16.790
Why? Because in the manual there are pictures of exactly how to take your unit
apart and reassemble.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.529
Also it's got a parts list

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:22.919
and for the life of me I always get the call 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.569
that this is missing,

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.069
or I don't have this anymore,

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.369
and what do I need.

00:03:30.369 --> 00:03:31.629
So do that

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:33.129
and with this care

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.049
you should have this unit last a very long time.

00:03:36.049 --> 00:03:38.189
If you'd like to see this unit

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:42.559
or any other industrial, commercial, or horticultural sprayer
