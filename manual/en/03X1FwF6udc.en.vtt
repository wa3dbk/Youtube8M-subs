My name is Julie Asti. I'm a Certified Financial
Planner with Asti Financial Management. And

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:07.939
today I'm going to talk about how to design
a savings plan. The first thing you want to

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:11.690
do in trying to design a savings plan is to
first create a working budget. Because you

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.730
want to make sure that after, as your income
comes in and you've paid all of your fixed

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:19.320
and your variable expenses that you have some
money that you can actually dedicate to a

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.640
savings plan. So the first step is definitely
going to be able to create a working budget

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.890
that provides you with hopefully positive
cash flow in which you can start a savings

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.772
plan. When you are looking into a savings
plan, one of the things that you are going

00:00:31.772 --> 00:00:36.730
to need to ask yourself is what are you saving
for. And there really can be three main types

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.690
of goals. The three goals are really based
on time periods. Short term goals, intermediate

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.490
term goals, and longer term goals. Short term
goals are those that would be accomplished

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:50.240
anywhere from you know currently, a goal that
you are saving for in the next couple of months

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.890
to something that would be in the next three
years. So kind of zero to three years is a

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:58.579
short term goal. An intermediate goal would
probably go anywhere from three to ten years.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.690
Maybe that's purchasing a car in five years
or buying a house in seven years. And then

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.670
a longer term goal is going to be anything
ten years plus. Maybe buying a vacation home

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.580
when you are fifty or being able to retire
securely. Those would be the three types of

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.390
goals that you would have, that you would
be trying to create a savings plan for. In

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.481
terms of looking at the three different types
of goals it's important to note that if you

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:26.340
are saving for a short term goal I would highly
recommend that you invest that money liquid.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:32.700
And by liquid I mean investing into high yielding
money market account, checking accounts, savings

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.120
accounts. Something that's going to be save,
it's going to be liquid. You are going to

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.640
have a hundred percent guarantee a principle
and it's hopefully going to be FDIC insured

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.420
which means it's going to be invested in a
banking institution. Because for a short term

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.140
goal you want to make sure when you are ready
to actually purchase that goal that you have

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.010
the money now saved to enact that goal. You
want to make sure you have a hundred percent

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.030
of the money that you originally saved for
that goal. For intermediate or long term goals,

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:02.159
that's money that you can actually invest
in mutual funds, stocks or investment accounts.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:05.299
Because on those types of assets you want
to have a growth rate. You want to have a

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:10.060
higher rate of return. Short term goals, savings
accounts are probably going to return anywhere

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:14.650
from one to maybe three or four percent. Hopefully
over the long term investments in the stock

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.540
market are going to return anywhere from maybe
five to ten percent depending on your risk

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.200
tolerance and the portfolio that you've chosen
to put together. But those you can take a

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:25.420
little bit more risk because you need to get
a little bit more return in order to reap

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.010
those goals over the long term. And that would
be how to create a savings plan for your short,

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.380
intermediate or long term goals. My name is
