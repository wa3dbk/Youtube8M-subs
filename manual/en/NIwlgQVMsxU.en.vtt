00:00:05.789 --> 00:00:08.655
Quite some power and this from a four-cylinder.

00:00:15.217 --> 00:00:19.728
You've probably been waiting for this car
for quite a while, at least the enthusiasts did.

00:00:19.729 --> 00:00:23.649
Today we're in the new BMW 3-series.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:27.103
Initially it'll reach the market with
two versions: diesel and gasoline.

00:00:27.104 --> 00:00:30.326
We're currently driving the 328i.

00:00:37.415 --> 00:00:42.614
The 328i is BMW's new four-cylinder engine
that we've somewhat become acquainted too.

00:00:42.615 --> 00:00:45.875
It's supposed to replace the
six-cylinder entry engine.

00:00:46.804 --> 00:00:51.778
It's got 245 bhp produced
by a twin-power turbo engine.

00:00:51.861 --> 00:00:57.023
With 350 Nm at a mere 1250 rpm,
the torque is quite nice too.

00:00:57.024 --> 00:01:01.178
And because it's got a
eight-speed automatic gear...

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.934
... you've always got your
full torque available.

00:01:03.935 --> 00:01:07.427
Making it a nice and exciting car.

00:01:07.428 --> 00:01:10.781
The engine doesn't sound very extravagant.

00:01:10.782 --> 00:01:12.862
But it doesn't sound bad either.

00:01:12.863 --> 00:01:16.015
From the inside it sounds less good
than from the outside.

00:01:17.313 --> 00:01:23.757
The cameraman made the clever remark that
the engine has been made to...

00:01:23.758 --> 00:01:27.674
... make it look like a six cylinder is driving by,
from the outside that is.

00:01:36.473 --> 00:01:39.498
But of course what you're interested in,
how's the steering?

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:46.677
Kind of nice, it feels somewhat lighter and
more sensitive compared to the old 3-series.

00:01:46.678 --> 00:01:50.852
A relative of mine has one of those,
so I've driven it for quite some time.

00:01:50.853 --> 00:01:54.427
This just feels more agile and fresh.

00:01:54.428 --> 00:01:59.579
The strange thing is, is that this car has
increased in length, almost 10 cm (4")...

00:01:59.614 --> 00:02:04.122
... which greatly benefits the rear passengers
because theyâ€™ve got more legroom now.

00:02:04.123 --> 00:02:09.090
Although it has increased, it still feels rather
nice and small and compact.

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:21.671
The new 3-series is available
in three different lines.

00:02:21.672 --> 00:02:25.218
The luxury, comfort and sport line.

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:30.063
Of course we're driving the sport line,
this also matches the 328i's sporty image.

00:02:30.064 --> 00:02:36.028
This means that it looks more sportive,
quite logical actually.

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:40.403
Gloss ornamental exhausts for instance.

00:02:40.404 --> 00:02:42.322
Black strips around the windows.

00:02:43.364 --> 00:02:47.980
In the interior there is a nice red piano strip.

00:02:47.981 --> 00:02:48.822
Nice red...

00:02:49.123 --> 00:02:50.076
There's a red strip.

00:02:50.077 --> 00:02:51.493
Red strip.

00:02:51.494 --> 00:02:55.806
We don't really like it because it's not the
same red as the car we're driving.

00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:06.827
This car's got all kind of different driving modes.

00:03:08.283 --> 00:03:12.289
There's the sportive steering, the comfortable steering...

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:21.526
... there's sport plus that disables part of the traction control
so you can play a bit without it becoming dangerous.

00:03:21.527 --> 00:03:23.986
And there's the eco pro mode.

00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:30.329
Not very exciting, quick switching, multigrain stuff.

00:03:44.348 --> 00:03:45.477
Hi!

00:03:45.478 --> 00:03:49.722
There's a nice sensor somewhere over here,
can't really find it.

00:03:49.757 --> 00:03:53.537
If you kick underneath, it'll make the
trunk pop open.

00:03:54.276 --> 00:03:55.640
Sometimes.

00:04:22.745 --> 00:04:26.608
Now we're down here anyway,
those black exhaust pieces.

00:04:26.609 --> 00:04:28.721
They are specially made for the sport line.

00:04:28.722 --> 00:04:31.232
It looks rather nice.

00:04:42.861 --> 00:04:46.634
Unfortunately we don't know yet what price
the 328i is going to get in the Netherlands.

00:04:46.635 --> 00:04:49.695
But I do know it'll do
0-100 km/h (0-62 m/h) in 5.9 seconds.

00:04:49.696 --> 00:04:51.285
Which I'm going to do one more time.
