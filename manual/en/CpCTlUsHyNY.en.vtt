00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.860
How come you came to play at Basketball Club Zadar?

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:31.740
well

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.540
With Božo Maljković being the head coach I started getting more and more minutes

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:43.180
After Aleksandar Petrović arrived as head coach my playing time diminished significantly

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.400
beacause there were a lot of players on the roster

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.200
I spent more minutes on the bench than on the court

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.140
I wasn`t in full drill

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.700
Zadar had lack of tall players

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.080
my services were offerd to them

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.580
Zadar accepted me and I can only thank them and everybody involved

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.460
I am glad to be in such a great Club with such tradition

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.760
What can the fans expect form you on court

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.000
professionalism and sportmanship

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.040
I leave everything I got on the court

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.540
I will do whatever it takes to help this team

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.700
help the team grow as a collective and for everyone thrive as players and as a team

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.980
What role in the team do you expect to have and how can you contribute to the team?

00:01:35.347 --> 00:01:37.987
being a new player in a formed team

00:01:37.987 --> 00:01:41.107
I do not expect the lead role from the begginig

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.860
I am getting used to the teammates, to coaches, the surroundings

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.600
for now I just want to help in any way

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.280
but in the time ahead I believe I will contribute a lot

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.500
i believe my strengths are phisical dominance

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.460
being able to shoot

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.260
playing with my face and my back to the basket

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.780
so I believe I can help this team even though there are those that doubt me

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.960
First impressions about your new teammates

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.620
I am thrilled by the guys

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.880
they are all great

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.020
they treat my with manners

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.720
I see this team really high

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.620
I believe we can do much more than the goals set by the Club

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.720
How do you relax outside the court?

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:40.860
the usual stuff

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.140
hanging out with friends

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:43.380
playing videogames

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:45.440
and listening to music

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.820
do you have acquaintances from earlier among your new teammates?

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.420
Yes, only Jozo Brkić

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.360
I met him in our national team 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.840
he is the oly one

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:01.740
I can only invite all the fans to come to the game

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.460
they will have what to see on court

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:08.460
we are all young guy willing to prove ourselves

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:09.900
thank you
