00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.560
So next I'd like to show you some different
tips when using a sponge. So this is actually

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.080
when we're sponging to create texture on your
piece. So what you want to start out with

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.290
is the proper tools. So I like these ordinary
household sponges, and they have really, really

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:21.640
great nooks in them and it will really create
a neat look on your piece. So, some things

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.890
to remember when you are sponging, I always
say to start light and then you can build

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:35.220
from that. So all I'm going to do is dip my
sponge into my paint, and then I always want

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:42.470
to blot either on the top of the palate, the
paint palate, or just on some paper towel.

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.500
And blot off a good portion of your paint,
and then all you're going to do to actually

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.220
do a proper sponging technique is you're actually
going to want to bounce the sponge onto your

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.170
piece. So I'm going to start really, really
light, and you can see the really great texture

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.460
that you can get from it, and I'll actually
show you how to blend a little bit with it

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.930
too. So I'm going to start and go really,
really light so I'm going to really fade it

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:11.289
out. Notice I haven't re-dipped my sponge,
I'm using the exact same amount of paint that

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:17.609
I first had, and all I'm doing is by going
over and over parts of your piece that you've

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:22.880
already sponged, you're going to slowly create
an opaque coverage. So you sort of adjust

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.829
it, and you can sort of see how well you want,
how concentrated you want your marks to be.

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:32.420
So I'm going to sort of keep it at that, and
now I'm going to show you different ways that

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.539
you can blend with sponging. So I'm actually
not going to change my sponge, I'm going to

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:43.630
use the exact same side that I used for my
turquoise, and I'm going to use green this

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.060
time. So again, I'm going to dip it into my
paint, blot it off still, and then I'm going

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.969
to start the other side and I'm going to do
a green. And you can sort of see there are

00:01:54.969 --> 00:02:00.640
little tiny specks of my turquoise in with
my green, which I want because I want those

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.671
two colors to eventually blend together. And
I'm just going to sort of pull it in, and

00:02:05.671 --> 00:02:11.700
dab lightly, where the two colors meet. And
I'm just going to slowly bring the green into

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.819
where the turquoise is and then I can always
go back and grab more green, blot again, and

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.939
then start and get more concentrated into
the sides. And it's sort of a neat way to

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:28.970
sort of blend two colors together while creating
really neat texture on your piece. And that's

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:29.779
how we sponge!
