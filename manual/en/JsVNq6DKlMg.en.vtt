00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.379
This movie provides a basic understanding
of the function and capabilities a Phase One

00:00:05.379 --> 00:00:10.019
Media Pro

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.259
Media Pro is catalog software

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:14.499
that helps you organize and manage

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:19.460
a large photographic archive or an archive
that includes other kinds of Media

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.590
such as movies,

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:22.869
Audio’s, text documents,

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.400
layout presentation and more

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.890
the first thing to understand is that all
the work you do to organize your pictures

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.540
resides in a catalog document

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.770
not in the files themselves

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.229
this catalog document

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:37.930
like the One we have here

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.199
is One that can be

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:41.580
moved from One computer to the other

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.169
so that even if

00:00:43.169 --> 00:00:48.329
that second computer isn't currently connected
to the set of files

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.370
it can still know everything about your collection

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.150
let's open up this catalog and see the kind
of information that we get

00:00:56.150 --> 00:01:01.700
as you can see we have a set of thumbnails
that's on the right-hand side of the window

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.070
and then we have upset of categories over
here on the left

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.510
down at the very bottom we have this thing
called catalog folders and what that is

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.500
is a representation of the file system itself

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.159
and I can click through any of these folders

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.560
and look at any images that happen to be in
these folders

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.020
now One of the things you notice of course
is that they're these red question marks

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.670
and that means that these images that can't
be found this foulder can't be found and in

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.329
fact if we look all the way up to the drive itself

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:36.010
the drive itself can't be found either

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:37.740
now that's okay because

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.400
we know that this drive isn't currently connected
to the computer

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.290
but One thing that this does illustrate that's
very important

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:45.330
is that

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.240
the catalog structure gives you the ability
to

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.210
look through, browse and organize your pictures
even if you are not connected to the pictures

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.090
let's connect up the drive

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.350
and see what we get at that point

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:04.390
once the harddrive is connected, when we
go back in the Media Pro, we can see that all

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:09.029
the question marks have disappeared browsing
through folders is a useful way to find pictures

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:12.209
but it's not necessarily the best way to find
pictures

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.930
Because the pictures you may be looking for may be
widely scattered

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.540
let's look at some of the

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.569
what they call catalog fields

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.590
these groups of metadata tags

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:27.369
that we can use to find pictures that we're
looking toward any given time

00:02:27.369 --> 00:02:29.499
so here in the date finder we can browse

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.939
by date and I can open up

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:35.279
to any particular day and

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.030
click on that day and all of the pictures

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.819
that were

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.510
shot that day, if they've been catalogued

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.680
are now available to me. We can also look for
files according to file type or according

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.900
to which camera shot the pictures so all of
the work that we've just seen

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.480
are tags that are put into the picture as soon
as the picture is shot so we didn't have to

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.249
do any work to get those tags there

00:03:00.249 --> 00:03:05.829
Media Pro also lets you create and use our
other really useful tags such as these location

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:06.979
tags

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:08.739
which organize pictures by

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.370
Country, state

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.109
city and location

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:18.260
Media Pro can read these tags if you've created
them in Capture One or Bridge, Photoshop, Lightroom

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.250
Photo Mechanic

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.930
or lots of other applications, or you can create
them here really easily

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:27.020
you can also organize your pictures according
to tags

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.069
such as ratings

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.219
as well as keywords

00:03:31.219 --> 00:03:36.639
and author and others

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.650
you can also cross reference tags

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.150
so for instance if I’m looking for the best
pictures from Iceland I can select Iceland

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.319
and hold down the command key and control
key on pc

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.289
and cross reference that with

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:51.220
four stars, which is my highest rating in this
catalogue

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.389
and I come up with the just five images
that have been rated as four-star pictures

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:57.939
that came from Iceland

00:03:57.939 --> 00:03:58.929
if I want to

00:03:58.929 --> 00:04:03.179
continue that search through more images I
can add the

00:04:03.179 --> 00:04:08.309
three-star images to the group and the two-star
images and the One star images

00:04:08.309 --> 00:04:12.539
and so on

00:04:12.539 --> 00:04:16.930
the catalog sets panel is the most capable
and flexible place within the Program

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:19.519
to do lots of organization

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.779
you could set this up however you want and
you can build a hierarchy

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:26.060
that suits the needs of your collection

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.830
for instance I have

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:32.560
uh... all of my commissioned work within this
one very large set called “jobs”

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:35.020
anytime I doing assignment for our client

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.149
I make a subset for that client

00:04:37.149 --> 00:04:41.549
and then I can put the different jobs I do
for that client within that group as well

00:04:41.549 --> 00:04:43.530
so if I do multiple jobs

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.100
for the same company

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.519
they can all be organized this way

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:49.400
now this looks like a set of folders

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.919
but it's not, the images are living in the
folders

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:56.660
wherever the folders happen to be they may
be on different drives but I can bring them

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:59.530
together here in these virtual sets

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.379
when I have a small shoot I may not need to
subdivide the images very much but when I

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:07.200
have a large assignment like what we see here

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.280
I had multiple situations

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:10.470
and I can

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:16.450
subdivide these images for each situation
so that it makes it much easier for me to

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:18.409
go through and

00:05:18.409 --> 00:05:20.520
find those pictures and organize them

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.880
and deliver a very coherent and

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:26.479
well edited and organized group of pictures

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:27.509
for the client

00:05:27.509 --> 00:05:30.749
One of the most valuable things you do to
your image collection

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:33.009
is to search it for high value items

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:38.179
such as images you might want to use in a
portfolio or send off to a stock agency

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:40.500
by doing those searches here within

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.370
the Media Pro catalog

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:45.680
you can save that work and you can revisit
it later

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.360
for instance I have a earlier searches that
I’ve done here and I’ve just created catalog

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:51.719
sets for those

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:53.039
and when I just

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:58.150
the other day went through and looked for images
I might want to add to my portfolio then I was

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.300
able to name

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.249
this group

00:06:00.249 --> 00:06:00.879
for

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:02.360
the search that I was doing

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.360
and subdivided according to the type of work

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.379
looking in here I might say well

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:12.129
I’m going to decide that I am going to use of
few of these

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:13.379
so I’m simply going to

00:06:13.379 --> 00:06:15.020
hold down the control key

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:16.239
or right-click

00:06:16.239 --> 00:06:17.979
and add a group and say

00:06:17.979 --> 00:06:21.949
let’s say add to website

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:26.599
and put a date; 110514

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:27.789
and

00:06:27.789 --> 00:06:28.919
I’m going to

00:06:28.919 --> 00:06:33.460
say that, this one

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.309
And this one and that one

00:06:35.309 --> 00:06:37.860
are going to be added to my website

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:41.930
so I simply drag them into this group and
they show up

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:45.460
and now I’ve been able to subdivide

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:49.090
This set of images down into some really high-value
images

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.379
and be able to use them for something

00:06:51.379 --> 00:06:54.099
and to be able to save that information

00:06:54.099 --> 00:06:56.870
that's really a an important

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:01.680
kind of function that we want to do across
the entire collection

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.300
and something that's very nice about this

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.570
as I’ve been able to do this

00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.379
without having to create

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:08.259
a new set of pictures

00:07:08.259 --> 00:07:11.840
or without having to move things around in
to different folders

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.540
because remember these aren't folders these
are just

00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:20.159
like a playlist in your music program

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:23.229
and Media Pro doesn't only let us organize
the pictures

00:07:23.229 --> 00:07:25.539
we can also do stuff with the pictures

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:27.719
we can create web galleries

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:30.590
we can create slideshows

00:07:30.590 --> 00:07:32.270
We can convert images

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:37.110
or we can even send them straight to the image
editing application of choice here with the

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:38.159
right click

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:40.579
look for other movies on the website

00:07:40.579 --> 00:07:43.399
that will show you how you can take advantage of some
of these other functions
