00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:08.660
And if your house is looking worse than some
of the homes that we just saw because you

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.049
can't part with Great Aunt Edna's teapot collection
basically from 1920 and just really don't

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:18.529
need it anymore, then this is the interview
we have to have you see this morning.

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.240
Joining me know, Kathi Burns is here with
'What is Muck?

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.919
How to Master Your Muck: How to Clean Out
Your Home and Make It Nice and Streamlined.'

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.949
We save so much junk it's ridiculous.

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:31.949
What is muck first of all?

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:32.970
Define it for us.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.150
Muck is anything that no longer serves you.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:36.440
That's a lot of stuff.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.440
It is.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.660
You can have a lot of stuff in your life that
serves no purpose, but it just so happens

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:41.760
to be there.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.760
There it is right there.

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:47.080
It makes you feel stuck or overwhelmed, old
habits that no longer serve you, an overbooked

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.680
schedule, overflowing closet, uncompleted
projects -- things that really make your life

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:52.680
a mess.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.100
Yeah, and those are things that stay in the
back of your mind all the time, especially

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.800
the uncompleted projects so that mucks up
your mind.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:02.040
Right, and your closet...things like oh my
gosh, I've got to get rid of these things,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.040
and those things.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.360
So tell us what we can do to make our homes
cleaner, what do we really need and what can

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.700
we throw away?

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.380
That is the good question.

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:14.090
So take for instance these, you have your
collection of colanders.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.649
And this is from one kitchen, and actually
there were more.

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:18.679
So how many colanders do you really need?

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:20.490
Not that many!

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:23.170
Well a good thing to say is, well how do I
cook now?

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.220
Do I still cook using all this, do I still
make my hard tack candy every year?

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.110
What am I doing right now?

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.860
And if perhaps you only do pasta and maybe
a little bit of vegetables, let's get rid

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.860
of it!

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:37.860
Keep the two that you use.

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.320
And don't be afraid to throw it out?

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.320
Donate it.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.009
Donate it to charity and that way you're passing
on your good as well which is wonderful.

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.609
The more that you release, the more you're
able to excel through life.

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:51.760
So if you feel stuck or you feel 'stuck in
the muck' so to speak, a way to master your

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.630
muck is to start releasing things.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:56.600
It can be as easy as your knife drawer.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.469
Oh my, that's a lot of knives!

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:02.280
So how many knives do you really need?

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.229
Not that many!

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.119
That's why I love these knife holders because
they actually give you some type of boundary

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:14.510
but it could be that you really stream down
and gone simple, you're no longer eating what

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.160
you used to eat, cooking what you used to
cook, you're very simple.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.519
It could be that you need just one really
nice knife and this will handle everything.

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:27.030
And pots and pans you don't really need like
a bunch of pots and pans in the kitchen.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.730
Use only the ones that you want and take the
others and donate them to charity.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:31.730
So what can we keep?

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.950
What are the top three things that you say
to keep in your kitchen so to speak?

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.709
Well I don't think there's really three things
that you should keep, but there's guidelines

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.159
-- the 'How to Master Your Muck' guidelines
that I put together in my book are: if it

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.561
serves your purpose right now, if it makes
you happy (if you just like to look at it,

00:02:49.561 --> 00:02:52.620
it doesn't have to serve a purpose but if
you're happy about it and you like it, like

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.099
art or a little object).

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.240
Keep that.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:56.950
Keep that, absolutely.

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:02.270
So things that really have a purpose in your
life right now are what you keep and if there's

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:03.401
space to store it.

00:03:03.401 --> 00:03:07.220
And that's the most important thing because
when we start taking up space that's when

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.220
it starts getting messy.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.219
Alright, Kathi Burns joining us this morning.

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:12.829
Thank you so much for being on with us and
clearing up the muck.

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.030
By the way, all this information is going
to be on our website at 10Connects.com.
