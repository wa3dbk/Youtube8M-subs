00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:01.310
Hi I’m John Green.

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.650
Welcome to my fancy new salon, including my
totally real fireplace.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.599
This is Mental Floss on YouTube and did you
know that Garry Trudeau, who created Doonesbury,

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.210
won a Pulitzer Prize in 1975?

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.849
That was the first comic strip ever to win
a Puh-litzer.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.280
Or possibly Pew-litzer.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.160
And that is the first of many facts about
newspaper comic strips that I’m going to

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:29.330
share with you today.

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.410
In 1945, conservative Harold Gray used his
comic to show just how much he despised FDR’s

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.460
New Deal policies.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.480
He killed off a star in his strip, Little
Orphan Annie: Daddy Warbucks.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.579
Eventually Warbucks came back to life, but
only after FDR died.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.060
The character claimed, “Somehow I feel that
the climate here has changed since I went

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.060
away.”

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.160
The comic Katzenjammer Kids was the first
to use speech bubbles.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.450
It’s also the oldest comic strip ever.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.170
It started in 1897 and still puts out new
comics today.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.510
In 2008, a tumblr by the name of “Garfield
Minus Garfield” was getting 300,000 views

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:05.510
a day.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.760
All the creator did was remove Garfield from
Garfield comic strips, leaving a sad and slightly-insane-looking

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:11.760
Jon.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.830
Jim Davis, who makes Garfield, was really
cool about it actually.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.330
He claimed that some of the strips on the
blog actually worked better than his originals.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.700
If I can make one recommendation, Internets:
Spiderman without Spiderman.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.049
And we’ll stay here on the wall to discuss
Peanuts.

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.110
Charles Schulz originally called his comic
strip Li’l Folks, but that had to be changed

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.689
because there was already one titled Little
Folks.

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:35.060
Off-topic, I just want to say how grateful
I am that there’s no rapper named Little

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.060
Wayne.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.560
Anyway, Schulz once admitted that he hated
the name Peanuts.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.869
He said, “It’s totally ridiculous, has
no meaning, is simply confusing - and has

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:44.869
no dignity.

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:46.920
I think my humor has dignity.”

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.939
My humor has dignity too, Charles Schulz.

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:50.920
See my earlier Little Wayne joke.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.979
And incidentally, Charlie Brown never did
kick that football in the fifty years that

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.570
Peanuts ran, which, by the way, was almost
18,000 strips from 1950 to 2000.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.450
In a 1975 speech, Gerald Ford said, “There
are only three major vehicles to keep us informed

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:12.980
as to what is going on in Washington: the
electronic media, the print media, and Doonesbury...not

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.340
necessarily in that order.”

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.450
One of Mindy Kaling’s first forays into
comedy was a comic strip for Dartmouth College’s

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.400
daily newspaper titled “Badly Drawn Girl.”

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.590
In 2005, Blondie’s 75th anniversary was
celebrated in the comic strip with a huge

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.090
party that featured tons of other comic strip
characters with months of build-up and lots

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.090
of interaction.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.470
The characters in the comic Pearls Before
Swine weren’t invited to the party, but

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.540
they still played out a story arc about their
plans to crash the party.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.270
When Farley (the beloved sheepdog in For Better
or For Worse) died, creator Lynn Johnston

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:46.720
received 2,500 letters - some positive and
some angry.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:51.650
The Ontario Veterinary Medical Association
even named a charity after him: The Farley

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.650
Foundation.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:55.879
Seth MacFarlane also had a comic strip, but
a little earlier in life.

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:58.849
He was being paid to cartoon when he was nine-years-old.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:02.960
His strip was called “Walter Crouton”
and it ran weekly in his local newspaper.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:07.320
There’s a park in Monterey, California containing
a statue of Dennis the Menace.

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.590
But it isn’t the original.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.160
In 2006, a bronze Dennis was stolen from the
park.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:17.110
It was 3 feet tall, 125 pounds, and worth
$30,000.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.220
It never turned back up so it had to be replaced.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.370
So if you’re looking for some Dennis the
Menace style mischief, and you also want $30,000,

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.910
Monterey, California.

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.379
Though artist Mort Walker has since been given
the army’s highest civilian honor, Decoration

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:33.620
for Distinguished Civilian Service, the army
didn’t always love his comic Beetle Bailey.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.760
In fact, the Pentagon had previously used
Walker’s comics as an army training guide

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.330
for how NOT to act.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.420
Scott Adams, the creator of Dilbert, decided
to start a food company in the late nineties.

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.970
They produced frozen vegetarian burritos using
his title character as the mascot.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:50.510
They were of course called Dilberitos[a][b].

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.599
Calvin and Hobbes creator Bill Watterson is
famous for his refusal to let anyone adapt

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.080
his comic to another medium.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.950
He has even turned down meetings with legends
like Steven Spielberg and George Lucas.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.700
One more fact about Calvin and Hobbes because
the Internet loves Calvin and Hobbes.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:09.120
In 2008, students at Washington University
in St. Louis organized a Calvinball club,

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.830
which attracted forty students.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:15.069
The one rule of Calvinball, of course, is
that you can never play it the same way twice,

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:20.180
and the club has honored this, using everything
from hardhats to water balloons to footballs

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.499
in Calvinball games.

00:04:22.499 --> 00:04:26.919
In 1996, when the mom on Family Circus (best
known as “Mommy”) got a drastic haircut,

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:28.090
it was big news.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.740
And by that, I mean it was an actual, literal
news story.

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:36.669
The LA Times went above and beyond with their
coverage, getting quotes from famous stylists

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.050
about the look.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:41.849
The Wizard of Id was a collaboration between
Brant Parker and Johnny Hart.

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:46.339
After getting the idea from a deck of cards,
they spent three days in a hotel room working

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:47.339
on it.

00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:51.080
They scheduled a meeting with hotshots from
the syndicate, who showed up early.

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:56.509
They were greeted by Parker, Hart, and a hotel
room littered with food, booze, and scrap

00:04:56.509 --> 00:04:57.509
paper.

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:01.569
The president of the comic syndicate reportedly
told them, “We think you guys are disgusting,

00:05:01.569 --> 00:05:03.159
but we’ll take The Wizard of Id.”

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:06.370
Speaking of The Wizard of Id, it was one of
Jim Henson’s favorite comics.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.009
He even considered adapting it into a TV show,
shooting a pilot in 1969.

00:05:10.009 --> 00:05:14.690
He ended up too busy to pursue the project,
but you can watch some of it if you click

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:15.690
here[c].

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:18.529
If you’re ever at Islands of Adventure and
the line for everything at The Wizarding World

00:05:18.529 --> 00:05:23.349
of Harry Potter is super long, which spoiler
alert: it will be, check out Toon Lagoon.

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:28.330
I mean, you can eat the favorite food of comic
characters, like a sandwich at Blondie’s

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.900
or ice cream at Cathy’s.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:35.659
Speaking of Cathy, when it was announced that
Cathy would be ending in 2010, #WaysCathyShouldEnd

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:37.190
was a trending topic on Twitter.

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:40.960
By the way, I apologize for using the word
“hashtag,” but at least I didn’t follow

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.099
it with “yolo.”

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:47.389
Speaking of only living once, people often
wonder WHY Bill Murray agreed to voice Garfield,

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:49.619
given that he only has so much time on this
earth.

00:05:49.619 --> 00:05:53.009
Well, he told GQ that he took the role because
the film was written by Joel Coen.

00:05:53.009 --> 00:05:57.159
And he had already done a day of voice work
before learning that this was NOT the Joel

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:01.110
Coen of the famous Coen brothers, but rather,
a different Joel Coen.

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:05.039
Which is all fine and good, Bill Murray, but
how do you explain Garfield 2: A Tail of Two

00:06:05.039 --> 00:06:06.259
Kitties...

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:09.279
But it’s not fair to throw Bill Murray under
the bus when it comes to comic strip adaptations,

00:06:09.279 --> 00:06:13.439
because the real villains of that story are
Betty White and Don Rickles, who were in the

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:16.009
straight-to-VHS Dennis the Menace sequel.

00:06:16.009 --> 00:06:18.000
Which also starred Carrot Top.

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.659
In news of a slightly better movie, Owen Wilson,
William H. Macy, Kiefer Sutherland, and tons

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:27.189
of other esteemed actors voiced animals in
the 2010 Marmaduke movie.

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:30.819
George Lopez was also in it, but his career
technically ended when he did the movie Balls

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:31.819
of Fury.

00:06:31.819 --> 00:06:34.770
Anyway, you can’t blame any of these people
for being in the Marmaduke movie because 1.

00:06:34.770 --> 00:06:36.180
paycheck and 2.

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:40.559
The premiere was a BEACH PARTY that featured
actual surfing dogs.

00:06:40.559 --> 00:06:44.949
Comic strip character Zippy the Pinhead appeared
in graffiti form on the Berlin Wall.

00:06:44.949 --> 00:06:49.759
When the wall was torn down, that piece sold
for $10,000 in an auction.

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:53.979
According to Rhymes with Orange cartoonist
Hilary Price, the word “crap” is still

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:56.439
considered inappropriate on the comics pages.

00:06:56.439 --> 00:07:01.490
In January 2014, she had to give newspaper
editors an alternative strip to the one she’d

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:05.610
designed that contained the word “crap,”
just in case they’d rather use, you know,

00:07:05.610 --> 00:07:06.610
a G-rated strip.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:07.789
Well, I for one say that SUCKS.

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:09.569
Apparently you can’t use the word “sucks”
either.

00:07:09.569 --> 00:07:11.289
What is this, Maoist China?

00:07:11.289 --> 00:07:14.599
How does Garfield express his frustration
when he can’t have lasagna!

00:07:14.599 --> 00:07:19.389
And lastly, I return to my fancy salon to
tell you about the unlikely friendship between

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:23.919
Far Side creator Gary Larson and primatologist
Jane Goodall.

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:27.899
One of Larson’s comics had one chimp asking
another “You conducting a little more ‘research’

00:07:27.899 --> 00:07:29.839
with that Jane Goodall tramp?”

00:07:29.839 --> 00:07:34.210
The Jane Goodall Institute was outraged, but
Jane herself stopped them from getting lawyers

00:07:34.210 --> 00:07:36.759
involved because she thought the comic was
funny.

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:40.629
The chimps perhaps were not so amused - Gary
Larson later visited one of Goodall’s research

00:07:40.629 --> 00:07:44.039
locations where a chimp named Frodo attacked
him.

00:07:44.039 --> 00:07:45.189
Larson was only slightly injured.

00:07:45.189 --> 00:07:48.789
Thanks for watching Mental Floss here on YouTube,
which is made with the help of all these nice

00:07:48.789 --> 00:07:49.789
people.

00:07:49.789 --> 00:07:52.659
Every week we endeavor to answer one of your
mind-blowing questions.

00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:57.590
This week’s question comes from Nick who
asks “Where does Bill Clinton reside today?”

00:07:57.590 --> 00:08:01.330
Well, Nick, not that I’m recommending that
you stalk the Clintons, but they live in Chappaqua,

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:02.330
New York.

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:03.990
If you have your own mind-blowing question,
please leave it in comments.

00:08:03.990 --> 00:08:05.759
We’ll endeavor to answer as many as possible.

00:08:05.759 --> 00:08:09.580
Thanks again for watching Mental Floss and
as we say in my hometown, don’t forget to

00:08:09.580 --> 00:08:09.989
be awesome.
