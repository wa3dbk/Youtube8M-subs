00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.620
I love dramatically framed statement mirrors but not always the price that goes along with them,

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.060
so I've decided to try to tackle one myself.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.920
I have a bunch of great crown molding left from a photo shoot that I did and I thought this would be perfect to make the frame.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.880
So to start this project, your first need to find a mirror.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.360
I found this mirror at Home Hardware.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.040
It's a great beveled mirror, it's very inexpensive.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.100
So the base for this mirror is going to be a piece of plywood.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.260
I had this plywood cut at Home Hardware to size, to accommodate the mirror that I chose.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.760
I left about a 4" band of plywood on other side of the mirror.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.420
That way, I'll have something to nail my molding down to when I get to that part.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.920
So we're going to measure the plywood find the center point.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.820
Now we know exactly where out mirror should line up once we glue it down.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.140
So now I'm going to apply some No More Nails Adhesive the back of the mirror.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.660
And we're going to apply it all the way on the edges of the mirror.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:09.120
And then we're going to want to run some across the middle so it adheres firmly to the plywood once we put it down.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.900
Okay, so now we're going to glue it together.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:20.180
I just want to make sure we line up the bottom of the mirror and that the sides are also lining up.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.440
Make sure to let this adhesive dry about 20 mins before you begin applying moldings to the mirror.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.500
So to protect this mirror from any paint or glue that may get on it,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.360
I'm going to cover the edges with green painters tape before I start.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.700
So the first piece of molding I'm going to use is a thin 3/4" decorative molding that I think will make a nice transition between the mirror and the plywood.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.520
Because it's such a thin molding, we really won't have to use nails to secure it,

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.440
we can use our construction adhesive again.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:02.800
So I'm going to run a thin bead of construction adhesive along the back of the molding.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.060
We want to make sure we push the molding flush up against the edge of the mirror and push it down nice and firmly.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.960
Now we're going to do the same thing with the other 3 pieces.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.160
All these corners have been mitered on a 45Â° angle so they should fit together perfectly.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.760
So this is the crown molding that I'm using for the frame.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:44.540
So it's 6" wide and has this great detail that I think is going to look great once it's painted out.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:49.840
When you're installing crown molding, unlike other moldings, you're going to be installing it on its edge like this.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.300
So when you make the mitered cuts, you want to put it in the miter box the exact same way.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:02.720
So to secure the crown molding, you want to first run a thin bead of construction adhesive along the back of the molding.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.160
Then, you want to press it firmly down on the edge of your plywood.

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:16.620
And with a little bit of help, I'm going to have someone hold it while I tack down the first piece of a finishing nail.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.520
To make sure the nail goes all the way in, you're going to want to use countersink.

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.860
We're going to follow these same steps with all the other pieces of crown molding.

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:38.360
But when you get to this part, you're going to want to put a little bit of adhesive on the edges to make sure that they stick together as well.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.360
We're going to place this down and hold it together like that.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.100
So while I'm waiting for the glue to dry, I'm going to use some painters tape to tape the back of the corners.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.660
This will hold it in place while the glue dries.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.920
I've also added a finishing nail to each corner to make sure that all the mitered edges are nice and secure.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:11.240
So now because everything doesn't always line up and we do need to hide some of the counter sunk nails,

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:13.680
I'm going to use my wood filler to fill everything in.

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.680
You want to make sure that the wood filler gets inside all the cracks.

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:22.120
And the good thing about wood filler is that it's paintable and sandable.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.880
So now that the wood filler's dry, I'm going to sand all the joints.

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.220
I'm using a super fine sandpaper to make sure that I don't scratch the wood molding.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.880
You want to make sure you get into all the nooks and corners so you have nice, smooth edges.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.960
Now I'm ready to paint and I've chosen this great Beauti-Tone colour called "Ink".

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.120
It's an almost black colour that I think would look great in any room.

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:54.080
So you want to make sure you get a nice amount of paint on your brush and because this is a really detailed molding,

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:58.080
you want to make sure you get inside all the little nooks and crannies.

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:12.420
So I've chosen a latex paint with an eggshell finish because I really didn't want it to be too shiny in the end.

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:16.840
So the first coat's done.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.740
Now, we'll probably need to give it about 2 more coats before we get the finish that we want.

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.240
I think this mirror has a really great presence to it.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.800
It would look good in the front hall, a bedroom, and would really just add a little bit of extra drama to any room in your house.
