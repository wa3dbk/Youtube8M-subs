they have also added a new option
recently

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:56.459
because i've had some people don't tell
me they simply don't like to download or

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.469
they don't want to download or maybe
they just don't know how to download and

00:03:59.469 --> 00:04:01.729
don't feel comfortable doing it
themselves

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:04.669
