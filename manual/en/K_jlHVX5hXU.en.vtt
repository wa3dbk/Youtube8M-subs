00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:08.950
So, we know that Springfree Trampoline is the safest trampoline in the world

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.169
and you're probably wondering what costs
more

00:00:11.169 --> 00:00:13.269
customers have to decide

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.959
how much safety and quality they can
afford

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:19.749
when we designed the Springfree Trampoline it took us 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:22.130
fifteen years to get it right

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.519
George Nissen built the first trampoline 

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.390
in the 1930s and since then, there's 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.400
really been no change to the basic configuration. This is the first time really

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.540
that someone has redesigned it from the ground up and looked at a way of

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:41.290
getting rid of some of the main impact points in a conventional trampoline

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.920
The design of the Springfree Trampoline is

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.320
quite a lot more complicated than the
design of a conventional trampoline

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.260
The composite rods for example cost many times more than the springs of a

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.570
conventional trampoline. They need to have a long fatigue life. 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.470
now normally this composite material
doesn't have to be bent as frequently

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:02.080
as it is in a trampoline but in this case

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.260
we've had to have a special recipe developed so that they will last the

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:06.420
distance

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.240
all of these things contribute to
something that is inevitably a more

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.810
expensive product

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.630
but the reason for that is so that we
can take away some of the danger of

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.350
conventional trampolines

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.470
There's many reasons why a traditional
trampoline could be cheaper

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:26.610
but in most cases it's because they've
cut corners somewhere. Many of them fall

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.540
apart relatively quickly. The ultraviolet
inhibitor is often lifted out of the

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.640
materials of a conventional trampoline
and that means that they don't last very

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.060
long. Some of the research that has been
done on traditional trampolines

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.619
shows that the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.560
padding material that they use to
protect children from falling onto the

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:50.320
frames or the springs deteriorates quite
quickly, so traditional trampolines

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:54.790
would have to have thicker padding on their steel poles to approach anything like the

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.270
softness of the Springfree Trampoline

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.280
I found that

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.700
in the US anyway there's 100,000 children a year injured on trampolines.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.390
A traditional trampoline could be made as safe as a Springfree Trampoline but

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.950
at the moment the standards don't require it so most often it's not.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.729
If traditional trampolines were to be made to

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:19.259
be as good as a Springfree or as safe as a Springfree Trampoline, there would be quite

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:22.279
significant changes that they would need to make.

00:02:22.279 --> 00:02:26.059
Let me give you some examples. The padding around the edge would probably need to be

00:02:26.059 --> 00:02:30.569
connected to the trampoline net, so that your feet don't slide underneath and get

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.469
tangled with the springs. The enclosure poles on conventional trampolines are made of steel

00:02:34.469 --> 00:02:36.609
and often they'll have a 

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:40.540
very thin layer of padding on them, whereas the Springfree Trampoline polls,

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.939
they're well away from the actual net itself on the top of the polls of traditional

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.819
trampolines you need something

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.129
that ensures that you can't impale yourself. The Springfree Trampoline poles

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.849
if you come down on it it's flexible and it will move away. Currently the Springfree Trampolines

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.129
exceeds all standards by
quite some margin. there are a lot of

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:02.579
smarts that go into this trampoline

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.019
not only did we redesign it from the
ground up but we had to have 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.129
pretty good competent engineers to put
the production facility together. With

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:16.329
all those changes it would inevitably
cost quite a bit more and yes, the Springfree

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:18.329
Trampoline might cost you more

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:24.169
but that's because it's far less likely to cost you

00:03:24.169 --> 00:03:28.319
a trip to the hospital

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:34.879
a broken bone

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:41.879
or even a ruined summer

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:47.789
So when you buy a Springfree Trampoline it's not just about what you're getting, but

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:48.489
also

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:49.429
about what you're avoiding.
