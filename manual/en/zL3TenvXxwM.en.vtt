00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:01.260
Hi YouTube, Darth Here:

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.180
It’s been a little while since we’ve heard
from the Hardline developers about what’s

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.229
coming next with their game, and today we’ve
got the very first patch.

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:10.330
There were a number of issues concerning weapon
balance that were brought up in the beta,

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.600
and many other issues, and this update manages
to address some, but not all of the community

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:15.600
concerns.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.660
So let’s take a look at what the first patch
for Battlefield: Hardline means for us.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.300
First-and-foremost, let’s get to the meat
of this patch: the weapon rebalance.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.350
For the most part, this change was isolated
to a few weapons.

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:33.350
The K10, AKM, RO933, FMG9, HCAR, HK51, Saiga
.308, and PTR-91 were the specific targets,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.690
so I’ll run down those now.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.470
For the K10, it should come as no surprise
that Visceral has nerfed the damage output

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.260
of this weapon in the short and the long ranges.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.320
Whereas it used to do 34 damage up close and
12 damage at maximum range, it now does 33

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.270
up close and only 8 at range.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.191
As I said in my previous video, a one damage
difference might not seem like a lot, but

00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:55.280
it takes the weapon from a three-shot kill
to a four-shot kill.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.110
This brings the weapon’s time-to-kill in
line with the MPX at a respectable 150 milliseconds

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.110
up-close.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.549
Still fast enough to kill you in a single
frame, but not completely outclassing every

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:06.979
other weapon in the game at CQB.

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.280
Next up to get hit with the nerf-bat is the
AKM.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:12.630
This weapon wasn’t terribly overpowered
by any stretch, but it was the only assault

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.729
rifle with a four-shot kill at range.

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:18.100
Now the weapon has gone from 25 minimum damage
to 24.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.939
This means that the AKM is a five-shot killer
at range.

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.550
This is slightly better than the six-shot
of the other assault rifles at their maximum

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.550
ranges.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:30.750
But keep in mind that the M416 and M16A3 are
better in the 33-to-56 meter ranges because

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.770
those weapons fall off at a further distance.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.310
So there’s a very narrow range of superiority
for the AKM close-up against other assault

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.820
rifles, and beyond 56 meters against other
assault rifles.

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.640
But across-the-board, all the battle rifles
saw a damage upgrade at long-range, as they

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.520
went from 24 minimum damage to 25.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.409
This upgrades the battle rifles to a four-shot
kill at long range, and gives them a distinct

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.750
niche advantage over the assault rifles.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.510
This seems like a pretty nice bonus for the
battle rifles, and it is, but I think it’s

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:00.000
just one more nail in the coffin for the DMRs.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.090
As for the DMRs, both the PTR-91 and the Saiga
.308 had their upwards recoil reduced.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:08.319
While this is a nice bonus for players who
want to use these as a blend between the more

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:12.459
accurate and lethal bolt-actions, and the
rate of fire of a battle rifle, I think they’re

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.049
still going to be disappointed in the DMR
class as a whole.

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:18.180
You still give up a lot with these weapons
at close range, and they’re not discernibly

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.689
better at long-range than a controlled battle
rifle.

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:25.389
Similarly, two underperforming battle rifles,
the HCAR and HK51, were also given slightly

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:27.319
easier to control upwards recoil.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.719
To be honest, I’ve been avoiding picking
these two weapons up until this patch as the

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.859
SCAR-H and SA-58 OSW are the far superior
choices.

00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:41.180
After this patch, the SA-58 OSW with its--possibly
erroneous--game-topping 840 m/s bullet velocity

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:42.599
is still the clear winner.

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:46.400
If you’ve taken the time to unlock the Jury
410 and found it somewhat lacking, you’ll

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.790
be pleased to know that the amount of damage
per pellet is going up to 20.

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.989
Now I’ve found the weapon unlocks in Hardline
to be particularly brutal, and secondaries

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.959
are typically not weapons I seek out initially,
so I really can’t weigh in on this change.

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.639
And honestly, unless I’m already running
around with my secondary out, the number of

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.469
battles that I have to resort to a secondary
are exceptionally low in Hardline when compared

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:07.169
to Battlefield 3 or 4.

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:10.349
The time-to-kill usually means one of the
two parties are dead before a weapon switch

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:11.639
can ever happen.

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:15.879
As for the carbines, the RO933 got a slight
upgrade in its rate-of-fire, going from 800

00:03:15.879 --> 00:03:17.260
rounds-per-minute to 850.

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:21.159
This at least makes the weapon competitive
with the other Operator choices, whereas before

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.469
the first weapon everyone used in the game
was also one of the worst.

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:28.829
And finally, another unlock weapon, the FMG9
has had its maximum damage increased from

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:30.819
21 to 25.

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.579
This is a pretty significant upgrade up-close
and takes the weapon from a minimum kill time

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:39.819
of 253 milliseconds to 190 milliseconds; add
in flight time, of course.

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:44.579
The change makes the weapon far more competitive
with its fellow PDWs, but it still lags behind

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.400
class-favorites in the MPX and K10.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.719
However, with quite a bit more midrange power
than those two choices, the FMG9 has carved

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:52.480
itself out a little spot with this patch.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.849
So that’s the bulk of the weapon changes,
and there are some noteworthy missing elements

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.269
that I’ll get to later in this video.

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.159
If you’ve been wondering where all that
good stuff that you saw in the Beta went,

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:01.159
fear not.

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:04.260
Visceral is increasing the odds of all Battlepacks
dropping better items.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.760
Specifically, bronze Battlepacks have a better
chance to drop collectibles and vouchers,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.579
silver Battlepacks were similarly improved,
and gold Battlepacks got the best increase

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:14.609
to their value by having their standard items
removed.

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:17.909
So if you’ve been saving up your cash -- either
in-game or out -- now might be the time to

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.660
drop some of that currency on a few gold Battlepacks.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.180
Next up, Visceral took a shot at the explosive
spam in the game -- particularly in Hotwire

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:25.680
where vehicles are abundant.

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.270
Now the number of RPG rounds available from
the trunk or boot of a car has been limited

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.270
to just one.

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.139
Additionally, the RPG has decreased splash
size and damage, increasing the need for a

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.840
more direct hit on your target.

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.169
To be honest, I can’t imagine this will
change a lot of things, as it really only

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.699
takes one car respawning to carry yet another
launcher into battle.

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:46.300
Keep in mind that if the car sticks around,
that launcher will eventually respawn -- allowing

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.009
the player another shot with the vehicle.

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.650
I’d argue for getting rid of the launchers
entirely if there weren’t hard-counter vehicles

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.110
in the game, so I think we’re unfortunately
tied into a catch-22 scenario.

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:00.789
Remove the launchers, the hard-counter vehicles
become overpowered, remove the vehicles, and

00:05:00.789 --> 00:05:03.630
people start shouting about how the game doesn’t
feel like Battlefield.

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:06.370
To their credit, Visceral has fixed a good
number of bugs with this update.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.740
There were some server and client stability
patches in this update, as well as adding

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.490
a few more server options such as longer map
rotations and adding a conquest large version

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:15.490
of Growhouse.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:19.590
Additionally, the Team Deathmatch spawns were
set to be further away from one another -- time

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.810
will tell if this corrects the issues players
were seeing in that game mode.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:23.840
So what didn’t make the cut?

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.310
I think the first thing on everybody’s mind
is any tangible improvement to the “netcode”

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:28.310
of the game.

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.370
Keep in mind that when I refer to “netcode,”
I always do so with quotation marks around

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:35.979
it, as “netcode” means many different
things to many different people.

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:40.000
Personally, I’ve felt that the “netcode”
in Hardline has been a step behind Battlefield

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.410
4’s since the Fall Patch -- but Battlefield
4 has also made **drastic** changes to their

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:46.960
time-to-kill to achieve a measure of success.

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.680
Hardline doesn’t really have that option.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:53.139
Dying behind walls, trading, and its sort
are all symptomatic of the time-to-kill in

00:05:53.139 --> 00:05:54.139
Hardline.

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:57.439
Like the transition of Battlefield 4 from
Battlefield 3, we’re asking the engine to

00:05:57.439 --> 00:06:00.669
do more on what is essentially the same limitations.

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:03.819
Improvements were made before launch--but
clearly there are still issues.

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:07.289
Behind-the-scenes, from Twitter it sounds
like progress is being made here, but it hasn’t

00:06:07.289 --> 00:06:09.360
materialized in-game yet.

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:13.050
Also missing is the improvements to weapon
achievements, licenses, or other content-spreading

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:15.310
changes that have been discussed in the community.

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:20.210
At 1250 kills to get a weapon license, only
deep-divers are ever going to be able to use

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:21.659
weapons cross-faction.

00:06:21.659 --> 00:06:24.999
Maybe that’s intentional, but considering
my own play, with almost a thousand hours

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:30.030
played across Battlefield 4, less than 10%
of the available guns would be unlocked cross-faction

00:06:30.030 --> 00:06:31.699
in that game for myself.

00:06:31.699 --> 00:06:36.340
If cross-faction weapons existed in BF4, I’d
only have a very small handful unlocked.

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.120
As far as achievability goes, the achievement
weapons in Hardline are reminiscent of the

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:42.090
phantom program in Battlefield 4.

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:46.050
Which would be fine if they didn’t comprise
a non-insignificant percentage of the content

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:47.050
in the shipped game.

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.419
So overall, what does this patch mean for
Hardline?

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:53.270
It should be pretty clear I’ve got mixed
feelings on this patch, what I wish it did,

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.449
and the things it accomplishes.

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:57.909
I don’t think it’s going to provide the
shot-in-the-arm that the PC player numbers

00:06:57.909 --> 00:07:00.590
need to match Battlefield 4’s current success.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.300
At the same time, it contains some very needed
changes to weapon balance.

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.830
But I just don’t think it goes far enough
-- these are the sort of changes that feel

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:10.340
as if they could have been delivered day-one.

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.000
But enough from me, what do you folks think
about Hardline and the latest patch?
