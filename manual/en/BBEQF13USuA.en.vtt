00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:01.659
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.

00:00:01.659 --> 00:00:02.659
(Applause.)

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:03.659
Everybody please have a seat.

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.040
Well, today I am honored to welcome a little
up-and-coming basketball team -- (laughter)

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.980
-- to the White House called the world champion
Miami Heat.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.180
(Applause.)

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:23.019
Now, for many of teams that come here, this
is a lot of cameras in one place.

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:24.570
It’s a little overwhelming.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.570
(Laughter.)

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.720
But for the Heat, this is what practice looks
like.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:28.720
(Laughter.)

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.720
This is normal.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:36.100
I know this is the first trip for some of
these players, but a few of them were here

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.030
a couple of years ago for a pickup game on
my birthday.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:47.469
Now, I’m not trying to take all the credit,
Coach, but I think that it’s clear that

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:54.780
going up against me prepared them to take
on Kevin Durant and Russell Westbrook.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.190
(Laughter.)

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.989
It sharpened their skills.

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.420
It gave them the competitive edge that they
needed.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.310
And I think part of the reason they came back
today is they want another shot at the old

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:07.140
guy.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.970
(Laughter.)

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.400
But first, I have to congratulate the Heat
on their well-earned title.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.060
This team traveled a long road to get to where
they are.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.630
In 2011, the Heat got all the way to the finals
only to come up short.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.510
But when you fall, the real test is whether
you can ignore the naysayers, pick yourself

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.300
up and come back stronger.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.330
And that’s true in basketball, but it’s
also true in life.

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.680
That’s exactly what these guys did.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:41.610
Instead of getting down, they got better.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.690
Dwayne Wade worked on his core.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:47.950
LeBron learned some post moves from Hakeem.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:50.280
Shane Battier came on board.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.360
They became a more complete team.

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.030
They got to know each other better and trust
each other more.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.140
And they became more fun to watch.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.460
In Game Four against the Thunder last year,
we saw LeBron carried off the floor with cramps,

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.610
only to come back a few minutes later and
hit a dagger of a three-pointer to put the

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.750
Heat ahead.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:14.970
During Game Six, we saw him pull off one of
the greatest performances in basketball playoff

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:20.030
history, dropping 45 points -- and he had
a scary look in his eye.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.450
(Laughter.)

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.610
We saw Dwayne Wade, the heart and soul of
this team, continue to do whatever it takes

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.800
to win, including leading the team in blocks.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.750
And at the post-game press conferences, he
dressed well enough to land himself in GQ

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:35.750
magazine.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.750
(Laughter.)

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.500
Show them your kicks here, Dwayne.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.500
(Laughter.)

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.870
If any of you can pull this off -- (laughter)
-- other than Dwayne Wade, let me know.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.910
We saw Chris Bosh get injured, but get healthy
right at the perfect time and do outstanding

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.140
work throughout the rest of the playoffs.

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.560
And it wasn’t just the Big Three.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:01.190
Mike Miller could barely walk.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.810
Mike, you look better now.

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:04.920
(Laughter.)

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:12.000
You looked broke down last year -- (laughter)
-- but still hit seven three-pointers in the

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
final game.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.710
I don’t know how he did it because he could
not walk.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.180
He looked like an old man.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.760
Mario Chalmers earned himself a nickname from
Dwayne Wade that I’m not allowed to repeat.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.760
(Laughter.)

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.140
But he did a great job.

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.650
Shane Battier, as always, played impeccable
defense, hit big threes.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:37.670
Juwan Howard -- “Grandpa” -- became the
first member of the Fab Five to win a ring.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:45.360
And Coach continually set the tone and kept
these guys motivated the entire way.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.319
So that team mentality -- with everybody doing
their part -- is what finally put the Heat

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.319
over the top.

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.010
And it’s especially impressive when you
think about everything they’ve had to deal

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.020
with over the last few years.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:01.700
This team inspired a lot of passions on both
sides.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.190
And I’m just talking about their dance moves.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.250
(Laughter.)

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.880
We saw that video, LeBron.

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:08.930
(Laughter.)

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:14.420
But even though I’m a little disappointed
that the Bulls didn’t make it, I do want

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:19.000
to congratulate the Heat for a well-earned
championship.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.270
LeBron said, “It’s about damn time.”

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:29.600
And I want to thank them for taking the time
this afternoon to spend with wounded warriors

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:36.960
at Walter Reed, because you guys are heroes
to them but they are heroes to all of us.

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.600
And let me just say one last thing about these
guys, and I mentioned this as we were coming

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.600
in.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:49.030
There’s a lot of focus on what happens on
the court, but what’s also important is

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:50.030
what happens off the court.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:55.690
And I don't know all these guys, but I do
know LeBron and Dwayne and Chris.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:02.370
And one of the things I’m proudest of is
that they take their roles as fathers seriously.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.840
And for all the young men out there who are
looking up to them all the time, for them

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:15.310
to see somebody who cares about their kids
and is there for them day in and day out,

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:16.310
that's a good message to send.

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:21.270
It’s a positive message to send, and we’re
very proud of them for that.

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:22.350
(Applause.)

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:27.750
So congratulations, again, to the Miami Heat.

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.040
And now we are going to take a picture that
makes me look very short.

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.040
(Laughter.)

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:36.360
I’m accustomed to it, but first I’m going
to ask Coach to say a few words.

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:37.669
(Applause.)

00:05:37.669 --> 00:05:46.230
COACH SPOELSTRA: Well, on behalf of Micky
Arison, Pat Riley, the entire Miami Heat organization,

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:51.590
and our families, we want to thank you for
your hospitality today to be in the White

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:56.830
House and also to be inspired by the great
men and women of the Walter Reed Hospital.

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:02.800
We are honored and truly, truly humbled to
be here.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:08.150
We actually hope that this team serves as
an inspiration to the nation of what a group

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:14.790
can do when you come together and sacrifice
your egos for a greater goal; to come together

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:20.970
with a real hard-hat work ethic, and to be
able to persevere through adversity and a

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:25.850
whole heck of a lot of criticism -- (laughter)
-- and still be able to accomplish the ultimate

00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:26.850
dream.

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.010
THE PRESIDENT: Fantastic.

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:30.170
Thank you so much.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:31.170
(Applause.)

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:32.170
MR.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.040
JAMES: Am I supposed to say something?

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.840
THE PRESIDENT: You can if you want.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:40.900
It's your world, man.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.330
(Laughter.)

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:43.760
MR.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:50.010
JAMES: On behalf of myself and my teammates,
we just want to thank you -- to piggyback

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:54.870
what Spo said -- for the hospitality, for
allowing us to be, I mean, in the White House.

00:06:54.870 --> 00:06:56.710
I mean, we're in the White House.

00:06:56.710 --> 00:06:57.800
(Laughter.)

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:01.740
And Coach said -- and the Prez said this real
casual.

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:09.300
So I mean, we're kids from Chicago and Dallas,
Texas and Michigan and Ohio and South Dakota

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:11.509
-- (laughter) -- Miami.

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:14.680
And we're in the White House right now.

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:19.840
This is like, hey, mama, I made it.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.980
(Laughter and applause.)

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.350
MR.

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:32.960
WADE: All I've got to say is we've got a 10-day
contract left?

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:34.130
THE PRESIDENT: Yes.

00:07:34.130 --> 00:07:35.130
MR.

00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:37.890
WADE: Pick my man up.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:38.890
(Laughter.)

00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:39.890
THE PRESIDENT: You guys could use a shooter.

00:07:39.890 --> 00:07:40.890
(Laughter.)

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:41.890
MR.

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:42.890
WADE: My point guard.

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:43.890
(Laughter.)

00:07:43.890 --> 00:07:44.890
THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.

00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:44.891
(Applause.)
