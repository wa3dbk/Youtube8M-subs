00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Now let's cool the yeast.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
This is the first cooling phase that occurs in the morning.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Starting from 6:00 am, we then need to do it every 3 ½ hours up to 4 hours.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
3 times per day.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
We use water to 20-22°C max.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
For...

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now I do it with my eyes closed, however, we add about a couple of grams of sugar per each liter 
of water.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Just to give the yeast a supply of oxygen.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
And huh... and to sweeten it, because being left like this throughout the night

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
it gets sour.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Let's remove the film of the yeast. This is a yeast that we

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
put aside yesterday

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
From the previous mixture we prepared yesterday.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Let's drain the water.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Let's press a little bit.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
and cut into slices...thin slices.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
It should be left to soak for about 15 minutes.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
just to make it purer.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Once this is done, it gets pressed,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And we can proceed with the cooling.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
When we do it.... We do it with our eyes closed.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Then, we proceed with the weighting.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
When we press.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We do.... we weigh the yeast and add...

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
...the same amount of yeast and flour and, 35% water.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
So, after 15 minutes...

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
...spent in the wet yeast...

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
...we press and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
...drain all the water that has been incorporated.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
We weigh...depending on the kind of dough we want to get...

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
we pour water over 500 grams of yeast

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
...35% water should be

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
175 grams.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Let's place the dough in the mixer.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Let's melt for 4-5 minutes.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And let's add the flour.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Let's knead for about 10 minutes.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and let's put it back in the cell at 28°C.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000
For three and a half hours.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Then, once the yeast has melted...

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
...we add the flour.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
About half a kilo of yeast, half a kilo of flour.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So, at this point the yeast is ready.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Let's put it on the table.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
and make... a nice loaf.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Let's make a cross.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Now this one goes to the cell for...

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000
...three and half hours.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Until the dough swells to up to three times its volume.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So after three and half hours our yeast is ready.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000
To make the next cooling phase

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:56.000
We cut it into slices.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
This one will be cooled with...

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000
...an equal amount of flour...

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
...for example: 1 kilo of yeast, 1 kilo of flour...

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
and 50% water.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Now we're ready for the cooling process.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Let's put the slices of yeast in the machine.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
Let's add one third of the water.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
And let  melt the sourdough with water.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000
See, the first measure of water has almost dried, let's add more water.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
After about 10 minutes...

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
the yeast is ready, it has melted with a little water, let's add the flour.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000
After about 15 minutes the dough....

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000
the sourdough is ready.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Let's remove it from the machine

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000
and put it on the table.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Let's put aside a piece of the dough we just prepared for the next day.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000
Let's divide this one into three parts that we'll use to prepare the dough tonight.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000
Once this is done, let it rest for just...

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
5 minutes.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
This is the part we have taken first.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000
Let's wrap,

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.000
and store it...

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
...with water in a container.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
I store it in water so that the acidity that is...

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000
produced throughout the night is released into the water.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Once that is done, we put it in the water here.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.000
and this one is for tomorrow.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Now let's make a cross on top.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000
Let's open the cross.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.000
And let's add the flour...

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
so that the yeast doesn't stick to the pot.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And now it is ready to go into the cell...

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.000
...and be used for the dough...

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
tonight.
