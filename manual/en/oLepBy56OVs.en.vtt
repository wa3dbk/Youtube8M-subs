Hi I'm Laura from young writers workshops
dot com. And I'm going to talk about how to

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:11.959
write a creative writing story. Hopefully
all your writing is creative. I want to talk

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:20.429
about writing a story in a way that will make
it easy for you to approach it. The four elements

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:28.010
you need to have in your story are setting,
character, some sort of action and a conflict.

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:32.720
If you have those four things, you set those
four things up you can pretty much write just

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.590
about anything. So start the action of the
story where every you feel comfortable. Sometimes

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:45.190
people say start right in the middle of the
action. For example the bell rang and everyone

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.850
jumped up. That would be starting at the beginning.
You can really start wherever you feel comfortable.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.560
The next thing to remember is to bring the
conflict in. In every story you have to have

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:01.830
some characters who are facing some sort of
challenge whether it's you know they are in

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.860
conflict with each other or there's a conflict
versus nature where they are in a storm. Whatever

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.729
the conflict is, you need that to make it
come alive, to make it have a point. It's

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:18.960
not really a story if there isn't a conflict.
Bring some description in, describe your setting,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:27.110
describe your characters. And use those, those
descriptions to create a more personal picture

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:33.969
of what's happening in this story. Resolve
the conflict and when you feel like your conflict

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.429
has been resolved you can end the story. You
don't have to have a long conclusion, you

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:44.649
really get to choose when you are writing
a story it's up to you how to structure it

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:51.189
and where it begins and where it ends. So
just to sum up a few things to keep in mind

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:58.729
when writing, a creative writing story are
to include setting, characters, a plot and

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:03.990
a conflict. To begin the action where ever
you want and to end it when ever you want.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.540
Use description and use detail. And those
are some things to remember when writing a

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.289
creative writing story.
