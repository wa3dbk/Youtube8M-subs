00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.210
(off screen) “So joining us now from NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center is Dr. Michelle Thaller.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.390
Thanks for joining us.” (Thaller) “Thank you, great to be here.’ (off screen) “So tell us what exactly is a 

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.570
supermoon and will it affect Earth?” (Thaller) “Well a supermoon happens when you 

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.680
get a full moon near a perigee. And perigees are a word for the closest

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.800
approach the moon makes to the Earth every month. Apogee is the farthest away. 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.910
You see the moon’s orbit is not a perfect circle. It’s actually a little elliptical. Sometimes

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.030
it’s a little farther away. Sometimes it’s a little closer. And that means that the size of the moon 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.160
seems to change in the sky. And when you get a full moon that happens when

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.280
the moon is very close, that’s called a supermoon. Now as far as the affects

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.380
on the Earth…nothing very direct. The actual size of the moon in the sky doesn’t change 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.460
very much. It’s only about 12 percent larger than an average full moon. 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.510
And as you may know, the highest tides of the month happen at 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.540
full moon and new moon. These are called the spring tides of each month. 

00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:57.720
And because the moon is a little closer than normal, that means the tides will be a little bit higher 

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:01.890
than normal as well. But we’re talking about a change of less than an inch. 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.070
So one of the challenges about measuring what they call the perigean tide,

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.250
the high tides associated with a supermoon, is even measuring it at

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.430
all. It’s a fun thing to actually detect. It’s not something that you can easily see.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.600
(off screen) “So what is the best time to view the supermoon and will it look different

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.780
from other full moons?” (Thaller) “Well to me the best time to view 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.940
any full moon is right at sunset because that’s when it rises. And when you see the 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.080
moon with respect to the horizon with buildings and trees or whatever

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.220
it just seems to look so much more spectacular. It looks larger. In reality 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.320
the size changes not that much. The moon at perigee or closest is just

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.370
a little bit larger than the moon when its farther away. Um there really 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.470
isn’t a best time at night to view this. Kind of a trivia that the actual moment 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.540
of supermoon when it’s both closest and the most full is going 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:55.590
to be at 7:30 a.m. this Sunday. But that’s actually after the moon has set. 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.640
So I would say anytime on Saturday night, go out and look at this beautiful big, 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.830
bright, full moon. My personal favorite time is right after sunset.

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.010
(off screen) “NASA has a major observatory in orbit around the moon right

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.190
now call the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. What are some of the cool things you’re seeing.”

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.370
(Thaller) “Well yeah so we actually have an observatory orbiting the moon right now.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:20.550
And we are returning spectacular high-resolution images of the entire 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.690
lunar surface. We can see all the Apollo landing sites, the footprints of the 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.860
astronauts. The poles of the moon are fascinating places. 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.010
There are actually craters both at the north and south pole of the moon where the sun never 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.140
shines. You never get any sunlight at all. And of course those are very difficult to image. 

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.250
. But we’re actually bouncing lasers down to the moon. We’re studying the topography 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:45.370
of these craters. And there’s evidence that there may be ice actually frozen 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.450
into the soil in these permanently shadowed craters. So there may be more 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.520
water on the moon, frozen water, than we suspected. So LRO is telling

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:57.570
us so much about how the moon came to be, how it changes over time.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:01.620
We’ve recorded the coldest temperature in the entire solar system with LRO in one of these 

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:05.810
permanently shadowed craters. It’s about 23 Celsius above absolute

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:09.990
zero, which is actually much colder than 400 degrees 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.180
below zero Fahrenheit. So just a fascinating place and we’re finding out 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:18.360
new things all the time. There’s so much more to learn about this familiar object

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:22.540
in the sky. (off screen) “I understand that LRO has taken some really incredible

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.720
images. Can you talk about some of those?” (Thaller) “Well I know that certainly some of my 

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.900
favorite images are of the Apollo landing sites. In some cases you can actually see the American 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.080
flag still up. I’m also a particular fan of 

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:39.250
the central mountain peak inside Tycho Crater. You can see this gorgeous mountain 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.440
right inside the crater. There are boulders on it that are as big as baseball stadiums. 

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:47.610
And I just love the variation of the lunar 

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.740
terrain. There are dark lava plains that are relatively smooth. 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:55.850
There are high regions where it’s very rocky and bouldery. It tells us 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.940
about the evolution of the solar system. You can actually see the scars left by 

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:04.010
huge impacts. Here again we have that gorgeous mountain inside Tycho Crater.

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.060
That one boulder you see in the middle is the size of an entire 

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:12.090
football stadium. It’s incredibly huge. The moon is a

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.270
relic of a more exciting and more violent time in our solar system’s

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:20.440
formation when the planets were coming together. Lots of things were colliding. 

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.620
We think the moon may have been created during a super collision where the 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.810
Earth was actually hit by something the size of a planet. So the moon is

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.990
so serene and we see it, it’s so familiar to us. It’s also 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.180
dramatic and violent and the stories associated with it 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.350
just really fire my imagination.” (off screen) “So tell us, where 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.520
can we learn more about the moon.” (Thaller) “Well I would say if you want to go through some of the 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.690
 best images NASA has of the moon, go to the LRO website. That would be 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.830
NASA.GOV/LRO for Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.960
Look at the Apollo landing sites. Look at the giant mountains on the moon. Have fun

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:02.060
fun exploring your closest neighbor in space.

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:06.150
(off screen) “Thank you so much for joining us.”(Thaller) “Great to be here today. Enjoy

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:07.990
the supermoon.”
