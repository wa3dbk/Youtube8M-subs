Hi, I'm Karen for Expert Village. You'll need
some plastic bags or plastic wrap to keep

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:12.350
your prepared fondants moist, not dry. A ruler
is handy to have for measuring and keeping

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:18.400
things straight if you want to do straight
cuts. A rolling pin. It's handy to have a

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:24.460
small rolling pin and a large rolling pin.
When you're covering the cake, you'll want

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.940
the large rolling pin and when you're doing
small decorations, you'll want the small rolling

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.090
pin. This particular one I picked up in a
craft shop for rolling out clay and stuff,

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:36.920
but it works great for the fondant. This is
a tool that they use to smooth the fondants

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.399
and you'll find that in the cake decoration
center of any craft store or where ever they

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:43.370
sell cake decorating supplies. It's not necessary,
but it's a very handy tool. So I added it

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.190
here. Some spatulas are nice to have to help
placement or picking up the fondant. Those

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:58.459
come in handy too. An assortment of cookie
cutters are great to have. Flowers, stars,

00:00:58.459 --> 00:01:05.230
any kind of shapes that you like. I picked
these heart ones to use today. You'll want

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.530
some food coloring to color your fondant.
Fondant comes white. And you add food colors

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.110
to color it. I don't recommend using the liquid
colors that you find in the grocery stores

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.430
because they'll moisten the fondant too much
and make it sticky and hard to work with.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.930
These are paste colors. And toothpicks are
for putting the color into the fondant, which

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:28.800
you'll see. We'll also be using confectioner's
sugar , which we use to dust the board when

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.040
rolling so the fondant doesn't get sticky.
You'll need some, this is shortening. A vegetable

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.307
shortening or a margarine. It's better to
have it without color, so if you're choosing

00:01:33.307 --> 00:01:37.300
a margarine, choose one that is pretty colorless.
Not one that's dyed yellow a lot. Because

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:45.660
you'll use that to soften the fondant. Sometimes
the fondant gets too dry and you want to soften

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:53.370
it. Plus you'll see how we use it as we go.
And finally water is important to have. A

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:56.340
little bit of water and we use this as glue.
When you're sticking flowers or shapes or

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.610
your design elements onto each other, you
just use a tiny bit of water to stick the

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.950
pieces together. I think we've covered everything
and now we're ready to get started.
