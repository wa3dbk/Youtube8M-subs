00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:27.890
Well we have to open it. Okay. Here we go.
Yeah, good! Look at the yummy meat. So we've

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:36.410
opened the coconut like this and you want
to try and get the meat out in as big of pieces

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.250
as you can because we are going to be cutting
it up into little rounds as mozzarella. So

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.329
here I am just going to show you how to do
this Nili. You take the spoon and you kind

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:59.399
of try to slide it between the coconut flesh
and the shell and you try to be very careful

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:17.869
to not break the coconut meat. Let me see,
doing a great job. Of course I cut it so many

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:26.460
times. All these pieces of shell every where.
A way to select a coconut or determine if

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.040
it is ripe. We get whole cases of them. There's
the whole piece of flesh out of a coconut.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:47.170
Do you want to give it a try? Yeah, okay.
Try that. There you go. With a little practice

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:58.000
it gets easier. You are doing great. Look
at that. Do I have a job? Yes! When can you

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:16.010
start. We do a lot of this. It smells so good.
There's

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:25.819
pieces of shell. They just come right off.
That's okay; pull it off. You clean it. I

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:36.620
usually rinse it pretty good with water and
you know that is opening the coconut. So next

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.340
we are going to assemble the Caprese Salad.
