00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.180
Walter: Janet, I absolutely love the idea
of this recipe, the smell of this recipe,

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.180
the look of this recipe.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:16.200
Jan: Well, this is one of those really classic
things that it's so hard to mess up, but this

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.900
is balsamic chicken.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.380
And we start off like you do with so many
super easy, fabulous dishes.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.359
We're going to brown off the chicken.

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.640
Now this was boneless and skinless, so we
had to give it a little bit of help.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.640
Walter: Right.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.640
Jan: We used a little bit of olive oil.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:30.640
Walter: Right.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.640
Jan: And let it get nice and brown on both
sides.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.920
Walter: And don't worry about cooking it through.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.920
Jan: No.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.920
Walter: Just get it nice and brown.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.920
Jan: That's right.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.010
We will finish it up later, but you do want
the color.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:38.010
Walter: Yes.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.050
Jan: And into the same pot I dropped a couple
of sliced onions.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.250
Walter: Which are already starting to brown
off.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.250
Jan: That's right.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.750
Walter: Getting some carmelization to give
a little sweet to this.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:50.720
Jan: That's right and now if you're going
to do this at home, you want to let this go

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:51.720
a little bit longer.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.850
You want more color than we've got here, but
we're in a hurry.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.310
Walter: Well, we could come back at the first
commercial on the Young and the Restless.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.399
I guess that wouldn't be a good idea.

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:01.519
Jan: Well, probably not.

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:02.519
All right.

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.120
Now we were talking about the difference and
different kinds of balsamic vinegar.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.820
Walter: You have to find one you like.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.560
Jan: Find one that you like.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:12.180
Walter: Because there's an enormous difference
from one to another.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.030
Jan: And you can't necessarily go by price.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.110
Walter: No, oh, no.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.340
Jan: There are really fine, high end specialty
vinegars that this is not one of those.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.340
Walter: Yes.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.340
And for this case you don't really need that
super high end.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.340
Jan: So when you're shopping in your grocery
store.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.450
No, it would be wasteful.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.380
Walter: Like the one I was telling you about
that I have at home that I put on strawberries

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.380
with an eye dropper.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.380
Jan: That's right.

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.409
You don't want to do that for this dish but
taste the ones first.

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.100
Walter: Find the one that you like and then
stick with it.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.770
Jan: That's right because we're going to reduce
this a little bit and that flavor is going

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.770
to get more concentrated.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.000
So if you don't like it to begin with, you're
really going to hate it at the end.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.159
Walter: Now the concentration I found with
balsamic vinegar actually increases the sense

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.380
of sweetness in the vinegar.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.380
Jan: Oh yes.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.380
Yes, it does.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.380
Walter: Okay.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.380
Jan: I love vinegars.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.380
They're one of my go-to favorite ingredients.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.380
Walter: Absolutely.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.500
Jan: I just love what they do.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.320
So a can of tomatoes, and I like the little
ones.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.930
I like the petite diced tomatoes.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.450
I think that they're just nicer.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.450
Walter: Whatever.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:05.450
Jan: They are.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.450
They're nicer.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.450
Walter: Okay.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.450
I've been known to use them.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.900
Jan: Well, honestly when you have the larger
ones, the kids look at it and they'll freak

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.510
out and they say, "What is this?

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.870
Is that a tomato?"

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.660
But if you've got this you don't get the freak
out.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.320
Walter: This is one if the kids didn't eat
it they'd be weird.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.060
Jan: My kids are weird.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.080
That's just the way it is.

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.080
A teaspoon...

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.240
Walter: Oh, I didn't mean to have your kids
in mind when I said that.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.480
Jan: I did.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.020
So a teaspoon each of thyme and rosemary,
oregano, and basil.

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.620
Walter: And there is no wonder it smells good
in there.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.620
Jan: That's right.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.500
Walter: With that combination it could not,
not smell good.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.980
Jan: That's right so we're putting these guys
back in here.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:41.660
Walter: Work them down in there a little.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.270
Jan: Get them down in there, and if you've
got the juices that collected, don't waste

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:46.270
that.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:47.440
That's like liquid gold.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.750
Walter: Now about long does it need to cook
because we're about how long to be gone?

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.340
Jan: Well, I'd give it about 20 minutes.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.340
Walter: About 20 minutes.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.500
Jan: And then I serve it over pasta, but this
is what we end up with.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.370
Walter: Oh, or rice or almost anything.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.720
Write in and get the recipe.
