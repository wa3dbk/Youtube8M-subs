00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You can heal your life

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:38.900
Resentment, criticism, guilt are the most damaging patterns.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.100
The release of resentment can even dissolve the cancer

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:54.000
When we really love ourselves, everything works in our lives.
We must release the past and forgive everyone.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:11.100
I find that resentment, criticism, guilt and fear cause more problems than anything else

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:21.000
These four things are causes of our main problems in our bodies and in our lives.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:35.000
These feelings arise because we blame others, and we accept responsibility for our own experiences

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:45.000
Really, if we are all one hundred percent responsible for everything that happens in our life, then there is no blame.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:58.300
What is happening There, in the externally, it is only a reflection of our own inner thoughts.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.000
I am not condemning bad behavior of others,
but our beliefs, that attract people who will treat us that way.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.300
If you find yourself saying, 'Everyone makes me such a thing, I criticize, do not support me, use me as a mop, abused me, then this is your pattern.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.800
There is some thought in you that attracts people who exhibit this behavior,
when you stop thinking this way, they will go elsewhere and we will do that to someone else.                                     you will no longer attract them!

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:37.000
Some results of patterns that manifest physically present:
The long harbored resentment can erode the body and become a disease we call cancer.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:47.400
Criticism, as a permanent habit, often leads to arthritis in the body.
Guilt always seeks punishment and punishment causes pain.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:03:00.000
Fear and tension that occurs can create things like baldness, ulcers and sore feet.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:11.300
I discovered that forgiveness and release of resentment can dissolve even cancer.
While this may seem simplistic, I have seen and what I have experienced in my work

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:24.300
We can change our attitude toward the past.
 The past is gone.
 We can not change it.
 However, if we can change our thoughts about the past.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:35.600
to punish silly at the moment because someone hurt us in the distant past!

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:47.400
People with deep patterns of resentment I say: Please, try to dissolve the resentment now, when it is relatively easy.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:01.800
Do not wait until you are under the threat of surgeon's knife or your deathbed,
 when you can also have to face the panic.

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:12.700
when we are panicking, it is a real problem focus our mind in the healing work.
Before we need to give us time to dissolve fears.

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:23.000
If we choose to believe that we are helpless victims and that everything is useless, then the universe will support us in that conviction, and we will go down the drain

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:33.800
It is vital that we release these ideas and outdated and negative beliefs that support us and nurture us.
Even our concept of God must be one that is for us, not against us

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:45.000
To release the past must be willing to forgive.
Every time we get sick we should look into our hearts to know whom we should forgive.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.000
In this concept I would add that person to whom it is more difficult to forgive is to release more need

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:04.000
Forgiving means letting go, release.
 It has nothing to do with forgiveness behavior.
 Just about to release all, you do not need to know how to forgive.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:15.000
All you need to do is be willing to forgive.
The universe will do so.

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.600
We understand very well our own suffering, but how difficult it is for most understand that they, anyone who most need to forgive, also suffered.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:31.300
We need to understand that they did the best they could with understanding, awareness and knowledge they had at that time.
