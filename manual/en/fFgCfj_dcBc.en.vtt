On behalf of expertvillage.com I'm Eric Williams
and I'm here to talk to you about beginning

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:15.230
harmonica. Okay, now that we've learned to
play scale we're ready to maybe try some songs

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:22.609
in what's called straight harp. Straight harp
is the more traditional old time songs, campfire

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:28.390
songs, cowboy songs, folk songs, they're almost
always in what they call straight harp. What

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:34.039
that means is you're taking the harmonica
and you're playing a song in the same key

00:00:34.039 --> 00:00:39.440
as what the harp is labeled. This is the G
harp so you play a song that's hopefully in

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.420
the key of G and you use a lot of the same
notes of the scale that I just played earlier

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.789
and what you do is you hopefully play single
notes whenever possible and you play the melody

00:00:49.789 --> 00:01:27.330
of a song in just a nice plain straight forward
honest heart felt manner. Let me try to demonstrate,

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:50.630
see if you know this song. So, I did that
in mainly single notes but there were a couple

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.230
of places where I harmonized on purpose so
it wouldn't just be all single notes all the

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:59.040
way through. I tried to put a little bit of
flavor on a couple of those. The famous song

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:05.240
of Shenandoah. So that's one of the most commonly
played on a harmonica. That's a pretty good

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.310
example of straight harp I hope it helps.
