00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:07.390
This web cam was deployed on an ice floe at
the North Pole in spring of 2013.

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.570
Web cam images track the snow cover, weather
conditions, and the instruments that are seen

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.010
in the camera images.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.689
The web cams normally operate during the Arctic
summer warmth and daylight (from April to

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.279
October).

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:26.570
Due to the wide angle lenses used in the camera,

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.570
objects such as the ocean-atmosphere buoy
are closer to the camera than they appear.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.100
The lens may be covered by fog and rain in
the spring.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.659
Melt ponds are a normal part of the seasonal
cycle of Arctic sea ice.

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:13.189
In summer, solar heating melts the snow cover

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:17.659
and 4 to 20 inches of the upper surface of
the sea ice,

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.950
forming fresh water melt ponds that lie on
top of the sea ice

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.079
with their surfaces slightly above sea level.

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.780
This web cam was located in a relatively low
spot in the ice,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:34.619
with a greater than average snow thickness,

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.540
both of which contribute to the formation
of the melt pond.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.680
From the location of the small ridge beyond
the far edge of the melt pond,

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.680
scientists estimate that the far shore of
the melt pond is 65 to 165 feet from the web

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:52.939
cam.

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.090
At the buoy, the melt pond is about 15 inches
deep.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.950
On July 27, the melt pond was full.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.689
The next day, it was completely drained.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.110
When the surface of the melt pond rises above
the freeboard of the ice floe,

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.200
melting will often penetrate the bottom of
the melt pond at the thinnest point,

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.060
causing the pond above the ocean line to drain,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.060
often quite abruptly.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:33.720
The lens may be covered by snow and ice as
winter approaches.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:17.540
The ship in the background is the KV Svalbard.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:23.380
Scientists aboard the ship recovered the web cams
and instrumentation on September 20.
