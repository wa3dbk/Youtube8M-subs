00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:10.440
Heavy duty trucks literally carry the world
on their backs.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.010
They are impressive machines created with
precision, the sum of many parts designed

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:23.090
to work together like a well-tuned orchestra.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.939
But all parts are not created equal.

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:27.830
Some parts are not what they look like.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:38.670
There may be many copies out there, but there's
only one original.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.770
We at Teleparts take pride in providing ONLY
original parts for heavy-duty trucks, trailers,

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.149
tractors, off highway equipment and much more.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.720
For more than 50 years we've been delivering
name-brand genuine parts from leading U.S.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:58.840
manufacturers to heavy duty truck part suppliers
and truck fleets around the world.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:06.490
Original parts are more reliable, they last
longer and pricewise they are not more expensive

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.470
than all the "will-fit" parts that are in
the market.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.670
People think that if they will buy a cheap
part they will save money.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.530
Actually they don't.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.040
Their downtime is much longer than the one
who uses the genuine parts.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.399
We supply original parts for American made
Heavy Duty Trucks and Buses such as Freightliner,

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:37.649
Western-Star, Volvo, Navistar, Mack, Oshkosh,
Kenworth, Rio, Autocar, Thomas Built Buses,

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.200
as well as Military on/off Highway Trucks.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.920
Our vast computerized library can track even
the hardest-to-find parts and make it available

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.950
for immediate shipment.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.600
Our packing experts can consolidate orders
and pack to the client's specifications and

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.799
requirements.

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.570
We look at each customer and every order in
an unique way.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.630
If the customer wants us to ship via air this
week, fine, we can ship via air.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.970
If they want us to consolidate his order so
we can make container shipments, we can do

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:09.970
that.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:10.970
For them.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.870

regulations all over the world.
