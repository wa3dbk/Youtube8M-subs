00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.260
Hello, I'm Chita Johnson, and I'm going to
teach you how to walk and turn on the runway.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:12.089
This is basic runway. I'm here at John Robert
Powers in Ontario, California, and I've been

00:00:12.089 --> 00:00:18.070
teaching 3 year olds up to 50 year olds for
20 years, so if there's one thing I know,

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.820
I know how to teach walking and turning on
a runway. I'd like to start with stepping

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.270
up on the runway. You can practice this at
home or anywhere that you have a step. So

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.200
I'm going to start right here at the side
of the ramp and I'm just going to show you

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:41.350
how important it is to focus into your camera,
then to take your right foot and step up onto

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:47.390
the ramp. The reason I'm using the right foot
is to block the inner-part of the body, the

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:53.890
crotch so-to-speak. It's really not professional
to step up with the outside leg. So anytime

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.450
you're facing an audience in any type of performance,
especially modeling, you want to be poised

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:07.030
and graceful. It's so important that you put
the outside leg up in front of the audience.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.509
What I'd like to do is make sure that you've
got your toes totally to the side of the ramp

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.299
or the step because you also don't want to
stand back to where you're lunging in. That's

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.960
not graceful as well, it over-strides your
step. So I'd like for you just to stand right

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:27.299
at the edge of your step, right at the edge
of the ramp. Take the right foot and bring

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:35.580
it gracefully up to the ramp and move up.
Notice that when I do that I don't bounce.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.719
There's no bounce in the step. What I want
you to do is just gracefully get your toes

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:48.790
close to the ramp and step up without a bounce,
very graceful, very poised. I can do it backwards

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:55.630
as well because that trains my body to stay
poised, graceful and smooth without a bounce.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.810
Notice that all the strength is coming from
my knees, the strength is not coming from

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.130
my back. I'm not curling my shoulders to add
to, and I'm not moving my arms with my elbows

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.890
bent to give me strength to get up. This is
the way a lot of people take stairs because

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.530
it gives their body strength to get up. Well
I'm a model and I'm already pretty strong,

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.000
so to prove my strength, I'm going to maintain
my posture, pull in my stomach muscles which

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.230
expands my chest so that it gives me strength
by leaving my hands flat to my side, fingertips

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:37.000
lightly touching the thighs, and just gracefully
put my foot up on the ramp, slowly but surely,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.890
gracefully stepping up and down so there is
no bounce in my step. That's so important

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:53.120
for your first appearance when you're approaching
the ramp. That's how we approach the ramp

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.790
gracefully.
