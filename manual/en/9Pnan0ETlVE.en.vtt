"Dead Meat Bacteria Endotoxemia"

00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:06.409
These findings of inflammatory compounds

00:00:06.409 --> 00:00:08.509
in animal foods and fermented foods

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:11.312
"...therefore suggest that 
apparently unspoiled foodstuffs

00:00:11.312 --> 00:00:12.942
may nevertheless contain,

00:00:12.942 --> 00:00:15.317
at some point in their 
preparation or processing,

00:00:15.317 --> 00:00:16.767
a sufficient microbial load

00:00:16.767 --> 00:00:18.847
to release endotoxin receptor stimulants

00:00:18.847 --> 00:00:20.988
into their growth environment."

00:00:20.988 --> 00:00:23.666
This notion is supported 
by many previous studies,

00:00:23.666 --> 00:00:26.426
showing that certain commonly 
consumed foodstuffs

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:29.713
can contain a high bacterial 
load before cooking,

00:00:29.713 --> 00:00:30.773
such as fresh hamburger,

00:00:30.773 --> 00:00:32.473
which has often been shown

00:00:32.473 --> 00:00:37.654
to contain approximately a hundred 
million bacteria per quarter pounder.

00:00:37.654 --> 00:00:39.832
Notably, however, the 
purpose of the present study

00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:42.942
was not to examine the 
microbial quality of each foodstuff,

00:00:42.942 --> 00:00:46.981
since the pathogen associated 
molecular pattern, biological activity,

00:00:46.981 --> 00:00:48.771
is retained independently

00:00:48.771 --> 00:00:51.373
of bacterial viability or cooking.

00:00:51.373 --> 00:00:54.293
Meaning, the bacteria can be dead,

00:00:54.293 --> 00:00:55.813
the bacteria can be cooked,

00:00:55.813 --> 00:00:58.539
but their endotoxins are still there.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.769
You can boil meat for two hours straight,

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.889
dip it in an acid bath (like our stomach)

00:01:05.889 --> 00:01:08.467
and expose it to digestive enzymes.

00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:12.103
Bacterial endotoxins were 
found to survive both cooking,

00:01:12.103 --> 00:01:16.473
and our bodies’ best attempts 
at acid and enzyme digestion.

00:01:16.473 --> 00:01:18.333
This led them to speculate

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:21.713
that “the occasional ingestion of 
meals high in bacterial endotoxins

00:01:21.713 --> 00:01:25.295
could promote transient, mild, 
systemic inflammatory episodes

00:01:25.295 --> 00:01:27.885
that predispose subjects 
to the development

00:01:27.885 --> 00:01:30.515
of atherosclerosis 
and insulin resistance,

00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:33.254
which can lead to diabetes."

00:01:33.254 --> 00:01:36.041
The animal fat may play a profound role

00:01:36.041 --> 00:01:38.681
in the pathogenesis of this 
after-meal inflammation

00:01:38.681 --> 00:01:41.301
by increasing the absorption 
of the endotoxins.

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:43.654
That's where the animal fat comes in.

00:01:43.654 --> 00:01:48.513
Since endotoxin has a strong affinity 
for the saturated fat transport system

00:01:48.513 --> 00:01:51.118
through the gut wall and 
into the blood stream.

00:01:51.118 --> 00:01:54.108
So animal fat may play a role

00:01:54.108 --> 00:01:56.091
in boosting endotoxin absorption,

00:01:56.091 --> 00:01:58.224
but the primary reason all those studies

00:01:58.224 --> 00:01:59.394
show increased inflammation

00:01:59.394 --> 00:02:02.554
from animal foods, but 
not from most plant foods,

00:02:02.554 --> 00:02:06.877
may be the load of dead 
bacteria in animal products,

00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:09.982
which release endotoxins that 
are absorbed into our system,

00:02:09.982 --> 00:02:12.492
leading to the endotoxic inflammation

00:02:12.492 --> 00:02:18.842
we see after meat, egg, and 
dairy consumption as well.

00:02:18.842 --> 00:02:21.712
So, now that we know what's going on,

00:02:21.712 --> 00:02:24.058
what do we do?

00:02:24.058 --> 00:02:26.528
(From a 2012 follow-up...)

00:02:26.528 --> 00:02:31.018
Well, the most obvious solution 
to this metabolic endotoxemia

00:02:31.018 --> 00:02:33.785
appears to be to reduce 
saturated fat intake,

00:02:33.785 --> 00:02:36.565
which in the U.S. is mostly 
from cheese and chicken.

00:02:36.565 --> 00:02:38.972
But, the researchers fear,

00:02:38.972 --> 00:02:42.182
"the Western diet is not conducive 
to this mode of action.

00:02:42.032 --> 00:02:47.606
It's difficult for patients to 
comply with this request."
