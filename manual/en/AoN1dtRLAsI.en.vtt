00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.210
Today in our 2000 Volkswagen Beetle, we'll
be installing hinge hitch Part #60902.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:11.429
Now, before we begin our installation, here
are a few measurements to help you when selecting

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.530
accessories such as a bike rack or a cargo
carrier.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.550
From the center of the hinge hitch hold to
the outer most part of the bumper is 5.5 inches.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.690
From the top of the receiver to the ground
is 7.25 inches.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.000
Now, let's go ahead with our install.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.670
To begin our installation, underneath the
vehicle here, we'll need to remove the exhaust

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.230
hangar bracket.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.050
We'll then need to remove the clip holding
the exhaust shield on the vehicle.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.690
Now this vehicle is equip with an aftermarket
exhaust so your exhaust may look slightly

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.690
different.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.140
We'll now go ahead and bring the exhaust hangar
bracket down and bring it out of the way allowing

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.650
our heat shield to come down.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.940
Here on the passenger side, our mounting location
will be the toe hook.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:03:13.239
There is a custom bracket included with the
trailer hitch as seen here.
