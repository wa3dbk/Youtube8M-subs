00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I used a tent for mountain climbing of the lightweight type using the moisture-permeable material Gore-Tex in the snowy mountains.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
At 6:30 a.m., it is base camp of the Yatsugatake.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The temperature in the tent -18.3 degrees Celsius (-0.94 degrees Fahrenheit).

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The Yatsugatake is cold according to rumor!

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
But it is not cold because there is me in a sleeping bag.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
A lot of snow went down last night.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
A lot of snow is piled up on the top of the tent.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:59.000
When even if it is moisture-permeable material, an inner wall has frost …

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Moisture-permeable performance does not function at all.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It is full of frost in the tent.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:21.000
I saved it so much.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000
I will take the outside temperature later.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Because the tent is -18.3 degrees Celsius (-0.94 degrees Fahrenheit), is the outside less than -20 degrees Celsius (-0.4 degrees Fahrenheit)?

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
The weather is excellent.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:02:22.000
It is the snow which fell last night.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I put a watch made in Casio for a measurement outside.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
A temperature indication part shows a measurement limit bottom.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Will と be that it says -20 degrees Celsius (-0.4 degrees Fahrenheit) as follows to say?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
As for the thermometer of this watch, -20 degrees Celsius (-0.4 degrees Fahrenheit) is a limit value of the measurements.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:55.000
After all -20 degrees Celsius (-0.4 degrees Fahrenheit) is to say as follows.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.000
I withdrew by a tent at 9:00 a.m.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It snowed again when I did so it.
