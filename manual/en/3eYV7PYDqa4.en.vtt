00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:06.520
My name is Ben, and I served in
the Gulf War in the United

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.620
States Army with the 82nd
Airborne as a Tank Unit.

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:13.690
It's not like a Hollywood
picture.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.290
People are getting hurt there,
you're seeing real blood.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.760
Now you're going, oh, God,
I hope I don't get hit.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.935
You're praying that
you don't get hit.

00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:22.150
You have to be brave for your
other troops, because you've

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.530
got to back each other up.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.640
But when you see somebody fall
down and get hurt by getting

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.000
shot, that's when it
all comes real.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.920
I still think about it from
time to time, too.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.130
I was still going through
problems.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.560
I was seeing doctors
in the military.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.150
I fell off a tank and I
fractured my back, but

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.960
I made it out OK.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.970
I came out in one piece,
but my mind didn't

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.970
come out in one piece.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:52.990
I was on light duty because of
my injuries, and then I had to

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:55.980
retire in '98.

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.010
When I got out of the Service,
I came home and it

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.190
didn't seem the same.

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:06.950
Because once you live a military
life and then go back

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:10.820
home and try to come
back to civilian

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.840
world, it was different.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.810
I was having nightmares,
I couldn't sleep.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.410
I was up at night, all night,
pacing back and forth.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:23.675
Any noise, any backfire or
anything, I was jumpy.

00:01:23.675 --> 00:01:27.260
If I went out, I was always
looking around.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.740
I was really nervous
and still scared to

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.660
be out in the street.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.520
My family is the one
who took me.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.553
They said, there's something
wrong with you, and you need

00:01:35.553 --> 00:01:36.100
to see a doctor.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.890
And it took them a couple of
weeks to get me there, because

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.910
I kept on saying, there's
nothing wrong with me.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.170
I guess I got worse,
because my family

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:44.030
couldn't take it no more.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.410
I went to a regular doctor
appointment.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.846
I hear on the speaker my
name being called.

00:01:48.846 --> 00:01:51.700
I'm like, why is my
name being called?

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.765
When I go to the room, there
are two doctors there.

00:01:54.765 --> 00:01:57.160
They said until you're
ready to go, we're

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.120
not releasing you.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.530
From there on, I was
going to groups--

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.160
in the ward going to groups.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:05.560
I was ready after the
fourth week, because

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.850
they let me go home.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.890
But within two weeks later, I
ended up going back in there

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.890
myself, I couldn't take it.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.850
I was feeling guilt, and then
I wanted to hurt myself.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.590
And at that time, I came back
out after two months.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.520
I stayed with my sister, which
she lives up in the country

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.780
area, which is more peaceful
and quiet.

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.180
So the doctor felt that would
be better for me to go away

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.260
for a little while--
go up to enjoy a

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.280
little country quietness.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.900
Because he felt that when I
first got out, because of the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.710
noise and stuff, that
was [? part ?]

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.780
[? of my ?] trigger.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.870
I was constantly going to
doctors like every two weeks

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.820
until they stabilized me.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.750
They also put me in a group with
other guys who have PTSD.

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:58.140
So we all tell each other our
stories, we all get along, we

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:59.685
all understand each other.

00:02:59.685 --> 00:03:02.860
And I have my counselor and
I have my doctor, which

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.020
constantly look after me.

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.090
If you're afraid
to talk to your

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:08.420
Lieutenant, go to the Chaplains.

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:10.780
Because the Chaplin will guide
you the right way.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.600
The Chaplains in the military,
they keep everything to

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.050
themselves.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.430
They'll guide you the
right way for help.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.130
But I tell them when
you get out, don't

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:19.890
keep it built inside.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:20.970
You got to go seek help.

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.670
You can't stay home, like
I say, in the bunker.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.040
You got to get out of that
bunker, you got to seek help,

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.010
you got to put that foot forward
and try to keep going.

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.100
And the VA does that for you.

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:38.310
It took me awhile, and
I got a lot of help.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.770
And I'm getting better
and better every day.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:46.690
It worked for me, it probably
can work for you.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:47.940
Just give it a try.
