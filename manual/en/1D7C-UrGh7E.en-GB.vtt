00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:06.600
This is Mike. Mike is a family physician based
in Ohio. He likes to share ideas about medicine

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.760
with other healthcare professionals all over
the world using social media.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.080
Mike has his own blog, where he writes about
medicine. He also speaks his mind on his podcast,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.730
on Facebook, and using LinkedIn and Google
Plus.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:25.830
Mike’s Twitter profile is followed by around
fifteen thousand people, many of them other

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:26.830
physicians.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:29.160
Let’s take a look at just one of those followers:

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.079
Here’s Kevin. Kevin is an internal medicine
physician in New Hampshire who writes a blog

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.539
about medical news, that gets millions of
visitors. He has over one hundred thousand

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:43.410
followers on Facebook, Twitter, Google Plus
and LinkedIn.

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.139
One of Kevin’s followers is Anne-Marie.
Anne-Marie is a primary care physician based

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:55.749
in the UK (yes, that’s in Europe! Doctors
are using social media all over the world!).

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:00.869
Anne-Marie writes on her blog, and she posts
on Google Plus, and on Twitter: she has posted

00:01:00.869 --> 00:01:03.100
over one hundred thousand tweets!

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.259
I bet you’re wondering, “How do these
doctors get any real work done?”

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:13.130
Well, the truth is, social media is a CRUCIAL
part of their real work.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:18.240
In fact, right now, healthcare professionals
all over the world are talking and learning

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.090
from each other through discussion forums,
blogs, and all sorts of social media sites

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.490
like Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, LinkedIn
and others.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.280
This is great news for anybody who wants to
learn what doctors are saying about… well,

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.280
anything at all.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.619
Let’s say you’re a medical student studying
cardiology. You can connect online with thousands

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.780
of qualified cardiologists and hear what they’re
saying about the latest treatments.

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.420
Or, let’s say you work for a pharmaceutical
company and you want to know what physicians

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.720
think about your new drug. Are they worried
about efficacy, or safety? If you could hear

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.600
what they say to each other, you’d discover
right away how they feel; and then you could

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.729
make sure you get the right messages to your
customers just when it matters most.

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.909
There are literally hundreds of thousands
of healthcare professionals using public social

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:12.410
media, just like Mike, Kevin, and Anne-Marie.
But the problem is, listening to them isn’t

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:17.709
so easy because their voices are drowned out
by the millions of other people tweeting,

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.780
blogging and commenting online.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.209
In fact, it has been essentially impossible
to isolate the voices of healthcare professionals

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:28.700
using social media monitoring tools, until
now.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.640
That’s why we invented Creation Pinpoint.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.299
Creation Pinpoint is a new service that distills
just the conversations taking place among

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:42.160
healthcare professionals in public social
media, and tells you what physicians, surgeons,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.840
pharmacists, or nurses are saying about your
products or therapy areas. In over one hundred

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.349
countries worldwide.

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:51.290
Here’s how we do it:

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.130
We start with one of the world’s leading
social media monitoring platforms, which is

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:01.390
tracking billions of tweets, posts and mentions
from over seventy million sources online.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:06.180
Then we add the Creation Pinpoint ‘big data’
Engine, which has hundreds of thousands of

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:11.129
healthcare professionals’ social media profiles,
sites and blogs – and it’s growing all

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:17.100
the time! We built it using proprietary algorithms
that index healthcare professionals and at

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.970
the same time, learn about their behavior.
That means, the more profiles our data engine

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.060
studies, the more intelligent it gets.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.049
Finally, we add the expertise of our global
team of seasoned researchers and pharmaceutical

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:35.739
marketing gurus to turn the insights we learn
from healthcare professionals’ conversations

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:40.250
into strategic recommendations that will make
all the difference to your brand.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.420
So, not only can we listen to the right healthcare
professionals, but we can also listen to what

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:50.880
they say about what’s important to you.
Then we turn that into an easily digestible

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.709
report to guide your decision-making.

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.049
To get started, go to creationpinpoint.com,
and tell us what you would like to hear physicians

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:00.939
talking about.

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:05.470
Creation Pinpoint. It’s the fastest way
to hear what physicians really think.
