Hi. I'm Chris Bryce from superservice.com.
I'd like to talk to you about how to keep

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.970
a PC running smoothly. When you're trying
to keep your computer running smoothly, one

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.330
of the main things to keep in mind is that
the software programs out there, for the most

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:19.380
part, that claim to do that for you or to
speed things up, actually, can cause more

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.189
harm than good. So my personal recommendation
is don't add any software to your computer

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:30.009
that claims to make it faster or to make it
better. All those software programs end up

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.520
doing is adding another step for your computer
to go through. And, again, can cause more

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.180
harm that good. The next thing to keep in
mind is in adding programs that might not

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:45.980
be beneficial to you and making sure that
when you upgrade programs, you uninstall the

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.960
previous versions. If you have, for instance,
video player installations that are media

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.740
players that are playing files on your computer
and you have several different versions of

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:00.870
them from version two to version three and
you have version six on there, you want to

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.949
make sure and uninstall those previous versions
if you're not using them. If there's a genuine

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:11.750
need, such as some people who may have Office
2007, and they may keep a copy of Office 2000

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.670
on their computer as well, to make sure they're
compatible with friends and colleagues, that's

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:21.320
fine. But if you generally don't need the
software anymore, then I would say uninstall

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.039
it and just install the newer versions. Those
are two of the main things to keep your computer

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:31.900
running smoothly. The next thing is try to
keep away from downloading software and keeping

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.270
it on your hard drive. You're going to want
to make sure that your software that you're

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.549
downloading, if you don't need it any more,
then you go ahead and get rid of it. But also,

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.509
in your Internet browsing cache, history,
your temporary Internet files, keep those

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:50.139
all down to a minimum because that does actually
affect the way the system itself runs. The

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:55.380
other thing to keep in mind is that when you're
installing your software for the first time,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.579
you're going to want to make sure and put
it in a good location. If you use the default

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:04.439
location of program files, that's terrific
because all the programs get stored in the

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.590
same directory and it's easy for your computer
to access. If you have software programs you're

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.000
installing in different directories all over
the computer in different hard drives and

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.540
that to, then you're going to have problems
seeking the information and trying to find

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:21.120
it. On that same note, with keeping information
on different parts of the hard drive, a lot

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.310
of people tend to want to defragment their
hard drives. My personal recommendation is

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.270
not to do that. It's like a scratch that you
have to itch. It's like an itch that you have

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.030
to scratch. The more you scratch it, the more
you feel that you have to. The same thing

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.490
with defragmenting; the more you defragment,
the more the computer feels like you have

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:44.460
to defragment and that actually can slow your
computer down. I personally have never defragmented

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.410
any of my computers and they're running flawlessly
and very quickly because I don't have any

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.820
additional software and I don't take any additional
steps that will slow it down. Those are the

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.890
main things to consider to keep your PC running
smoothly.
