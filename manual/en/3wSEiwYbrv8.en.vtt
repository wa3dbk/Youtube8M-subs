00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:20.430
You know the great thing about football?

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.359
It’s that the game has pretty much stayed
the same over all these years.

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.449
I mean sure, the times change and the style
of play from the 60s is very different from

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.000
the 70s which is very different from the 80s
and so on.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.730
Things come and go, like the rise and fall
of the 4-4-2, and new goal line technology,

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.620
and the outrageous belief that English will
win another World Cup while there are still

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.649
teams like Italy and Germany.

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.290
But the fundamentals of the game remain the
same.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:01:01.299
Now as for football videogames, yeah, they
have seen some changes, to put it lightly.

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:06.820
Champions World Class Soccer, a game from
way back in the videogame fossil record, is

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.490
an example of these changes.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.210
I wouldn’t say it’s from as far back as
the video game Triassic period with the 2600,

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.329
but definitely late Jurassic.

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:28.140
Going back shows just how far we have come
to reach the sports games of today.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.860
From the title you may have reasoned that
the game is all international football.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.780
There are no club teams, all national teams.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.390
There are a pretty decent amount to choose
from, all with their own ranking.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:44.620
You have Uruguay, France, Great Britain, not
England, United States, Brazil, Italy, and

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:48.420
a German team that is amazingly ranked higher
than Italy.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.480
How is that possible?

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.480
Just like other sports games of the time,
it is very limited in terms of game modes.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.520
You have the ability to play an exhibition
match, either against the computer or a friend,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.640
and you are able to enter into a tournament.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.200
The tournament is very fun, playing like the
World Cup, starting with groups then on to

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.340
the knockout rounds.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.790
A major advancement for the genre is here
too, and that is a password system.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.580
If you can’t finish a tournament is one
sitting, you can write down a code and return

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.580
later.

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.310
I know this sounds primitive, but at the time,
wow.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.090
It was amazing.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.730
As for the football gameplay, it is solid
early videogame football.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.120
It is played from a side perspective, which
is how I prefer it.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.480
You can choose your formations as well.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.620
The camera does feel zoomed in a little too
far, making you rely heavily on your radar.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.170
But that doesn’t take away from the feeling
you get when you put one in the back of the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.170
net.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:46.810
It is crazy to see how far sports games have
come.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:52.540
Before there was Be A Pro modes, there was
Champions World Class Soccer, and it is no

00:02:52.540 --> 00:03:01.799
less as entertaining.
