welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:17.580
i'm going to make Teeka chutney. This is very popular and goes with Vada Pav and Teeka

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.730
means spicy and they add little bit of garlic

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.750
nice garlic flavored teeka chutney. For this first roast your peanuts and Til

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.490
seed separately;

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.230
you know till they nicely colored and they're cooked and raw flavor is gone

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.300
you know we're going to take this
roasted peanuts and til seed and make

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.920
it into a fine powder

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.730
now let's see the rest of the ingredients;  for this we are going to use

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.059
coconut powder not grated we have a little bit of jeera powder and chilli powder.

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.270
I also have chopped green chillies, decent amount of chopped garlic and pinch

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:57.989
of hing.

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.020
Now in this add very little oil;

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.119
you do not add too much very little first add pinch of hing and chopped

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:13.560
green chillies and also chopped garlic
and when this getting cooked,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.619
add this coconut powder and we're going
to cook it till it is slightly you know

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:20.369
colored

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:27.930
ok this coconut gets a color very easily; 
now switch off the flame and now you can

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.939
add little bit of cumin powder and chili powder and mix this, you know let

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.259
this mixture cool down and for this chutney try and use the chili powder

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:44.909
which has got a really red color. In this add this peanut and sesame seed powder and

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.930
mix this, add salt;

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.220
it may take one or two minutes just
keep stirring till this salt and all

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.140
these spices mix very well

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.820
This awesome teeka chutney. This is served with vada pav in Maharashtra, in

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.420
Pune wherever you go and ask for vada pav they give chutney

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.640
usually lot of people ask hey little extra on the side along with green chilli.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:12.850
Dear friends try this chutney awesome very tasty

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.060
I'll tell you a little secret, after frying the vada,

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.190
what they do is they take these tidbits
of besan and they make a powder of it

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.780
and then mix with this teeka chutney. So
