00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So we're at FACT, which is the Facility For Animal Care and Treatment

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We are housed within the Environmental Studies Area

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
of the CSU Bakersfield campus.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Behind us we have our display enclosures

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
that are there for the visitors to see.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
And then we also have a section of our

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
rehab enclosures which are the birds that we're hoping

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
will be released out into the wild.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
We had her in the lab a couple of days

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
She came in from an irrigation pipe,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
like one of those big,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
three-, four-foot round irrigation pipes.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Her nest was in the bottom of it, but they flooded it

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
to irrigate the croplands.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
And then probably later this week she'll go

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
back out to the same area she was found

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
So that she and her mate can

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
find a better place to nest.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Basically I'm a student volunteer out at FACT.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I kind of help clean the birds, feed the birds.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
We test fly.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
My time is also spent giving tours

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and giving educational programs to kids

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
so they can learn about the birds we have

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and what we do and

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
what to do if they find a bird.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
I haven't yet been out her for spring

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
but I heard that it can get pretty chaotic

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
because there's a lot of babies.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
I think it's fun. They're really cute,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
even though they can be kind of aggressive

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and want to bite you.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
But they're just so fun and it's

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
cool to see them grow up

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
and be able to be there from the time they're little

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
and be able to release them 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and know that you were able to help that little bird.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
We try to release them where they were found

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
so that way they're familiar with the area.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
A lot of times if we have a farmer bring baby owls

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
that were found on a haystack they they are

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
more than happy to take them back because

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.500
they help with pest control.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.500
I know, you want another one.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.000
You're just going to have to wait.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So these two are younger.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
And they are siblings,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
which is why they are together.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
These two came out of a haystack.
[Owls make hissing sounds]

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000
And usually when we get birds out of a haystack

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
there are four or five, not just a couple.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So we're not sure if the others were older

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
or they just didn't find them yet.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:33.000
[Owls make hissing sounds]

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
[Videographer] The sound they're making is pretty amazing.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
[Marlene] That hissing sound is one of their defensive mechanisms.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
The advantage to having the mice is

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
when they come in and they're really small

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
they know that's food because

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
that's what their mom's been giving them.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
So that when they're released they still have

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000
that familiarity with 'This is the wild food,'

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
'This is what I need to go find,'

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000
once they're released.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
It was found on the side of the road,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
probably got hit by a car.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
[Donna] It's not even fighting it.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
[Marlene] So it's an adult red tailed hawk that has an injury

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000
on its left wing at about the elbow

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
probably in the radius and the ulna, not in the elbow joint.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.000
So what we were doing with Donna,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
who's one of our students out here at the facility,

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
is checking the injury to see if it's something

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
that maybe we can work with to get it to heal

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
so that the bird can be released,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
which ultimately would be our goal.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000
This bird, though, we're not sure.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Because there are a couple of bones

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000
that look like they're exposed with the injury,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
and that is something that's very hard to get to heal

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
so that they are releasable.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Occasionally the ones that are not releasable

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
do become display birds, which all of our birds

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
that are in our display cages are ones that

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
are injured and cannot be released.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
So those are the birds that when 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
visitors come for open house,

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
which we have on April 2,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000
those are the birds that visitors will see

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
are ones that have come in injured

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and are not releasable.
