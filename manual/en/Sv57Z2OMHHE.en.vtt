00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:13.939
Welcome to the 2012 edition of USF St. Petersburg Orientation 101

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:16.510
I'm Scarlett.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.419
and I'm Jacob.

00:00:17.419 --> 00:00:20.119
We're this year's Lead Orientation Leaders.

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.119
There are a few things you'll need to know before your voyage begins.

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:31.109
You should have received a confirmation E-mail

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.520
containing all of the necessary information.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.760
Be sure to read it before coming to orientation.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.500
In order to park in the garage you'll need to print out a parking pass.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:41.940
Don't worry! It's available in your confirmation e-mail.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.310
After you park, check-in will take place in the Peter Rudy Wallace Center for Teachers courtyard.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.320
That's the building closest to the parking garage. Be sure to be on time.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:01:00.240
Next you'll need to head over to Residence Hall One, to drop off your stuff.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.500
When you get to your room, it will look like this, only empty.

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.190
so you'll need to bring things like:

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:14.920
a towel, sheets, a pillow, or a sleeping bag, an alarm clock, and toiletries, like a tooth brush, tooth paste, and shampoo.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.070
For the rest of the day,

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:22.500
your academic advisor and attend a variety or orientation sessions with your orientation group and leader.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.000
Parents and families will be on a different schedule.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.719
We will provide you with breakfast,

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.729
lunch, and dinner, on the first day.

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.000
After dinner, it will be time to say good bye to parents and families.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:33.619
Don't worry!

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.150
They'll be back to pick you up on the second day.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.790
Later that night, students will attend a pool party.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.440
So be sure to bring a swimsuit.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.130
Don't forget your towel!

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.590
On the second day, your orientation leaders will wake you up bright and early for breakfast. So try to get some sleep.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.439
You will also register for classes on the second day.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.569

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:56.000

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.450
