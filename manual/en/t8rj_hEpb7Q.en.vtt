00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:01.480
What's up?

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.480
Welcome to MyTechMethods.

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:12.409
My name is Andy, and this is my full video
review over the ASUS VS238H monitor.

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:17.500
Now this monitor is one of the best monitors
that you can get right now for under $160.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.859
It's currently $159 on Amazon with free shipping.

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:24.550
It's gotten great reviews: an average of 4.5
out of 5 stars.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.460
So at any time during this video if you want
to click the link in the video description

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:31.430
below that will take you to the best price
on Amazon for this monitor so you can purchase

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:32.430
it.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.160
This is a 23 inch full HD LED monitor with
IPS technology so it does support a full HD

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.340
resolution of 1920 by 1080, and it has an
all black finish which looks really nice.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.290
On the back of the monitor you'll see it has
1 HDMI port, 1 VGA port, 1 DVI port, and a

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:51.480
3.5 mm audio jack.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.550
In the box it comes with a power cable, a
VGA cable, and a DVI cable but no HDMI cable.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.750
Now this monitor does not have a built-in
speaker, but I'm not a big fan of built-in

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.829
speakers on monitors so that wasn't a problem
for me.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.300
Some of the features for this monitor include
a slim elegant form factor, very slim.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.520
It's very lightweight.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.690
It's got a 2 millisecond response time for
smooth motion playback.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.190
Since it is LED backlit it is more energy
efficient.

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:20.680
It has a 50 million to 1 smart contrast ratio
for more defined images and dark colors.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.610
It also has a feature called splendid video
intelligence technology which provides quick

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.560
image presents for your display.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:31.100
This is an IPS display which provides some
of the best viewing angles for monitors right

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.650
now currently on the market, and it does produce
very accurate colors as well.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.220
I've been using this monitor for months, and
I can tell you right now that the colors and

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.040
fonts are very crisp.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.020
They look so good on this monitor.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.170
This is a very good monitor if you're a Windows
or Mac user even if you're a gamer or not.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:51.230
I don't play many games, but I use this on
my Mac and I've played some games.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.240
And it looks really good to me.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:58.570
The response time is very high so you don't
get any blur during a high motion game play.

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.270
What's great about this monitor is you can
quickly toggle through those built-in presets

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:03.680
for your image display.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.880
It has theater mode, game play mode, standard
mode, scenery mode, and a couple others.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.260
Each mode looks different and is made to be
suitable for whatever you're doing on the

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.260
screen.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.090
For me I really like the theater mode.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.049
It really brings out the colors, looks really
good.

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:21.019
But most of the time I leave it on standard
because the brightness is a little too bright

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.659
for me on the other modes and I just turn
the brightness down to below 50 on standard.

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.269
That's usually what I have it set at.

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.629
I also like the fact that you can tilt this
monitor.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.569
You can tilt it back and forth and change
the viewing angle for this monitor.

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:34.569
Some monitors you can't.

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.879
It's a fixed angle, but this one does tilt
back and forth very easily.

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.010
The stand for this monitor could be a little
bit better.

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:46.239
It's kind of a small stand and can be a bit
wobbly if you're on an uneven surface or if

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.640
you tend to hit the desk frequently.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.859
But it's not that big of a deal, and I actually
like the smaller stand.

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:55.560
It doesn't take up very much room at all so
I like that aspect of it.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.829
The stand and the bezel of the monitor both
have a glossy black finish to them.

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:04.139
They're shiny, but the screen itself is a
matte screen so you don't get that glare if

00:03:04.139 --> 00:03:06.260
there's a light behind you which is really
nice.

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.840
After months of using this monitor I have
no dead pixels whatsoever, and the screen

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.400
looks just as good as the day I got it.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.349
Now this is an excellent monitor, but if you're
doing high-end graphic design or hardcore

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:20.970
photo editing you probably want to spend a
little bit more money and get a higher quality

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:21.970
monitor.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.200
But this monitor is perfect for people who
want to upgrade to a large high quality HD

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.639
monitor but want to save money and not break
the bank.

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.549
So I highly recommend this monitor for everybody
else.

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:36.390
95% of the users out there will be extremely
pleased with this monitor.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.959
So if you want to get this monitor the link
for the best price on Amazon will be below

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.209
