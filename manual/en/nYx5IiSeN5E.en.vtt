Bonus Fact #1: Her Story was created by Sam Barlow, an early legend in interactive fiction (Aisle) who later moved on to design Silent Hill Origins and Shattered Memories.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:02:04.900
Bonus Fact #2: Viva Seifert, the actress featured in Her Story, has many talents. She's also a former gymnast who competed (without medaling) in the 1992 Summer Olympics and a musician in a band called Joe Gideon &amp; the Shark.

00:02:23.300 --> 00:04:48.400
Bonus Fact #3: In researching Her Story, Barlow read transcripts from the Christopher Porco murder case where a son murdered his parents for the inheritance. Noticing the thread of "money" that ran through that transcript inspired the mechanic for Her Story.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:06:59.100
Bonus Fact #4: The script was originally 300 pages, but when Seifert expressed her alarm at the length, Barlow shrunk the font size and removed blocking notes to shrink it to 80 pages. College students, eat your heart out!
