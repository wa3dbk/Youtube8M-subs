Today, on a 2011 Kia Sorento, were going to
install part number 118506 from inaudible.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.120
First thing well do is were going to remove
the two tail lights.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:17.300
Well remove two screws here and here.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.520
To disconnect the harness, first inaudible
the right here, and pull the part.

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.350
Well put those aside and repeat the same process
over on the passengers side.

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:32.460
The next thing well do is remove this plastic
ring right here.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.690
That fastener will not be reused.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:52.860
Well take the wire harness dropped between
the body work and the body.

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:11.899
