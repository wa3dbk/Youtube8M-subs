Hi, my name's Belinda and today I'm going to show you how to make a payment online

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:15.109
on the Virgin Media website. So if we head over to the Virgin Media website,

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.099
once there

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:23.099
you need to select the 'My Virgin Media' tab on the right hand side of the screen.

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:27.449
If we page down on the next screen, you'll see 'pay online',

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.269
this will take us to the QuickPay screen, now there's two options on this page.

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:35.940
We're going to do the top option, which is make a one off payment with QuickPay.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.140
We're going to select 'make a payment'

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.960
and again, this will give us the QuickPay screen.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.240
This QuickPay screen is a trusted site and is shown by the very sign

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.120
in the right hand side of the screen.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.790
Now you will be requested to put some information in, which you can find on your bill

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.760
or you can find on the e mail which we send you once a month,

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:57.490
to let you know what your bill is ready to view.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:00:59.000
to let you know what your bill is ready to view.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.280
So we need to put the payment reference number in

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.460
and the area reference.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:11.270
Once that information is in,

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.370
you'll be requested to put an e mail address in. This is so we can send you confirmation that

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.370
the payment has gone through successfully.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.490
You can now continue with the payment.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.280
On the next screen, there will be a box to put the amount that you wish to pay.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:41.020
If you can then put your name on the card that you're paying with,

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.790
the card type,

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.530
and the card number.

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:55.530
These are the sixteen digits across the front of your card.

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.840
The expiry date

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:12.840
and the last three digits on the back of
the card.

00:02:12.919 --> 00:02:15.689
Continue with your payment.

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.769
You'll come to a screen which will confirm all the details.

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.689
Continue with 'pay now',

00:02:22.689 --> 00:02:27.149
this was taken to a confirmation screen, which will thank you for your payment

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:32.019
and give you the option to print your confirmation, which you'll receive via e mail as well.

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:33.299
I hope this video's been useful.
