00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.360
LS fest LS power including motorcycles
boss hoss switched over to LS power in

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.690
all of their motorcycles in 2008 and
they have not looked back since

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:35.670
check these things out - 95 is a lot of
horsepower for a bike wing about a

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.200
thousand pounds right

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.850
well how about this one at 445
horsepower or this one here that puts

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:42.150
out

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:48.420
525 horses with just a few modifications
we've even heard rumors of twin-turbo LS

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.100
engines in these bikes that are putting
out an eye-popping 1,000 horsepower

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.890
these boss motorcycles and trucks are
over the top and they're all chevrolet

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.479
LS powered but even with the v8 these
bikes maintain a sleek design which

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.040
isn't easy when you've got an eight and
a half gallon fuel tank but you're gonna

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.600
need that fuel when you're pushing out
about 500 horsepower the boss bikes have

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.460
an air-ride suspension and a BP brake
system which are probably going to need

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.440
especially if you decide to go with the
6.2 liter Corvette engine and upgraded

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:28.110
camp now bosses even making tracks like
this 32 lowboy coupe model with the same

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.840
awesome Chevy LS power is the
motorcycles

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.880
these bikes are insane Chevy LS v8 power
with the ridiculous horse power to

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.789
weight ratio and they look cool

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.539
these boss hoss motorcycles are awesome

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:46.079
