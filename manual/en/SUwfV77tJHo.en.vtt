00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.469
ELON MUSK AND
STEPHEN HAWKING ARE AMONG SOME

00:00:03.469 --> 00:00:04.810
OF THE SCIENTISTS WHO HAVE

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.240
SIGNED A LETTER URGING
RESEARCHERS TO CALM DOWN WITH

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.820
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:11.830
THEY
ARGUE THAT ARTIFICIAL

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.830
INTELLIGENCE, AND SPECIFICALLY

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.630
AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS, COULD LEAD
TO THE DESTRUCTION OF SOCIETY ON

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.650
A WHOLE.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.500
ME GIVE AN EXAMPLE OF
WHAT THE LETTER SAYS.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.500
"IN A

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.470
LETTER UNVEILED AS RESEARCHERS
GATHERED AT THE INTERNATIONAL

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.290
JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE IN WINDOWS ERRORS

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.520
ON MONDAY, THE SIGNATORIES ARGUE
THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF ROBOTS

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.760
CAPABLE OF KILLING WHILE ON
TETHERED TO HUMAN OPERATORS IS

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.080
FEASIBLE WITHIN YEARS, NOT
DECADES.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.510
IF THE VELVET IS NOT

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.540
CUT OFF, IT IS ONLY A MATTER OF
TIME BEFORE THE WEAPONS AND UP

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.180
IN THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS AND
WARLORDS, THEY SAID.

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.180
IF ANY

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.330
MAJOR MILITARY POWER PUSHES

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.720
AHEAD WITH AI INTELLIGENCE
WEAPONS DEVELOPMENT, A

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.579
GLOBAL ARMS RACE IS VIRTUALLY
INEVITABLE, AND THE

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.770
ENDPOINT OF THIS TECHNOLOGICAL
TRAJECTORY IS OBVIOUS.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:58.770
I'M A ñ

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.280
AUTONOMOUS WEAPONS WILL BECOME THE
COST OF TOMORROW.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.390
THIS IS SUPER INTERESTING TO
ME.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.470
THESE GUYS ARE NOT

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.600
LIGHTWEIGHTS, THESE ARE NOT
CONSPIRACY THEORIES.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:12.620
ELON MUSK IS

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:14.530
NOT ONLY THE HEAD OF SPACE X,
BUT ALSO TESLA.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.820
HE IS THE ONLY

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.040
GUY IN AMERICA THAT HAS FOUNDED
TWO DIFFERENT BILLION-DOLLAR

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.040
COMPANIES.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.180
ITíS AMAZING, LET
ALONE JUST THE SCIENTIFIC

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.360
BREAKTHROUGHS THAT HE COMES UP

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.360
WITH.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.170
HE SAYS THAT ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE IN THIS CONTEXT IS

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:32.119
HUMANITY'S "BIGGEST EXISTENTIAL

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:33.119
THREAT."

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.270
HAWKING, WHO IS
CONSIDERED PERHAPS THE SMARTEST

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:42.150
MAN ALIVE SAYS, " ARTIFICIAL
INTELLIGENCE COULD BE THE

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.900
BIGGEST BREAKTHROUGH IN HUMAN
HISTORY, BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.990
MIGHT ALSO BE THE LAST."

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.990
THESE

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:50.770
ARE WEIGHTY STATEMENTS.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:51.770
I
ALMOST

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.610
CANNOT BELIEVE HOW OUT THERE
THESE STATEMENTS ARE, BUT THESE

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:04.380
ARE SMART GUYS, AND THEY ARE NOT
ALONE.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.049
STEVE WOZNIAK, NOAM

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:10.310
CHOMSKY, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OF
AN ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.260
COMPANY ñ

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:13.790
EVEN HE SIGNED IT.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:18.129
I WONDER
IF HE CITED BECAUSE OF MONOPOLY

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:19.129
REASONS.

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:22.239
I DON'T KNOW HIS
INTENTIONS ARE, WHO CARES, BUT

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.529
WHAT I WANT TO DO REAL QUICKLY
IS JUST DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:28.450
THE USE OF THINGS LIKE DRONES
AND AUTONOMOUS WEAPONRY.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:29.450
WITH

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.200
AUTONOMOUS WEAPONRY, IT IS NOT
ATTACHED TO A HUMAN BEING AT

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.109
ALL, IT IS AUTONOMOUS.

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:35.419
WITH
THRONES, WE ALREADY HAVE AN

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:38.489
ISSUE WITH KILLING PEOPLE BEING
LESS PERSONABLE.

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:39.940
YOU ARE IN A

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.069
REMOTE LOCATION, YOU USE A DRONE
AND PEOPLE ARE DYING AS A

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.120
RESULT OF THAT.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:48.519
WITH AUTONOMOUS WEAPONRY, THERE
ARE NO PEOPLE ATTACHED TO

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:52.409
IT AT ALL, WHICH TAKES THE
MORALITY OUT OF SOMETHING

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:55.249
AS SERIOUS AS KILLING SOMEONE.

00:02:55.249 --> 00:02:56.249
WE CANNOT HAVE IT.

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:57.989
THEY ARE
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:58.989
THAT PART IS

00:02:58.989 --> 00:02:59.989
CRAZY TALK.

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:01.329
IF YOU ARE TALKING
ABOUT ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.560
AND AIR CLEANING YOUR HOUSE,
THAT'S ONE THING, BUT THE

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.620
MILITARY IS TALKING ABOUT FIRST
USING THEM TO FIND BOMBS, THAT

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.450
IS OKAY TOO, THOUGH THAT IS

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.450
FIRST.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.150
THEY SHOW YOU HOW THE
ROBOT CAN GO TO FUSE THE BOMB,

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:21.510
AND THEN THEY SAID NOW FOR THE

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.769
SECRET PORTION WILL TAKE THE
DEFENSE SECRETARY BACK WITH

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:25.769
ARNOLD PORTER'S.

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:26.769
FINISH OF THEM

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:28.889
HOW THE ROBOTS COULD KILL
PEOPLE.

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.029
LOOK, IT'S BEHIND

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:36.150
DOORS, AND THERE ARE SOME
ASSUMPTIONS, BUT THESE GUYS

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:37.809
THINK IT IS WHOLLY MERITED.

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:40.180
SEPARATE THE NONKILLING ROBOTS

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.089
FROM THE KILLING ROBOTS THAT ARE
NOT ATTACHED TO HUMAN BEINGS,

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:45.980
YOU HAVE GOT TO BE AGAINST THAT.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:49.999
WE ARE SAYING THAT RIGHT NOW
THERE IS A GUY IN TAMPA THAT

00:03:49.999 --> 00:03:54.010
OPERATES THE DRONE, AND OFTEN
TIMES THEY HAVE SKETCHY

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.010
INTELLIGENCE.

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.010
THEY CALL IT

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:04.229
SIGNAL INTELLIGENCE.

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:06.799
THEY SAY,
THERE IS A CELL PHONE THAT A

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.900
TARGET ONCE USED, WE DETECT IT ON
THE GROUND, WHO IS HOLDING IT?

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.959
WE DON'T KNOW, BUT AT LEAST
THERE IS A HUMAN BEING WHO

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:14.749
PRESSES THE BUTTON.

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:19.550
IN THIS
CASE THERE WOULD BE AUTONOMOUS

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:23.700
ROBOTS WHO ARE KILLING MACHINES,
THERE IS NO MORALITY.

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:24.700
THEY JUST

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.570
GO, I HAVE LOCATED X, OR Y,
OR Z, IN WHATEVER MECHANICAL

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.221
COMPUTATION THEY MADE, THEY

00:04:33.221 --> 00:04:34.770
PRESS THE BUTTON ON THEIR OWN.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:37.210
WE CANNOT HAVE THAT.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.210
THAT IS

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:39.210
CRAZY.

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.190
WITH ALL TECHNOLOGY YOU HAVE
TO DO A COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:46.820
WITH ALL TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS
BEEN DEVELOPED BY FAR, THERE HAS

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.870
BEEN A LOT OF GREAT THINGS THAT
CAME OUT OF IT AND ALSO A LOT OF

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:50.870
ABUSE.

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.010
COMING WITH THE
INTERNET, FOR AN INSTANCE.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.010
A

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.560
LOT OF GREAT THINGS CAME OUT OF
THE INTERNET, A LOT OF ABUSES AS

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.560
WELL.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.680
THE COSTS ARE NOT AS BAD
AS THE BENEFITS, BUT AT THE SAME

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.830
TIME, WITH SOMETHING LIKE
AUTONOMOUS WEAPONRY AND

00:05:03.830 --> 00:05:07.690
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, I FEEL
LIKE THE DOWNSIDES ARE MORE

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:10.010
SIGNIFICANT THAN THE UPSIDES.

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:11.180
LET'S SAY YOU TAKE THE KILLING

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.310
PART OF IT OUT, AND YOU LOOK AT
THE MORE BENIGN PART OF IT,

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:15.660
I GUESS, I MEAN WHAT?

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.040
ARE WE GOING TO HAVE ROBOTS
TAKING OUR JOBS?

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.770
THAT WOULD BE A DISASTER.

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:24.180
TO SOME DEGREE THAT ALREADY
HAPPENS, AND WILL HAPPEN MORE,

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.750
THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT THAT.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.270
IF YOU PROGRAM A ROBOT TO

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:32.490
ELIMINATE THREATS, WHAT IF YOU
DECIDE TO SHUT THE ROBOT DOWN

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:36.030
AND IT TAKES THAT AS A THREAT?

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:37.300
YOU WOULD
BE THREATENING IT.

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:38.310
I HOPE YOU WILL

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.460
PROGRAM IN A WAY THAT IT
DOES NOT VIEW YOU AS A THREAT.

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.560
NOW WE'RE GETTING INTO SCIENCE
FICTION, BUT AGAIN, THE SMARTEST

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.970
PEOPLE ON THE PLANET ARE TELLING
YOU IT IS NOT REALLY SCIENCE

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:48.280
FICTION.

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:51.530
ONCE THEY ACTUALLY
HAVE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, WE

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.380
DO NOT REALLY KNOW WHAT IS GOING
TO HAPPEN NEXT, AND THAT IS

00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:55.380
PRETTY SCARY.

00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:58.200
SO, LET END ON THAT NOTE.

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:01.930
IF YOU THOUGHT OUR HUMAN COPS
WERE BAD, WAIT UNTIL YOU GET A

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:02.700
LOAD OF ROBOCOP.
