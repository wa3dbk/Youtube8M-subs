00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:17.010
[Background: You're looking for coarse flecking
throughout this portion of the wing]

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.730
Khristi: It's a takeoff of the idea of a quilting
bee where people would get together to complete

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:28.550
a project, so we have 40 or 50 people come
in and work together for a week to process

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.320
all these wings, so we call it a wingbee.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.420
[background talking]

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:40.420
Paul: It's the, the last part of a survey
called the Waterfowl Parts Collection Survey,

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:47.730
which is a survey where we ask a sample of
usually 6-8,000 hunters nationwide to send

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.920
in a wing from every duck they shoot and the
tail feathers and wing tips from every goose

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:54.489
they shoot.

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.769
Khristi: So we get the bag of mail that contains
envelopes with the wings in it, and we have

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:04.080
a person or group of people at each site who
is responsible for processing the mail. They

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.540
look inside and see what species it is, write
the species name on the outside and we store

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.100
them in the freezer. And this goes on throughout
the hunting season, and then at the end of

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.520
the hunting season, end of January and into
February is when we meet to process all the

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.050
parts.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.390
Paul: And we get help from a lot of Fish and
Wildlife Service employees, but also from

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:32.390
state agency employees. We can tell what species
composition of the harvest is, so that's one

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:41.090
purpose of the survey, but then the age and
sex information is value added. Age information,

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.290
what we're able to tell from these parts is
whether this was a young of the year bird

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:53.650
or an adult bird. So that gives us a pretty
good index every year of what productivity

00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:00.650
was on the breeding grounds the previous breeding
season, during the spring.
