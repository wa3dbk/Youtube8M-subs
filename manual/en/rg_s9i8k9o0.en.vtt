00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.740
Hey, what's up

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.420
Holy cow, what is going on over here?

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.120
Happy Valentine's Day!

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:13.460
This is great

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.080
Yeah, I just wanted to show you how much I care

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.380
Yeah, it, ah, looks that way

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:20.540
Ahem. 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.920
Oh, right!

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.920
Yeah, hold on, 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.740
Oh yeah!

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.960
Totally gonna be jewelry

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.060
The hell is this?

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.860
It's this week's episode!

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.000
Ah? How to make underwear!

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.580
Ladies underwear

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:39.940
You didn't even make em for me?

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.740
Shoot man, I didn't have the time to make it, plus HR said absolutely NO underwear giving

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.140
to employees, so, yeah.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:56.600
Section 4-3 of the ThreadBanger office code expressly prohibits gifting lingerie or other undergarments to other employees

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.531
Male or Female

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.340
Just watch it, watch it, you're gonna love it

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.240
Hey everybody, my name's Clare Bare

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.540
I have a sustainable  lingerie line called Clare Bare, and I make women's underwear

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.300
When I was in High School, I used to go through the Victoria's Secret catalog 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.480
with my friends and wish that we could afford everything

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.700
We used to stay up all night sewing bikinis and making tube tops

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.280
to got to the beach the whole next day wearing our new designs

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.960
I posted something on Etsy and it sold right away and then I just kind of got

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.580
this thrill out of, you know, making things and having people actually wanna buy them

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.140
The underwear that I design is kind of stretchy, I always work with materials that either stretch or

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.920
that you can use elastic and make them bunchy 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.900
A lot of the underwear that I make is bloomer-style, so it clings to your body but isn't skin tight

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.000
Today I'm gonna show you guys how to make a pair of underwear out of an old flannel

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.200
I got this one at a thrift store. Take the pattern. Just lay it down, right down the center panel

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.900
When I first came up with my pattern I just took a pair of underwear that I liked that I thought fit well

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:23.460
and I took a seam ripper and just took the elastic off and then I was left with this piece that was pretty much

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:24.740
the same as this. 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.400
When I'm cutting this I usually add an inch or two for seam allowance. 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.620
Here it is, and this is what you should have to start with

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:42.960
As you can see, this is the front of the underwear and the buttons go all the way from the front to the back

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:47.920
So, you can unbutton them anywhere along that line if you want

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.700
So it's kind of funny and also a little kinky

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:58.100
This flannel has a little pocket on it too so, I dunno what you could put in there but

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.420
I'm sure you could think of something

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:05.760
So now what I'm doing is cutting the buttons off that are closest to the top edge of the underwear

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.140
So it doesn't get caught in the serger and fly off and hit me in the face

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:12.760
Now what I'm gonna do is use my serger to finish the edges

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.900
You don't really have to use a serger, but I just love my serger so much so I'm going to

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:23.740
But if you don't wanna use that you can just fold over the edge and then just top stitch it

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:26.620
because no one really sees that, it's on the inside anyway

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:34.100
When you get to the top of the button placket, just make sure that it's lined up and not separated

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.840
So it doesn't get all twisted up in the serger

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.400
Where's your sense of adventure?

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.940
Right here

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:46.440
This February

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:47.480
Prepare

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.700
Who is it?

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:52.760
For the day everyone fears

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.960
Do It Yourself clothing that's one of a kind

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:02.520
You're watching ThreadBanger

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.060
Now what you wanna do is take the underwear

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.920
and just flip it inside out 

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:11.200
And line up each edge

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.020
And then just serge right down this side

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.420
Now you have the underwear with the serged edges

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.540
So, what I do next is I flip it inside out

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.300
And...

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.720
It looks like a giant pair of underwear

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:35.900
So now, I'm gonna take the serged edges, fold them over

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.520
And stitch them so that it has a nicer finish and the edges aren't just left raw

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.360
So now what we're gonna do is take elastic and add the waistband and the leg holes to the underwear

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.700
We're gonna use like a purplish-pink

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:03.140
So, when you cut your elastic, you need about 12 inches for the leg holes and then 2 feet for the waist band

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:06.920
So then we're gonna switch to zig-zag stitch

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:13.860
So I'm putting it about I guess a 1/4 inch off of the edge of the underwear

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:17.740
That way there's a little bit of a ruffled-edge to it

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:23.000
What you wanna do is pull the elastic tight, and just make sure you hold it the whole time you're sewing it

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.180
So that when you let go, it bunches up

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.900
I did the waistband and now I'm gonna take a little bit more elastic and do the elastic around the leg holes

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.800
Now you're finished and all you have to do is cut off all the little threads that are hanging off

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:49.180
And you have yourself a pair of flannel, button-down underwear

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:54.120
So now what we're gonna do is go back to our shredded up flannel and

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:57.780
And take what we can from what's left over of it.

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:02.320
I'm gonna take the collar and just cut along the edges

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:07.440
And this is now going to be an accessory to the underwear

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.560
So it's like a little choker.

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.100
And you can wear it as a necklace or you can wear it with your underwear

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:15.860
Whatever you wanna do with it

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.400
If you want you can even cut off the cuffs to the shirt and you can wear them

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:30.240
Happy Valentine's Day!

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:33.180
