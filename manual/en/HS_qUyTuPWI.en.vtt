00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:09.080
Hi, welcome back!
And I've got something really

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.510
cool for all you digital 
camera users out there.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.020
Especially you 
first timers.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.750
This is the 
Pentax Optio E70 Digital Camera.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.820
It's 10 megapixel resolution 
and a 3x optical zoom.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.700
It also has 34 MB 
of internal memory

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.120
but it also has 
capabilities for SD

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.530
and SDHC.
Which means

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.460
you can purchase 
those cards,

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:29.960
load it up in 
the camera

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.340
and take lots of pictures 
on this little thing.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.640
Let's take a 
quick tour.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.920
The Pentax Otpio E70 
comes equipped with

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.340
a bunch of cool  
features like,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.450
Smile Capture and  
Shake Reduction.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.370
Let's get started here.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.950
The on/off button  
is here on the top.

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.520
You can press it  
here, very simple,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.680
next to the 
shutter button.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.160
And if you go 
to the back

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.240
the LCD screen is 
a 2.4 inch LCD.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:55.590
And you have 
all your controls

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:57.530
here on the side. 
This is your zoom

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.700
in and out button.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.110
Which is pretty 
convenient here.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:02.640
And then you have 
your playback.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:03.750
So when you do 
take a photo

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.100
you press the playback 
button here.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:07.210
Your smile and 
face detection,

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:09.950
the smile capture 
feature is right here.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.180
You don't even have 
to fumble through

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.980
any menu features. 
And then you go

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.320
down and 
these are your

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.750
quick function dials.
You have your

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.950
timer capability here and 
you have your macro mode

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.960
and your flash 
selection here.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.460
If you go to 
mode we have

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.230
over 19 shooting modes 
that we can pick from.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:29.700
And what's good 
about this camera is

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.630
you can read on 
the bottom here

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.170
as you scroll 
back and forth

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.840
from the different features 
that you'd like to use.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.140
You have things like, 
blink detection.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.620
Which is a feature 
on this camera,

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.880
where it won't 
take the picture

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:44.950
if you're blinking. 
And it'll give you

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.660
a warning, if the 
person's blinking.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.020
Here you have your Capturing  
Moving Kids mode.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.150
Which we all know 
how crazy kids

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.570
and their activities can be.
And we want to capture

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.500
them in the action.
This actually locks onto

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.230
the subject, as 
they're moving,

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:00.930
and it captures them.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.970
So you also 
have things like,

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.870
your Food mode, 
if you like to

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:07.710
take pictures 
of your food.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.450
But that's all you guys.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.010
You have Panoramic mode 
which is cool.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.250
Let me show you this 
feature real quick.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.080
What I like about 
this mode is

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.790
that you can set and- 
the directions.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.720
So let's zoom out here 
so I can show you

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.720
the panoramic feature.

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:26.660
So we have here, 
we can shoot one.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.240
Right.
Now, it's going to

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.330
set you up and prompt 
you to do the other side.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.170
So if you move it over 
you have a little cursor,

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.770
I'm not sure if you can see it 
too well here on the screen.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:40.310
But you shoot in 
the second mode.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.850
And then you have 
your third capture.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:48.960
Which you line up, and 
this is the third frame.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.860
And you select.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.360
And let's wait as the 
data is being processed.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.430
As most things.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.500
What's great about 
this little camera,

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.630
and I like it, 
is that it weighs

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.700
absolutely nothing. 
Pretty much.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.700
It's 3.9 ounces of 
lightweight camera.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.870
Which you also 
have to be careful

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.580
because you can 
throw it in your

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.460
purse and damage it. 
But there you go.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.120
You've got your 
Panoramic View mode.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.220
We can play it back here 
using our playback function.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.100
And you have all 
the three frames

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.190
that you had captured 
separately.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.390
The camera merges it 
all together for you.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.030
If we take a tour 
here on the bottom,

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:29.730
you have your 
battery case here.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.200
And that's also where your 
memory slot goes.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.800
So don't forget 
that when you

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.070
do get your camera 
and you're like,

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:36.170
"OK where do I stick 
my flash card?"

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.000
It's in there.

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:39.460
You have your port.

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:42.950
Which is the one, one 
port to connect you

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.380
to your charger 
or your PC.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.480
And then you have the 
 little tri-pod stand here.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.930
That you can purchase 
a separate tri-pod

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.930
and have the camera 
in Still mode.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:56.060
This is the 
Pentax Optio E70 Digital Camera.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.630
Perfect for all 
your first timers

00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.400
and for children 
just developing

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:00.700
their knack for 
photography.

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:02.630
