00:00:06.246 --> 00:00:09.627
My name is Schaun Valdovinos and I'm with Hatch Mott MacDonald.

00:00:09.627 --> 00:00:16.418
We're working with Schlaich Bergermann und Partner to design 
 the Boy Scout Bridge. The Wing Tip Bridge.

00:00:16.418 --> 00:00:19.928
So we've come out to site with preliminary drawings

00:00:19.928 --> 00:00:25.042
that show where the foundations will be and the 
 terrain as the surveys picked it up.

00:00:25.042 --> 00:00:30.743
The purpose of this visit is to verify that 
 we feel comfortable with where things are

00:00:30.743 --> 00:00:33.622
and that basically confirms the geometry of the bridge.

00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:40.171
- We adjusted the design because of the steep angle of the landscape here.

00:00:40.171 --> 00:00:46.254
The mass which was on the top of the whole thing at the beginning

00:00:46.254 --> 00:00:50.178
moved it down to here and adjusted it perfectly to match the whole design

00:00:50.178 --> 00:00:52.463
and increased the efficiency of the bridge.

00:00:52.463 --> 00:00:56.909
- The goal of our project was to minimize 
 disturbance to the valley below the bridge.

00:00:56.909 --> 00:00:59.768
There's a little creek that kind of runs down in the bottom here

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:02.694
and that's all going to be kept natural.

00:01:02.694 --> 00:01:07.918
The slopes are pretty gradual with some trails skirting either side

00:01:07.918 --> 00:01:11.622
and so the Scouts will be able to come 
 down and see the bridge from underneath

00:01:11.622 --> 00:01:13.677
in this natural habitat.

00:01:14.536 --> 00:01:17.090
From where we're standing it's going to be about nine stories up

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.093
to the bridge deck and you'll see the 
 cables come in underneath the main deck.

00:01:23.093 --> 00:01:29.745
You can just visualize the Scouts shouting down to each other 
 and shouting up to each other in this wooded area.

00:01:29.745 --> 00:01:31.278
It's pretty exciting.

00:01:31.278 --> 00:01:33.251
- The trails are going to be coming up and down the valley.

00:01:33.251 --> 00:01:35.620
They're going to be awesome when you're crossing that.

00:01:41.717 --> 00:01:43.070
- So we're at the New River Gorge Bridge.

00:01:43.073 --> 00:01:46.760
We're up on the catwalks underneath the roadway.

00:01:46.765 --> 00:01:52.360
This bridge is almost 900 feet above the valley 
 floor while ours will be 100 feet

00:01:52.361 --> 00:01:53.720
so this is obviously taller.

00:01:53.723 --> 00:01:57.050
But it will help us understand

00:01:57.052 --> 00:02:00.210
a Scout's experience being up on those walkways.

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:03.250
On this bridge in particular, it's a highway bridge, 

00:02:03.252 --> 00:02:09.220
so vibrations aren't as big of a concern but when 
 you're walking on the bridge you really feel it.

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:12.650
That's something we're considering on Wing Tip Bridge.

00:02:12.648 --> 00:02:16.530
On the secondary walkways you are going to feel the movement

00:02:16.533 --> 00:02:20.900
but vertical movement is actually more comfortable than lateral movement.

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:24.720
That's why we have the splayed stays at the back

00:02:24.721 --> 00:02:29.610
to stabilize the structure against swaying side to side.

00:02:29.606 --> 00:02:31.640
But you really feel it on this thing.

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:46.300
- I knew during the competition when we saw this bridge

00:02:46.301 --> 00:02:48.580
that we could do something great with the Boy Scouts.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.030
- Well, we just wrapped up our tour of the New River Gorge Bridge.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:02.100
Very educational.  We're hoping to put that all together 
 and put that into the Wing Tip Bridge.

00:03:02.103 --> 00:03:04.840
We'll see you in 2013.
