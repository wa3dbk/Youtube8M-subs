00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.650
This is Fieldsports Channel News.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:13.120
Hunt saboteurs have beaten a huntsman unconscious.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.860
In this latest attack by masked antis, Tedworth
huntsman Mike Lane was spat on, knocked to

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:23.730
the ground, and was later treated for concussion
and broken teeth. The Government has no plans

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.850
to require hunt saboteurs to remove their
masks unless asked to do so by a police office

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.980
with the written endorsement of a senior police
officer.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.730
Many said it couldn't be done, but they're
not the ones driving away in a GBP130,000

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.860
Range Rover.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:45.390
Congratulations to Mark Winser who 'straighted'
the 25 targets delivered by the 120 ft tower

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.370
at Royal Berkshire shooting school in the
The Stratstone Ultimate One Challenge. Mark

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.850
was one of 20 finalists hoping to take the
top prize..and to set off the whole new image

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.360
Mark also won a Rolex.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.530
An ex vegetarian who has started a programme
to teach children to hunt has been hit by

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.420
a wave of death threats by her former friends.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.090
Jen Cordaro, who calls herself 'Jen the Archer',
started a program last year to teach hunting

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.850
and other outdoor pursuits to children. Search

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.770
Louisiana police found a deer hunter who had
been missing for four days in the swamp.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.090
Rob Varnado, aged 42, was separated from his
hunting buddy in the Honey Island Swamp and

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.729
spent four days and nights wandering it in
freezing temperatures. A deputy gave him a

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:39.259
McDonald's meal which he had just bought for
himself, and Mr Varnado recovered.

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.920
The RSPCA is using public ignorance to try
to outlaw mole-catching.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.079
Mole-catchers are often paid by the mole,
and traditionally display their catch on fences.

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:54.370
However, a photograph of dead moles in Denbigh,
North Wales, prompted the RSPCA to “appeal

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.330
for information” in the manner of a criminal
investigation.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.780
Local mole-catcher Mark Horsall points out
the practice is a tradition which shows farmers

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.700
where moles are caught and how many there
are. Happily, the RSPCA backed down after

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.090
it realised this is what it calls an “animal
control issue”. Thanks to Dave Fletcher

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.780
for sending in the story.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:22.080

Well, David, how do we choose a winner out
of the thousands who have entered?Well, I

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.709
have put them on to my phone, which should
be drifting into focus about now, and I am

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.069
going to count down five swipes and stab a
winner.

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:44.349
Five, four, three, two, one - stab! There.
You should know before I do. Let's have a

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.349
look.

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.220
The winner is Rhodri Thomas. Rhodri Thomas
who has a Hotmail address. Rhodri Thomas - we

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:13.989

And finally, this piggy is not so little.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.519
Hunters in Texas have live-captured a feral
hog weighing nearly half a ton. Blaine Garcia

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:30.239
and Wyatt Walton caught and hogtied the 790
pound animal with the help of two bulldogs.

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.440
Already nicknamed 'Boarzilla', it is in a
paddock while its fate is decided.

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.160
