00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:12.800
Hi. This is Bob Peek with Peek Packaging. Today I'm gonna talk to you about

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:13.490
Tuck Top Auto Bottoms.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.100
It will be written down on a description
as a "TTABTM"

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.900
-fancy code words.  Anyway what is a Tuck Top Auto Bottom? You see them a lot

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.150
in chipboard boxes and what are the
advantages of them?  Well let me show you how it works first.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.619
 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.809
The advantage or how they work is
that the bottom is already glued

00:00:32.809 --> 00:00:37.239
so it has a special gluer that will glue the
box this way and then this way.

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:41.180
So that when you're done, when you're
ready to load your product in here, it just

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.829
basically

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.040
snaps, the bottoms already glued

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.180
so it's secure, you don't have to tuck anything  in and you hold a little bit of weight

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.520
and then you get the top set up and it's the tuck top

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.230
for folding it in like this. Click. That is a Tuck Top Auto Bottom and I would say that

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.800
half the boxes we make for retail obligations
are this style.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.440
The reason again for this is the
speed that you can

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.630
lock it into place on
an assembly line

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:13.179
and it's got the security on the bottom.
You wouldn't want to use this if you are

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:16.319
gonna put high graphics on the bottom-you needed that space.

00:01:16.319 --> 00:01:19.649
You can see you still have some space, there is a bar code on here.

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.800
You could put some different things in
here but having like full graphics is

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.160
a little bit tricky. But it sets up nice,

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.500
it sits flat on a countertop like that, and
like I say it's secure. So those are the

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:33.470
two big reasons-speed and security.

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:38.360
Anyway if you think you might need a 
Tuck Top Auto Bottom

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.259
we could

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.119
structurally design one for you
send you the die lines,

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:48.490
you put your art work on it, send it back to
us via electronic emails and we can make

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.450
you a one-off mock-up,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.989
we can make you an electronic little spinning
one to see what it would look like.

00:01:54.989 --> 00:01:58.479
Then we would get you quotes on how much it cost to make them in production.

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.590
So anyway, I hope this answers any question you may have

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.590
but if not, feel free to give us a call
