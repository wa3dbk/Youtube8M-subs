00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
How's everybody doing?

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I wouldn't change anything. This is where I learned how

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
to really appreciate the game, and not take it for granted.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is like the hallway that I used to run down, because we didn't have a track.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The thing is, guys, it's not just about winning Super Bowls.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You know, it's about trying to be the best person that you can be.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I'm from Jackson, Mississippi. Back in '84, uncle took me to the game.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
You know where I'm going. Mississippi Valley, Jackson State University.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.000
We hadn't beaten Jackson in --

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
In 20-something years.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
20 some years. And that felt so good.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm eight, nine years old. I'mma give it to you, eight, nine years old,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.500
and everything in there says "Totten-Rice," "Totten-Rice."

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And I'm eight years old. It's not like it is now.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Kids know everything. They know stats at five years old, everything.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So I'm seeing the signs, everything, and I'm like, asked my uncle,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
"Whose number is Totten-Rice?" He was like, "No, nephew,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Totten is the quarterback, and that guy catching all the balls, that's Jerry Rice."

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
How does it feel to be back in the high school?

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
You know, it feels great. It brings back a lot of memories,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and this is where -- this is where I started, and I feel like I

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
have come full circle now, from starting here on to college

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and to the NFL, and now back here.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And being able to receive a plaque from the Pro Football Hall of Fame

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
and to have you guys be a part of it, too, Allstate Insurance,

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I think it's fantastic, and I get a chance to

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
bring closure to -- my God, a career that's just been amazing.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
How about it one time for the world's greatest receiver

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
in professional football, Jerry "World" Rice.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
I never thought I was gonna get drafted or play in the NFL,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and it sort of like worked out that way, but a lot of you guys here,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
you guys could be lawyers, you could be teachers.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
You can be whatever you want to be. But you have to work at it.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And you always have to give it 100%. Thank you guys, so much.
