00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:06.480
Ok, so now I am ready to actually iron it
and when I do iron it. It's going to lay really

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:13.709
flat and that is because I ran that top seam
on top of the lining and I have the seam pushed

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.750
towards the lining. So let me go ahead and
flip it out so you can see what it looks like.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.250
I probably don't even need to iron it but
I like to iron it really flat it so I can

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:29.779
see exactly what I am working with. You can
see now it just makes that circle really good.

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.910
And this is what it looks like on this side.
See? And it is all pushed out. And we don't

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:39.570
have to worry about trying to push each little
round piece out. And here is our opening and

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.730
we are not going to worry about that to much
right now. But we are going to do is go over

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:53.929
to the iron and iron this flat and mark the
casing for the drawstring. Ok. There we go.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:01:03.629
We just have to run a quick iron on it, it's
not even that big of a deal. I just like to

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:11.100
make it match right there. It's going to look
really nice when I have this done. I am almost

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:20.490
finished. Not to much longer to go. Ok. Now
there we go. Ok, so now that we have this

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.400
I am going to go ahead and start marking where
I want that casing. Lets see I think I am

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.730
going to mark it on this side because I have
this seam right here and I know where this

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:37.450
closes and so I can use this as reference
as pretend like it is just a regular seam

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:45.380
that just keeps going around. And on my casing
you will look at this one. You will see here

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:53.660
that the seam starts at the top of the drawstring
opening and there is another one at the bottom

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.590
and that is an inch. Because, you know these,
half an inch and half an inch we need an inch

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:05.710
of room for them to both fit in there comfortably.
So I am going to just go and mark one and

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.790
a quarter away from the lip. Because that
is how far we determined we wanted this little

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:18.189
ruffle. And then I am going to mark an inch
right there. So that's an inch opening. So

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:22.680
I am going to go all around and do one and
a quarter and then two and a quarter. And

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.810
if you just decided you wanted your ruffle
longer you can just go ahead a measure it

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.769
from there. And this one is actually really
important to mark because if you make this

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:44.069
one just to, to lopsided you will be able
to tell. But even if you have that egg shape

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:49.400
body right now if you go ahead and mark it
exactly the same amount all the way around

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:55.019
then you won?t have that. It will just lay
really nice and straight. Cool. That looks

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:05.640
perfect and it is the perfect amount. Ok.
Now after we top sew this I think we will

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:16.310
go ahead and close, make this closure. Which
won't be hard at all. Ok. But for now we are

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:24.170
going to, maybe for the next clip I will get
on to that sewing machine and I will go ahead

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:37.159
and close. Make this casing on here. Ok. So
there we go I have got a one inch casing all

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.379
around. And now I am going to sit down and
do some sewing and make that casing right

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:42.149
quick. So let's do that in the next clip.
