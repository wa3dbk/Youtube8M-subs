00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.620
They don't have to be tight. Just so that
they don't fall over. There we have the first

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:22.260
plant, and then back to this one. Get the
roots all loosened up. We set it on top of

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:33.620
the soil that we have in. Now I'm going to
add some soil all around. I'm going to add

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:44.890
it in. Turning the pot. I'm getting the soil
on the sides so it doesn't end up being crooked

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:59.989
or uneven. Try not to get too much soil on
the top. I want the level of the soil to be

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:07.729
kind of level from where it was before. I
don't want to bury this plant. If I need to,

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:26.759
I can lift up a little. A little more. Again,
I'm going to turn. It's kind of a messy project.

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:38.159
Best done outside.
Just pack it down a little bit. I don't want

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:43.310
to get it too tight, but just secure it so
it doesn't fall over on me or else we'll have

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:57.350
to stake this one too. We shouldn't have to.
I got a little too much soil on top. Here

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:17.100
we go. Pretty good. Maybe I'll put one stake
in here because this one's going a little...till

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:33.250
it's rooted.

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:34.580
I think it looks pretty nice. Alright.
