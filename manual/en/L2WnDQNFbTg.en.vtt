00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.330
If you cant stand the heat, get out of the kitchen and get grilling,

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:11.330
cheapskate style.

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:17.780
Hey! I'm Jeff Yeager the ultimate cheapskate and host of the Cheap Life.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.130
Here at the house of cheap we grill 
outdoors year round, even when its's ffffff

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.690
freezing outside.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.190
In warm weather, taking the cooking
outdoors has the added benefit of

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.830
keeping your kitchen cool,

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.740
and cutting down on air conditioning
costs. That's a cheapskate double doozy.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.150
Cheapskate double doozy...yeah.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.990
You can skip on the cost of lighter fluid
entirely;

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.070
by using one of these bad boys instead.
Charcoal chimneys are available at most

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.420
home supply stores, or better yet make
your own from an old coffee can

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:56.930
like I show you in this blog post.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.110
Aluminum foil is great for grilling not
only can you steem fish and vegetables

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.110
in foil pouches, but whatever you do, 
don't throw that away!

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.440
Use a rinsed and clean wad of foil to scrub grease and other gunk of your grill.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.560
It's time for a cheapskate shout out! A big shout out to the frugal chef for her sizzling

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.250
youtube channel, filled with all sorts of
great cooking videos.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.870
Make sure you check out her recipe for grilled shrimp and pineapple kabobs.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:28.190
Tropic and tasty!

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:32.620
To maximize tenderness and grill deliciousness while saving money on

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.200
charcoal,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.740
low and slow is the way to go.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.010
Don't use a mountain of charcoal, and slowly cook the food by placing it around

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:44.399
the edges of your grill.

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.130
and keep a lid on it.

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.690
Grilling with the lid on uses less charcoal, provides even more heat for cooking

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.690
and enhances that signature smoky grill deliciousness. ummhmm ummhmm "grunting noises".

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:10.200
If your more of cooking with gas kind of guy or gal you

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.580
can save five or ten bucks by taking
your propane tank to get it refilled at a

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:18.680
local propane supplier or refill station
instead of exchanging

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.400
it for a pre-filled one at the store.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.389
Grilling is a royal way to turn inexpensive ingredients like hamburgers into

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:29.939
a meal fit for a king.

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:35.049
Less costly meats with higher fat content make for some tasty morsoles.

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:40.729
As the fat cooks off it loads of flavor.

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:42.939
Let them eat burgers!

00:02:42.939 --> 00:02:45.269
I'm Jeff Yeager for the cheap life

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:52.269
stay sizzling and stay cheap!

00:02:53.389 --> 00:03:00.389
