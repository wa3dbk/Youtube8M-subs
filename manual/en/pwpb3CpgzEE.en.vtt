Hi! My name is Nate McCullough on behalf of
expertvillage.com. In this clip we are going

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.680
to talk about one of the braking components
that need inspected any time brake service

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.390
is performed. The component we are going to
talk about in this clip is your brake and

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:21.070
rotor. That's this large steel disc you see
here. There are several things that can go

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.380
wrong with this rotor. This vehicle in particular
has been parked for an extended amount of

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.500
time. As you can see there is a large amount
of surface rust all the way around the rotor.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.129
You can actually see where the pads were.
That's where the rotor happened to be stopped

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.019
when I parked the car. This amount of surface
rust is going to ruin the rotor. You will

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:47.719
never be able to machine this out. You might
be able to cut it out but it is going to put

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:53.999
it under specification. There is another problem
you may run across with a brake rotor. If

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:59.899
you do a lot of in town driving. A lot in
town driving requires a lot of stopping. That

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:06.100
can build up excessive heat in this rotor
and cause it to warp. If your rotor is warped

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:15.170
more than .005 you will be able to feel it
when you apply the brakes. The brake pedal

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:21.550
will pulsate. When you apply it, it will push
back at you as the wheel rotates into the

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:27.500
pads and you have them applied that warped
or fat spot will cause a hydraulic pressure

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.680
surge. It will force the pads apart cause
that surge to go backwards through the system,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.300
through the master cylinder and into your
brake pedal. At higher speeds you will also

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.070
notice the warpage when you apply the brakes
in the steering wheel. It may cause the whole

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.890
vehicle to shake and shutter and you definitely
will fill it up front. If it happens to be

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.710
a front rotor, you will feel the vibration
transferred through the steering linkage into

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.310
the steering wheel. Some of them can shake
quite violently. If the warpage happens to

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.310
occur only in the rear of the vehicle, you
will notice it more so in the coming from

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.640
the back of the vehicle. There is another
type of failure you are going to want to look

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.239
for which are any kind of cracks. That again
are going to indicate excessive heat or excessive

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:18.069
wear. If the rotor has been worn too thin
for machine work, it is not able to dissipate

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:23.999
properly. When you machine a rotor you are
actually removing metal, making it a small

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:28.800
thinner part. In my opinion, it under minds
the structural integrity of the rotor. It

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.430
will cause small flake style cracks to appear
all over the surface of the rotor. That is

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.849
one thing you are going to want to look for.
It will indicate a bad rotor and mean it needs

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:37.980
replaced.
