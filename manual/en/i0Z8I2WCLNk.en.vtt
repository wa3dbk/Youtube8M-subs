Hi, everyone. Felix here, at Gurney's.

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.950
Today we're talking about grape care in the late winter season,

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:10.070
some pruning, and also a little bit 
about how to train these plants.

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.070
This is a 4 year old grape vine here.
We've trained the primary shoot nicely.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.030
So your planting would be here, 
You have that cane coming up,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:23.300
It would break a shoot and you'd want to train that,
nice and straight like we have here.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.800
For a single curtain system, 
like we've trained this vine

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.500
(which is really a nice training system 
for mass production, really good productivity)

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.990
basically, we took one shoot and trained it one direction, 
here for this top wire

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.500
and took the other one the other direction.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.100
We have two primary shoots making up our single curtain, 
that are on this top wire.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.900
So this older vine here has a lot of last season's growth on it,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.450
which are these shoots here that are about pencil-thick or a little thicker.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.850
And on these shoots are some buds, you can see here.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.030
They haven't broken yet, but you can see them if you look closely here.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.600
That right there is a bud that's going to break, 
and there'll be a flower shoot off of that.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.500
That's where a cluster will form-- 
is on that new shoot coming off here.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.000
So for pruning, we look along this curtain here.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.780
We have a number of those that have come off last season.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.080
And really, we only want two or three shoots 
to break off of this last season's growth.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.740
So, the pruning approach here is to take these back to--

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.320
one... two... 
we have another bud on the other side, and there's a third,

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.440
but I'm just going to leave two there.
So we're going to trim this back.

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.120
You can see nice, vibrant green tissue there, 
and we have a couple of buds.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.700
And so we want to do that all along this curtain here, 
take these canes from last season back to a few buds.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.730
That's the goal here.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And these low-growing buds--this shoot is growing low, 
and is going to be under the canopy the whole time.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.400
So that's not doing us any good.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.800
Here we have a couple others. That was a little die back...

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.620
...and on the back side here, doing the same thing.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.260
We're going to continue to do that.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.120
This again is growing underneath, 
and that's not where we want it to be.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.580
You can see where we've gotten here, 
on this whole branch here,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.370
this part of the curtain...
we've taken these shoots back two, three buds.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.030
And we'll show later, in another video, 
how the shoots will initiate from there.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.030
And then you'll be able to see how a flower bud develops off of those.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.160
And we'll cover that, so you know how to identify your flower buds 
and where your clusters will be.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.160
And then in another video we'll talk about fruit thinning--

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.980
thinning your clusters, so you get massive berries 
and just balance the crop load on this vine.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.360
And those will be some nice points to look for on some later videos.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.040
Thanks for joining us.
