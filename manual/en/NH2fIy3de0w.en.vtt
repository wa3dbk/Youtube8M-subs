00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.170
Released in late September 2006, and directed
by Andrew Davis - this $80-million dollar

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.590
film only earned $15-million in profit.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.270
Kevin Costner and Aston Kutcher star in this
action-adventure drama film that focuses on

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.590
the life and training of the United State
Coast Guard's elite rescue swimming team.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.660
Neal McDonough, Melissa Sagemiller, and Clancy
Brown round out the supporting cast with commendable

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.870
contributions, but the real focus on this
picture is Costner and Kutcher.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:30.460
Costner is an extremely proficient rescue
diver, capable of saving everything but his

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.460
failing marriage.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.850
Whereas Kutchner is the hot-shot trainee more
focused on breaking swimming records than

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:36.030
saving lives.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.370
Both men are brilliant in their respective
teacher / student roles, bouncing off each

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.140
other with charged performances, especially
in one emotional scene where Costner opens

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.870
up about his troubled past, advising his protégé,
" Save the ones you can.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:48.239
The rest, you've got to let go."

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.750
Bookended by positively thrilling rescue-sequences
on the turbulent seas in the Gulf of Alaska,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.110
the majority of the picture is your typical
"boot camp" story... as we watch a group of

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.149
promising cadets go through every test of
endurance and skill to prove their readiness,

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.070
as only 280 make the cut from a pool of 39,000.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.451
The 139-minute feature doesn't break any new
ground during this middle-portion, but it's

00:01:07.451 --> 00:01:11.960
competently executed with effective use of
Trevor Rabin's hory-heavy score and some brisk

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:12.960
editing.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.140
With one lone exception however, the requisite
training montage was stylistically, but curiously,

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.500
filmed on low-definition video.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.460
An impressive chunk of the water scenes were
filmed in a giant indoor pool built specially

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.220
for this production... but its incorporation
is so flawless, you never notice.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.619
The pacing of this picture never feels slow,
but it does seem to contain a bit too much

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:32.380
story for its own good, the middle training
academy portion honestly could have been its

00:01:32.380 --> 00:02:04.270
own standalone movie.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.670
What "Top Gun" is to fighter pilots, this
fun and re-watchable experience is to the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.700
US Coast Guard.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.730
The PG-13 rated adventure is capped off with
a beautifully resounding epilogue that definitely

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:13.730
stayed with me.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.930
Although fairly predictable and formulaic,
this is a wonderful film that will make you

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.370
laugh, cry, and of course, appreciate the
real men and women who serve around the world.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:24.180
The Guardian", "Long-winded, but occasionally
inspiring."

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.340
Here's my final score... a SEVEN.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:30.080
Although fairly contrived and familiar, this
picture definitely works, least of all because

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.400
of its talented lead actors - I thought it
was COOL.
