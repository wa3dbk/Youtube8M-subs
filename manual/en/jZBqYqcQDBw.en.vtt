00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.490
When I'm on my skateboard it's just

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.380
This is what I want to do, this is awesome.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.090
you know what i love

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.440
the connection you have with that
skateboard i mean the things you can do

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.160
it's your escape it's your freedom it's
everything

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.490
It's just, it's who I am, it's what I love

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.250
I feel a connection with that more than anything else.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.920
I can't Imagine my life without skateboarding now, I mean, I'm just like

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.580
it's so twenty four seven

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.280
about skateboarding that

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.620
honestly i can't even

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.470
imagine what i would be doing. I realized
it once I started skateboarding that

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.510
nothing else mattered.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.140
I didn't care what kind of job I had, as long as I could keep skateboarding

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.890
that's all that makes me happy.
You look at everything if it's skateble or not.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.380
Like, can I skate that?

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.970
Yeah, I can skate that!

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.619
Can I skate that?
No, I can't skate that.

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.990
It's just, it's in your head.  You see a set of stairs, that's a set of stairs that you can skate.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.790
Everything I look at, it's based on skateboarding.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.710
Like, OH! I could skate that. I could skate that! I could go up there! You know?

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.390
know it's always there

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.759
anson obsession

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.260
like ido not no-load group of them

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.050
they could be just more in life

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.490
but that's why i think about everyday do
homework done school everything that

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.410
stayed put into my head

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:11.489

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:17.740
just art

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.839
dedicated so much time can asked for

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:22.949

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:13.269
ali skateboarding until i can

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:38.269

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:38.899
that

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:41.779
i could ever have as much fun skiing

00:03:41.779 --> 00:03:45.699
by myself as i did for my client

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:52.629
