00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.020
On this video I'm going to share with you
my country rib recipe.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.340
Now country ribs are a little bit different
than baby back ribs.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.340
I prefer country ribs because they have a
lot more meat on them.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.840
Now I always brine my ribs and, in this case,
I made a Jack Daniel’s brine.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:39.399
I combine 2 cups of Jack Daniel’s with 1
cup of brown sugar, 2 tablespoons of sea salt,

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:46.859
2 tablespoons of garlic powder, 2 tablespoons
of ground black pepper and 1 teaspoon of dried

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:47.859
thyme.

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:55.909
I mix that all together and I put that in
a container and filled it up just enough to

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:58.210
completely cover the meat.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.620
Put it in the refrigerator overnight.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:06.390
Let's have a look at these country ribs that
have been brining overnight.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.229
Oh, smells good!

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:16.290
We need to dry these off before we put our
rub on them.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:27.939
Let's get some paper towels and put those
down here and some tongs.

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:32.689
Look at that.

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:43.280
That's going to smoke up good.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:02:07.649
All right, let's dry these off.

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:18.480
Now in this bowl, I have a rub that consists
of 2 cups brown sugar, 1/2 cup sea salt, 1/4

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:27.950
cup Spanish-style paprika, 1/4 cup chili powder,
1/4 cup lemon pepper, 1/4 cup granulated garlic,

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.940
1 tablespoon ground black pepper, 1 teaspoon
dried basil, 1 teaspoon ground thyme.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.550
That's all in here.

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:37.550
Let's mix it up.

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:44.190
It's going to take some time to get these
lumps out of the brown sugar.

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:56.360
Okay, now that we have the majority of the
lumps out, we can take our ribs and put them

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:04.520
in here and just pat the heck out of them
with this seasoning.

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:10.100
Let me get another container to put these
on.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:25.840
We are going to let these sit for awhile when
we go out and prepare the smoker.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.820
The wood that I am going to use to smoke these
country ribs with is a combination of apple

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.890
and cherry.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:34.780
You can see it soaking in water there.

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.730
Also, notice that I have lined the pan with
aluminum foil even on the bottom.

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.590
The bottom of the pan is also lined with foil.

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.570
That makes cleanup easier.

00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:50.060
Now we have this rack sitting here which allows
the juices to drip into here and helps keep

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:51.510
our smoker cleaner.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.090
It's a little difficult to clean sometimes.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.930
Okay, the ribs have been sitting for about
45 minutes.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:00.650
Let them warm up a little bit.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.570
They were in the refrigerator overnight in
that brine; and we have our wood that's nice

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:05.570
and wet.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:09.010
We have the smoker set to 210 degrees.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.160
This happens to be Smokin Tex model 1400.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:17.620
I purchased this back in 2009 and it actually
sets under this table all winter; and you

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.650
can see that it's really holding up.

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:24.800
Let's put the meat in and the wood chips and
let's get started.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.770
Okay, the country ribs are in the smoker,
the wood chips are in place, the temperature

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:34.980
is set for 210 degrees.

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:41.870
All we have to do is sit back and wait for
about three hours.

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.600
Okay, it's been about three hours.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.010
The internal temperature is about 169 degrees.

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:56.160
Let's take these country ribs inside and put
them under the studio lights so that you can

00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:58.140
get a better look at them.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:05.130
Okay, there you have it, my version of country
ribs soaked in a Jack Daniel’s brine, rubbed

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:13.450
with a brown sugar rub, smoked in a smoker
for three hours at 210 degrees with a combination

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.370
of apple and cherry wood chips.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.160
Um, um, um does that look good!
