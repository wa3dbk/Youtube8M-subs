00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:07.660
Hello DisneyCarToys here and today I'm going
to transform my Krista doll into a mermaid

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.520
like Ariel.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:15.070
To make the mermaid sea shell top, just take
2 little balls of purple play doh to match

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:21.200
Ariel's top and then take your play-doh knife
and cut 3 little lines into it to make it

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.950
look like a shell and also to flatten it.

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:28.350
Then do the same thing with the other ball
of play doh to turn it into a sea shell.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:35.690
Now that we are done making the sea shells
we can place them on Krista's body just press

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:41.449
them firmly to her and have the lines lie
horizontal.

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:44.320
To finish her top, we just need a strap to
go along her back.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.640
So just roll out a little string of play-doh.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.679
Then attach the strap on the side of the sea
shell and wrap it along her back to the other

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:53.679
side.

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.539
It is a little long so just rip it off and
press it to the shell.

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.050
Her top is complete and she looks so cute.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.370
So now we can make the mermaid tail.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.680
For the mermaid tail just roll out some aqua
colored play dough.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.080
Then we'll cut out the tail.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:17.310
Just cut a straight line at the top, and then
curved lines going inward on the sides.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.170
The tail is pretty simple.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.710
Just place it on her body and wrap it around
with the smallest part at her feet.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:29.410
I have a little bit of extra play-doh here,
I'll just rip it off.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:34.900
There we go and then for her feet, just press
the play-doh in and then fold it down just

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.850
like a little baby burrito.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:42.770
To get rid of the seams of play-dough you
just want to press the play doh with your

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.850
fingers get it nice and smooth.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.060
And now we can make her little fins.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.140
For the mermaid fins you want to take a lighter
color green play doh and roll it out.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.640
And then we'll cut out almost like a triangle
shape on the top.

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.120
Then you want to do a wavy shape for each
little flipper.

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.330
Go up and then do a little wavy shape on the
other side too.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:09.700
That's a pretty good shape for the fin.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.639
No lets use our little play doh knife and
we'll cut some lines on it too just to give

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:18.400
it some decoration.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.489
Now that her mermaid fins are cut out just
press it to the bottom of her feet.

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.340
You want to press pretty strong just to make
sure it sticks.

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:31.340
There you go, that's pretty good.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.379
And now Krista is a mermaid just like Ariel.

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.250
They are sooo cute together.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.769
