00:00:13.536 --> 00:00:20.220
I've driven a lot of fun cars for Autoblog.

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:27.601
I've been on tracks, great! But there's
one track everyone wants to drive on.

00:00:27.601 --> 00:00:31.545
I haven't driven there,
though I've been there.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.645
To watch races.

00:00:34.624 --> 00:00:39.113
But I've never been on the track.
I've never been on the Nurburgring.

00:00:39.113 --> 00:00:47.986
That needs to change. With a fun car,
so we borrowed a Peugeot RCZ-R.

00:00:48.725 --> 00:01:03.485
Rally driver Kevin Abring gives me some
useful tips on how to drive the 'Ring quickly.

00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:08.364
We'll do that. First let me
tell you about the car.

00:01:08.364 --> 00:01:10.028
It's the Peugeot RCZ-R.

00:01:11.065 --> 00:01:15.713
It's the Peugeot RCZ like we know it,
but with some nice tweaks.

00:01:15.713 --> 00:01:23.654
The RCZ has 197 hp max, which
is fun, but not very exciting.

00:01:23.654 --> 00:01:28.733
The RCZ-R has 266 hp,
which sounds more like it.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:37.115
It's FWD, so it's a challenge to
put all that power on the road.

00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:46.706
Peugeot installed a Torsen differential
to transfer the power to the road.

00:01:46.706 --> 00:01:48.409
I have to say, it's a succes.

00:01:53.952 --> 00:01:59.415
You feel the diff work, because the wheel
wobbles when putting the pedal to the metal.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:06.634
It's a nice experience. The RCZ-R is
more hardcore than the regular RCZ.

00:02:06.634 --> 00:02:14.063
Overall... I've been driving it close to
the Nurburgring and it handles great.

00:02:14.063 --> 00:02:21.675
It has a good balance with its adjusted
sports suspension, making it stiffer.

00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:27.471
It's just a nice car to explore
the Nurburgring with.

00:02:27.817 --> 00:02:31.544
Kevin will first show me how it's done.

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:35.659
I'll be in the passenger's seat,
after which we'll switch places.

00:02:36.314 --> 00:02:38.468
Let's see if I can do it myself as well.

00:02:42.649 --> 00:02:48.471
It's going to happen. Kevin
pulls in with a different car.

00:02:48.471 --> 00:02:50.544
Great, let's go.

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:55.418
Let's go. See you soon.

00:03:15.247 --> 00:03:18.423
Don't get on the throttle too soon
or you'll end up too much on the outside.

00:03:43.913 --> 00:03:45.968
Well, enjoy it mate.

00:03:48.185 --> 00:03:49.918
All the useful tips.
- Yes, I will.

00:03:55.872 --> 00:04:00.009
I only see-- It's stabilizing.

00:04:01.168 --> 00:04:04.782
Ease off on the throttle.
Brake hard.

00:04:07.436 --> 00:04:10.223
A right corner.
You can grace the curb.

00:04:11.412 --> 00:04:14.998
Keep inside with the next left
for the upcoming right.

00:04:14.998 --> 00:04:16.898
Stay in 3rd.

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:28.909
For this left, stay inside. Grace the curb.
There's a late apex.

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:31.727
You went in too soon.

00:04:36.061 --> 00:04:41.732
The next is a shitty corner.
You'll go in with ESP and ABS.

00:04:41.732 --> 00:04:45.457
Lift, and ease back on
the throttle. And lift.

00:04:45.457 --> 00:04:48.090
Hit the curb. Great.

00:04:48.472 --> 00:04:51.904
Keep it inside. You'll go wide fast.

00:04:53.908 --> 00:04:57.967
Turn in nicely, lift, and brake hard.

00:05:00.003 --> 00:05:04.787
A late turn-in. Coast it in.
Gently back on the throttle.

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:13.600
Stay in the middle. Nudge the brakes,
and pedal to the metal.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.820
After decompression you can
go back on the throttle.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.973
I'm starting to sweat. It's hard work.

00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:31.440
If you know the landmarks,
you'll be more relaxed. 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.706
This one is OK.

00:05:38.134 --> 00:05:43.540
This is a shitty corner.
Easy, wait with the throttle.

00:05:53.107 --> 00:05:57.491
Keep left, OK go. Yea!

00:05:58.898 --> 00:06:02.784
Brake early for the next. You don't
see the apex. It'll pop up.

00:06:02.784 --> 00:06:05.899
Back to 4th. Start braking.
A little more.

00:06:08.072 --> 00:06:10.596
Brake early. Go in.

00:06:14.092 --> 00:06:17.437
I don't know what it's doing.
- It may have broken down.

00:06:18.465 --> 00:06:22.887
It was really awesome.
Casper wants to do this more often.

00:06:22.887 --> 00:06:26.857
I thought so.
You'll have to invite me as well.

00:06:35.726 --> 00:06:40.385
We're driving back. Thank you,
Kevin. It was fun, absolutely.

00:06:40.385 --> 00:06:45.096
I want to do this more often,
so I'll return to that nice track.

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:51.068
If you got enthusiastic about RCZ-R,
I can imagine. It's a cool car.

00:06:52.436 --> 00:06:56.696
You'll have to pay the dealer
47,000 euros for one.

00:06:58.526 --> 00:07:02.789
I can't think of a reason why you shouldn't.
Take it to the Nurburgring. Hoon it.

00:07:03.385 --> 00:07:08.083
Great. Do we have something
to complain about? Yes.

00:07:09.951 --> 00:07:14.431
It's a French car, so the build
quality isn't all that great.

00:07:14.431 --> 00:07:23.586
This car has done 2,000 miles and I've
got the passenger seat's logo right here.

00:07:24.186 --> 00:07:26.039
It fell off already.

00:07:26.556 --> 00:07:28.218
It's not very sturdy.

00:07:29.997 --> 00:07:34.698
Another thing: they could've
left out the back seat.

00:07:35.265 --> 00:07:39.050
It just adds weight and
no one can sit there.

00:07:39.762 --> 00:07:41.442
Unless you know someone without legs.

00:07:42.159 --> 00:07:46.866
Or head. Then it might fit.
Other than that it's a no go.

00:07:46.866 --> 00:07:51.061
Maybe fun for your Labrador
to bring along. Perfect, a dog.

00:07:51.061 --> 00:07:55.148
If you won't have kids,
but a Labrador: buy a RCZ-R.

00:07:55.148 --> 00:07:57.739
Only if you don't mind logos falling off.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.200
