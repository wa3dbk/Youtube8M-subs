00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:19.730
Hello, I’m Ric Manning, the gadget guy at
My Well-Being.

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.880
Today I’m here to talk about wireless headphones
-- a product that brought a new era of peaceful

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.220
co-existence to my household.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.399
I like to watch the late news and some of
the nighttime talk shows on our bedroom TV.

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:36.219
But for my wife, it’s lights out by 11.

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:40.940
With wireless headphones, I can be in bed
watching a TV show or even a loud movie while

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.309
she sleeps undisturbed.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.199
What’s more, I can turn up the volume as
loud as I want.

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.019
And let me tell you, after years of hitting
more than my share of rock concerts, I tend

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:52.019
to want to crank it up.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:56.499
[Move to Item #1 Audio Unlimited]
A typical wireless setup comes with headphones

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:00.960
and a transmitter, like this one from Audio
Unlimited that sells for about $50.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.500
(Caption: Audio Unlimited - $50)
In this case the transmitter also serves as

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.500
a charging cradle for the battery inside the
headset.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:14.890
One cable plugs into a power source, and the
other into the headphone jack on your TV,

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.680
stereo or DVD player.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.400
[ Ric puts the phones on his head]
The ear cups fit completely over your ears.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.720
That reduces the possibility of sound leaking
out . . . but it also means the headphones

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:30.990
are a little bigger and bulkier . . . and
not especially comfortable for wearing in

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.990
bed.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.110
[CUT to Ric at Item #2 - Sennheiser]
This model from Sennheiser is a step up in

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.620
quality and price - costs about $65.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:42.140
(Caption: Sennheiser - $65)
These phones also have a rechargeable battery

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.670
inside one of the ear cups gets refueled when
it’s parked in the cradle.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.960
The sound quality is better than some of cheaper
models that I’ve tested.

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.910
But remember, all wireless headphones compress
the audio signal.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:59.560
They work like cordless phones, so they will
never match the quality that you get with

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:00.730
cabled headphones.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:05.570
[CUT to Item #3 - Able Planet]
Another step up are these headphones from

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.920
Able Planet, which cost about a hundred dollars.

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.600
(Caption: Able Planet - $100)
They are designed for people with some level

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:11.940
of hearing loss.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:16.470
They have built-in technology that boosts
the middle frequencies.That make voices and

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.310
dialog clearer and easier to understand.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.780
Unlike the others, these headphones use replaceable
batteries that fit into one of the ear cups.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.730
The power switch is built into this swivel
connector above an ear pad.

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:32.730
Check this out.

[Voiceover]

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.420
When the phones are on your head, they power
up.

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.560
This amber light comes on and tells you that
the power is on.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.060
When you set them down – or if you fall
asleep in bed and they slip off your head

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.120
– they automatically shut off.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.240

So , here’s a quick recap.

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.240

Sennheiser - $65)

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.920
Able Planet - $100)
$50 for the Audio Unlimited headphones . . . good

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.060
price but a little bulky.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:57.000
$65 for the Sennheiser . . . A better fit
and better sound.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.319
$100 for the Able Planet headphones . . . . good
people with some hearing loss.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:03.319
Thanks for watching.
