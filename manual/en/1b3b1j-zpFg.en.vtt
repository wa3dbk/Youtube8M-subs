00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.140
No matter what our competitors may claim ACDelco is the only original equipment

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.320
service brand for GM cars and trucks

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.430
so if you're looking for a battery to
service a GM vehicle

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:32.610
then look no further than ACDelco. In
addition

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.489
our professional line of batteries are
also a great fit for other brands on the

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:36.879
road.

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.730
In fact our line of batteries meet
requirements of ninety-eight percent of

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.100
the vehicles on the road today.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.570
Our professional batteries are available
in three different versions

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.579
each with unique specifications and
warranty. First is the Professional

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:54.470
featuring an 18-month warranty. Next is the professional Silver

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:59.089
with a 30-month warranty and finally this
is our top of the line Professional Gold

00:00:59.089 --> 00:00:59.780
featuring

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.509
a 42 month warranty. These limited
warranties include battery replacement.

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:06.270
Not a pro-rate warranty

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.470
carried by many of our competitors where
customers must pay.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.770
All of our professional batteries include
these key features.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.400
First is this soulidium low porosity inter-cell well

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:21.150
that helps ensure longer battery life.
This weld improves corrosion resistance

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.020
and assures full fusion to the plate lug. These accessible vent caps,

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.960
that you see here, help to reduce leakage
and corrosion. Our batteries also include

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.520
a negative pace formulation to resist
flaking. 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.560
This helps to improve our overall
performance

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.180
and also increases battery life. If you
notice here

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.590
these negative grids feature rounded
corners while the positive grids are

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.159
fully framed with no exposed wires

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.370
these help optimize conductivity and
starting performance

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:54.979
while helping to eliminate internal
shorting. This

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.270
envelope separator helps resist
punctures and improves the circulation

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.670
of acid which allows the battery to
remain cooler. This is yet another

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.170
feature to help improve battery life.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.289
Our professional batteries are offered
in many sizes

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.790
cold cranking amps and reserve capacity
to meet your needs

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.250
and finally all of our professional
batteries are 100 percent pressure

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.920
tested

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.049
to ensure added strength and rigidity
and they

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.090
also are 100 percent electrical short
tested prior to shipment

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.780
as you can see ACDelco is committed to
providing you the highest quality

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.920
