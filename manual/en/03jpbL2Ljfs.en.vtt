Welcome to howtocookthat.net.

00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:03.930
Today we are going to make a sock monkey as
a cake topper.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:08.760
I am actually making my son's first birthday
cake and I have just chosen a few of his favorite

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.250
toys so let's get started.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.840
First of all we need to mix the colors.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.200
We need the white, brown, red and black.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:20.500
If you are not sure how to do that, go to
the video on fondant basics on this channel.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:25.369
First of all roll out your sock monkey's body,
rolling it into an oval shape and then put

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.040
three pieces of spaghetti down the middle
to give it some strength.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.010
The sock monkey is quite tall and lean so
once you have done that just give it a bit

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.719
of an extra roll to make sure it is the right
shape.

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.310
Then place that upright on your baking paper.

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:43.590
The reason we put it on baking paper is so
that it doesn't stick to your bench because

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.550
we are going to need to be able to put it
aside to let it firm up and dry overnight.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.360
Next we want to make his legs.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.870
Take some more of the brown fondant, roll
it into a skinny snake shape and just place

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.980
some cream on the end and then roll them together.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.339
Cut it to length, just put it next to the
body to see roughly how long you want it to

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:10.110
be, cut it to the right length, and then just
make your other leg match the first one.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.430
Push it down flat on one end, and so that
then you can just place the body on top of

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.990
the legs.

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.680
Next we are going to make his arms.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.580
Take another piece of your brown fondant and
roll it out into the snake shape, again putting

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.430
some cream onto each end to for his hands
and roll it smooth so that it all matches

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.850
together, and then trim it agin to the right
length, this time with the hands we are going

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:38.170
to use some spaghetti to attach it to the
body.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.200
We didn't need to do that with the legs because
they sit flat on the floor but with the arms

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.630
they are going to need some spaghetti for
strength.

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:54.119
So simply place a piece of spaghetti into
the arm and then gently stick it into the

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:58.810
body, making sure you are sticking it in in
the right angle, then place the arm in the

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.350
position you want it to be.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:07.649
Later I added some food that mimicked the
food that we were eating at the birthday party

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:13.340
and we were having cake pops so I put a cake
pop in the monkey's hand, made out of fondant

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.130
as well so you can do that sort of thing later
if you would like.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.760
Next, to make his head roll a ball of your
brown fondant, then take a smaller piece of

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.319
cream, roll it into a ball and cut it in half
and place that on top of his head for the

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:42.970
cream top that he has and roll it together,
push it together, to make it nice and smooth.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.450
Next we will make his mouth.

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.840
Take a smaller ball again of cream fondant,
cut it in half.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.959
Then he has the red smile so we are going
to take the red fondant and roll it out very

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:03.580
thinly and cut a fine strip that is pointed
on the corners for the corner of his mouth.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:09.790
Pick that up and place it over the cream fondant,
a little bit of water on the back on the fondant

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.160
and place it on his head where it goes.

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.040
Next, if you want the knitted look of the
sock monkey, mix up some royal icing.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.440
I am using a clean paint brush; just put some
little dabs of your royal icing over your

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:26.440
fondant.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.269
That doesn't have to be thick it just adds
that texture to it.

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:35.280
Next take a tiny piece of black fondant and
roll it into a ball and place one on each

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.880
side for his eyes.

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:45.840
Then we take another small piece of brown
fondant, roll it into a ball, cut in half,

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.860
obviously I am using a very blunt knife, don't
use, don't do it on your hand if you've got

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:51.860
a sharp knife.

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:57.019
Roll it into a ball again and place on the
side of his head and then I am using the back

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:01.870
end of the paintbrush, just push the ears
in in the middle a little bit to give that

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.070
ear shape.

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:05.020
And make sure they are in the right position.

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.340
Next we are going to make his hair.

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.769
Take some red fondant and roll it out superfine
like a piece of string, you might have to

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:15.220
practice this a few times if you're not used
to rolling the fondant.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:21.470
Then take you a skewer, break off a small
length and using the end of the skewer poke

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.520
that into the top of his head.

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:26.460
Repeat that until he's got enough hair.

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.900

Once you've added enough hair, just use your
skewer to rearrange it to give him the hairstyle

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.070
you are happy with.

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:50.120
Next, to attach the head to the body we take
a piece of spaghetti and poke it gently into

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.660
the head and carefully picking it up so that
you don't damage the shape of the head or

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:01.110
any of the hard work you've just done, then
place that head onto the body of your sock

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.110
monkey.

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.740
Then using your paintbrush again, add the
knitted look to your sock monkey just by placing

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:10.690
dabs of your royal icing all over his body.

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:12.830
I hope you've enjoyed this video.
