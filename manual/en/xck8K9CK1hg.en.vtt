00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:26.100

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.100
he is suffering from short term memory loss

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.020
after coffee i just took the blanket and went to sleep

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.320
sir

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.500
that means

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.020
there is also a blanket in the house

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.880
ARE YOU INSANE?

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.820
he is suffering from such a major disease and you are worried about the blanket?

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.800
Actually i think that you are suffering from a very MAJOR Disease

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.640
MAJOR Disease!

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:01.940
Which one

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.700
PARABOLA

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.920
What?

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.620
I have heard about ebola but what is parabola

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.200
ebola is actually a foreign disease. parabola is a local disease

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:13.320
parabola? local?

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.620

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.260
we will start the treatment from today onwards

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:22.700

00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:23.915

00:03:24.342 --> 00:03:25.942

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:27.589
two tablets after meal

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.036

00:03:30.038 --> 00:03:31.318

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.880

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.160

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:19.600

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.160

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:28.020
unfortunately you are in the last stage

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.500
so doctor! what should we do now?

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.480

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.300
