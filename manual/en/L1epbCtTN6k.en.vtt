00:00:06.673 --> 00:00:08.673
This year at MWC

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:11.042
Opera introduced Opera Mini for iPhone

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.580
Because of the Opera compression technology

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.781
the speed of downloading Web page can six times faster

00:00:17.856 --> 00:00:19.856
Now it has been submitted to App Store for approval

00:00:21.355 --> 00:00:25.090
Will Apple approve the non-Safari browsers on its iPhone?

00:00:25.092 --> 00:00:26.420
We don't know yet

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:28.426
Now Opera Taiwan office has the iPhone with Opera Mini for demo purposes

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:31.963
Techbang immediately went to Opera Taiwan office

00:00:32.274 --> 00:00:34.150
to conduct the testing

00:00:34.157 --> 00:00:36.157
Let's see the features of Opera Mini for iPhone

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:38.970
Bascically, Safari is a good browser

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:43.041
However, Opera Mini is designed for

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:46.344
business travelers or road warrior

00:00:51.952 --> 00:00:53.952
He may be in the airports

00:00:54.428 --> 00:00:56.428
or developing countries

00:00:57.826 --> 00:01:01.490
where there is no 3G network

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:03.495
At 2G and EDGE network, Opera Mini can

00:01:07.534 --> 00:01:09.534
make browsing very fast

00:01:10.637 --> 00:01:11.910
, comparing with other browsers

00:01:11.912 --> 00:01:12.970
According to our test

00:01:12.973 --> 00:01:14.973
iPhone's Safari under 2G Edge network

00:01:16.443 --> 00:01:18.443
open the front page of Techbang Web site

00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:20.010
spending 1 min 45 sec

00:01:20.016 --> 00:01:22.016
However, because of the compression, Opera Mini

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:24.115
only needs 25 secs to open the front page

00:01:24.418 --> 00:01:26.418
Although it does not reach six times faster, it is four times faster

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:29.254
The huge difference is data transmission

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.140
It supprisingly only takes 1/ 12 of the data Safari transmit

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:34.993
it does save a huge amount of money

00:01:36.129 --> 00:01:38.129
The UI of Opera Mini

00:01:39.381 --> 00:01:41.380
is Speed Dial

00:01:41.796 --> 00:01:43.800
This was invented by Opera

00:01:44.118 --> 00:01:46.120
Now this feature has been adopted by other browsers

00:01:49.157 --> 00:01:51.160
The major function of Speed Dial

00:01:52.686 --> 00:01:54.690
can help you access to your favorite Web site very quickly

00:01:57.985 --> 00:01:59.980
In additions, we have Opera Link

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:06.590
which can sync the bookmarks and Speed Dial from your Opera desktop browsers

00:02:07.961 --> 00:02:09.960
to your mobile phone

00:02:11.657 --> 00:02:13.660
it is convenient to use

00:02:14.235 --> 00:02:16.240
Of course, you can use RSS subscrition in Opera Mini

00:02:17.838 --> 00:02:19.840
How much time Apple needs to get Opera Mini approved?

00:02:21.247 --> 00:02:22.670
Now if your guess is right,

00:02:22.676 --> 00:02:24.680
Opera will give you an iPhone

00:02:24.778 --> 00:02:26.780
We are very positive about this submission

00:02:27.314 --> 00:02:29.310
We will be approved

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:32.490
because we didn't violate

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:34.790
its development conditions

00:02:39.826 --> 00:02:41.830
If the participant in Taiwan wins the award

00:02:42.097 --> 00:02:43.830
will the phone be delivered to Taiwan?

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.830
it will be delivered to Taiwan

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:48.460
The speed of Opera Mini

00:02:48.461 --> 00:02:50.460
and the convenience of the bookmark sync

00:02:50.481 --> 00:02:52.480
are very useful at iPhone

00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:54.820
Will Apple approve this submission?

00:02:54.823 --> 00:02:56.820
Let's wait and see

00:02:57.077 --> 00:02:59.080
Techband will have the follow-up report on this.
