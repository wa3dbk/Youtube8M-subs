00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:15.907
Pretty much everyone loves eating pizza,

00:00:15.931 --> 00:00:17.645
but it can be a messy business.

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:19.163
Pizza is soft and bendable.

00:00:19.187 --> 00:00:21.697
So how can you stop
all that cheese from falling off?

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:23.023
You might know some tricks:

00:00:23.047 --> 00:00:24.888
you can use two hands --
not so classy,

00:00:24.912 --> 00:00:26.271
or you can use a paper plate

00:00:26.295 --> 00:00:28.636
and allow only the tip
of the pizza to peek out.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.215
There's one other trick, though:

00:00:30.239 --> 00:00:33.364
holding the crust, you can sort
of fold the slice down the middle.

00:00:33.388 --> 00:00:35.460
Now the tip of the pizza
isn't falling over,

00:00:35.484 --> 00:00:38.577
and you can eat it without getting
tomato sauce all over yourself

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:41.060
or accidentally biting off
some of that paper plate.

00:00:41.084 --> 00:00:44.090
But why should the tip stay up
just because you bent the crust?

00:00:44.114 --> 00:00:46.366
To understand this,
you need to know two things:

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.460
a little bit about the math
of curved shapes

00:00:48.484 --> 00:00:50.777
and a little about the physics
of thin sheets.

00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:51.954
First, the math.

00:00:51.978 --> 00:00:54.183
Suppose I have a flat sheet
made out of rubber.

00:00:54.207 --> 00:00:57.451
It's really thin and bendable,
so it's easy to roll into a cylinder.

00:00:57.475 --> 00:01:00.399
I don't need to stretch
the sheet at all, just bend it.

00:01:00.423 --> 00:01:03.328
This property where one shape
can be transformed into another

00:01:03.352 --> 00:01:06.338
without stretching or crumpling,
is called isometry.

00:01:06.362 --> 00:01:10.160
A mathematician would say that a flat
sheet is isometric to a cylinder.

00:01:10.184 --> 00:01:11.971
But not all shapes are isometric.

00:01:11.995 --> 00:01:14.615
If I try to turn my flat sheet
into part of a sphere,

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:15.932
there's no way I can do it.

00:01:15.956 --> 00:01:17.511
You can check this for yourself,

00:01:17.535 --> 00:01:20.221
by trying to fit a flat sheet
of paper onto a soccer ball

00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:22.253
without stretching or crumpling the paper.

00:01:22.277 --> 00:01:23.428
It's just not possible.

00:01:23.452 --> 00:01:24.815
So a mathematician would say

00:01:24.839 --> 00:01:27.633
that a flat sheet and a sphere
aren't isometric.

00:01:27.657 --> 00:01:30.103
There's one more familiar
shape that isn't isometric

00:01:30.127 --> 00:01:32.869
to any of the shapes we've seen
so far: a potato chip.

00:01:32.893 --> 00:01:35.557
Potato chip shapes
aren't isometric to flat sheets.

00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:39.073
If you want to get a flat piece of rubber
into the shape of a potato chip,

00:01:39.097 --> 00:01:42.284
you need to stretch it --
not just bend it, but stretch it as well.

00:01:42.308 --> 00:01:43.467
So, that's the math.

00:01:43.491 --> 00:01:44.657
Not so hard, right?

00:01:44.681 --> 00:01:45.832
Now for the physics.

00:01:45.856 --> 00:01:47.751
It can be summed up in one sentence:

00:01:47.775 --> 00:01:50.656
Thin sheets are easy to bend
but hard to stretch.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.236
This is really important.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.371
Thin sheets are easy to bend
but hard to stretch.

00:01:55.395 --> 00:01:58.458
Remember when we rolled
our flat sheet of rubber into a cylinder?

00:01:58.482 --> 00:01:59.720
That wasn't hard, right?

00:01:59.744 --> 00:02:02.118
But imagine how hard
you'd have pull on the sheet

00:02:02.142 --> 00:02:03.984
to increase its area by 10 percent.

00:02:04.008 --> 00:02:05.467
It would be pretty difficult.

00:02:05.491 --> 00:02:07.453
The point is that bending a thin sheet

00:02:07.477 --> 00:02:09.499
takes a relatively small amount of force,

00:02:09.523 --> 00:02:12.758
but stretching or crumbling
a thin sheet is much harder.

00:02:12.782 --> 00:02:15.296
Now, finally, we get to talk about pizza.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.331
Suppose you go down to the pizzeria
and buy yourself a slice.

00:02:18.355 --> 00:02:21.279
You pick it up from the crust,
first, without doing the fold.

00:02:21.303 --> 00:02:23.994
Because of gravity,
the slice bends downwards.

00:02:24.018 --> 00:02:25.786
Pizza is pretty thin, after all,

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.176
and we know that thin sheets
are easy to bend.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.681
You can't get it in your mouth,

00:02:29.705 --> 00:02:32.686
cheese and tomato sauce dripping
everywhere -- it's a big mess.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.861
So you fold the crust.

00:02:33.885 --> 00:02:36.996
When you do, you force the pizza
into something like a taco shape.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.944
That's not hard to do --
after all, this shape is isometric

00:02:39.968 --> 00:02:41.923
to the original pizza, which was flat.

00:02:41.947 --> 00:02:45.008
But imagine what would happen
if the pizza were to droop down

00:02:45.032 --> 00:02:46.305
while you're bending it.

00:02:46.329 --> 00:02:48.112
Now it looks like a droopy taco.

00:02:48.136 --> 00:02:50.872
And what does a droopy taco
look like? A potato chip!

00:02:50.896 --> 00:02:54.779
But we know that potato chips are not
isometric to flat pieces of rubber

00:02:54.803 --> 00:02:56.249
or flat pizzas,

00:02:56.273 --> 00:02:59.247
and that means that in order
to get into the shape it's in now,

00:02:59.271 --> 00:03:00.901
the slice of pizza had to stretch.

00:03:00.925 --> 00:03:03.516
Since the pizza is thin,
this takes a lot of force,

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.498
compared to the amount of force it takes

00:03:05.522 --> 00:03:07.422
to bend the pizza in the first place.

00:03:07.446 --> 00:03:08.800
So, what's the conclusion?

00:03:08.824 --> 00:03:10.626
When you fold the pizza at the crust,

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.300
you make it into a shape where a lot
of force is needed to bend the tip down.

00:03:14.324 --> 00:03:16.951
Often gravity isn't strong enough
to provide this force.

00:03:16.975 --> 00:03:18.800
That was kind of a lot of information,

00:03:18.824 --> 00:03:20.545
so let's do a quick backwards recap.

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.205
When pizza is folded at the crust,

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:24.299
gravity isn't strong enough
to bend the tip.

00:03:24.323 --> 00:03:26.376
Why? Because stretching a pizza is hard.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.389
And to bend the tip downwards,
the pizza would have to stretch,

00:03:29.413 --> 00:03:31.598
because the shape the pizza would be in,

00:03:31.622 --> 00:03:32.793
the droopy taco shape,

00:03:32.817 --> 00:03:35.370
isn't isometric
to the original flat pizza.

00:03:35.394 --> 00:03:37.204
Why? Because of math.

00:03:37.228 --> 00:03:39.407
As the pizza example shows,
we can learn a lot

00:03:39.431 --> 00:03:42.581
by looking at the mathematical properties
of different shapes.

00:03:42.605 --> 00:03:46.136
And it's especially nice when those shapes
happen to be pizza slices.
