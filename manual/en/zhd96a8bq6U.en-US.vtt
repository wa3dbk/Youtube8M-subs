00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.580
Hey guys we are at MWC 2015 and Sony has released
Xperia Z4 Tablet.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:13.520
Depending on which region you live in
So it's 10.1 inch tablet it has all the latest

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:20.859
specs powered by SnapDragon 810 Chipset 64Bit
Octacore Chipset.

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:27.749
You know also has 3GB of RAM it comes with
32GB of internal storage.

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:31.650
But then supports micro SD card slot of up
to 128GB.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:37.920
Now that's lot of storage space but what's
important is that is one of the thinnest device

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:46.750
in the market or thinnest Tablet at least.
So 6.1mm only here and also it's IP 68 certified

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.140
now.
So the depth has increased from 1 meter to

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.190
1.5 meters and you can still keep it for maximum
of 30 minutes.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.350
IP 67 certification allows you to keep the
device inside up to 1 meter of depth.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:09.380
This one goes up to 1.5 meter.
It also has the brilliant Tri-luminous Display

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:14.630
that came from the Sony Bravia Television.
So it also has the X reality which kind of

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:21.170
makes the colors pop out because it increases
the saturation on the RGB Palettes.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.360
You see that's the 5MP front camera also on
top you have the sensors and stuff.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:36.219
Yeah you have the on screen soft keys there
on the left side you would have the power

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:42.799
button the volume rocker there.
Nothing much below here you have the micro

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:51.170
USB 2.0 port and on top you have the micro
SD card slot depending whether you have the

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.130
WIFI only version or the LTE version.
You will have Sim card slot there it supports

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.189
Nano Sim.
You have noise cancelling mic over there and

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.229
that's about it.
It's very very thin but the side is actually

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:12.340
plastic I think not exactly aluminium.
Now we gonna have look at the back.

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.239
The back is also plastic very high quality
plastic I have the white model with me.

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.810
You get two colors the White and the Black
you see the NFC tag out there.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:28.370
And the 8.1MP camera but it does not accompany
an LED flash so your night time photography

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.099
is gonna be a pain.
It's white color but I see very sand blasted

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:37.700
kind of texture over there.
It's very shimmery looks nice gives premium

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.790
touch to the tablet.
However you do not exactly feel the sand you

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.159
know kind of a texture.
There it just look like this unlike the one

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:50.730
plus one I mean you know you could feel that
sandy thing.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.840
So that's the Xperia Z4 Tablet it looks brilliant.
It's very very light I am gonna just quickly

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:04.390
show you the specs.
You will see it's only 389 Grams for the WIFI

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.069
only model and 393 Grams for LTE model 6.1mm
thin.

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:18.459
It's powered by SnapDragon 810 Octacore 64Bit
Chipset has an Adreno 330 GPU 3GB RAM 32GB

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:24.519
flash memory I already told all this.
And it also supports you know MHL 3.0 WIFI

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:32.599
Mimo and 6000 mAh battery which I think could
have been longer.

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:48.280
So all these other things it has 2K resolution
2560*1600 more than 2540*1440 that you see

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:52.219
in the Samsung tablet S.
So it's slightly more and also comes with

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:57.379
Tri-Luminous and X reality.
So those are the quick specs and the hardware

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:05.290
of the Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet.
So looks like the Xperia Z4 tablet has very

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:11.709
light and fast and seamless user interface.
You can see every animation all swiping everything

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:16.829
does not lag at all.
Although you have all widgets on the home

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.959
screen.
It's very very fast and light and seamless

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:27.710
very smooth and see that's how you go to the
menu's you have all the apps around here.

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.350
We don't know it's a demo device so there
might be Demo apps that would not come pre

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.949
loaded when you buy this device.
But you just get an idea you have all the

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:41.090
Google you know in house apps like Chrome
and Gmail and Maps and stuff.

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.190
You also have some of the Sony's in house
apps there you see all the system apps like

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.040
album and you have lifelog which keep tracks
of your physical activities.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:57.430
You have keep that's from Google some other
stuffs here.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:04.970
But I do not see Walkman you have trackid
and stuff play music.

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:11.000
You have play station.
This one should be able to act as a remote

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.970
for your play station.
You have camera but I do not see Walkman app

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.810
yet.
You might or might not get the Walkman this

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:25.440
might not be Walkman supported device.
You see I see music app but not the Walkman

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.680
app here.
You have albums and other stuff we will go

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.240
to the settings and see the about device.
And the storage spaces and all.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:41.940
So about device you can see it comes with
Lollipop 5.0.2 right out of the box.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:51.030
You also have I wanna show you the storage.
So out of 32GB it says only 18GB is available

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:57.379
because I am sure it has demo content installed.
But out of 32GB generally you should have

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:06.410
roughly about 25 to 26GB available.
And then let's check out the camera Ui.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:12.060
Which is not very different from your Xperia
series of phones.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.730
But I guess it's slightly neater so you have
all the options around here.

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:24.289
Aspect ration you can go white screen or stay
at 4*3 and that's how the front camera looks.

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:32.180
It's bright enough and it does not lag at
all you see.

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:40.330
It's almost zero lag which is cool ya.
So probably we gonna show you some image and

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.580
video samples later on.
So that's guys that's the Sony Xperia Z4 Tablet.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:52.199
It's very very nice and it could be very important
product in the Sony Tablet portfolio and the

00:06:52.199 --> 00:07:00.801
Sony Mobile Technology portfolio to say.
So it's gonna be released in Spring 2015 you

00:07:00.801 --> 00:07:06.009
have two models WIFI only and the WIFI plus
LTE models.

00:07:06.009 --> 00:07:11.770
The WIFI plus LTE models I think would be
closer to 650 Euros an the WIFI models should

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:16.750
be about 600 Euros.
But the pricing is not final yet it's only

00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:20.720
indicative.
And no dates whether it will come to India

00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:21.860
if at all.
Thank you.
