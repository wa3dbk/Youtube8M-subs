YouTube, Edgar here and welcome to Artifexian
Here you will learn everything you ever

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.290
wanted to know about world-building

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.230
and then some well

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.679
An open letter to elliptical galaxies
dear

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:17.520
elliptical galaxy why are you so
incredibly boring

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.850
I mean I've spent so long researching into
you guys trying to find something

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.410
interesting to say about you

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.430
and to be honest you've kinda let me down for
shame elliptical galaxies

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.760
For shame. For starters instead having
big beautiful colorful spiral arms

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.110
you instead look like a featureless mono-colored
blob

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.890
Hanging around the cosmos. You also contain very
little gas

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.850
and dust so interesting things like star
formation rarely occur

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.270
a what stars you do contain tend to be
old very old

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.960
low-mass stars now I hate to be ageist

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.600
but old least in the astrological sense
equates to

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.149
BORING!! like imagine for second our
earth

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:04.360
was suddenly transported into an
elliptical galaxy what would the sky

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.129
look like?

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:11.240
Well bland. Stars would be uniformly
distributed across the night sky

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.100
it will be almost features save for the
abnormal amount of globular clusters.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.470
Ellipticals tend to have numerous
globular clusters orbiting them

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.170
much more sold in spiral galaxies
even still

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.759
it is up for debate as to whether or not
these clusters could be seen

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.430
given the uniformity of the night sky
call me a spiral chauvinist

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.259
but I like my night sky filled with varying
stellar types

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.470
dust lanes and a Galactic disc arcing

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:43.979
across the sky now to be fair there are
some interesting things about you

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.280
but not enough to draw the attention of
the world builder

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.420
but instead work noting that for one thing
when it comes to

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.420
size you are much more versatile
then your spiral counterparts

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.740
and the actual physics keeping it stable
is moderately interesting

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.479
I mean is nothing like Euler's identity
kinda interesting book frankly

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.470
I'll take whatever I can get at the
moment firstly the stars inside you tend

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:08.649
to

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.099
orbit radially as opposed to in a single
plane which is cool but

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:16.800
REALLY dangerous in terms of galactic
habitability

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.040
also there's a tight correlation between
the velocity dispersions your stars

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.400
and the size of the supermassive black hole
this is called

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.980
M-sigma realtion its a little complicated to get
into right now

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.879
go check out the link in description
if you're interested lastly you ellipticals tend

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.810
to be found your Center galactic
clusters or groups

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.190
and it thought to be the result of
galactic collisions....look

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.739
I'm as much a fan of MASSIVE extinction level
events as the next guy is

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.810
especially those on a galactic level
but dear

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.000
ellipticals you are in every way possible

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.910
the graveyards of the cosmos yours sincerely

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.940
Artifexian. Guys find me on Facebook and
Twitter but more importantly

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.230
like subscribe right here on Youtube thank
you for watching
