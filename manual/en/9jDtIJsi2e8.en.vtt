00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.719
In the middle of the boat you’ll have a
centreboard, which either pivots around a

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:20.180
pin like this, or slides up and down like
this, which is called a dagger board.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.560
Your boat should have at least two buoyancy
tanks to keep you afloat.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:29.320
They are designed that should one become holed
the boat will still float.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.940
The buoyancy tanks form the main body of the
hull that you sit on, with an additional tank

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:37.030
at the bow of the boat.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.920
Drainage holes are fitted at the back of the
boat to allow you to drain any water that

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.180
may collect in the buoyancy tank while sailing.

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.340
These holes are secured with bungs which must
be fitted before you go afloat.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.979
The boat will not sink if you do not fit the
bungs, but it will fill with water and be

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:56.320
very difficult to steer if you don’t.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.879
To steer you’ll have a rudder which is fixed
to the back of the boat, and controlled by

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.519
a horizontal pole which is called the tiller.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.690
The final part of the assembly is the tiller
extension, which is the bit that you hold.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.219
The rudder blade pivots around a pin which
allows it to be easily raised and lowered,

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:22.020
and once down is secured in place with a piece
of rope held in a jam cleat on the tiller.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.520
The person steering is called the helmsman,
but when we use this term it applies to both

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.750
male or female.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.000
This person steers the boat by holding the
tiller extension across and in front of their

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.010
body with one hand, and the mainsheet in the
other hand.

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.090
This is called the dagger grip.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.969
This grip allows you to control the mainsail
and rudder easily.

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.520
In a two hander the second person is called
the crew.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.069
This person controls the jib, and if fitted
the spinnaker.

00:01:54.069 --> 00:02:00.090
To help you lean out and balance the boat,
hook your feet underneath the toe straps.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.580
The left hand side of the boat is called the
port side.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.969
And the right hand side the starboard side.

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:14.840
In front of the boat is called ahead, and
behind the boat is called astern.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:20.930
The side of the boat under the boom is called
the leeward side, and the side of the boat

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.620
opposite the boom is called the windward side.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.950
As you change tack or gybe, the windward and
leeward descriptions change sides as well.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.470
All the other descriptions remain as they
were.

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:44.260
Boat and wind speeds are measured in knots,
and one knot is 1.85 kilometres per hour.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.890
Understanding what all the parts of your boat
are called will help you to understand better

00:02:47.890 --> 00:03:15.959
the other training videos on this site.
