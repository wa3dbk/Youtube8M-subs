00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:05.880
Hi! I’m James Adams and I’m here on behalf
of expertvillage.com, and now we’re going

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.030
to talk about IDE hard drives, which are the
older kind. You’ll find them in every single

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:18.880
computer from the 80’s, 90’s and nowadays.
These ones are a little trickier to install.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.730
First thing you’ll notice is I got these
two cables on the table; this one is thin,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:30.450
this one is well it’s kind of parallel it’s
fat and these two cables are exactly the same.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.030
All it is this one is a little more expensive;
it’s made for air fluid indicates. It’s

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:43.260
just fancier cable, it’s a fancier version
of this one. These two cables have one thing

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.590
in common and that is that each one of these
cables has three different connectors. You’ll

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:56.210
see there’s one, there’s one right here
and then there’s one right here and these

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:03.520
connectors determine like where the hard drives
go, first you need to identify which ones

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:09.810
go to the hard drives so you’ll notice that
these first two are really close together

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.830
and that the third one is really far apart.
This one that is far apart, goes to the motherboard

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.350
on the computer. These ones you know that
are close together these actually go to the

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.200
hard drive. Same cases these two are close
together, this one’s far apart, it goes

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.950
to the motherboard. One very important thing
to know is your windows hard drive will be

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.619
installed in this connector, which is called
a master, which it’ll be the first one.

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.150
Then we look at the second connector this
is called a slave. This will be for like let’s

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.270
say you have your windows hard drive installed
you want to have extra storage space you’ll

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.970
connect it to this one and finally the third
one goes to the motherboard and this one just

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:03.650
both goes in the motherboard. In determining
what you want to do with your hard drive determines

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.560
where it goes, like I said if your windows
hard drive crapped out and you need to put

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.180
a new one it’ll go on this connector, if
you need more storage it goes in this one

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.849
and if you need this one goes to the motherboard
on the computer.
