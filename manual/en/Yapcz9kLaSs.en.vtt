Hi I'm Casey and I'm here on behalf of Expert
Village in last segment I showed you how to

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.559
remove the wax strips. In this segment I'm
going to show you how to reapply if necessary.

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.839
So how to tell if when to reapply is after
you remove the waxing strips and you coudl

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.960
see just a little bit of hair that you didn't
get obviously waxed out. I can go ahead and

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.270
I'm going to reapply here. Down in here a
little bit you could see the little bit that

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:31.440
I didn't get I'm going to go ahead and put
the wax on the same way and then a little

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:52.659
bit right underneath. So I'm going to put
the wax just on those couple little hairs.

00:00:52.659 --> 00:01:03.190
Still making sure that my wax is not to thin
or to thick. I'm going to come in and just

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:20.829
get these little guys that I missed. Then
I'm goign to apply a little bit more come

00:01:20.829 --> 00:02:04.539
over to this side and I need just a little
bit just underneath the other eye. Stay tune

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:11.450
for the next segment which I'm going to show
you how to comb the eyebrows.
