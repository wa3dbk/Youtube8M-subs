00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.589
Hey Vsauce I'm Jake and if Star Wars were
to have happened in our universe and truly

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.500
occurred a long time ago in a galaxy far, far
away ... light from the actions in Star Wars

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.890
could be hitting Earth right now, or will
some day. So if we pointed a telescope at

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:21.919
the right far away galaxy .... could we see
Star Wars? Even if we choose the nearest spiral

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:27.109
galaxy to us, Andromeda, the requirements
and results for resolving individual planets,

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:34.109
people or ewoks turns out ... to be almost
as disappointing as the Phantom Menace.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.739
To make out the flag on our moon from earth
we would need a telescope that's 260meters.

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.289
If we wanted a clearer picture, one that
would show us the stripes, if they were still

00:00:45.289 --> 00:00:49.239
there, we would have to bump the size up to
6,850.

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:54.570
The biggest optical telescopes on Earth have
mirrors around 10meters and the largest one

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.730
planned, the aptly named European Extremely
Large Telescope, will be completed in 2022

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.880
and have a 39 meter mirror. Still a good deal
smaller than you would need to see the flag

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.530
on the moon.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.070
When you try and see small objects that are
good distances away, especially when they

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.340
have less light, it becomes much more difficult
to resolve. For example, here is the best

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.439
photo we have of Pluto, and this is a celestial
body in our own solar system and relatively

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:26.810
close at 4.2 billion km.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.969
So the reason we can take an amazing image
of Andromeda, 2.5million light years away,

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:37.950
is because we are looking at an object that
is an estimated 260,000 light years across

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.649
and contains a trillion stars. It has to do
with the relative size to distance where Andromeda

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.090
would be .1 or 200,000 times greater than
Pluto's.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.110
If we wanted to be able to see a planet or
satellite in a completely different galaxy

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.320
like Andromeda, you would need a pretty substantial
telescope. To be able to get a glimpse at

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.109
the forest moon of Endor, more than double
the size of Pluto we would only need a telescope

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:05.820
that was 6...wait for it... million 500 thousand
kilometers in diameter. About the size of

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.060
4.5 of our suns.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.260
But we want to actually see what is happening
on the planet. I mean, I want to look at an

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.739
Ewok with my own eye because they are adorable.
To produce a fairly detailed image we would

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:25.510
need something gigantic, something 1.7 light
years large. This telescope would surpasse

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.510
Voyager 1's current 18 billion km distance
and would be larger than our solar system.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.330
But here is when we run into a slight problem.
Bad Astronomy has a great piece about pointing

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.680
Hubble at Earth and trying to get a photo.
The resulting image would be blurry because

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.970
of how quickly it is orbiting. He likens it
to "trying to take a picture from a moving

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.909
car: nearby objects will streak by, but far
away objects appear to be moving slowly."

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.709
So even though Andromeda is spatially far
away, it is magnified to such a degree that

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.340
we'd probably get a very blurry Ewok. The
incredibly long exposure time the telescope

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.560
would need to collect enough photons to form
an image wouldn't help either and whatever

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:12.260
image we were able to produce would have a
blue hue since Andromeda is moving so quickly

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:17.560
towards Earth, at a rate of 300km a second,
that the light is blueshifted.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.680
Even light coming from people near you has
to travel a distance. Since lightspeed is

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.970
finite, at arms length you're actually seeing
a person 3 nanoseconds younger than they really

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.510
are. There is a constant flow of new, old
light being spread out across the Universe

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:36.680
so who knows what we might be able to see
next, maybe a galaxy far, far away.

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.600
And as always, thanks for watching.
