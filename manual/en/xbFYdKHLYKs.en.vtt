Minnesota.

This weighed 392.5.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.350
&gt;&gt; We're here today with Don at
the Iowa State Fair.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.860
Don, how many entrants did we
have today.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.500
&gt;&gt; We actually had 12 entries
but 10 that showed up.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.830
&gt;&gt; That's a pretty large field.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.830
&gt;&gt; That is.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.500
Normally we'll have five or six.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.850
The Lincoln weighs 385.5.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.680
&gt;&gt; Now as time goes on, have we
been seeing weights increase.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.380
&gt;&gt; They're going down.

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:05.079
The heaviest is 457 pounds.

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:10.560
Our heaviest ram is going to be
the nine year old cross bread

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.820
ram at 405 pounds.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.859
&gt;&gt; Tell us a little bit about
Frank here.

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:19.280
&gt;&gt; Frank's just been hanging
around on the farm after we

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.229
retired him from the breeding
herd.

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:24.450
And we just kept him on feed and
waiting for his big day at the

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:30.299
Fair here.

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:35.630
&gt;&gt; Our first coming into the
ring, this bora's name is happy

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.630

He weighs 988 pounds.

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:53.880
Just take him out and put him in
any pen over there.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.349
Their boar's name is Willie.

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:00.549
He's four years old, he loves
shelled corn.

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:04.639
He's a big pet, and don't you
all scratch him on the back or

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:07.880
he'll start wagging his tail at
you.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.260
He weighs 1, 067 pounds.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.760
This is a pure bred Yorkshire.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.810
His name is Wilbur, about five
years old.

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.010

250 pounds.

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.470
This one weighs 969 pound.

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.830

raised.

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:39.069
He eats about 20 pounds of feed
a day.

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.099
He loves bread and doughnuts,
and up to this point he's been

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.850
very easy to handle.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.680
1,103.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.090
This is your largest boar.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.510
&gt;&gt; Winner was just over 1100
pounds.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.510
How does that rank compared to
past years.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.540
&gt;&gt; It's about normal.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:03.599
We see about that same range
occasionally like last year, we

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.099
had one that went over 1300
pounds.

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:09.730
So on any given year but as
everybody knows, feed costs is a

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:14.499
little higher this year so these
bors didn't get as much feed.

00:03:14.499 --> 00:03:21.670
&gt;&gt; We got Jerry and Jake they
raised this year's biggest boar.

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.379
How long have you been in the
business.

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:26.379
&gt;&gt; Since 1979.

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:27.379
&gt;&gt; Is this your biggest boar.

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:28.379
&gt;&gt; First one, yes.

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:40.499
&gt;&gt; The one who remembers -- is
ad in February.

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:42.950

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:49.099
He's a pretty good size rascal.

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:54.040
He raise 3,032.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:57.050
&gt;&gt; We knew he would be up there
in the running.

00:03:57.050 --> 00:04:00.780
The other ones look pretty good
today.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.780
We weren't sure.

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.780
We've had him as a yearling.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:11.809
You got to feed them right when
you decide to bring them down.
