Hey guys Maxine here with AccessoryGeeks.com
and I have here in

00:00:05.968 --> 00:00:10.147
front of me the Otterbox Defender Series
Case for the Blackberry Playbook.

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:14.048
Now as you can see here like any other
Otterbox Case it is chalk full of

00:00:14.048 --> 00:00:15.720
protection for your devices.

00:00:16.113 --> 00:00:19.946
Now a little bit about this case,
there are 3 layers for you.

00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:24.869
This first layer is actually detachable
from the case itself and this pops off

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.376
here as you can see there is a bunch of
little contraptions that I will be going

00:00:27.423 --> 00:00:30.581
over in just a second.
But first just the basics of the case,

00:00:31.045 --> 00:00:36.386
this is a high impact polycarbonate shell
that you see lining the inside and then on

00:00:36.386 --> 00:00:43.723
the outside you have a impact absorbent
silicone that is made for absorbing shock

00:00:43.816 --> 00:00:50.571
and drops in caser you happen to you know
drop your Blackberry Playbook anywhere.

00:00:51.014 --> 00:00:56.587
This will absorb the shock and keep your
Blackberry Playbook safe from any damages.

00:00:56.959 --> 00:01:02.903
Now another thing about this case, it
also comes with a clear protective membrane

00:01:02.903 --> 00:01:10.287
touchscreen screen so as you can see here
this is actually covering the screen

00:01:10.287 --> 00:01:15.256
itself so that you can keep your screen
safe from scratches and dents alike and it

00:01:15.256 --> 00:01:21.200
will also help protect it from cracking
so you get a complete protection of the

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:28.770
device without compromising any of the
safety and as always with Otterbox the

00:01:28.863 --> 00:01:32.021
ports are buttons are also accessible as
you can see here the buttons on the top

00:01:32.021 --> 00:01:39.219
are still good to go.
There is a silicone tab covering the audio

00:01:39.312 --> 00:01:45.860
jack, there you go and then on the bottom
you also have your charging ports and HDMI

00:01:45.953 --> 00:01:52.408
output all covered thanks to the silicone.
Now earlier in the video I mentioned that

00:01:52.408 --> 00:01:57.284
the top of the case comes with
a bunch of compartments.

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:02.253
Now when you are not utilizing the top part
of the case to cover your screen you

00:02:02.346 --> 00:02:08.848
can set in the back of the device
and it snaps on as so.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.396
And as you can see here there is a sliding
tab for you to reveal your camera,

00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:21.711
should you happen to need it while you are using
your device and when you are not using it

00:02:21.804 --> 00:02:25.659
you can just slide that close and it will
protect the camera and keep it dust free.

00:02:25.984 --> 00:02:34.529
Now let's say want to utilize the front
part of your case is standingâ€” kickstand,

00:02:34.783 --> 00:02:36.386
you can do that as well.

00:02:36.687 --> 00:02:43.120
These top parts here will come up and as
soon as that is propped up you can use

00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:46.789
them to stand your playbook.

00:02:47.368 --> 00:02:53.476
Let's just prop that back up again and you
are good to go and it will keep your

00:02:53.476 --> 00:03:00.257
playbook in landscape mode for you.

00:03:00.303 --> 00:03:04.622
