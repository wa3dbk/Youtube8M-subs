00:00:11.856 --> 00:00:18.000
Being a new company in the community, we wanted
to partner with an organization locally

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.500
that would help us achieve not only our goals
but the community's goals.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.521
Anne Arundel Community College has a great
track record of developing curriculum and

00:00:25.521 --> 00:00:28.800
training their students for jobs in the field.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.600
Before we had even opened, we went and met with
the community college about our restaurants.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.267
And we ended up with a number of our recipes and
actually some of our chefs through that partnership.

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:42.131
AACC gave me the advantage to make me prepared.

00:00:42.131 --> 00:00:45.685
They gave me real-life situations in the
kitchen during our labs.

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:50.160
They made sure that we understood if we did 
something wrong on how to fix it, and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.908
basically how to present ourselves throughout
the entire process of getting a job.

00:00:53.908 --> 00:00:56.879
When this casino came here this was one of
the placed I wanted to be. 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:59.112
It was something new, something I've never
experienced before.

00:00:59.112 --> 00:01:04.000
They put me up against another gentleman that
had 20 years of banquet experiences in hotels.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.800
It really came down to execution, being
prepared, and the attitude I presented.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.866
That really was what gave me the competitive
edge, and I think that how AACC helped me

00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:17.310
prepare, is to give me all those tools to
set myself above the competition.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.200
The dealer school was the next evolution in
our partnership. 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.695
The college had an interest in an on-going 
program that would support not only us

00:01:24.695 --> 00:01:26.800
but all the other casinos that are in the area.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:32.715
That partnership has proved extremely valuable
as you can speak to 515 of the dealers 

00:01:32.715 --> 00:01:35.943
that graduated the program, and are 
now here gainfully employed 

00:01:35.943 --> 00:01:38.800
and starting their new career 
in the casino industry.

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:41.112
I just thought is was going to be a great
opportunity.

00:01:41.112 --> 00:01:45.645
I always thought dealers were interesting,
almost like characters.

00:01:45.645 --> 00:01:48.648
Because I was having a hard time finding a
job in today's market 

00:01:48.648 --> 00:01:50.236
and I was getting discouraged.

00:01:50.236 --> 00:01:53.200
The training was really intense.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.629
I feel like it was pretty much like a bootcamp.

00:01:55.629 --> 00:01:58.918
But the instructors, they guided you so well.

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:01.650
It was like nothing that they didn't tell you.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.850
They pulled me through it, taught me everything
little by little, and now 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:22.951
it was definitely worth giving it a shot.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.463
I feel confident and good on the table. 
I'm really enjoying being here.

00:02:11.463 --> 00:02:15.750
I think we were all very prepared for what
we have to do at the casino. 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.531
I think it's a great experience.

00:02:17.531 --> 00:02:20.400
For the amount of that money you make coming
out of school, 

00:02:22.951 --> 00:02:28.129
We are now directly employing 2400 people
in the casino business. 

00:02:28.129 --> 00:02:30.333
This is a career opportunity for people. 

00:02:30.333 --> 00:02:33.384
It's a big part of what's happening here 
in Anne Arundel 

00:02:33.384 --> 00:02:38.039
and we should make the education match 
to the extent that we can.
