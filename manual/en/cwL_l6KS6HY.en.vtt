00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.433
- You were so sweet.

00:00:01.433 --> 00:00:03.300
My design show on HGTV,

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.733
you Tweeted out, when you
were watching the design show.

00:00:05.733 --> 00:00:06.733
- Yes!

00:00:06.733 --> 00:00:08.300
- And then your wife
Tweeted out,

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.066
"Watching 'Ellen's
Design Challenge' on HGTV.

00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:13.866
"Scott Foley is drooling
over the tools they get to use.

00:00:13.866 --> 00:00:15.133
Nerd alert."

00:00:15.133 --> 00:00:16.600
- No, well--Thanks, babe.
- Yeah.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.866
But so--because you love
stuff like that.

00:00:18.866 --> 00:00:20.300
- I love that stuff.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.766
I mean, I'm a huge
HGTV watcher,

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:24.866
between "Fixer Upper"
and "House Hunters"

00:00:24.866 --> 00:00:26.866
and the reno guy.
- "Property Brothers."

00:00:26.866 --> 00:00:28.133
- I love it.
I love it all.

00:00:28.133 --> 00:00:29.833
And the fact that
you were gonna have a show on,

00:00:29.833 --> 00:00:31.566
like, we set the DRV,
and we TiVo'd it,

00:00:31.566 --> 00:00:34.100
and we watched it live,
and it is--

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.400
like, I just love that stuff.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.766
I build furniture myself,

00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:38.400
and, like,
I don't have great tools,

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.700
because I don't have the space
or I don't have the time or--

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:42.700
but every now and then
I get to do it, and I love it.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.200
And I thought your show
was so good.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.966
I wanna see
more construction though.

00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.100
- Well, you know--

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.433
- The second episode
had more than the first.

00:00:48.433 --> 00:00:50.566
- Yeah, it's brand-new,
so we're learning,

00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:51.900
and the next season
we're gonna have--

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.300
we've learned
all kinds of things,

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.933
but it's so fun to watch
people have a challenge

00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:57.633
and make furniture
in a short amount of time,

00:00:57.633 --> 00:00:59.400
and to see everyone's
different take

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.533
on what to make
out of something.

00:01:01.533 --> 00:01:03.300
- I think it's so smart, and,
you know, we love those shows.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.066
We love "Project Runway,"
and we love "Top Chef."

00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:07.033
So anytime people make things
in a competition,

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:09.000
I think it's great.
It just brings out that--

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.133
you see that artistic spirit,

00:01:10.133 --> 00:01:11.433
and to do it
with something I love,

00:01:11.433 --> 00:01:13.800
with furniture, and, like,
I love building houses,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.133
and I spent some time
with Habitat for Humanity,

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:19.000
and I just think it's so--
such a great thing.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.666
- I know, I actually thought
of the idea two years ago,

00:01:21.666 --> 00:01:23.033
and I thought,
I love furniture,

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:24.533
and why aren't we showing--

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.600
We see food competition shows,
we see fashion.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.066
- Yeah.

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:30.066
- But we don't see design
competition with furniture,

00:01:30.066 --> 00:01:33.400
and HGTV bought it,
and it's--and I--

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.166
I said I would watch it
even if it wasn't mine.

00:01:35.166 --> 00:01:36.966
It's such a great show.
- I think it's great.

00:01:36.966 --> 00:01:38.533
Who do you think's gonna win?
Do you know who's gonna win?

00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:39.700
- Of course I know
who's gonna win.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:40.933
It's my show.

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.233
- But I didn't know
how far ahead you were.

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:43.533
So it's not--
- No, we--

00:01:43.533 --> 00:01:45.633
And we only did six,
and so--

00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:47.066
but next season
we'll do more,

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:49.766
and we'll do different things
and guest judges.

00:01:49.766 --> 00:01:51.166
You have strong opinions.

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:53.233
I would love for you to be
a guest judge on one of them.

00:01:53.233 --> 00:01:54.833
- I would love
to be a guest judge.

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:56.933
- Because I want different
people's opinions on stuff.

00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:58.733
- I would love it.
I'm rooting for Tim right now.

00:01:58.733 --> 00:02:00.266
- Yeah, everybody is.
- Is that right?

00:02:00.266 --> 00:02:01.666
- I think so.
I think everybody--

00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:02.900
- Oh, good, 'cause he won
the first one

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.600
with that--the desk--
- The compass desk.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.933
- Yeah,
the George Washington desk.

00:02:05.933 --> 00:02:08.433
And then didn't do great
in the second,

00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:10.100
but I liked his bar
in the second one.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.433
- Yeah, I did too.
- I don't know.

00:02:11.433 --> 00:02:12.900
- And then Mark,
who went home the first time,

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.066
was really talented.
- I thought he was really good!

00:02:15.066 --> 00:02:16.733
- And he just made a mistake.

00:02:16.733 --> 00:02:18.866
But anyway, it's a good show,
and I'm glad--'cause I saw--

00:02:18.866 --> 00:02:20.433
- You shouldn't
have voted him off.

00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:23.000
- I did not.
I would not have voted him off,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.433
but he did make a mistake.

00:02:24.433 --> 00:02:25.800
And there's a bench
that you built

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.866
that I was really impressed.

00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:28.000
I think I wanna have you
on the show.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.166
- Oh, yeah?

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:30.266
- 'Cause you made this
out of a deck?

00:02:30.266 --> 00:02:31.333
You took a deck apart?

00:02:31.333 --> 00:02:32.733
- So when
we bought this house,

00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:35.300
there was a wooden, like
a play structure, swing set

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.033
for my kids that it was sort of
rotting and falling apart,

00:02:38.033 --> 00:02:39.600
and I took it down,
but I saved the wood.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.966
And we put up
a new swing set.

00:02:40.966 --> 00:02:42.700
But I just built this
out of the old one

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:44.766
to sit next to them.
- Wow, that's really impressive.

00:02:44.766 --> 00:02:46.700
- See, there's the one picture
my wife took that I don't love

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.200
where I'm not at a store.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.266
Thanks, babe.

00:02:49.266 --> 00:02:50.433
- I love the picture.

00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:51.833
I think that it's great.

00:02:51.833 --> 00:02:53.033
- I'm very proud of it.

00:02:53.033 --> 00:02:54.533
- And I'm proud that
you made that bench.

00:02:54.533 --> 00:02:55.933
I have something for you,

00:02:55.933 --> 00:02:58.133
and--'cause you're just
supporting my show

00:02:58.133 --> 00:02:59.800
and Tweeting out
about my show.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.766
So I wanna give you a project

00:03:01.766 --> 00:03:03.900
for whenever you want
to build something.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.400
Here are some tools and some--

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.033
- Oh, no!

00:03:08.033 --> 00:03:09.933
No, come here!
Stop it!

00:03:09.933 --> 00:03:11.366
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

00:03:11.366 --> 00:03:13.566
- No, I'm not kidding you.
- You gotta be kidding me.

00:03:13.566 --> 00:03:15.800
You can't give an actor
on a TV show tools.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.233
- I can.
And there's your tool belt.

00:03:18.233 --> 00:03:19.633
You have a tool belt, right?

00:03:19.633 --> 00:03:21.933
- I'll put that on right now.
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah.

00:03:21.933 --> 00:03:23.666
- This is for Konrad.

00:03:23.666 --> 00:03:25.133
Here, if he--
- Oh, no way!

00:03:25.133 --> 00:03:27.066
- He's got a tool belt.

00:03:27.066 --> 00:03:29.633
- Babe, so cute.
- He's got a tool belt as well.

00:03:29.633 --> 00:03:31.333
- So cute.

00:03:31.333 --> 00:03:32.833
- Oh, my--Do these work?
They work.

00:03:32.833 --> 00:03:34.933
So cute.
He can help me.

00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:36.766
- Okay, and I have--
I have something else also.

00:03:36.766 --> 00:03:38.666
Isn't that adorable though?
- It is adorable.

00:03:38.666 --> 00:03:39.933
- I should give one
to all your kids.

00:03:39.933 --> 00:03:41.500
It's not fair to just
give the baby something,

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:42.966
'cause they'll get jealous.

00:03:42.966 --> 00:03:44.166
- They're already jealous.
They'll be all right.

00:03:44.166 --> 00:03:45.266
- All right.
- Does this look all right?

00:03:45.266 --> 00:03:46.666
- It's fantastic.
- Okay.

00:03:46.666 --> 00:03:48.666
- All right, also you know
the last challenge I gave you

00:03:48.666 --> 00:03:50.766
to put something
on the set on "Scandal"

00:03:50.766 --> 00:03:52.266
and would give you $10,000

00:03:52.266 --> 00:03:53.633
towards the charity
of your choice?

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:54.966
- Yeah.
- I have one more challenge.

00:03:54.966 --> 00:03:56.633
'Cause you're always
in underwear, always.

00:03:56.633 --> 00:04:00.666
So if you can somehow put on
Ellen underwear in the show,

00:04:00.666 --> 00:04:06.466
I'll give you $10,000
to the charity of your choice.

00:04:06.466 --> 00:04:08.766
- $10,000 to the charity
of my choice

00:04:08.766 --> 00:04:10.166
if I wear Ellen underwear.

00:04:10.166 --> 00:04:12.033
Shonda Rhimes,
we gotta find a way

00:04:12.033 --> 00:04:14.200
to put this Ellen underwear
in "Scandal."

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:16.300
- For sure.
It's to charity, Shonda.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.666
Come on.
- Do you--

00:04:17.666 --> 00:04:20.233
This is--There's so many
pairs of underwear here.

00:04:20.233 --> 00:04:22.133
- Well, you get to choose
which one you wanna wear.

00:04:22.133 --> 00:04:23.766
- Oh, good.
- You're always in underwear.

00:04:23.766 --> 00:04:25.466
- Well, I mean,
if I could choose,

00:04:25.466 --> 00:04:27.200
I mean,
it'd be that one, right?

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.533
- All right, yeah.
- But I have a feeling

00:04:28.533 --> 00:04:30.166
this one's probably gonna
have a better shot.

00:04:30.166 --> 00:04:32.233
- No, I would rather--
Whatever you want, okay?

00:04:32.233 --> 00:04:33.733
- Okay, okay, great.
- But do it on the show,

00:04:33.733 --> 00:04:35.666
$10,000 to the charity
of your choice.

00:04:35.666 --> 00:04:37.000
- Deal.
