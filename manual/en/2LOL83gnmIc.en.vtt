00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.170
For those who missed out on the message last
week, I was away due to a friend's wedding

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.990
- it was at a winery, so you'll have to forgive
me for taking the time off to indulge myself

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.750
with copious amounts of fermented juice.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.590
In other news, I've also picked up an iPad
3 for our office, which means instead of the

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:28.500
sporadic use I've had for testing purposes,
we can finally start recording footage.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:34.220
It's good news all-round so lets jump right
in to the Friday Wrap-Up for the 6th of July,

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.220
2012.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.250
We only briefly touched on the E3 rumors of
Capcom developing an iOS version of their

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.739
latest fighting title, but the developer has
since confirmed that the game is in production

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.020
and scheduled for a Summer release.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.750
For those wondering, the game will undergo
some tweaks to suit the platform, notably

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:55.159
the tag system has been revised to focus on
one member as the primary, with the secondary

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.110
character having a limited time with which
they can be 'tagged in'.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:02.600
I can't wait to test this bad-boy out when
it's released!

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.040
Ravenous Games hit a vein of juicy platforming
gold when they released League of Evil and

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.530
its sequel, and now they're back with a new
platformer, albeit one that steps back in

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:13.400
to a more traditional role.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.430
Random Heroes is available as a free Flash
title and extends their original gameplay

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.250
by making levels larger, adding more weapons,
and even a boss battle or two.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.080
With any luck the iOS version will see advances
over the Flash version, but we'll just have

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.180
to wait and see.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.770
Chalk this one up as being intriguing thanks
to its trailer alone - Button Brigade places

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.490
you in the role of a mechanized worm that
is attempting to escape a labyrinth and to

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.090
do so you'll need to possess 'buttons' to
perform special actions in the level.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.460
It's ostensibly a puzzler, but the mix of
action elements makes it look like it will

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.280
keep you hooked instead of falling asleep
at the wheel.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.240
Although two weeks have passed, we've had
some hot contenders for the top spot, but

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.310
partly because I'm lazy and also because it
deserves the limelight, I'm going to award

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.440
it to only one this week.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.100
Squids Wild West is the game Squids really
deserved to be from the outset and extends

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:07.840
the basic gameplay, giving it depth and complexity
thanks to all new hazards, unique distinctions

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.200
between the heroes and balancing that means
progression is reliant on your skills in each

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.049
level, not on how much you're willing to farm
to out-level things.

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:20.290
Although it's not a traditional turn-based
RPG, Squids Wild West retains the spirit of

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.959
classic titles, while also having a focus
on fun mechanics and an interesting storyline.

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:30.900
For $0.99 it's an absolute steal - even if
you haven't played the original.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.299
For those wondering, yes, the new iPad means
we'll be able to provide even better examples

00:02:35.299 --> 00:02:40.389
of gameplay, though it will obviously take
us some time to work it in to the videos smoothly.

00:02:40.389 --> 00:02:45.049
For now, keep a look out for our review of
Magic The Gathering 2013 and have a great

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:51.199
weekend!
