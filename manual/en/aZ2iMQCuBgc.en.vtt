00:00:01.108 --> 00:00:03.200
Hi everyone, this is Mike at BrashMonkey

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.840
And today's quick tip tutorial is about
starting a Spriter project from scratch.

00:00:08.148 --> 00:00:11.131
Now the first thing I usually do in creating

00:00:11.222 --> 00:00:13.817
artwork, that I'll be animating in Spriter

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:22.411
is to just quickly sketch out the
overall character or object in sort
of a default or idle position

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.250
And one thing I recommend... (of course
it's not necessary but still there
are some definite benefits to it)..

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:30.240
is to actually work about

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.540
what would I do is work four times the
size of the actual resolution I need

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:38.650
And I do this because it allows
me to work very quickly

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:42.114
and so, broadly
and a little sloppier...

00:00:42.171 --> 00:00:44.300
than if I were working at actual size

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.514
Where I really would have to pay attention
to almost every pixel very carefully

00:00:48.594 --> 00:00:54.354
If you work really large, then when it
gets reduced to really sort of automatically cleans up your work quite a bit.

00:00:54.537 --> 00:00:58.350
The other nice thing about
working at a larger size

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.480
Is that if it turns out you
end up needing larger versions
of the artwork or animations

00:01:04.582 --> 00:01:10.388
For a higher resolution version
of the game later or for just
marketing or you've already done

00:01:10.468 --> 00:01:13.245
The vast majority of, you know,
all of the work for that

00:01:13.725 --> 00:01:17.070
Now once you have your
object or character...

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.830
fully sketchet out, its the right size,
and the right general design..

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.080
the next thing you're going
to want to do is to start sort of

00:01:24.308 --> 00:01:27.960
cutting him up into
individual body parts, um,

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.748
that you're going to need

00:01:29.954 --> 00:01:36.365
to, um, sort of reassemble in Spriter so
that they can each independently
be moved and rotated and stretch.

00:01:37.268 --> 00:01:42.520
And once you cut up your um,  your
character or object into different pieces

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.685
what I do (and it will be explained
in another video that I will link
to in the description of this video)

00:01:48.948 --> 00:01:52.580
um, I rotate them so they're
all sort of lying flat

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.670
and  sort of facing to the right

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:55.710
as you can see here..

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.965
So here's all of the separate parts of
this crab characters that I'll need to animate

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.165
um...and I rotated them before
I started cleaning them up..

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.090
and then all I need to do
is just sort of trim them...

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.337
just crop them all as separate images
and save them out into a folder.

00:02:16.148 --> 00:02:20.890
And as you might see in the
other and video that I'll be linking to

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:28.720
you might not necessarily. In fact you most likely don't need to do this process of rotating the pieces before you clean them up

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.290
but you'll see in the other
video why I tend to do it...

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.674
It just gives you more animating
freedom down the line.

00:02:34.765 --> 00:02:38.620
Nowonce you save out all of
your individual body parts as

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.525
24-bit PNG images with
transparent backgrounds,

00:02:42.605 --> 00:02:45.920
you're going to end up with a folder
that looks something like this

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.020
however, you'll see this folder already
has a Spriter file in this temporary file

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.530
Because I already
I have made this Spriter file

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.057
And because I have it open in
Spriter there is this file here..

00:02:58.251 --> 00:03:04.022
But aside from that you'll
have an image folder with
your different body part images in it

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.330
Now what you can do
before getting into Spriter,

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.268
If you really have a lot of
different parts going on..

00:03:11.394 --> 00:03:13.828
it might be worth your while to

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.460
sort of devide your
images into sub-folders.

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:21.980
So maybe I have a folder called
head, a folder called legs, a
folder called clothes for instance...

00:03:22.137 --> 00:03:26.137
That can make it easier to sort of
stay organized in Spriter

00:03:26.388 --> 00:03:29.702
and to find your specific

00:03:29.862 --> 00:03:31.920
body part images more quickly.

00:03:32.822 --> 00:03:37.970
And don't forget you can actually... you
don't have to get to a perfectly clean up

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.057
state with all of your body part images
because of course you can load them
back into an image editor at any time,

00:03:44.125 --> 00:03:48.490
clean them up, or edit them and then
save them back and reload them into Spriter.

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:53.100
So you're not forced to work
with an unchangeable image

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:59.220
You can even leave them purposefully
quite rough to save yourself some
time to perfect your animations...

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.740
and make sure in general that the images
are roughly what you need

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.920
and then clean them up when you're
otherwise done or close to finished..

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.508
with the animations.

00:04:09.017 --> 00:04:13.108
But anyway, once all of the
images are cut up and

00:04:13.314 --> 00:04:16.685
appropriately trimmed, 
and all in the same, um,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.150
all in one main folder

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.897
or in sub folders within
one main folder

00:04:22.045 --> 00:04:23.828
You're ready to start up Spriter.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.590
So when you start up Spriter it's going
to look something like this

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:30.450
And what you're going to want to do

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.011
Choose File &gt; New Projects

00:04:34.171 --> 00:04:38.350
And then it's telling you you need to
choose the project folder for your..

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:40.617
new Spriter project, and you just

00:04:40.925 --> 00:04:44.840
navigate to that folder to you created

00:04:44.845 --> 00:04:48.750
that has all of your images, or all of
your sub-folders with  images in it.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:54.380
So in this case,that is called "CrabSpriter".

00:04:54.388 --> 00:04:55.850
So I select that folder,

00:04:55.851 --> 00:04:59.820
and now you'll see all of my
images, are ready to start to use...

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.937
And now I'm ready to start animating.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.420
But I will non't be working on
an animation in this video.

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.650
What I'll be doing is linking
in the description of the video

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.565
To other tutorials that I've
already made that can take you
from where this video leaves off.

00:05:17.051 --> 00:05:19.234
And that's it.  Thanks a lot for watching!
