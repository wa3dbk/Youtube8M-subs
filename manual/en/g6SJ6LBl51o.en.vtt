00:00:02.049 --> 00:00:04.138
(train whistle blows)

00:00:06.307 --> 00:00:09.573
Voiceover: On a barren
stretch of prairie 600 miles

00:00:09.573 --> 00:00:12.905
west of St. Louis, a crew
laying rails for the first

00:00:12.905 --> 00:00:15.954
transcontinental railroads
stopped long enough for

00:00:15.954 --> 00:00:19.071
Alexander Gardner to make this photograph.

00:00:19.071 --> 00:00:21.988
Once this railroad was
completed, travelers no longer

00:00:21.988 --> 00:00:24.763
had to spend months crossing
rivers and mountains

00:00:24.763 --> 00:00:27.738
and prairies on horseback and then wagons.

00:00:27.738 --> 00:00:30.987
They could journey from the
east coast to California

00:00:30.987 --> 00:00:33.321
in just a few days.

00:00:33.321 --> 00:00:36.039
The development of the railroad
paralleled the invention

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:39.405
of photography, together
and independently.

00:00:39.405 --> 00:00:41.879
These two innovations
introduced people to an

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.088
entirely new way of seeing the world.

00:00:45.088 --> 00:00:49.549
Assistant Curator of
Photographs, Anne Lyden.

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:52.556
Anne: It's hard for us to
imagine today in this of

00:00:52.556 --> 00:00:56.763
technological world, but
during the 1860s traveling

00:00:56.763 --> 00:01:01.033
at speeds of 30-40 miles an
hour, it was really quite

00:01:01.033 --> 00:01:04.130
revolutionary and it completely altered

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.569
people's sense of space and distance.

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:10.118
Voiceover: In Europe, the
railroad was a unifying

00:01:10.118 --> 00:01:13.034
element connecting cities
and towns, places that

00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:16.533
people lived, worked or
vacationed. This film, from the

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:20.114
1890s shows the simplicity
of commuting by train

00:01:20.114 --> 00:01:22.866
between urban centers and
recreational destinations

00:01:22.866 --> 00:01:26.450
like La Ciotat in the South of France.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.033
In England, where the steam
locomotive was invented,

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:32.093
railroads emerged from
an industrial background.

00:01:32.093 --> 00:01:34.366
They are the main impetus
for the growing network

00:01:34.366 --> 00:01:36.511
of railroads, was the
efficient transportation

00:01:36.511 --> 00:01:39.617
of raw and manufactured goods.

00:01:39.617 --> 00:01:42.342
In America, however, tracks
were laid across an entire

00:01:42.342 --> 00:01:45.534
continent through vast
areas of wilderness to unify

00:01:45.534 --> 00:01:48.645
the country. The railroad
reflected the expansion of a

00:01:48.645 --> 00:01:51.414
growing empire and together
with railroad photography,

00:01:51.414 --> 00:01:54.199
drew people west, both as
tourists and as permanent

00:01:54.199 --> 00:01:57.417
settlers. This photograph
of an engine decorated with

00:01:57.417 --> 00:02:00.699
antlers outside a Wyoming
train station emphasizes the

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:02.950
American pioneer spirit.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.511
Anne: Many railroad
photographs were made as

00:02:04.511 --> 00:02:08.346
promotional images celebrating
the adventure of travel.

00:02:08.346 --> 00:02:11.350
Photographer William Henry
Jackson made this portrait

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:13.645
of a well-dressed traveling
party on the Colorado

00:02:13.645 --> 00:02:16.587
Midland Railway in an
attempt to seduce potential

00:02:16.587 --> 00:02:20.312
travelers. He framed the
image with a tunnel carved out

00:02:20.312 --> 00:02:23.730
by explosives and
inadvertently documented the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.312
workers' struggle that made
it possible for the faint

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:30.062
passengers to travel in luxury.

00:02:30.062 --> 00:02:32.312
Photographers such as
Jackson celebrated the

00:02:32.312 --> 00:02:34.896
engineering accomplishments
of the railroads.

00:02:34.896 --> 00:02:37.175
Boring through mountains
and building bridges and

00:02:37.175 --> 00:02:39.897
trestles over creeks and canyons.

00:02:39.897 --> 00:02:42.117
The laborers employed by
the railroads however,

00:02:42.117 --> 00:02:45.166
often risked and
sometimes lost their lives

00:02:45.166 --> 00:02:47.819
to complete these projects.

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.191
This striking photograph by
Carlton Watkins focuses on

00:02:51.191 --> 00:02:54.444
an impressive trestle near
Sacramento, California.

00:02:54.444 --> 00:02:56.404
Presenting the grandeur
of this engineering

00:02:56.404 --> 00:02:59.572
achievement by including
some of the 12,000

00:02:59.572 --> 00:03:01.740
Chinese workers who
helped build the Central

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.150
Pacific Railroad, it also tells
the story of immigrant labor.

00:03:06.191 --> 00:03:08.690
Ann: At first the public
was suspicious and a little

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.961
fearful of trains. The
noisy, smoking, steam

00:03:11.961 --> 00:03:14.880
producing locomotive was so unfamiliar.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.869
Photography was used to
dispel any concerns and

00:03:17.869 --> 00:03:21.538
answer any curiosity should
regarding the railroad.

00:03:21.538 --> 00:03:24.707
It was integral in
encouraging people to travel.

00:03:24.707 --> 00:03:26.941
Though the novelty of
steam engines faded and the

00:03:26.941 --> 00:03:29.064
public no longer feared or marveled at the

00:03:29.064 --> 00:03:31.882
railroad, twentieth-century
photographers were still

00:03:31.882 --> 00:03:34.569
attracted to the subject.

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.685
They created photographs
that celebrated the

00:03:36.685 --> 00:03:39.649
abstract qualities of
these beautiful empire

00:03:39.649 --> 00:03:41.085
machines in sumptuous detail.

00:03:41.085 --> 00:03:43.520
