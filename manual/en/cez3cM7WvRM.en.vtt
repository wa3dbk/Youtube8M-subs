Link in the description for the fuse i used for this repair

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.740
Hello, and welcome to Shane's main shop today. I'm doing a quick video on how to change the fuse and your kitchenaid dishwasher

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:14.470
[so] stay tuned

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:21.760
Okay, these are the things you're going to need first of all this is what the new fuse looks like it comes with this little

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.369
plastic Protector

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:31.749
You'll see where that goes once we get in there it also comes with these zip ties in the kit as well as this adapter

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.480
And I'll show you what this is used for as well

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.720
you may not need it in yours I did not need it mind these the plugs that go on to the

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.010
fuse

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.010
[probably] some of the original ones

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.369
[and] they came from the factory did not have these plugs, so the company when you buy the new fuse provides this little adapter

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.989
Connection unit here you can use if you have to all right so let's

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:02.379
Get the dishwasher open here, and we'll show [you] how to fix it you also need a star bit

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:08.079
okay, one of the things you want to do first is locate your model and

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.649
Serial not serial number, but the model number [of] your unit. This is a kitchenaid dishwasher and

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.240
Model number for these units [are] just inside the door on the left hand side on the strip and this particular one is

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.790
a que ud

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.390
S01 I

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.439
Lw

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.779
[h6] so that's the one we're going to be showing you how to replace the fuse in and

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.169
How I knew the fuse is gone is the whole unit went Dead

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:40.270
Nothing was working at all on it

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:41.780
And I'll show you what I did to

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.909
Determine that it was acts of the fuse by jumping across to see if it would come on

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.000
so one of the first things you want to do is unplug the unit of course and

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:59.500
Then get the wrench out that I talked about earlier all around the door here. There is several of these hex screws in

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.269
you only need to take out the top few in this particular model because

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:11.169
use is behind this front panel, and I got them all [out], but one I'll just take this last one all really quick and

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:15.819
I use these stand up in kind of hold it with your legs, so it doesn't drop out

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.590
off the front

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.300
Once you have that out. You can see this front tips away here. I?

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.569
Will adjust the camera here so we can see

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.630
What I'm talking about

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.180
Actually, you can almost see it anyways

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:42.329
so if you can see right here in behind this here's your fuse right here, and

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:50.760
These two wires are original to the dishwasher some units are wired directly to the fuse. So you can't replace it

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.590
without cutting the wire

00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:00.239
And that's why they provide this so if you have to cut the wire the two cut ends in your dishwasher get placed inside here

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.759
Screw down tight that gives you two plugs to plug into your new fuse

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.679
[when] you install it in my case the original one had the fuse on the original one had the plugs already available

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.610
So I didn't have to put that

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.610
piece in

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:19.739
Again, this is the fuse itself right here

00:03:20.859 --> 00:03:27.659
It's hard to see but there is a little lip [right] here, [and] that actually clips in here locks in place

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:32.249
You can just use a screwdriver to get down and behind there. It'll pop [right] out

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.179
[I] just pull the two wires off put them put your new one in

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.920
Pop it two wires back on plug it unit back in and you're good to go

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.140
it's as simple as that and [this] is like a

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.689
$15 part, but if you hide something to replace this probably gonna cost you like 50 bucks

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.399
So once you have that done this also goes in at the same time

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.790
Here's the old one I can show you it actually slides on that lip. I just showed you earlier

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:06.719
Like so and then it clips on and it just protects these connections when you put it back in from hitting anything

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.690
So there it is very simple

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.279
Once you have all that in place. [just] hold this down you put

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:16.419
your front

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:17.590
control

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:19.590
piece back in Place

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.910
Replace your screws

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:30.460
Okay, a couple things

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.819
I forgot to show you while I was opened up is how I test it

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:37.989
When I pull these off the original fuse it was inside there

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:44.919
I just put a jumper wire across here and here plug the dishwasher in just for a second all the lights came on and

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.859
So I knew it was a fuse because when this was plugged in the fuse to plug this question nothing [was] happening at all

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.319
so if you put a wire between these two

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:59.109
And just don't leave it obviously on for a long time because you're bypassing your fuse

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:04.449
Plug it in your lights all come on. You know right away. The fuse is ago this helps out

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:11.620
