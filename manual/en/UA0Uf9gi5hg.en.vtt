00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:27.100
Finn Mac the finest automated machines

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.890
manufacturing machines to produce

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.360
chocolate ice cream popsicles and gelato

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:42.250
in a mac

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.190
hello and welcome to the match today

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.840
we're going to discuss Pro 16 row 16 is

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.670
like the proform which is a little

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.140
bigger you can produce up to 120 litres

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.640
per hour ago 16 is used by ice cream

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.140
makers with a little bit more experience

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.050
would like to increase the production

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.680
and possibly distribute 416 is very

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:11.560
durable easy to use clean and maintain

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.420
and stainless steel just like the pro

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:18.550
for it's very easy to use

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.360
prepare your recipe mixture pour it into

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.750
the front of machine close the lid set

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.190
your temperature

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:29.470
wait for your ice cream picture into

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.050
delicious ice cream when the machines

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.390
done an alarm will sound to let you know

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:36.600
mixtures rate

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.640
simply then extract into a tub or into a

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.280
box distribution

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.180
you can put in display display cases in

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.180
front of your shop or putting boxes

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.909
close it up and send it out stories

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:59.569
to remove heat from the enclosure is

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:01.640
required to use a water circulation

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.950
system that passes through the ice cream

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.229
machine and is pumped into the water

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:08.690
cooling tower the tower should be

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:11.239
located outside the grounds usually in

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.150
high well-ventilated areas using this

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.280
system has a huge advantage because

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.049
water can be maintained at a temperature

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:21.440
lower than that of air keeping your

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.750
machine that is required cold

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.530
temperature pro 16 can produce ice cream

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.180
fresh society and frozen yogurt today

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.810
injury is going to produce fresh green

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.190
apple ice cream

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:40.220
let's watch as measuring demonstrates

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.260
how to use no 16 major has prepare the

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:48.829
ingredients and now she's going to bore

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:50.810
the ingredients into the front of the

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.560
Machine depending on the order of your

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.340
ice cream

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.010
starting from light colors to darker you

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:59.900
can do more than one flavor without

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.989
turning off the compressor this is very

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.049
energy saving and we recommend this

00:03:06.049 --> 00:03:13.420
compared to our other competitors

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.340
fixtures going into the front of the

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.239
tank and now closing the lid now we are

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.840
turning on the machine and setting the

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.720
temperature today at minus 7.5 this

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.330
separates us from our competitors who

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.200
normally set the time as opposed to the

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.450
temperature was setting the time you get

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:44.260
variations in your ice cream cinemax

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.269
sense the temperature and you're always

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:48.489
going to have consistency that your ice

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:54.960
cream will reach that temperature

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.830
your product once the Machine reaches

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:00.750
the correct temperature alarm will sound

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:02.790
and your ice cream is ready to come out

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.590
now

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.140
the doors are open and we can see the

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.900
ice cream coming out at full force at a

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:17.010
high speed dumping into the tub and

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.920
preparing yourself to with this in your

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:28.380
storefront or a showcase you and now you

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.970
can see we're dumping the second mixture

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.370
in without cleaning up the tank because

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.770
we can use a darker color after using a

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:41.130
lighter color and again the product at

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:44.430
the fittest final stage there you have

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.120
about eight minutes you have your

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.720
product weeks put in the tubs ready to

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.170
serve your display case or put in

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:57.660
containers close it up and distribute

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:05.460
exactly one hour 120 meters

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:07.129
