00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.620
Some students come straight from a BA programme

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.133
and you can actually see their focus

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:15.160
and whether they could take
the ideas from their BA study on to an MA programme

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.180
or you get people from
industry who've been working for a while

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.230
and they want to come back and research various areas.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.300
The thing about MA studies is that students really have to understand what research culture actually is

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.820
and working independently.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.026
Here we go into the nine designs that I chose to have as part of my range...

00:00:36.026 --> 00:00:44.560
First and foremost you're assessing their ability to work in a kind of mature way with their tutors or their professors

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:52.180
and they can actually take forward their ideas in a more independent way without constant supervision.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.190
They have a starting point for their study

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.120
and they have raised questions that are actually interesting questions.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.440
Doesn't have to be questions that we would raise

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.000
but the questions they find interesting in a personal way.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.640
What are your areas of research?

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.020
I'm exploring autobiography in film...

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.640
It's about mastery

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.600
you don't do an MA in a subject about which you know nothing.

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:24.689
If you've done a BA in graphic design
you wouldn't apply for an MA in textiles

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.511
because you would be starting at square one

00:01:28.511 --> 00:01:33.880
you'd have to have a range of skills appropriate to the MA.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.725
An MA is about you going back to something

00:01:36.725 --> 00:01:39.552
perhaps re-looking or taking it apart

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.260
or bringing new things into what it is you already know.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.541
Obviously on a BA
programme there's lots of research and evaluation

00:01:47.541 --> 00:01:52.060
but on an MA you're probably
going to be looking at a specific research question

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.820
and in your application
you'll be asked to probably pose a research question.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:00.200
It's very important as well the that they have a context

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:08.200
that they have researched and understand designers or artists that are working in and around that field

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:09.678
think about the methodology

00:02:09.678 --> 00:02:11.320
how they will develop and make

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.480
and they also need
to have a bibliography.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.333
That is as important as a portfolio as an MA applicant

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:24.660
because what I'm looking for is a student that has the ability to write, research, do a dissertation

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.400
and that academic level of entry.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.740
I would always advise students to ensure that when they are doing the study proposal

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.060
that they really research the college they are going for

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.260
they research the academics, the
texts and the papers the academics have done

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.300
and what the graduates are doing
afterwards.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:50.592
Once you get to the end of the BA course at the MA level

00:02:50.592 --> 00:02:53.240
instead of a portfolio being this thick

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.140
which you might get for foundation level

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:56.520
portfolio might be that thick

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.800
but the work behind it, the context,
the detail, the thinking is implicit in what you see.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:06.520
The exhibition was like this and the light came vertically almost showering down the wall...

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:12.140
Things tend to be very big portfolios on foundation and then gradually they get smaller and smaller

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:20.900
and for an MA you have a body of work and it has quite a particular voice.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.040
You are sharing projects that demonstrate
your current thinking

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:30.660
and in your supporting statements you're making it clear where your research might be.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.640
Clearly an applicant needs to have core skills

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.740
and if they are developing new ways of working three dimensionally

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.520
they have that capability to sort of make breakthroughs in a new and more original way.

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:46.220
We want to create specialists

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.280
we're not handing out MAs because it is easy to get.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.420
It's difficult to get an MA.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.440
I don't have to create fine art, it's probably curating film festivals...

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.080
curating film is a very new concept which I really want to undertake now...

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:02.000
The BA lend over a certain level

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.560
the MA is about how can I take this even further

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.340
how can I research, how can I develop this

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.920
I have skills already, I understand this field

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.920
but where can I take it from here?
