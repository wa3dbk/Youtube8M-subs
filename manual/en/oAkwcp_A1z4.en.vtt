00:00:01.768 --> 00:00:04.700
JASON SKLAR: Today on the show,
Shaquille O'Neal, Bob

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.570
Costas, and Brandi Chastain.

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.960
No, it's not an episode of Two
and a Half Men, it's the

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.240
Tweekly News and it starts
right after we light this

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.280
fake, highly flammable
Olympic torch.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.300
RANDY SKLAR: Do you always carry
a gray butane kitchen

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.230
fireplace lighter?

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.600
JASON SKLAR: Yeah, in case
I have to light a

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.624
fake Olympic torch.

00:00:28.624 --> 00:00:31.090
RANDY SKLAR: Hey, welcome to
the Tweekly News, the only

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.820
internet Twitter show that's not
afraid to tell Tim Tebow

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.160
to put his shirt back on.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.160
JASON SKLAR: I'm Jason Sklar.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.930
RANDY SKLAR: And I'm
Randy Sklar.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.000
JASON SKLAR: And go ahead
and follow us.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.320
We are @sklarbrothers.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.115
RANDY SKLAR: We're here taking
time off from filing our

00:00:41.115 --> 00:00:43.530
motion to get joint custody of
Michael Jackson's children.

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.990
JASON SKLAR: I'll take Blanket,
you take Paris.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.900
RANDY SKLAR: And we can share.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:47.280
That way if I lose Blanket--

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.575
JASON AND RANDY SKLAR: We'll
always have Paris.

00:00:48.575 --> 00:00:51.110
RANDY SKLAR: OK, check your
testosterone levels, people--

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.230
it's time to figuratively
pee in a cup.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:53.880
It's @sports.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:55.880
JASON SKLAR: Now, there was more
action on Twitter this

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.610
week than in the entire Olympic
village after dark.

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:59.320
RANDY SKLAR: Heyo!

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.190
JASON SKLAR: Andy Richter threw
some Costas love into

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:01.850
the Twitterverse--

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.370
RANDY SKLAR: "Of all the
Twilight vampires, Bob Costas

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.610
is the least threatening."
That's a good point, Andy.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.610
Costas may not have a reflection
when he looks in

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.430
the mirror, but at least he
belongs at the Olympics.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.320
He's been broadcasting
the damn thing since

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.290
before it was televised.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:17.180
JASON SKLAR: Whereas Seacrest
makes less sense than hundreds

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.350
of Mary Poppins trying to beat
down a giant goblin baby.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.055
RANDY SKLAR: With umbrellas.

00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:22.800
JASON SKLAR: Britney
Spears style.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.590
RANDY SKLAR: The first time
we saw Seacrest's Olympic

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:25.930
coverage, we tweeted--

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.450
"Seacrest out of his element."
No, Seacrest--

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.170
the country hasn't just voted,
and you're not tossing it down

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.000
to Vanessa Manilo
in Times Square.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.850
We need an actual journalist to
help us decipher what the

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.215
hell Bela Karyoli is saying.

00:01:38.215 --> 00:01:40.390
JASON SKLAR: Meanwhile, former
genie Shaquille O'Neal kicked

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.760
off the first day of the
Olympics with this gold medal

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.670
query-- "Can Michael Phelps
still get eight medals even

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:47.200
though he just came in fourth?

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.030
Let me know.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.050
And who was in the lead
regarding medal count?

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:51.000
I know it's us."

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.820
RANDY SKLAR: If you know it's
us, then why are you asking?

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.020
JASON SKLAR: And by the
way, when you asked,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.510
it was China, Kazaam.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:56.710
Hey, Sklardon the interruption,

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:57.580
it's time to re-learn.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:59.800
RANDY SKLAR: And just like EX
helps people re-learn life

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.720
without cigarettes with its
free quit plan, we learned

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.050
that the only thing more
entertaining than a cat fight

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.575
in an outdoor fountain is
a cat fight on Twitter.

00:02:07.575 --> 00:02:09.630
JASON SKLAR: This week, U.S.
Women's soccer goalie Hope

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.660
Solo used Twitter to rip into
former U.S. Soccer star Brandi

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:15.980
Chastain for her critical
analysis of the team's defense

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.030
during their 3-0 win
against Colombia.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.700
Hope tweeted, "It's too bad we
can't have commentators who

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.450
better represents the team and
knows more about the game

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.816
@brandichastain."

00:02:26.816 --> 00:02:29.060
RANDY SKLAR: For someone
defending her team's defense,

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.170
she sure sounds defensive.

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.170
JASON SKLAR: Here's
another Twitter

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.560
shot she took at Brandi--

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:36.310
"Lay off commentating about
defending and gking until you

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.080
get more educated
@brandichastain.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.310
The game has changed
from a decade ago."

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.630
RANDY SKLAR: Which had sports
blogs all over England buzzing

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.515
with the same refrain-- will you
two just shag and get it

00:02:47.515 --> 00:02:48.850
over with, please?

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.350
JASON SKLAR: Now, even though
each tweet maxes out at 140

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.210
characters, a cool Twitpic is
worth a thousand characters.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:55.680
RANDY SKLAR: This is Pic This.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.900
JASON SKLAR: Twitter savant Rob
Delaney tweeted out this

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.800
pic with the caption, "if you're
a comedian, this is the

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.570
worst possible thing to see
walking into your show."

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:04.380
RANDY SKLAR: And he's right.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.800
You should never wear a veil
with regular clothes.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:08.905
It's unnatural, like
marriage itself.

00:03:08.905 --> 00:03:11.080
JASON SKLAR: Well, we never
cease to be amazed by who has

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.970
a Twitter feed.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.390
That's why we've created
this segment--

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.200
JASON AND RANDY SKLAR: Blank
has a Twitter feed?

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.620
RANDY SKLAR: Now, much to my
chagrin I discovered that Taco

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.980
Bell has a Twitter feed.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.360
JASON SKLAR: Of course, the
only time you can enjoy

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.600
reading it is at 2:00 AM
when you're hammered.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.700
@tacobell tweeted, "last day!

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:27.190
Bring a friend and enjoy a free
Cantina Bowl or Burrito

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.060
when you buy one."

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.530
RANDY SKLAR: Taking a friend to
Taco Bell for a free item

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:33.370
is a great way of saying, we're
not good enough friends

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.885
for me to be seen with you
paying full price at Del Taco.

00:03:35.885 --> 00:03:37.340
JASON SKLAR: Well, you know
the old saying, Randy--

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:39.250
you take your friends to
Taco Bell and keep

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:40.460
your enemies at Chipotle.

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:41.900
RANDY SKLAR: I did not
know that saying.

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.190
JASON SKLAR: I just said it.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.776
RANDY SKLAR: Oh, OK.

00:03:43.776 --> 00:03:46.095
Now before we log off, it's time
for tweets to re-tweet,

00:03:46.095 --> 00:03:48.680
where we highlight tweets from
people we follow who we think

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.840
you should follow too.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.160
Our good buddy Patton Oswalt
tweeted out this

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.610
retail advice recently--

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.430
"if you're selling bed sheets
at a Chevron, you probably

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.360
don't need to bother announcing
the thread count."

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:59.200
JASON SKLAR: It's a good
point, Patton.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.910
And besides, everyone knows
it's better to get your

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:02.800
bedding from Meineke.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:05.155
RANDY SKLAR: Yeah, you go to
gas stations for flatware.

00:04:05.155 --> 00:04:07.520
JASON SKLAR: Flatware
and overpriced gas.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:09.820
Hey, thanks for logging onto
the Tweekly News and don't

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:10.820
forget to follow
@thetweeklynews.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.720
RANDY SKLAR: And for more of all
this ridiculousness, go to

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.579
BecomeAnEx.org/Sklar for
exclusive content, outtakes,

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.860
and more rest stop housewares
suggestions.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.595
JASON SKLAR: You know, I get all
my place mats at Pep Boys.

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:23.310
RANDY SKLAR: That's funny,
because I've always thought of

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:24.585
Pep Boys as a place
for ramekins.

00:04:24.585 --> 00:04:25.820
JASON SKLAR: It's ramekins.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.090
RANDY SKLAR: Ramekins alone.

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:30.054
JASON SKLAR: It's ramekins.

00:04:30.054 --> 00:04:31.280
RANDY SKLAR: The place
for ramekins.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:31.950
JASON SKLAR: Ramekins.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:32.790
It's ramekins.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:33.305
RANDY SKLAR: It's ramekins.

00:04:33.305 --> 00:04:33.920
JASON SKLAR: It's ramekins.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.750
RANDY SKLAR: It's ramekins.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:35.796
JASON SKLAR: You're wrong.

00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:38.710
Oh, I'm going to stay
at a, uh, at a--

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:40.400
RANDY SKLAR: At a Ramada Inn?

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.200
A Ram-ada Inn?

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.450
JASON SKLAR: What?
