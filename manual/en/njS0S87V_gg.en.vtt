00:00:00.096 --> 00:00:03.428
(low tempo music)

00:00:03.428 --> 00:00:05.890
(lively music)

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:07.678
- Today we're going on
the ultimate day trip

00:00:07.678 --> 00:00:08.879
from San Francisco.

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:12.168
We're going to wineries
in Napa Valley and Sonoma.

00:00:12.168 --> 00:00:14.291
Come on, let's go.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:16.158
There are like miles
and miles of vineyards.

00:00:16.158 --> 00:00:17.480
This is crazy.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.901
What's cool is that they actually take you

00:00:18.901 --> 00:00:20.561
into the vineyards.

00:00:21.561 --> 00:00:24.204
Look, there's a little baby grape.

00:00:28.891 --> 00:00:31.254
It tastes so different
right out of the barrel.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.580
This is for spitting out your wine,

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.445
but we're probably not going
to be using that today.

00:00:37.445 --> 00:00:39.645
This one's a cab sav.

00:00:39.903 --> 00:00:41.732
This one has tons of flavor.

00:00:41.732 --> 00:00:44.481
We call it a bouquet of flavor.

00:00:44.515 --> 00:00:45.714
Like...

00:00:45.714 --> 00:00:47.792
bing, bing, bing, bing.

00:00:48.294 --> 00:00:50.213
Now we're headed to the next stop.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.031
A little Chardonnay before lunch.

00:00:52.031 --> 00:00:53.681
So excited to eat.

00:00:53.681 --> 00:00:56.287
There's a two course
meal to get excited for.

00:00:56.287 --> 00:00:57.344
Wow.

00:00:57.344 --> 00:01:01.576
This is a tomato soup
with creamy saffron sauce.

00:01:01.632 --> 00:01:02.815
Mmm.

00:01:03.073 --> 00:01:05.538
These are home made ravioli.

00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:07.752
This is really good.

00:01:10.326 --> 00:01:11.159
Hi.

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.438
Can I get a raspberry twist?

00:01:13.858 --> 00:01:15.514
Looks so good.

00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:17.539
Look at that gem.

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:19.632
Isn't it crazy? Like look
at the texture, yeah.

00:01:19.632 --> 00:01:21.975
This is amazing.

00:01:24.696 --> 00:01:25.673
- [Voiceover] It's today.

00:01:25.673 --> 00:01:27.015
- [Voiceover] Oh, thank you.

00:01:27.015 --> 00:01:28.050
- [Voiceover] This is the first I got--

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.309
- Absolutely unbelievable.

00:01:29.309 --> 00:01:33.088
If you ever get to do a
tour in San Francisco,

00:01:33.088 --> 00:01:34.673
make sure you do the Vine and Dine.

00:01:34.673 --> 00:01:35.669
- [Together] Cheers.

00:01:35.669 --> 00:01:38.448
- The last stop of the day
is here in Sonoma Square

00:01:38.448 --> 00:01:40.561
where you can wander
around to some cute shops

00:01:40.561 --> 00:01:42.985
and have some cheese with your wine.

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:47.747
I suppose I must taste this.

00:01:47.747 --> 00:01:49.606
- [Voiceover] Just to be sure.

00:01:49.996 --> 00:01:52.834
- [Everybody] Cheers.

00:01:53.244 --> 00:01:57.289
- My glass is empty but
I had such a fun day.
