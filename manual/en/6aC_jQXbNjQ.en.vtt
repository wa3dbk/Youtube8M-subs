Hello everyone, my name is Tasha. Today on the show 
 we will be continuing our Christmas series

00:00:04.809 --> 00:00:06.624
with an Elf tart.

00:00:06.624 --> 00:00:11.687
I really love Elf the movie and I did not see it until I 
 was an adult. I didn't see it until later in my life anyway.

00:00:11.687 --> 00:00:16.094
But I love him because he loves sugar 
 as much as I love sugar.

00:00:16.094 --> 00:00:21.993
He also has this unshakable faith. It is partially 
 because his faith was planted in reality.

00:00:21.993 --> 00:00:27.851
He grew up working for Santa Claus. What if 
 you grew up working for Jesus Christ.

00:00:27.851 --> 00:00:34.659
You would have an unshakable faith too. He teaches us a lot. 
 To have an unshakable faith and to love people unconditionally.

00:00:34.659 --> 00:00:37.206
So lets get started on this Elf tart.

00:00:37.206 --> 00:00:41.172
We are going to preheat our oven to 350 degrees F today.

00:00:41.172 --> 00:00:44.844
And to a food processor, we are going to add in tortilla chips.

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:50.987
Add in enough tortilla chips until it is full and blend 
 it, blend it, blend it until it forms a flour.

00:00:50.987 --> 00:00:56.258
Blend enough to you have a 1 1/2 of tortilla chip flour.

00:00:56.258 --> 00:01:01.512
Once you have that done stir in 2 tablespoons of melted coconut oil.

00:01:01.512 --> 00:01:07.471
Press it around the sides and bottom of your 9 inch 
 tart pan and bake it for about 10 minutes.

00:01:07.471 --> 00:01:10.705
Now for all of you who ask, "Why 
 do you make the same crust everyday?"

00:01:10.705 --> 00:01:16.378
Because I love it and it works for me. 
 I love it and it works for me.

00:01:16.378 --> 00:01:21.148
If you want to make a different tart crust, you can. Like 
 I decided to do today and it was a disaster.

00:01:21.148 --> 00:01:27.497
So thank you very much. I know what I did wrong. 
 I did not blend my tortilla chips enough.

00:01:27.497 --> 00:01:33.271
You have to blend them very very fine so that they become 
 one instead of just stacking on top of each other.

00:01:33.271 --> 00:01:35.795
But I moved on and carried on anyway.

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:38.760
We are going to make our guacamole mole filling.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:44.560
Even though Elf loves sugar and so do 
 I, this is our first savory tart.

00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:49.480
Which is, congratulations for us. Savory is good. I like salt.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:56.660
To the food processor, you want to add in the meat 
 of two avocados, 1/2 small onion, 1 tablespoon lemon juice,

00:01:56.665 --> 00:02:03.000
1/2 teaspoon salt, a dash of pepper, and one 
 tomato with the pulp and seeds removed.

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:09.360
Blend that all together until it is very very 
 smooth. I usually like my guacamole very chunky,

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:15.440
but for some reason I decided to go with a puree just 
 to keep doing purees. I don't know why I did it.

00:02:15.435 --> 00:02:20.370
To make our Elf, we are going to use a 
 slice of bell pepper to create his jacket.

00:02:20.373 --> 00:02:26.480
So cut out the little arm holes and kinda shape out 
 the arms and then once you have that done

00:02:26.481 --> 00:02:30.420
and you have the tales. Cut it down the 
 middle so it looks like a jacket.

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:37.260
Place that onto your tart and then we are going to use a 
 slice of a yellow bell pepper to create his little pants.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:45.060
He looks so cute. I used a banana for his head and 
 then I used more green and yellow bell pepper

00:02:45.065 --> 00:02:53.100
for his shoes and for his hat. I used a red bell pepper to create 
 his little feather in his hat which I think is so cute and

00:02:53.102 --> 00:02:57.980
I sprinkle red bell pepper all around the sides just 
 so it looks festive and of the season.

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.690
I used a plum to create his belt and my belt does 
 not look as good as his belt because Elf is sharp.

00:03:04.687 --> 00:03:09.670
I don't care what yall say. He is dressed to 
 impress. He is going to the ball yall.

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:17.270
I used onion to create his collar and his cuffs and I 
 used a little more plum peel to create his eyes.

00:03:17.271 --> 00:03:22.070
And the flesh of the plum, flesh, to 
 create his curly curly jewish hair.

00:03:24.226 --> 00:03:30.860
Does that make it not Christmas? And I used the flesh 
 of the plum to create his curly curly hair.

00:03:30.861 --> 00:03:35.930
I really like this tart even though I wish the crust 
 turned out more crust like. It was still edible.

00:03:35.929 --> 00:03:42.940
I love raw bell so I ate those right on up. The guacamole 
 turned out decent for me to be winging it and

00:03:42.945 --> 00:03:47.160
for it to be like a tart puree and not a 
 like a chunky guacamole like I usually like it.
