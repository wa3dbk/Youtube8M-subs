00:00:03.130 --> 00:00:06.020
Second interviews are radically
different from first

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:08.470
interviews, and the reason
is quite simple.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:10.450
This is where a company
has to make a

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:12.160
sound business decision.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.670
Are you the person
that is going to

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.880
perform for their business?

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.370
Quite often, we hear a candidate
say after the first

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:19.630
interview, oh, it was great.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.240
Got on like a house on fire.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.330
It was like two mates
chatting in the pub.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:24.200
It was great.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.860
And then in the second
interview,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.060
god, they were horrible.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.470
They were completely different
to how they were

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.200
in the first interview.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.780
They were an ogre.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.580
Typically in a second interview,
there will be three

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.130
people in the panel that
will be assessing you.

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.600
There will be your line manager,
ther will be their

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.290
superior, the sales director
or the managing director,

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:46.740
depending on the size of the
business, and there'll be HR

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.920
to support them.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.960
It's really important that you
engage to each of those

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.320
decision makers.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.240
Quite often, we've had HR
complain to us that the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.250
candidate, all they did was talk
to the sales manager and

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.590
the sales director and
they were ignored.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.630
It's imperative that
you engage with

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.959
everyone in that interview.

00:01:04.959 --> 00:01:08.310
The detail is everything
in a second interview.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.740
In the first interview, you
might talk about a few facts

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:11.250
and figures.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.730
But first interviews are all
about personality, and

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.210
chemistry, and can I see you
fitting in with the team, and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.460
can I see me managing you, and
can I see you wanting to be

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.970
managed by me.

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.750
All those kind of things.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.080
In a second interview, it's
now can you do the job?

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.450
Do you have the skills, the
qualities, the experience, the

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.730
ability to perform
in our business?

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.010
So it's all in the detail.

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:34.550
You've got to know your facts.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.610
You've got to have done
extensive research, which I'm

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.100
sure you would have done anyway,
but you've got to know

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:40.360
your sales figures.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.350
You've got to be able to
talk about what was

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.430
your target last year?

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:45.500
How did you perform against
the target?

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.630
Walk us through a deal that
you've won recently.

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.940
Exactly where did you
get the lead from?

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.380
How did you progress it from
stage to stage throughout the

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.660
sales process?

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.110
You've got to prepare on that
kind of stuff, and ideally, go

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.020
into the meeting with Sales
Lead Tables, testimonials,

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.160
anything that can support
and backup your case.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:08.940
I'd also recommend putting
together a second interview

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.060
presentation, even if you
haven't been asked.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.570
I'll go into this in another
video, but the importance of

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.940
it, it will make you really
think do I want this job, and

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.250
it will really help you prepare
to ensure that you've

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.950
got the stats and the
information to deliver the

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.680
detail when asked.

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.390
Let's talk about money.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.170
It's not very English to talk
about money in any interview

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:35.260
stage, and probably only happens
in about 1 in 10

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.410
times, but they may well ask
you what kind of salary are

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.390
you looking for and what kind
of salary you'd accept and

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:43.380
questions like that.

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.600
So be prepared--

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.220
and again, on the website,
there's lots of advice on how

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:52.180
to overcome that and how to
negotiate effectively.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.810
What is important though, is
if you're working through a

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:58.160
third party, like Aaron Wallis,
use that third party

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.440
to negotiate on your behalf.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:04.170
Money is a very emotive thing,
and if you get it wrong, if

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.650
they get it wrong, there's going
to be a barrier now--

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:07.290
an obstacle--

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:08.680
before you've even started
with them.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.580
So if you're working through a
third party, use that third

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:13.130
party-- that's what they're
there for--

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.390
to negotiate what's right
for you and what's

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:17.460
right for the employer.

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:21.260
And finally, don't blow
it all by not closing.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:24.420
You're a sales professional in
a sales interview, you are

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:27.210
expected to close in some way.

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.760
And again, on this website there
is lots of information

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.040
about exactly how to close the
meeting, but the best way to

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.130
do it, an assumptive close.

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.930
How do you do it?

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:40.900
When you feel the interview is
winding down, ask questions

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:41.850
about your performance.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.020
Can you see me fitting
in with your team?

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.280
Do you feel that I have the
qualities and abilities to

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.230
succeed in your organisation,
and so on.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.460
Get them talking about your
performance and how

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.080
they think about you.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.900
If you feel it's right and you
feel that it is, your sales

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.360
instinct will tell you this.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.960
If it is time for a direct
close, by all means, do.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.650
But if not, look, I've really
enjoyed your time.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.130
I know I can do a fantastic job
for you, and I really hope

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.620
I get the opportunity of
working with you all.
