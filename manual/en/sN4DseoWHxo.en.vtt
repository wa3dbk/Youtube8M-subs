00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.000
In the car, it's really good having the Mini Mic 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
because you don't have to keep turning around when he says, 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
"Pardon, I didn't hear you." You know he can hear because you don't get that response. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
When I was in the kitchen with my sister talking about this, 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
he came and pulled Mini Mic off because I had forgotten I left it on 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and said, "I need to give this to my cousin, so that I can hear what she's saying." 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
So, yeah, it's quite remarkable.
(RICHARD): There was also an occasion when you 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
were outside and he was inside and with the window closed, 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
you just talked to him as though he was in the kitchen. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.440
The Mini Mic was better than normal hearing.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.000
I'd say it’s very suitable. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
There are so many advantages of using the Mini Mic; 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
just even around the house as you’ve said previously. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I use it when I'm cooking so that I'm in the kitchen, Elijah can be somewhere else. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The exhaust fan can be going on and he can still hear what I'm saying. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Whereas previously without the Mini Mic, I'd have to stop what I'm doing, 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.480
go, try to find him and then tell him what I was going to tell him. 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.000
So just in those sorts of situations, it's been a huge improvement. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
In the car, it's just been. . . that’s been fantastic 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
because previously you'd be driving and he wouldn't hear what you'd say 
so you'd have to turn around 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and quickly turn back, which is a little bit dangerous. 
Whereas now, there is absolutely no problem.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Things like just going to the park; it’s been a fantastic device there. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Elijah would go scooting with his cousins, 
and I would be having to run beside him or be yelling out, 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
"Elijah, stop!" And you know, "There is a car." Or "Stop at the corner." 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Whereas now, I can just. . . He can be quite a long way away now, 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
like further than seven or eight meters in a straight line and he can still hear.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:01.000
(RICHARD): He was on an aeroplane flight, 
he went from totally distracted to completely engrossed by it. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So having good quality sound for those sorts of things with a little kid, 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
it makes things that would normally be inconvenient, 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
like travelling in an aeroplane, is probably more than inconvenient, it's painful, 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
it makes it easy. He is able to be engrossed. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I kind of laughed that he's the kid who’s profoundly deaf 
and he’s sitting on an aeroplane 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
watching a movie and he's got the best quality sound out of everyone. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Everyone else has got to wear noise-cancelling headphones 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
and he just switches the sound off and listens to the movie. 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.800
That’s pretty amazing.
