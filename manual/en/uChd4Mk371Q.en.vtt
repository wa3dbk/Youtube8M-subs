00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.330
What's up, guys?

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.000
Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.400
It doesn't get any more behind-the-scenes
than this.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:14.139
You guys have wanted to see what is it that
I do exactly in my life.

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:18.420
Well, you know, it really starts here in the
morning with one tip that I feel like you

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.630
should really start doing.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.269
Make it a habit because it's going to make
a big difference in your physique over the

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.419
long term.

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:29.720
The very first thing that I do when I wake
up, here, this is a bed head and all, I wake

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.430
up and I grab my glass of water that's right
next to my bathroom sink.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.500
And I drink 2 full glasses of it.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.590
It's about 16 ounces.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.270
You can drink even a little bit more, but
it's a little bit hard to maybe stomach too

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.680
much water especially if you're starting this
habit.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.530
The reason why, and remember guys, your muscles
are 75 percent water.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.490
Your brain cells are 85 percent water.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.960
You've just gone 8 hours, hopefully if you're
sleeping enough, without anything.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.990
No hydration at all.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.390
You would never do that during the day if
you were awake.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.580
As a matter of fact, I hope you wouldn't if
you're following this channel, but if you

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:11.090
do, you've got to do something about replenishing
it quickly.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.469
So if you give it this little boost here,
some even German researchers will say this

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:18.460
will boost your metabolism for 90 minutes
after doing it if you drink cold water.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:20.229
I'm not really doing it for that reason.

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:24.829
I'm doing it just for the hydration benefits
and making sure that we don't start our day

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:27.819
dehydrated and then try to play catch up the
whole rest of the day

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:31.579
Especially if coffee is part of your morning
ritual, all you're going to do is further

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:33.600
dehydrate yourself.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.189
If you get your jump start right here,

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.429
it will make an enormous difference in how
you feel, and an enormous difference in how

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.569
your muscles can perform that day

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.079
being that they're not dehydrated anymore,
and an enormous difference over the long term

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:48.590
about what our physique will look like.

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.960
So, you know, hopefully these really quick
behind-the-scenes, Jeff grab your camera and

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.530
go shoot a tip, will be very helpful for you
because

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.939
I really do believe it's the cornerstone of
what I do the very first thing in the morning.

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:00.939
Alright guys.

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.579
If you found this helpful, make sure you leave
a thumb's up.

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.459

I'm doing in my daily life' tips, just let
