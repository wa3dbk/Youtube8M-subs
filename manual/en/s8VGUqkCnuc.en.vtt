00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.260
“Never forget what you are, the rest of the world will not. Wear it like armor, and it can never be used to hurt you.” – Tyrion Lannister

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:14.860
Game of Thrones is a TV adaptation of the
fantasy novels “A Song of Ice and Fire”

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:21.900
by George R. R. Martin. Almost 200 nominations
and 59 awards, including Golden Globes, Writers

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.390
Guild, Critics’ Choice, Screen Actors Guild
and Emmys among others. The books have been

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.980
translated into more than 30 languages and
it's reached the top of The New York Times

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:32.969
Best Seller lists.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:40.120
It’s a fascinating epic story, full of complexity
and realism. Set in the fictional Seven Kingdoms

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.840
of Westeros, the series chronicles the violent
dynastic struggles among the realm’s noble

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.850
families for control of the Iron Throne. But
along that way, it becomes about so much more.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.670
Through the words and actions of these enthralling
characters, there are hidden lessons to be learned.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.420
In life, we are all playing the game of thrones
one way or the other. Life is a game, you

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:08.960
either win or you lose but there is no draw. This
world can be cruel, and people can be cruel to you for who you are.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.720
But you must embrace
that, as Tyrion Lannister says: never forget

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.170
what you are, for surely the world will not.
Make it your strength. Then it can never be

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:22.350
your weakness. Armor yourself in it, and it
will never be used to hurt you. Understand

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.450
your limitations and use them properly to
your advantage. What people think about you

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.270
doesn’t matter. If a lion does not lose
sleep over the opinion of sheep, you should neither.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.960
Wear your so-called weakness as a
badge of pride and find beauty in your uniqueness.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.440
And if it hurts, remember that pain is a lesson, and
each lesson makes us better.

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:49.589
The books and the show many times remind us
“valar morghulis”. Which means all men must die.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.400
Death comes for everyone. It could
be tomorrow, or it could be in many years from now,

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:59.009
but all men must die. People die at their
dinner tables. People die in their beds.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:03.420
People die squatting over their chamber pots. Everybody dies sooner or later.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.280
 But don’t worry about your death.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.420
Worry about your life. Take charge
of your life for as long as it lasts.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:16.420
Because death is so final, whereas life is
full of possibilities. So while alive, make

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.629
every moment count but don’t rush. Enjoy
your time. As Salladhor Saan said: he who

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:25.209
hurries through life hurries to his grave.

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.269
Do what you love, spend time with loved ones
and be grateful, because, as Martin relentlessly

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.209
shows, any moment could be your last.

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:38.700
Take the ropes of your life and take action.
Don’t just talk because words are wind,

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.900
and the wind is always blowing at the Wall,
Jon Snow reminds us that words by themselves

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.800
are meaningless unless we put action behind them.

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.860
Act now and don’t let fear control you.
As Arya Stark knows the man who fears losing

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.180
has already lost. Fear cuts deeper than swords.
Bravery is easy when you have no fear.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.180
 It’s those who are brave in the face of it, that
stand above the rest.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.920
Chaos isn’t a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many
who try to climb it fail and never get to

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.500
try again. The fall breaks them. And some
are given a chance to climb. They refuse,

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:22.020
they cling to the realm or the gods or love.
Illusions. Only the ladder is real.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:28.540
The climb is all there is. Now is your time to climb
up. Where there is a way in, there is a way out.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.780
Valar morghulis.
