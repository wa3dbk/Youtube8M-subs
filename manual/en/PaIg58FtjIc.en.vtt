Hello my friends and welcome
to another Tuesday of tutorial.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.640
I am Leonardo Pereznieto and today
we are going to draw a train

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.600
with a lot of smoke.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.100
Let´s use graphite powder
with a rag of chamois leather.

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:29.600
Take off the excess on a scrub piece of paper, and now… let´s draw!

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.410
Begin by sketching the general shape
you want the smoke to have,

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.179
and then do some shadows.

00:00:38.179 --> 00:00:41.719
The reason I suggest to use
this technique is because

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.679
the pencil can leave lines
and a more solid appearance,

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:50.600
while the powder leaves a more
ethereal look ideal for smoke.

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:58.900
We keep adding shadows to
render the shapes and volumes.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.840
And then with a kneaded eraser
or with a regular pencil eraser

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.979
you can pull lights...
and continue in this way,

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.900
pulling more lights and more shadows.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
This is really fun!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.689
If you want to contrast
or define some boarders

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.810
you may do so with pencil
but do it sparingly and carefully

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.700
so it doesn´t look rigid.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.700
And now… the train.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.159
I know i know, I was carried
away so much with the smoke

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.400
that I almost forgot the train.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.159
In this case it will be very simple,
small and from the front

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.100
it has a grid underneath and the tracks.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.390
And here on the side, we will be
able to see slightly another wagon,

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.390
let´s draw some dim trees at a distance
and we can rapidly build a landscape

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.600
with the chamois and graphite.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.000
I´ll extend the smoke
downwards a little bit so that

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.300
it will come out of the pipe.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.300
Draw other trees closer
and therefore darker.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.690
By the way the graphite
powder I get it by saving it

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.000
when I sharpen my leads
of my lead holders,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.480
otherwise you can get it
by rubbing the tip of your pencil

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.400
on sand paper.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:41.600
With an extra fine eraser
do the tracks,

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.980
if you don´t have one
you may cut a triangular piece

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.900
of your eraser with a blade.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.500
Excellent!

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.500
It´s ready!

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:59.750
