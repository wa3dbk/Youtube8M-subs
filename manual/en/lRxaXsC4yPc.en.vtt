Hey guys! How's it going? It is MyDifferentUserName here and today

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.939
I am going to be showing you probably one of the craziest assault rifles I have

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.099
ever built. Something that you would
never normally see

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.400
in combat but instead... "underwater combat"

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.149
Sounds crazy. I know, but the russians
have made a weapon

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:34.239
that can shoot projectiles underwater at a high-velocity just like real guns in the air.

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.600
So here it is, the Lego APS "Underwater
Assault Rifle"!

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.090
So even though that this girl is
interesting enough, it has a lot of

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.500
background behind it. It was actually made
back in 1975 by the Soviet Union,

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.839
I have no idea what they were thinking
when they try to make this,

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:57.579
but all I know is apparently fishing in
Russia is...

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.600
a lot more different than it is here, but
apparently it was made for frogmen back

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.750
when naval strikes used to happen a lot
during

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.620
the cold war. And having this gun proved to be a lot more useful than

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.040
using any kind a spear gun available.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.259
So you probably are looking at the
magazine going: "Why is it like that?"

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.520
That's because the bullet was actually
made to be

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.630
more hydrodynamic so can actually flow
through the water at a high-velocity

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.890
just like bullets do in the air.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.810
So the stock happens to be a wired
stocking and when it's folded

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.759
the end of it actually folds into the
pistol grip of the gun, so technically

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:32.780
you're holding the stock-

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.369
end and the gun at the same time. And just
the overall

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.490
of the gun kind of reminds me of something from like a weird sci-fi movie.

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.270
The gun doesn't even look realistic, but yet...
It exists!

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.409
The bolt on the gun also has to
travel a fairly long distance just because

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:51.020
of the size of the magazine and how
small the bolt

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.810
actually really is on the weapon. So in
case you were wondering why this gun

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.770
kind of looks like an "AK platform" that's
because it is. Think about it!

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.009
It is the Soviet Union, and back then, the
Soviet Union

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.030
used a lot of AK-47's and sometimes have
even made duplicates

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.340
of the same weapon just in a different
gun. Even with the giant magazine

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.360
on the gun, it can be held just alone
with one hand on the pistol grip,

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.010
which can make it easier for the person
to swim underwater with it.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.600
So in conclusion, all I can say is that
this gun is very strange, but I know it

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.550
will be fine

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.570
in Call Of Duty: Ghosts! Now so, let's get up

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:35.570
get ready go fishing "russian style"!

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.050
So subscribe for more "Ghosts" weapons! And as always...

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:39.050
Thanks for watching!

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.569
good
