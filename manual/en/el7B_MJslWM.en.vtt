00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:43.240
Another thing the Netherlands have a lot of is waterways: over 6,000km (3,700 miles) of them

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.200
in a country about twice the size of New Jersey,

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.080
so it’s not long before you find yourself having to cross one.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.720
Sometimes this means taking a ferry, as here on the river Lek at the city of Schoonhoven.

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.040
The Netherlands are basically one great big river delta.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:19.680
Actually, three: the rivers Rhine, Meuse and Scheldt converge in a system of distributaries and islands.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.720
We actually gave Schoonhoven a miss, and pressed on to the small town of Bergambacht.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.800
Not for any particular reason. It happened to be on our route, and we needed something to drink.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:51.920
Apparently, the locals are famed for their obsession with removing every weed from between paving stones,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.280
but actually all the towns and villages we passed through were neat, tidy and prosperous.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:03.120
And buzzing with life: in most west European countries, a town the size of this would be dead,

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.360
killed off by giant out-of-town shopping centres,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.920
but it seems the Dutch prefer to shop in their own local communities.

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.960
Inevitably, Bergambacht has a windmill.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.840
Oddly, though most people associate windmills with the Netherlands, they were probably invented in England.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.360
Certainly, although the English developed windmills that automatically turned towards the wind,

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:30.600
Dutch windmills had to be turned by hand.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.680
But the Dutch have been more successful at preserving their heritage,

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.560
although the industrial revolution made them largely redundant.

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.680
Windmills were used for grinding wheat, powering sawmills,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.280
and — especially important for the Netherlands — pumping water.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:03.120
Travelling around the country, you notice that it’s almost as much built on water as on land.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:10.840
So much of it is reclaimed land, and canals and ditches are simply everywhere.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.960
Bergambacht, believe it or not, was our first stop in Holland,

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.080
which may suprise those who use the word “Holland” to describe the whole of the Netherlands.

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:34.280
This is incorrect: the country actually consists of 12 provinces,

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:43.800
and only two of them — called, naturally, North Holland and South Holland — can be called “Holland”.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.960
Bergambacht is near a much more famous city,

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.280
its name known to cheese-lovers the world over: Gouda.

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:00.640
And in case you’re wondering: Yes, that is how it should be pronounced.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:04.640
The cheese isn’t actually made here, but in the surrounding area.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:07.880
It was, however, traded here, and still is:

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:12.640
aside from the touristy shops, there’s a cheese market every Thursday,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.800
although it was Tuesday when we went, so we missed it.

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.640
Gouda’s history is one of boom and bust,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.600
economic success alternating with periods of war, devastation and plague.

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:27.720
But the City Hall is quite magnificent,

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.560
and like many Dutch City Halls, it regularly demonstrates its carillon.

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.600
[CARILLON PLAYS]

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:57.640
St John’s Church, built during the 15th and 16th centuries,

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:03.480
is the longest in the Netherlands, and especially famous for its stained-glass windows,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.320
which, of course, we didn’t see.

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:17.160
A relative newcomer to the scene, built in the first few years of the 20th century,

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:21.000
is the Neo-Gothic St Joseph’s church.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:32.880
Gouda also features canals, built in the middle ages.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.720
The city did begin a program of filling them in after the war,

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:39.280
but stopped in the face of public protest.

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.320
The city grew on a waterway that formed part of a trading route

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:48.120
from the Baltic Sea to Flanders and France,

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.760
and the old harbour has been turned into a sort of open-air museum.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:10.720
It was getting towards evening — in the Netherlands, almost everything closes at 6pm —

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.400
and we really wanted to get to Delft.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:21.520
We chose Delft as a convenient base from which to explore Holland,

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:28.040
and the next day we took a train to Amsterdam, because driving in Amsterdam is too scary.

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.760
And you wouldn’t believe the number of bicycles parked at the station.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:40.800
It’s not a stereotype: the Netherlands have a population of 16 million, and 18 million bicycles.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:49.760
27% of all trips are made by bike, compared with 1.3% in the UK or 0.9% in the US.

00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:57.280
A Dutch citizen cycles and average of 900km (560 miles) per year.
