CLAY This week we’re stepping out of the
lab to offer a tribute to the humble backyard

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.060
barbecue. I’m Daddy Clay.
BRAD And I’m Daddy Brad. This week is brought

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.550
to you by One step Ahead. Great baby gear
every step of the way. One Step Ahead.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:43.430
CLAY You know Daddy Brad, I can safely say
that some of the most contented moments I

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.610
have had in my ten years of fatherhood have
been associated with simple backyard cookouts.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:55.010
BRAD Not some big production. Semi impromptu.
A few burgers, cold drinks, small crowd of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.299
friends, something to distract the kids. Done.
Daddy Nirvana.

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:04.400
CLAY Exactly, you turn it into some big production
and it can become “entertaining.” If you

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.670
don’t have  time to regularly have a backyard
barbecue. You’re messed up.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:16.050
BRAD Let’s take a look at the basic ingredients.
CLAY To me the key to a good cookout is that

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.680
it not be too kid-centric. I want to WATCH
them be cute and have fun, while having a

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:32.270
beverage. Playscape is good, but familiar.
Without going overboard spice it up. Just

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:39.370
a sprinkler might be enough.
CLAY Gift from sister-in-law. Awesome. Inflatables

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:50.530
from One Step Ahead. And you’re done.
BRAD The classics just work. Maybe throw a

00:01:50.530 --> 00:02:05.710
fancy sausage in there to spice things up.
You can get fancy, but why?

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:12.420
CLAY Same with the drinks. Juiceboxes for
kids. From grownups I try to put out both

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:19.510
beer and wine. I know some people feel uncomfortable
drinking around the kids, but they’re not

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:31.319
invited. I go with one light, one dark import.
Costco does these mixed Modelo cases, perfect.

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:47.650
And some cheap ass American light crap for
Brad. Wine, cheap and plentiful Australian

00:02:47.650 --> 00:03:03.900
chard. I’m not afraid of the pink stuff
if it’s quality. And a red, throw it in

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:11.930
the cooler with the rest if it’s hot out.
You could haul out the mixer, but that’s

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:21.700
a pain in the ass. Who you trying to impress?
BRAD A few friends. This is an example. You

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.420
don’t want too many of these assholes. A
few couples and kids. We think more than four

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:35.720
couples and it’s a big production. So I’m
out here in the yard, and the sun is going

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:41.959
down, music is on, meat’s on the grill,
smells good, and my youngest walks over and

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:48.030
asks to be picked up, and I’m right there.
I’m a ten.

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:58.580
BRAD The key is low key. If it gets too big
or fancy, then it’s pressure and you won’t

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:04.380
do it. And you should. If you don’t have
time to have a cookout, every other week,

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:06.370
all summer long, something is wrong with your
deal.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:10.410
CLAY Let’s talk cookouts. Head on over to
dadlabs.com And click on community. We want

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.050
to hear about your ideal cookout. What goes
on the grill, what goes in the cooler. What

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:21.340
keeps the kids busy in the yard. Funny cookout
nightmares. I wanna hear from you beer geeks

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:23.280
about the best burger brew.
BRAD Gas or charcoal. How to keep the bugs

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.630
away. We want to hear all about it. We want
to hear from all you lurkers out there that

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.620
watch, but don’t comment.
CLAY And on the new community, you can upload

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.909
picture of you and the kids at your next cookout.
You can even make and upload your own dadlabs

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:39.080
video with all your secrets for a successful
barbecue.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.099
BRAD Let’s get that conversation going.
See you back on the site.

00:04:42.099 --> 00:04:43.099
CLAY That’s all for us this week, here in
the lab. You’re overcooking that.

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:44.389
BRAD You want to do it?
CLAY It is my grill...
