Hello and welcome to +AudioCheck.tv! In this
video I'm going to explain you how a microphone

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.509
works.
Nowadays microphones can be seen at many places,

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.340
for example at a concert on stage, on TV or
even at home, maybe as part of a headphone.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.279
But only a small minority of people knows
how a microphone works. I'll show it on the

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.820
example of the dynamic microphone. Dynamic
microphones are used for singing in the most

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.770
cases because they are sturdy and can also
bear large volumes.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.309
First of all we unscrew this small metal basket,
this is only the pop screen which reduces

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.690
sounds like p, b or s. The actual inner life
of the microphone is here in a small capsule.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.800
In this capsule there are actually only 3
things. First of all this is the wafer-thin

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.930
membrane which is clamped in here. It's elastic
and when sound waves reach the membrane it

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.059
goes with them. So when I talk into the microphone
now the membrane changes it's position. When

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:05.140
I talk louder it moves more than when I talk
quieter.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.369
But we need another thing because the moving
of the membrane has to be caught. For this

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:13.920
there's a coil which is fixed on the membrane.
So when the membrane moves the coil moves

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.200
too. But: All good things come in threes so
one thing is still missing namely a magnet.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.310
The magnet receives the voltage which appears
from the coil's moving.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.420
So we begin again: I speak into the microphone,
the membrane moves, with the membrane also

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.360
the coil moves and the voltage that is impacted
to the magnet changes.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.630
The louder I talk the greater the movement
of the membrane and the coil and the greater

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.820
the electrical voltage. The quieter I talk
the smaller the movement of the membrane and

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.170
the coil and the smaller the electrical voltage.
Exactly this voltage can now be passed on

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.490
over a cable, here it's such a symmetrical
XLR one, this can be plugged in into an amplifier

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.909
or a mixer. To return once again to the electric
voltage: It can be seen in every audio or

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:59.960
video cutting programme. If I click to zoom
closer and closer we see those recorded membrane

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:04.700
vibration. So we see: It's not that difficult
to understand how a microphone works.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.530
