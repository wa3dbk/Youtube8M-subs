Hi everyone, it's Jeff Plumb here from PingSkills.com
and this is the ask the coach show episode

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.240
1 where we answer your table tennis questions.
I've got Alois Rosario with me, welcome Alois.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.550
Hi Jeff, how are you going?

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:21.310
Good thank you. So the first question we've
got and are going to talk about is the racket

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:28.080
height. So should the racket be the same height
as the ball or should it be lower than the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.600
ball? That's a question that we've been asked.
What do you make of that question Alois?

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.540
What I think we're talking about here is the
racket height as you're hitting the ball so

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:43.989
if you're going to play a topspin stroke,
then the bat needs to be a little bit below

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.270
the ball so that it can come up on the ball
that way. If you're playing a backspin stroke

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:57.110
then you can start a little bit above the
ball and come down to generate the backspin.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.690
Maybe for a serve is what she was talking
about. It's best to start either just a little

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.450
bit above the ball so you can come down on
it that way or behind the ball so you come

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:14.431
flat and into the ball that way as well. So
it depends on the type of spin that you are

00:01:14.431 --> 00:01:23.090
trying to produce, where the racket starts
in relation to the ball.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:34.850
OK. Very good. I'm just currently answering
that question. I'm looking at the Google apps

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.170
features here so there's a little feature
on this Google hangouts Alois where you can

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.630
specify which question you are currently answering
so I was just a little bit distracted there.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.630
OK.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:45.770
We'll see how that goes.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:53.400
Alright so another question we have Alois
is about a forehand problem and the question

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.570
is I can't get the ball on the table while
playing the forehand it always goes long and

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.900
misses the table. What should I do?

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:07.110
So the natural cure for the ball that is going
long is to put a little bit more topspin on

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:13.379
the ball so if you're hitting the ball too
flat and too fast then the ball is going to

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:18.730
tend to go out past the table. If you start
to put just a little bit of topspin on the

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:25.829
ball then the topspin is going to drag the
ball down onto the table so that's probably

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.620
one of the things that you can look at. The
other thing is also just adjusting the angle

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.219
of your bat so it could be as simple as instead
of your bat being at that angle just turn

00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:40.959
it down and forward a fraction and play the
same stroke that you're playing at the moment

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.450
and maybe that will cure the problem. Always
remember though with your forehand stroke

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.180
to get that bat coming up towards that eyebrow.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:58.059
OK. Good advice there. So really topspin is
the key.

00:02:58.059 --> 00:03:03.719
Great now so Hela's also asked us a question
about how to control, that's the title of

00:03:03.719 --> 00:03:11.109
it so he's got a bat with some rubber on it
so I think a Donic Coppa JO Gold and Mark

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:16.980
V on the backhand but he can't control the
ball so his question is should he change his

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.060
bat?

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:22.469
I think he's also got an offensive blade as
well there.

00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:26.989
He does, yes it's a Donic Persson exclusive
offensive.

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:33.150
Yep, so this is a problem we often find with
players and it's really natural when we start

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.370
to play we want to get a good bat and it's
really difficult when you're starting to work

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:46.079
out what is a good bat. I mean you look at
a bat that's $200 and think fantastic that's

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:50.491
going to be the one for me but often when
you're starting it's really important to start

00:03:50.491 --> 00:03:59.189
with a lower speed bat and a bat with a bit
more control. So if you, it sounds like the

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:04.489
bat that you've got there is just a little
bit too fast for you so you need to come back

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:09.809
a step. Keep the bat, put it in your drawer,
or put it in the cupboard because hopefully

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:15.630
as you progress that's a bat that you will
be able to use down the track. The bat that

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:21.289
we recommend to start off with is the PingSkills
Rook which is just a good control bat but

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:27.120
it has reasonable quality rubber on it as
well so you still want to have a bat that

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:33.379
you can get a bit of grip and a bit of spin
on the ball but the bat that you have bought

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:39.620
for yourself I think is just a bit too fast
so my advice is probably go for something

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:46.110
a little bit slower, just a pre-made bat to
start off with and put the other one away

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:47.830
till you get a little bit better.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.580
Yeah good advice. So it's really important
isn't it that you get something that is not

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:58.270
too fast so that you can learn to play a full
stroke and learn to hit the ball consistently

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.319
on the table. If the ball is coming off too
fast you're going to compromise your stroke,

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:07.360
you're going to try and play it a bit shorter.
We've got a really good video on how to choose

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.830
a table tennis bat so you can find that on
our website or just google PingSkills how

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:15.810
to choose a table tennis bat and you'll find
that video which takes you through the different

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:21.530
levels of bat and when you should upgrade
so that's definitely worth a watch.

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:27.560
OK. So I think that wraps up our first ask
the coach show episode 1 Alois so if our viewers

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:34.150
out there have any feedback on the show or
the format then let us know, leave a comment,

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:39.979
we'd love to hear from you and if you want
to get a question on then just go to PingSkills.com

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:45.710
and go to the ask the coach section and ask
a question and we will pick a couple of questions

00:05:45.710 --> 00:06:02.080
each time we do the show to answer them. So
thanks 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:03.080
for watching, thanks Alois.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.449
Thanks Jeff.
