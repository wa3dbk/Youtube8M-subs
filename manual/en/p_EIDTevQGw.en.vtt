Hello, my name is Shalon Delgado and on behalf
of Expert Village I’m here to talk to you

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:12.480
about the different types of modeling. The
three types of modeling I’d like to discuss

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:20.960
is: print, runway and parts modeling. The
first topic will be print, now print modeling

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:28.369
is basically when you see yourself in a magazine,
on a billboard, in a newspaper, any kind of

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:34.631
distribution of something that goes out to
everyone in the world is basically print modeling.

00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:39.520
Now you can do all kinds of print modeling,
you can do fashion print modeling which would

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:46.720
be posing in clothes for Sears or JC Penny’s
or Target or something like that. Or you can

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.890
do editorial print modeling which is just
basically where you’re sitting down, your

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.141
day to day routine drinking coffee and they’re
going to take a snapshot of you and put it

00:00:57.141 --> 00:01:03.490
in a magazine to focus on what you’re drinking
or what you’re reading, so print magazine

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:10.340
is a large spectrum that you can do for print.
The other modeling type of modeling would

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.700
be runway modeling is something that you’re
going to find high fashion runway in New York.

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.549
New York fashion which is high fashion runway
where you’re going to walk down a runway

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.020
in front of 20,000 people in a designer outfit
that you’re not going to see anywhere else

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.850
because it’s a one piece that’s out there
on the show floor or you’re going to be

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.509
in Paris walking down the street or in a restaurant,
that can be classified as runway modeling.

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:45.439
Because you’re showing off the designer’s
work of art their clothing line, so runway

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:50.450
modeling and print modeling are two different
kinds of modeling. Now the third type that

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.060
I’d like to discuss is parts modeling and
you don’t hear about it too much but it’s

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.939
really popular now days. That would be focusing
on your hands or your nails, your toes, your

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:08.350
legs or your hair or just your face. Parts
modeling can be very, very lookative because

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.980
you may not have the features of a model but
you may have beautiful hands and you can do

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:20.870
a nail commercial with your hands or you may
have just an exquisite face and do a Revlon

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.099
commercial or your hair for instance. There
are many types of modeling that you can do

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:33.799
and so if you don’t think that you may fit
the typical runway modeling or fashion print,

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:40.090
look into parts modeling. There’s a whole
spectrum of modeling out there for anyone

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:48.519
to do. You can visit me at www.myspace.com/shalon711,
