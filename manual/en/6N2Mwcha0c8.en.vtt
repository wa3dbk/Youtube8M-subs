Hi Everyone! I am Charu
You can see me somewhere here

00:00:03.827 --> 00:00:07.397
Oh oo, that's me. So Hi
Okay so as the FIFA Fever is on

00:00:07.397 --> 00:00:11.977
I will tell you how to turn
Your simple cupcakes

00:00:11.977 --> 00:00:15.217
into some exciting ones
while you are watching your favorite match

00:00:15.217 --> 00:00:19.486
so this is what you need
some cupcakes, You can either bake them

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:22.517
or get them
to save time I got them

00:00:22.517 --> 00:00:27.997
you have these flags of your favorite teams
some decoration things

00:00:27.997 --> 00:00:32.297
these food coloring, of your favorite color,
red, blue, yellow

00:00:32.297 --> 00:00:36.347
some frosting cream
I made this, you can even get them in the

00:00:36.347 --> 00:00:38.117
market
I will share the recipe below

00:00:38.117 --> 00:00:40.396
And this is the piping bag with some food
color

00:00:40.497 --> 00:00:44.197
and offcourse the nozzles to decorate your
favorite designs

00:00:45.197 --> 00:00:48.197
so lets get started with Spain
and for Spain it's red and yellow

00:00:49.197 --> 00:00:52.197
so we will be using two colors now
so this is red

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:11.197
I want to make it really simple
so I am going with these plain normal dots

00:01:16.197 --> 00:01:32.197
once red is done, we need to take some yellow
and to really pop it up we have the Spain

00:01:33.197 --> 00:01:36.197
flag
so here we have our Spain themed cupcake

00:01:38.197 --> 00:01:40.197
Now it's time for Brazil
so we need two colors green and yellow

00:01:41.197 --> 00:01:48.197
so lets get started
to make it very simple we will just make lines

00:01:51.197 --> 00:01:53.197
Brazil is my personal favorite
and they are hosting FIFA Worldcup this year

00:01:56.197 --> 00:01:58.197
I am so excited
Let's just sprinkle some

00:02:09.197 --> 00:02:13.197
and here comes the Brazil flag
Looks cool right? Yesss

00:02:15.197 --> 00:02:18.197
