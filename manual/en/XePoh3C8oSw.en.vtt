00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.120
Hi everybody.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.490
I'm Dr. David Reath, and I'm here to talk
about this week's Truth O Meter Tuesday question.

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.300
This week we're talking about scar management,
and trying to get the best-looking scar after

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.360
you have surgery, because it's something that's
on the mind of all our patients.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.480
And our question was this: that other than
time, the thing that is going to make the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.450
most improvement in terms of scars is external
compression, or external pressure.

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:33.730
And the answer to that is true.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:34.989
All scars get better with time.

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.570
Look at the scar that you had, say, a week
or two ago, versus the one that's been there

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.079
several years, and you can see a drastic difference.

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:51.470
But plastic surgereons for decades have used
external compression to help with scars.

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:57.580
This has been the basis of treatment of burn
scars, people with burns and have a lot of

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.890
skin grafts, have more problems with scarring
than any other patients we'll see.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.159
They've always been treated with external
compression garments, which put pressure on

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:10.920
the scar and physically help to mold and change
the scars.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.790
We utilize that same phenomenon in treating
our elective surgery scars.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:21.700
This is a small sillicone strip, we use it
to cover the incision for breast augmentation.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:28.590
And by just adhering to the skin, and putting
pressure on the skin, it makes the scars flatten,

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.060
and fade and improve much more rapidly than
they might otherwise.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.250
So external compression is a simple thing
to do.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.880
It's easy and it works.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.610
There have been a lot of other things that
have been tried out, that are marketed, that

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.120
you can by, which you put on scars.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:51.850
I've never seen a study that convinces me
that they are truly beneficial or are more

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:54.060
beneficial than external compression.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.280
That's the best thing to do and that's why
we use it on all our patients.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.880
It's hard to know if you have a scar that
is much older, whether external compression

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:01.880
will help.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.170
But certainly during the active healing phase,
for those first six months to a year, we think

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:07.820
it's very beneficial.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:15.950
So let's find out who this week's winner is.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:16.950
Sheila Anderson.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.209
Sheila, congratulations, you're this week's
winner.

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:21.209
We have a $100 gift card for you.

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:23.099
Do come into the office and pick that up.

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:27.660
For everybody else out there, we'll have another
question for you next week.
