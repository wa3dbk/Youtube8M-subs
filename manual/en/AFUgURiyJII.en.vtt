your producers are discover they put in a
teleprompter and you read it

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.909
whereas the decision making

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:48.100
in you can tell her sense of like how important
she thinks it is when she doesn't read from

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:48.740
the script

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.840

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:04.490
day

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.190
zina using

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:09.929
stiff

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.629
their sense of self importance

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.260
