00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.340
Hey guys, we're here at Animal Wonders and
it's night time so we decided to play with

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:06.340
some night time animals.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:11.250
Um, this is, these are brush-tailed bettongs
and Patagonian Cavy, peeking over the top

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:12.250
there.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.250
[Laughs]

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.400
But, uh, this is Dundee and we talked about
him a little bit in, err, Bettong Joey Project.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.800
You can see him when he's just a little baby.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.010
And this is Bettong Joey number five, 'Little
Bit' for now, we don't have a name yet.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.850
Dundee and his little sister are over there
hanging out in the corner.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.400
These guys are pretty good buds.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.150
They hang out together.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.609
Dundee is showing his little sister all the
ropes.

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:38.969
When we first introduced these two Little
Bit, err, kept trying to find Dundee's pouch

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.649
and was unsuccessful.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.649
[Laughs] Males don't have pouches.

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:49.469
Dundee here, he's five months out of his pouch
and he's eating a little yam right now.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.850
[Laughs] Little Bit here, is about a week
out of the pouch and she doesn't quite understand

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.190
solid foods yet.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.869
So, you see she's testing it, but she doesn't
quite get it yet.

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:02.869
You've got to grab it.

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:08.860
Do you want this one Dundee?

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:16.290
See that's how its done.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.030
They use their tiny front feet with those
big old claws to help hold them.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:26.920
There you go, look at her, yay.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.920
Oh.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:28.920
[Laughs]

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.610
You see Dundee hanging out in this dark little
spot here, its kind of a safe little nook,

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:34.860
cranny here.

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.001
These guys are prey animals and so there's
gonna be a lot of little buggers out there

00:01:38.001 --> 00:01:50.920
trying to eat them, so they feel nice and
safe in these safe little dark spots.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.460
Where ya going?

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.310
[Laughs]

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.159
Hi!

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:09.390
Yeah, she's just getting confused.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.239
Sniffing...

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:13.079
Achoo!

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:14.930
[Laughs]

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.620
Hi, hi.
