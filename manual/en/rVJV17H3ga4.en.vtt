00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:12.340
Start by getting your screws out first, separate
your screws.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:45.670
Now, the next step is to put the back onto the seat. Add four screws.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:01:04.180
Just lining up those sides, make sure they're
even and they're ready to go in.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.850
(Looks like James here is doing a good job
so far!)

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.500
Now pull the chair forward so it doesn't tip
over.

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:56.640
Take the first arm and line up the bolts with the holes.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:29.740
Hammer them in. Next, fasten the
screws.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:48.280
Take the second arm and repeat.

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.169
Be sure to also screw and hammer the hidden
screws in the inside bottom, too!

00:06:17.569 --> 00:06:20.069
You're done! Now you can sit back and relax
in your new Polywood Fan-Back Adirondack Chair.
