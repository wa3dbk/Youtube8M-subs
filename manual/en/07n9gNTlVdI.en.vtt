ABE TOKE: Hi. Welcome to Expert Village, my
name is Abe Toke. I'm going to take you through

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.009
step by step to shape yourself a complete
surfboard. I'm going to go ahead and clean

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:15.980
up this bottom a little bit, and then we'll
go ahead and do the top. And I'm going to

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:26.450
clean it up with the shearform again. When
you run your hands across the bottom, you

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:32.630
can really feel a high spot or a low spot.
I mean you can obviously see that we're a

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:37.950
little low here still, but just keeping--you
don't want to dig in to this and try to make

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.270
it up right now. So just keep on shaping the
board is one whole thing. Don't stop in here

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:53.690
and dig away and trying to hit a home run
with every little stroke. It's more important

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:02.750
that it really stays flat. Once you start
shaping off the bottom a little bit, you'll

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.930
notice that the stringer will start to pop
up. That's when it's a great time to break

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:14.720
out this hand planer and just hit the stringer
alone. Careful not to--you don't want to reshape

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:21.310
this bottom that much so you just really want
to just take as consistent smooth cut off

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:31.840
the stringer. I usually start somewhere around
the apex of the bottom contour which is generally

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:39.210
around the middle of the board and just flow
right off the nose. Once I'm pretty happy

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:46.590
with the relatively flat, I got most of the
marks out. I'm going to go ahead and flip

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.520
it over. The stringer is pretty hard to shape,
so I usually tend to get that down and then

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:02.530
you can shape the foam to the stringer, starting
on the high points always first.
