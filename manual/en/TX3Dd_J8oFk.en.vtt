00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.779
Have you ever wondered why there’s so much
debt? Or why the experts and authorities seem

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.100
completely unable to solve the current debt
crisis?

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:13.620
Well the reason they can’t solve it is because
they’re trying to fix and repair the existing

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.870
banking system. But the existing banking system
is completely flawed. It’s the existing

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.390
system that has buried all of us under a massive
mountain of debt.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.320
In the next 3 minutes I’ll show you how
the design of the banking system guarantees

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.650
that the vast majority of people will end
up in debt, and why allowing the banks to

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.550
go back to business as usual would be the
worst thing for the economy and for society

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.160
as a whole.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.420
But first, where do you think all this debt
came from? Many people would assume that a

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.030
bank needs to get money from a saver before
it can make a loan to a borrower - after all,

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.260
isn’t that what banks do? Taking money from
people who want to save it, and lending it

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:55.559
to businesses and people who need to borrow?

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.680
Well, Not exactly.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.320
Here’s a fact that not many people know.
A bank doesn’t actually need to have any

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.820
real money before it can make a loan to someone.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.430
When you take out a mortgage from the bank,
the bank doesn’t take that money from somebody’s

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.890
grandma’s life savings.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.200
No. Instead, they simply open up a computer,
and type some numbers into your account.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.000
You get a huge wad of money in your account,
and you also get a huge wad of debt that you’ll

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.770
be repaying over the next 25 years.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.850
But the money that you borrowed was created
out of nothing and just typed into your account.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:32.560
We know that’s hard to believe, but you
don’t need to take our word for it. The

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.939
Bank of England themselves say that “When
banks make loans, they create additional [bank]

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.100
deposits for those that have borrowed the
money.” These ‘bank deposits’ are just

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.909
the numbers in your account.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:48.619
And Martin Wolf, the chief economics editor
at the Financial Times, says that “The essence

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:53.420
of the contemporary monetary system is the
creation of money, out of nothing, by private

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.240
banks’ often foolish lending.”

00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.670
So almost all the money we use today is made
in this way - out of nothing, by banks, when

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.579
they make loans.

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.250
And the only way that we, as the public, can
get our hands on this money, is to go into

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.630
debt to the banks.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.969
In other words, almost every pound that we
need in the economy - to run shops, businesses,

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:18.189
factories, schools and hospitals, must first
be borrowed by us from a high-street bank.

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:23.889
And if one person has a million pounds, the
rest of us MUST be a million pounds in debt.

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:28.730
If we try not to go into debt, then the banks
would be unable to create money and the economy

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.629
would grind to a halt.

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:33.859
This is effectively a whole-scale privatisation
of the power to create money.
