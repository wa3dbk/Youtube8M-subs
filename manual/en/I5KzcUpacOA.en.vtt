Hi, this is Jeff Wilkins on behalf of Expert
Village. The next step is we're going to take

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.510
this wing and stand it upright. We've got
to create something that will make it stay

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.590
in that position. So, with the tying thread,
I'll pull the wing back, I'll start wrapping

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:26.150
the thread right at the base of it and the
build-up of thread, which I like to envision

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:34.930
as a cone in front of the wing, the wing material,
will cause it to stand upright. And that technique

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.530
will work with any material, not just this
yarn, but any hair or other material you might

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:45.880
use for that. So, we have the wing upright.
The next step in tying any parachute pattern

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:51.899
is to create a post around the wing. The way
we do that, is we do those with a tying thread

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.219
and I prefer looking down on top of it. I'm
a right-handed tier, so we're going to go

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.559
from that position, looking straight down
on the fly; I'm going to go in a clockwise

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:08.390
direction. Take the tying thread, and we'll
go around the base of the wing. The thing

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.020
that's important is the plane of the thread.
The plane should be this, bob and tip pointing

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.180
down at the table, flat plane that's in line
with the hook shank, not an angle, which causes

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:27.729
it to come off. So, you want to wrap it with
steady pressure, keeping the thread on a flat

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:35.460
plane. What we're doing is, we're creating
a rigid base, that in two more steps, we're

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.770
going to wrap the hackle around the base of
the wing. This provides a rigid surface on

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:49.869
top of which that can happen, so that's called
posting the wing. Now, so it stays in that

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.229
position, I'm going to take a little pit cement,
just a little drop of it. This can be drying

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:02.329
while we're finishing the fly. Put just a
dab front, back and both sides and even up

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:13.120
on the wing post we created. So now we have
a completed wing post.
