00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.909
Penn State students, faculty, and staff
have made 2008 a year like no other

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:15.000
I hope you'll join me in resolving to
bring that same level of 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000
engagement, enthusiasm, and Penn State pride into 2009

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:37.070
My New Year's resolution this year is to be a
better professor, an even better mom,

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.320
and to improve my time in the Mountain Marathon

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.000
My new year's resolution?
To beat the DOW

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Try a new flavor.
Try every flavor!

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.170
Crash an A-list. Maybe

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:51.000
Finish writing all those papers that I
have stacked on my desk

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
To call my grandmother every week

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.000
To get a motor home

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.640
Definitely to be a spotter, I mean that is by far number one

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.180
To make my polymer stick to my substrate

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.530
Be less stressed out.
Be healthy!

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.000
I hope to give the best tours, and finally master walking backwards

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.330
You've got to have more cookies, and more variety of cookies

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.000
Think less about myself and more about others

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.500
To take Penn State as high as the sky as far as recycling

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:29.000
To be more of a team player and show a little more leadership

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.429
I just want to be the happiest person I can be

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:42.000
To demonstrate a silicon wire solar cell
that has an efficiency comparable to

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.840
current crystalline silicon solar cells

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.950
We wanna pick up organic, we want to give that a shot

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.479
Play better golf

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:51.500
Thank my parents more often

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.000
So thank you mom and dad

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Max out my IRA

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.930
I'm gonna grow my hair.
Me too!

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.000
To not get lost in the stacks

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.500
Bring joy through music.
To change the world

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.500

Do you know anyone?

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:28.799
Happy Holidays!
HAPPY HOLIDAYS!

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.519
On behalf of the entire Penn State
community,

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:34.750
I wish you a happy and healthy new year
