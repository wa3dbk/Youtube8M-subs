00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:08.840
Carrying on the legacy. More than wearing
the suit more than meets the eye. The sights

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.950
and sounds of Nittany Lion tryouts.
Thats now In Motion.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:16.080
The Lion represents people. Because at the
end of the day Penn State is people. I think

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.130
the Nittany Lion represents all the fans and
all the people who have a great love for Penn

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.000
State.
Our alums, our fans, their families, they

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.270
see all of Penn State in that one symbol.
Accomplishing the physical demands and getting

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.200
blue and white faithful fired up are just
part

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.870
of the mascots role.
Being the lion means a lot more. Being the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.830
lion inside the suit is just doing a huge
amount

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.600
of events. Outside of the suit its reaching
out to the community reaching out to the Penn

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.840
State community. Involving yourself with the
university. Giving back. Youre a symbol

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.230
for the university.
The student selected will continue a tradition

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.000
of pride and enthusiasm. And the tryout phase
is only the beginning of a demanding and amazing

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.510
journey.
A once in a lifetime opportunity. And I cant

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.930
tell you why. Everybody has a different
motivation. But at the same time, honestly

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:19.610
I think, in everybodys motivation to do this
there is an overlapping feature and a common

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:24.570
theme that is they love Penn State. We always
want you to be connected to our university.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.170
We want you to realize that once you say that
you are a Penn State fan or once youre a Penn

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.090
State alum or attend one of our campuses that
youre always connected youre always part of

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.450
this bond, this family that weve
created, and the bonds will be there forever

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.100
for the rest of your life. And I think
a lot of that is exemplified through the Nittany

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:58.229
Lion mascot. Thats the way the associate
it with everyone.

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.469
