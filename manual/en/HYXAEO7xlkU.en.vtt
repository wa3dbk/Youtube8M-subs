Hello, my name’s Adrian Richards, thank
you for watching the video. I’m a plastic

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.090
surgeon and the surgical director of Aurora
Clinics and today I’m going to be talking

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:15.379
about a new type of facelift called a MACS
facelift. I’m going to be discussing what

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:20.260
it is and who’s suitable.
So a traditional facelift, which I’m going

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:27.949
to talk about in other videos, has got a lot
of names but might be known as a SMAS facelift,

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:32.840
a deep plane facelift, all these words which
I’ll discuss in other videos because the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:40.530
words used to describe facelifts are really,
really complicated. So I’ll slowly work

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.940
through that in the videos.
So what is a MACS facelift? Well basically

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:53.140
a MACS facelift was first devised as a modification
of the S lift which was very popular in Europe

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.379
probably about 15 years ago and the MACS facelift
was really devised and modified in Belgium

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:03.379
in 2001. Who’s it suitable for? Well basically
it’s suitable for the younger patient, normally

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:17.090
45 to 55. Why is it different from the normal
facelift? The real difference is that tradition

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:23.590
al facelift goes behind the ear, so also lifts
the neck. The MACS facelift tends to lift

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:35.230
the soft tissue of the cheek more vertically,
so upwards. A traditional facelift is more

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.060
back, very good for tightening the neck, a
MACS facelift lifts more upwards. So what

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:45.900
it does is it lifts the cheek, nasolabial
fold and jowls, a MACS lift does that, I don’t

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:52.060
know if you can see that on the video but
it does that, it does not do backwards, it

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:04.420
does up. A good example of this, the prominence
of your cheek used to be up there, with gravity

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.310
it comes down, the jaw line with time goes
down and you tend to sort of get jowling here.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:19.510
So what a MACS lift does, by an incision in
the hairline here in front of the top part

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:27.000
of the ear, normally behind the nobble of
the ear, the tragus and down, is do this.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:34.000
So who’s suitable? Relatively younger patients,
really 45 to 55, people who are generally

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.330
fit and healthy, people who don’t want a
lot of down time because it’s a very quick

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.790
recover and it doesn’t work that well for
people with really loose skin in the neck,

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.240
particularly in the middle. So if you’ve
got really loose skin in the neck, a MACS

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.750
isn’t for you, you really need a specialised
neck lift, which is a different procedure

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:02.780
which I’m going to talk about.
So in summary, a MACS facelift, the initials

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:13.130
stand for minimal access, which means short
scar, unlike a normal facelift, cranial suspension.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:17.620
Cranial suspension basically means for these
soft tissues, which I’ve talked about which

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.961
we’re going to lift up, are firmly anchored
to the deep tissues of the scalp here. So

00:03:23.961 --> 00:03:33.380
MA; minimal access, CS; cranial suspension,
the MACS facelift. So good for younger patients

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:39.260
who want a quick recovery, they haven’t
got a really saggy neck who want basically

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:41.290
rejuvenation, putting the skin and the soft
tissues back where they were ten years ago.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.490
So a very good technique in selected patients
and if you’d like to know whether you’re

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.880
suitable, think you might be suitable, please
send us a photograph of yourself or better

00:03:49.880 --> 00:04:03.840
still, arrange a consultation so we can discuss
the best way forward for you. If you’d like

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.819
to arrange a consultation, either do so by
email to the Aurora website or phone us on

00:04:08.819 --> 00:04:10.200
