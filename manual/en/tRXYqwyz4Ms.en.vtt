00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.560
CASEY CORMIER: We can use certain harmonics
to take us out of our typical standard tuning

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.919
and give us something different. So, let's
try it just a really simple one. This is drop

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:16.180
D tuning. This is very popular and lots of
rock and roll genres but also, you know just-just

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.861
in general for some people. If you have a
song that it's in the key of D major and you

00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:24.840
want to lower D on top but you don't have
a bassist. This is a good way of getting it

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:33.350
done. So, play open D, okay, and then you
play the 12th fret harmonic. There is a 12th

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:41.430
harmonic too of the E string, remember barely
touching right on top. Now, you hear those

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.949
aren't the same note at all. [HUMMING] We
want them to sound the same so we're going

00:00:45.949 --> 00:01:07.700
to play D on the 12th fret harmonic here on
E, go to the knob immediately.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:20.950
Okay, now we have a D as a bass string, okay.
If we play D major cord now remember when

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:29.240
we played D major before, we used the D as
our bass to open D, well now, you can have

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:36.900
the low D as a bass. See how much thicker
that cord is but this also changes our other

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:42.570
cords so we can't play a G major like this
anymore, see, it doesn't work. What you have

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:48.460
to do now is play with our third finger, the
5th fret of the A string is now-this is a

00:01:48.460 --> 00:02:14.220
G, see, D, F-D, E, F, G. [GUITAR PLAYING]
Okay, so try experimenting with drop D tuning.
