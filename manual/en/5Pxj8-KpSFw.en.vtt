00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:14.340
Pluto was named by an 11 year old English
schoolgirl named Venetia Burney.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:21.380
It was named after the Roman God of the underworld
and until 2006 it was considered the 9th planet

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.760
in the solar system.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.540
It was discovered by 24 year old American
astronomer Clyde Tombaugh at the Lowell Observatory

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:34.340
on February 18th 1930.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.590
By comparing photographic plates taken over
separate nights, Tombaugh spotted that one

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.910
point of light had moved.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.870
On closer inspection it was found to be the
elusive ‘Planet X' that had been predicted

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.500
for many years.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.410
Pluto is a tiny little world; it is smaller
than our Moon.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.700
It has a brownish yellow colour.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:02.760
But to see it you need a very large telescope
indeed.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:11.130
It is so far away, on average 5 trillion km
from the Sun, that even the best images show

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.850
nothing of the planet.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.390
It goes around the sun once in 250 Earth years
in a very elliptical orbit which sometimes

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.899
brings it in closer than Neptune.

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:31.090
In 1978 it was discovered that Pluto had a
tiny Moon Charon and then in 2005 two more

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.400
satellites were discovered Nix and Hydra.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.899
So why is Pluto no longer a Planet?

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:45.479
In 2006 the international astronomical union
drew a series of rules that determined what

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:52.270
a planet is and Pluto simply did not qualify;
in fact there are more deserving bodies in

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.479
the solar system.

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.529
A planet must be in orbit around the Sun.

00:01:58.529 --> 00:02:04.460
A planet must be big enough to pull itself
into a roundish shape.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.660
And a Planet must have cleared its orbit of
other bodies.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.670
Pluto is now considered to be just a large
member of the Kuiper belt, a band of space

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.320
debris left over from the formation of the
solar system.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.750
These ‘minor planets' are now known as ‘Dwarf
planets'.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.230
NASA launched the new horizons mission to
Pluto in 2006.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:43.550
It will arrive in 2015 carrying with it, the
Ashes of its discoverer Clyde Tombaugh.
