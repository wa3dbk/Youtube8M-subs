Next we want to fill our pots, but first off
we want to talk about the different types

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.919
of potting mix that are available. You can
go to a garden center and pick up probably

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:18.670
any of these types. This is a nice loose mix,
which just consists of pearl lite and peat.

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.369
You can see it's very light and very airy.
This is a typical annual mix. This is a mix

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.400
we use here at the farm, which has some chunkier
pieces of pearl lite, which are these little

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.940
white things. It's got a little bit of bark
and it's got peat. The bark is to increase

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:47.280
some aeration in the soil and it holds on
to a little bit more water. This is a perennial

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:54.760
mix where you can see that it gets even chunkier.
It has big pieces of bark in it and the same

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:04.199
thing. Better aeration and holds on to water
a little longer. Then this is a sandy mix.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:10.970
I took some of the annual mix and I put some
sand in it. It'll be one part of the regular

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:21.750
mix and two parts of the sand. For todayâ€™s
purpose we're going to just use the regular

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:33.670
potting mix. So we don't make a mess. Go a
little light. I went to the top because when

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.330
I water it it's not going to sink. I'm not
going to press down on it because we don't

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.570
want to take the air. The plants need air
especially the roots, so we don't want to

00:01:41.570 --> 00:02:00.100
make that mistake of pressing down. We'll
just fill up all our pots. Okay.
