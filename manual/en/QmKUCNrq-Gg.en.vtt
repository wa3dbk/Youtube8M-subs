00:00:00.254 --> 00:00:03.894
&gt;&gt; No!

00:00:03.894 --> 00:00:05.535
&gt;&gt; Shut up!

00:00:10.846 --> 00:00:11.809
&gt;&gt; Come on.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.404
[ Sound of gunfire ] &gt;&gt; Come on.

00:00:19.404 --> 00:00:20.117
Come on.

00:00:20.117 --> 00:00:21.628
Go, guys.

00:00:21.628 --> 00:00:22.683
Let's go, chief.

00:00:22.683 --> 00:00:23.534
Come on.

00:00:29.038 --> 00:00:30.313
Chief, what are you doing?

00:00:30.313 --> 00:00:31.309
Come on.

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:32.998
&gt;&gt; You guys go on without me.

00:00:32.998 --> 00:00:34.799
I'm slowing you down.

00:00:34.799 --> 00:00:36.694
&gt;&gt; Chief, no.

00:00:36.694 --> 00:00:38.272
&gt;&gt; We got to keep moving.

00:00:45.092 --> 00:00:47.384
&gt;&gt; Quick, get back to the headquarters.

00:01:12.879 --> 00:01:14.273
&gt;&gt; All right, let's do it again.

00:01:14.273 --> 00:01:16.966
This time, make sure you jump over the box.

00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.035
&gt;&gt; Fine.

00:01:18.035 --> 00:01:19.205
I know.

00:01:26.088 --> 00:01:27.254
&gt;&gt; Seriously?

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:28.449
&gt;&gt; What?

00:01:28.449 --> 00:01:29.899
&gt;&gt; It's like 3 feet high.

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:30.769
&gt;&gt; Give me a break.

00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:32.810
Yesterday, I pulled a muscle playing Wii tennis.

00:01:34.425 --> 00:01:35.720
&gt;&gt; Wii tennis?

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.216
&gt;&gt; It's a physically demanding sport!

00:01:49.779 --> 00:01:50.720
Ian?

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.791
&gt;&gt; What?

00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:55.209
&gt;&gt; I finally make it over the box and you are standing here on your phone.

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:56.301
&gt;&gt; Hold on.

00:01:56.301 --> 00:01:59.590
Greg sent me this hilarious picture of the party last night.

00:02:02.854 --> 00:02:04.118
&gt;&gt; You need to pay attention.

00:02:04.118 --> 00:02:05.983
You always have your phone while we are filming.

00:02:05.983 --> 00:02:12.285
&gt;&gt; Well, I figured it would take you ten more times to jump over that box since you seem to be box jumping challenged.

00:02:12.285 --> 00:02:19.983
&gt;&gt; I am sick of you being critical of my performance when you look at pictures of guys' butts on your phone when we are filming.

00:02:19.983 --> 00:02:22.304
&gt;&gt; That picture was funny and you know it.

00:02:23.604 --> 00:02:24.944
What are you doing?

00:02:24.944 --> 00:02:26.762
Are you quitting or something?

00:02:26.762 --> 00:02:29.072
&gt;&gt; Yes, I am quitting.

00:02:29.072 --> 00:02:30.292
&gt;&gt; Fine!

00:02:30.292 --> 00:02:31.643
Go ahead and quit.

00:02:31.643 --> 00:02:34.133
But I am keeping the cameraman.

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:35.194
&gt;&gt; That's not fair.

00:02:35.194 --> 00:02:36.681
I'm entitled to my fair share of that cameraman.

00:02:36.681 --> 00:02:41.532
&gt;&gt; Fine, I will take him Monday through Thursday and you can have them Friday through Sunday.

00:02:41.532 --> 00:02:43.422
&gt;&gt; He is Mormon.

00:02:43.422 --> 00:02:44.672
He can't work on Sundays.

00:02:44.672 --> 00:02:47.063
This is all my fault, isn't it?

00:02:47.063 --> 00:02:49.060
I hate you guys.

00:02:50.452 --> 00:02:51.720
&gt;&gt; Whatever, man.

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:53.346
I am out of here.

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:54.167
&gt;&gt; Fine.

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:55.317
I'll just get a new partner.

00:02:55.317 --> 00:02:57.296
And he's going to be way funnier than you.

00:02:57.296 --> 00:03:15.297
And he's going to be able to jump over boxes and laugh at pictures of people's butts and he's going to have a way cooler name than you like Ernesto or Fernando or Antwon, Pablo, Ian, Maria, Guadalupe, or Ian.

00:03:15.297 --> 00:03:18.073
Yeah, I think I just covered about all the cool names.

00:03:18.073 --> 00:03:19.251
Idiot.
