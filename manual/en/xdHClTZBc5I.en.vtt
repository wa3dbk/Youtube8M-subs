And finally, here we are. And not to shabby
I must say! Er.. if you like really small castles. 

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.029
What are you talking about? That's, that's
a nice castle. It took me all day to make!

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.300
Yeah, sure, I'm a canary, and I can tell you
right now that's not a nice castle, that's

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.250
a small and boring castle. A canary huh? You're
not a canary, you're a chicken! You see this

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:46.949
feather, that means I'm a canary, I'm not
a chicken! Listen to this beautiful voice,

00:00:46.949 --> 00:00:52.979
LALALALALALA!!(Singing badly) You have to
at least admit though, this is a lovely view.

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:58.820
You can see everything from up here! Yeah
if it wasn't for your tiny little castle!

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:03.369
Wait... What's that over there? It looks like
a person. It looks like they're gonna knock

00:01:03.369 --> 00:01:10.369
at your castle! I knew it was a bad idea to
come over here! Hey you! Over here! Uh, is

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.450
it really a good idea to get his attention?
What if he's here to kill us? Hold on, I'll

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.450
be right there! Wait, don't go! Who's gonna
feed me seeds after you're dead?! Whew, Hi,

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:29.830
I'm Scifiguy, uh, this is my castle, who are
you? Help, please, help me... Oh my god! It's

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.560
a girl, Chix, she needs help! Get over here!
What if it's a trick? I don't wanna die! You're

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.040
not gonna die, just get over here! We need
to get her into the castle! Hurry up! Ok,

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:48.040
fine! But if I die, I'm coming back and haunting
you! Wow, she's really pretty. If you say

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.380
so, you giants look all the same to me, just
a bunch of big blockheads. Yeah, and you're

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.680
a chicken. How many times do I have to tell
you, I'm a canary! Yeah, yeah. Ugh, Where

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.270
am I?! Oh good, you're awake! You came to
my castle and passed out, before you even

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.270
told me your name! Oh. I'm Fanficgirl. I...
I remember... (Crying) Are you ok? Of course

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:25.040
she's not ok! Can't you see she's crying?!
Ss... Sorry, It's... It's just hard. Exhale.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.280
I am a princess from a beautiful mountain
kingdom called Ardor. It was a flourishing

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:44.890
community, with busy markets, where people
would come from all around to trade. Earlier

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:52.209
that day, before the tragedy, I had fought
with my father, and decided to leave Ardor.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.720
As I was climbing a nearby mountain I saw
an army of terrifying and strange creatures

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:06.720
marching toward the kingdom. I watched Helplessly
as the evil hordes burned my homeland to the

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.849
ground. I don't even know if anyone survived.
Wow... that's a lot to take in. It has become

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:25.849
my quest to seek aid to fight this new enemy.
Will you join me? Give me uh, couple minutes

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:31.470
to think. Wait, you're gonna think about it?
A minute ago, you were drooling over this

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.470
blockhead, and now you're gonna think about
it? No, it's ok. I understand. I don't expect

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:44.420
you to give your life for someone you just
met. No, it's not that, of course I'll help

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:51.420
you. I'm just trying to figure out how to
put together an army. So, where are we headed?

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:57.120
We're going to the nearest village. I'm hoping
we can find some people to join our cause.

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:04.120
(Zombies moaning in background). I don't like
it out here, I keep hearing the moans of the

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.390
undead, it's freaking me out! Don't worry
about them, Chix, we're moving to fast for

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:16.390
them to be a threat anyway. Oh my! Wait, what
is that? Uhh, I think it's a cow! That is

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:25.410
no ordinary cow. Yeah, I think it's drooling!
That cow has been changed. It looks awfully

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:34.029
like the creatures I saw in the army of darkness.
It's just one cow, I think I can take him.

00:04:34.029 --> 00:04:41.029
Be careful, and make it quick, there are still
zombies out there! How're you doin little

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:48.430
guy? Are you, are you ok? (Growl). What the
heck? Oh no! Ahhhh! Will Scifiguy defeat the

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:58.360
corrupt cow? Will our heroes form their army?
Stay tuned next time for more of, MINECRAFT

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:05.360
HERO!!
