00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.510
What's up Attackers?

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:11.440
Today is Thursday February 27th, Ashley here
with your daily MMO News, exclusively from

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:12.910
MMO Attack.com.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.090
Today is sad and gloomy here in San Diego,
which is a rarity, but the news we have is

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:19.320
far from it.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.430
On today's show we've got a necromantic manipulator
in Black Gold Online, and Infinite Crisis

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.290
open beta announcement and a big year for
World of Tanks.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.180
Your daily XP starts now!

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:34.850
Today, Black Gold Online unveiled a mage class
that shows off its Steampunk side.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.460
The Conjurer, who fuses steam technology with
the power of dark magic, draws their power

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:40.790
from beyond the grave.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:46.180
This new long to mid range mage class uses
their enigmatic sorcery to cast powerful spirit

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.789
spells and provides a class for those who
like to sit back, cast and destroy.

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.610
The Conjurer is ideal for those who like to
support the team with CC and do their fair

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.410
share of DPS, while sitting back and taking
in the view.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.190
Just kidding, you don't have time to admire
when your blasting the heck out of cheesy

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.579
Avril Lavigne trailers.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.659

will begin on March 20th, so make sure to

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.200
The Infinite Crisis Open Beta date has been
announced, and with it comes a slew, if that's

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.860
the right word, a slew of new champions.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.580
So, let's get to the details.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.820
Warner Bros, and Turbine's MOBA will start
its open beta on Friday, March 14th.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.980
On that date the Green Arrow, Aquaman and
Mecha Superman will be released into the game.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.189
Mecha Superman is a massive enforcer, who
will use his metal tonnage to fissure the

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.170
ground, and create earthquakes while stunning
enemies.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:43.079
Green Arrow is a DPS marksman, armed with
a bow and quiver of specialized arrows, while

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:47.050
Aquaman is a strong duelist who wields a mighty
trident in combat.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:48.050
His only enemy?

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.009
A six packs plastic rings.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.570
Along with the new heroes, the Open beta will
include the new tri-lane map, Gotham Divided.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.200

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.310
Lastly, World of Tanks is planning for a huge
year in 2014, and with the release of today's

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.170
trailer, they are planning on revealing their
major plans throughout the year with a new

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.679
series of developer diaries.

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.450
The plans for the year include delivering
a completely new combat experience by overhauling

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.520
the look and feel of the game.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.940
Technical enhancements like dynamic suspension,
damageable parts, a graphics render revamping

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.880
and new meta game functionality are all part
of the new experience.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:29.650
Each feature will be fully described through
a dev diary throughout the year and implemented

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.120
shortly thereafter.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:33.550
