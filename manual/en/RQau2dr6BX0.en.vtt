Hi my name is Dave Andrews and today I'm going
to explain to you how computer hard drives

00:00:07.389 --> 00:00:14.130
work. I have a diagram on my computer that
I'm going to pull up. And this is basically

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:20.949
the parts of a hard drive kind of taken apart
to where you can see each individual one.

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:25.430
Now hard drive is basically if you looked
inside your computer it would be like a block,

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:32.289
maybe be a little bit larger then an index
card and that is a basically a block of metal

00:00:32.289 --> 00:00:36.420
and these are the parts that are inside of
that hard drive. You have a what's called

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:42.530
a read head right here, and you also have
platters. Now these platters are basically

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:48.989
if you look at it, it looks like a CD but
instead of being like a CD it uses magnetism

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:55.889
to store data. What happens is when your hard
drive is spinning up is these platters inside

00:00:55.889 --> 00:01:01.870
of your hard drive will spin very, very fast.
And they'll spin constantly. Some will spin

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:06.880
at fifty four hundred rpms others will spin
at seventy two hundred. There's even a ten

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:13.470
thousand rpm hard drives and higher. Now what
rpm does for you is the faster this spins

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.939
conceivably the faster that hard drive is
going to be able to read data and certain

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.570
conditions. But basically wrapped around this
platter if you follow my little hand here,

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:33.920
kind of growing out as it goes around are
strips basically of data. And that data is

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:40.119
stored magnetically little a, it will either
be a part that has no magnetism or a part

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:48.130
that does have magnetism. And this read head
will scroll around on this hard drive to different

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:55.149
parts of it and it will as it spins pull that
data off that hard drive. If it is a magnetized

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:58.960
area of the hard drive it will read a one,
if it's not a magnetized area of the hard

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.330
drive it will read a zero. And you combine
all those little ones and zeros together and

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:10.909
you get the data off of the hard drive. And
that is how a hard drive works. My name is

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:15.209
Dave Andrews and I've just described to you
how a computer hard drive works.
