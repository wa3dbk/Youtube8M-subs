00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:02.539
The mines in the Netherlands all closed long ago.

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:05.720
So how special will it be to see equipment like this here once again?

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.760
This section will eventually become the highest point of the track and represents an important moment for us.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.619
In this series of films we take you on a journey through the development...

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:21.579
...and creation of Efteling’s latest spectacular rollercoaster.

00:00:21.579 --> 00:00:28.979
In this episode, we take a look at the large quantity of mining equipment sent to us following the appeal made by the design team.

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:32.340
We are also present as an important milestone is reached.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.310
The highest point of the entire attraction. 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:38.970
This is 'The Making of: Baron 1898'.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.480
Efteling has been searching for original items of mining equipment for the interior of Baron 1898.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.450
Its earlier appeal did not fall on deaf ears.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.880
A few weeks ago, we put out an appeal for original mining parts and equipment.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:04.290
This proved to be very successful and we received a lot of responses.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.570
Some of the unusual items we have received include a whole collection of mining lamps, mining helmets and telephones used in the mines.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.479
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.620
It’s no longer possible to go out and buy this type of equipment, so we’re very pleased with the results.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.020
We still don’t have enough, by any means, and we’re still searching for various items...

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.660
...to make the attraction more authentic and believable.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.360
To achieve the quantities required, we’re also having certain items reproduced.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.400
We’re having extra helmets made, for example, so we have 40 identical ones straight away.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.210
We’re giving them more of an Efteling character by adding small details or using a certain colour.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.000
The mines in the Netherlands all closed long ago, so how special will it be...

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.900
...to walk through a room like this and see all the equipment once again?

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:56.210
Including genuine items also makes it feel like a real mine.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:07.470
As the search for mining parts and equipment for the interior continues...

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.029
...on the construction site, people are working hard on the details that add authenticity to the terminal building.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.240
The building has reached the finishing stage. The shell is complete and we’re working on the attraction’s theming.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:20.600
The most beautiful elements are currently being added to the building.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:22.780
This is evident on the outside of the building.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.580
The steel frameworks, the shading, the colouring and the patterned ironwork above the entrance are already in place.

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:31.090
This helps to create the appropriate context and time period.

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:33.220
You can also see it on the chimney.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.980
Although this was only recently built, it is already blackened around the top.

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:44.749
A lot of work is taking place on the track and the various sections are really taking shape.

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.040
The tunnel section is complete and the lift section is installed. That was very exciting.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.320
The wind was blowing hard.

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.889
We were uncertain whether we should allow work to continue.

00:02:55.889 --> 00:03:00.439
In the end we decided to bring in a large, 400-ton crane and a 200-ton crane.

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:05.319
Which together raised the lift section and carefully positioned it within the building.

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:08.479
That was really nerve-racking.

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:11.899
There were only five centimetres to spare on each side and sometimes nothing at all, when the wind blew hard

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:20.849
We also used two large cranes to reposition the platform.

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.449
Which was carefully lifted and once again fitted perfectly.

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:34.559
Behind us is the section of track which goes on top of the lift and platform, where passengers pause briefly before the freefall.

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:39.879
This section will eventually become the highest point of the track and represents an important moment for us.

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:42.829
And perhaps also the most important part of the ride.

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:48.859
Because it’s this section of track that provides the thrill; hanging briefly in mid-air before falling into the tunnel.

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:56.809
And that’s the stage we’ve reached.

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:04.089
The utmost precision was required to fit Baron 1898’s final and highest lift section in place.

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:12.220
It was a success.

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:19.620
The highest point of Baron 1898 has been reached; a milestone that is a cause for celebration on the construction site.

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.460
On 1 September last year, we started work with the aim of opening this summer.

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:30.789
Six months later, we have reached the highest point; a unique moment!

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:33.279
And which companies have been involved in this?

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:39.679
Hoppenbrouwers, Gubbels, BOM Engineering, Heijmans, Bouwbedrijf John van Gestel, Van den Bersselaar...

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:49.580
Brouwers Groenaannemers, TIAB, Bartels, Van Nunen, B&amp;M, Van Aken Architecten, Fugro, Hoffmann Groep, TÜV...

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.000
...Van der Kolk, Alcedo en L&amp;L.

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:52.720
I believe these are all Brabant-based companies.

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.900
A fact of which Efteling is very proud.

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:19.079
