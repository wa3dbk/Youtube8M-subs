00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:12.400
This episode of Tekzilla is brought to you
by Net Flix.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.480
If your PC ready for Battlefield 3, the beta
for one of the biggest games of the year,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.860
Battlefield 3 is out and after spending last
week locked in a dark room my partner this

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.310
week in computer hardware Ryan Shrout just
finished up PC Pro.com Battlefield 3 system

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.300
build guide aka the guide to what you need
to not get snuffed in Battlefield 3.

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.660
Welcome back to Tekzilla Ryan.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.490
Hey, how are you?

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.960
Are you over this game yet?

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.680
Literally, how many hours did you spend testing
this last week?

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.930
Well, I don’t know, if I go to the actual
Battlefield battle log I could probably tell

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.770
you how many hours I played, it was a lot.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:52.500
It was a lot and I would be lying if it was
all testing, there was a lot testing in there.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.780
You just spent overnight, you downloaded Rage,
have you already moved beyond Battlefield

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:02.310
to Rage or will you be playing Battlefield
at all this week?

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.610
So, it will depend on how good Rage turns
out to be I guess.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.180
Haven’t had any time really with Rage before
the launch happens tonight at midnight so

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.479
it will be interesting to see how that goes,
from a website site perspective and a performance

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:22.470
perspective from now through basically Christmas
each PC game release that is lined up is going

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.969
to take up a lot of time.

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:26.049
It’s a high class problem.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:32.749
We should talk about Battlefield 3, minimal
specs kind of work.

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:33.749
What are the recommended specs?

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:35.130
Kind of.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.420
The recommended specifications are more important
than minimums.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.670
Minimums go all the way back to the Radion
3000 series and the Gforce 8000, 8800, those

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.659
types of cards.

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:50.810
Recommended system specs are Windows 7, 64
bit, quad core PCU, 4 gigs of memory.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.069
If your graphics card, which is just about
the most important part is either a Gforce

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:00.270
GTX 560 or a Radion 6950.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.360
This isn’t crisis, but this is pretty taxing
on your system, what’s going on here?

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.720
It’s, they spend a lot of time improving
texture, improving shader quality using a

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.400
lot of post processing anti-aliasing for the
first time as well that uses a lot of GPU

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:16.560
horse power.

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.010
The really set the bar very high for themselves
in terms of what the quality of the game will

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:25.489
look like and then you’ll notice in the
recommended specs and if you’ll look at

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:31.129
all the quality setting low through ultra,
they kind of set the bar pretty high saying,

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.460
we don’t want our game to look any worse
than this and if you don’t have this type

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:38.299
of hardware then you will just have to deal
with it.

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.250
So, what do you feel at this point, if you
are going to buy the game what would you want

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.090
for your minimum CPU and GPU?

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.380
For your processor I think we can be pretty
flexible here, anything that is a quad core

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.140
processor is going to be able to handle it.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.150
They are recommending quad core but they don’t
specify anything in terms of frequency other

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.870
than that, that lets you know the game multi-threaded
capable in our testing, we haven’t done

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.819
a lot of CPU testing, but I disabled and enabled
cores and hyper threading and that kind of

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:12.400
stuff and it does seem you use 3-4 threads
of processing relatively modestly.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:18.189
??? processor never went above 40% CPU utilization,
and that was even running frapps for performance

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:19.239
testing and that kind of stuff.

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:25.400
So I think if you have any kind of Athlon,
??, Sandy Bridge Quad care processor you should

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.079
be find on the CPU front.

00:03:28.079 --> 00:03:32.340
But you will be feeling pain if you try to
do it on a dual core processor?

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.200
I would say you would probably get a way with
it, we’ve had a lot of commentors in forums

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.500
members talking about that they have dual
core processors and it does work, you can

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.329
do it, and I think you might be bottle necked
a little bit more at the lower resolutions

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:49.080
than you would be at the higher resolutions
so at that point it depends on what image

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.829
quality setting you are actually using.

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:56.060
This seems to be a game that is much intense
on the GPU side of things, than the CPU.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.189
It is, definitely.

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:03.689
In our little review we did, our article kind
of system build guide for Battlefield 3, we

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:08.280
kind of laid it out in three different tiers
of image quality.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.680
We targeted at, if you are a user that wants
to do, you are ok with medium quality settings,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.489
you are ok with 1680x1050 resolution, maybe
that is the native resolution of your screen

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:17.900
as it is.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:25.440
We recommend a GTX560 or a Rabian5860 or above
which kind of fits in with the recommended

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.580
setting from EA and Dice in the game.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:33.080
If you want to do higher res gaming like a
1080p, a high quality settings, you go up

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:38.650
to us recommending the top ?? and the single
DPU in either video or IMD, the GTX560 or

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:45.560
the Radion 6970 then if you go even above
that, if you have a 30 inch panel, you have

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.000
2560x1600 or if you are doing like triple
monitor gaming, this game will support three

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.470
displays and Ifinity or video surround which
is really nice.

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.110
Then you get into really high cost, you’re
going to need two 580’s or two 6970’s

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.550
which are going to cost you about $1000 for
the graphics cards.

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:10.280
It is a game, commitment here if you want
a game a higher resolutions.

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:16.560
But it doesn’t seem that crisis still works,
they started throwing trauma to your GPU just

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:18.849
because they could.

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:23.620
No, I think they are actually, we were able
to play it on local quality settings with

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.360
90, 100 GT and you could play and an you had
passable frame rates, so if you don’t want

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.919
to upgrade, you might still be able to get
away with playing the game, it’s a pretty

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:39.780
different experience than if you have a GTX560
or a Radion 6000 series card or higher.

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:45.290
Its definitely the most taxing game we have
seen on a PC in quite some time, we kind of

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:50.669
complained that crisis 2 didn’t push graphics,
?? really didn’t push GPU technology, this

00:05:50.669 --> 00:05:51.759
definitely does.

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:58.800
Our goals were 60 frames per second at these
resolutions and quality settings and the GTX580

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.580
just barely being able to get by at 1080p
high quality settings.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.849
That is what ????? and ???? love to see, right,
they love to see what is going to force you

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:08.949
guys to buy more graphics cards.

00:06:08.949 --> 00:06:11.190
Desperate need for better GPUs.

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:16.270
Obviously, Rage, is that going to be the number
one occupation over at pcpro.com this week?

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:22.599
Yep, we are going to start testing on that
tonight and do the same type of performance

00:06:22.599 --> 00:06:25.139
analysis that we did for this.

00:06:25.139 --> 00:06:31.509
My initial impression is that Rage is not
going to be as GPU intense as it will be CPU

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:34.229
and memory intense which will be kind of interesting,
it will be the first time for something like

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:37.780
that in a long time in the gaming world, but
we’ll have to see later on that.

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.410
That will definitely be the focus from a PC
perspective for probably the next week or

00:06:41.410 --> 00:06:42.410
so.

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:43.410
