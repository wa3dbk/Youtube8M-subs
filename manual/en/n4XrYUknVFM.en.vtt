00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:04.990
One patient takes Ginseng and it works for
them, gives them lots of energy, makes them

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:10.920
feel great. Another person takes Ginseng and
they feel awful, they get aggravated, they

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.220
get palpitations in their heart, just doesn't
work right. So what gives? What's the difference

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:20.369
between Eastern herbs and Western herbs? Or
the way that they're used? Hi my name is Mark

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.070
Brinson, Doctor of Oriental Medicine, Physical
Medicine Specialist, and International Seminar

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.779
Provider. There's a big difference between
the way that Eastern and Western herbs are

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.370
used and the philosophy that's behind them.
So let's take for instance something like

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.410
Ginseng, to tell you how specific the, the
prescription needs to be to match someone.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:44.660
When we say Ginseng from a Western standpoint,
we think all Ginsengs are alike, but in reality,

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.000
there's over five main types of Ginsengs and
a lot of sub-species of it that do completely

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.950
opposite things. Let's, let me give you a
few examples. Have you ever had someone take

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:58.710
an herb, or yourself take something that just
didn't quite work for you? And you took it

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.820
on the recommendation of a friend who though
it was the best thing ever. Well lets' say

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.770
for instance that I have heart palpitations,
I have high blood pressure, I'm a little bit

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.329
irritable, but I don't feel like I have that
much energy. If I take something like a Korean

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:18.689
Ginseng, which has a very hot property to
it, it's going to make all of those things

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.319
worse. Where if I take something like and
American Ginseng, which is totally on the

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:27.979
other side of the spectrum, it's going to
cool my body, it's going to take my irritation,

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.850
my aggravation away, but it's also going to
give me energy at the same time. So what's

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.810
different about Eastern and Western Herbology
is that they're very specific on the properties

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.950
that are created once it's inside me. So by
taking something in, it's not going to be

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:48.560
the same for everybody, for that person who's
hot, they can't have hot type herbs or foods.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.509
Where the person that's cool, and tends to
be cold, to like hot drinks, to always be

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:59.240
on the low side of things, if they took something
like that Korean Ginseng, they would feel

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.280
great or phenomenal. So the basics of it are
in how specific the diagnosis needs to be

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.840
in order to prescribe them properly. My name
is Mark Brinson, Doctor of Oriental Medicine,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.700
hoping this helped you a little bit in finding
your balance today.
