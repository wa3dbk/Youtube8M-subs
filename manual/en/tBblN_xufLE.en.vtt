00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:06.049
Hey everyone!

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.660
I'm Jessica from JewelryTutorialHQ.com
and Bespangled Beads on Etsy.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.370
Today I'm going to show you how to make a
knotted cord bracelet using waxed linen cord.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.960
This bracelet is going to have a sliding knot
so that your bracelet will be an adjustable

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.749
size and fit almost any size wrist.

00:00:23.749 --> 00:00:27.810
You'll find a complete list of supplies and
tools needed for this project

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.789
below the video.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:35.850
We're going to start with 24 inches of waxed
linen cord (.8mm) and tie a knot as close

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.010
as you can get to the end.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.140
Just a quick note: If you want to make a design
that has more knots than this bracelet, then

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.530
you're going to want to start with a longer
piece of cord.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.980
Now before I start beading, I'm just going
to apply a little bit of beeswax to the end

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.879
of the cord.

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:57.719
And then I want to pay attention
to which direction the threads are already

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.300
twisted and I want to twist between my thumb
and forefinger in that same direction.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.300
This

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.970
is going to help prevent fraying.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:14.620
I'm going to start by sliding on a spacer
bead and then I'm going to make a knot.

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:23.640
Now I'm going to use an awl, which is a pointed
steel tool that's mounted in a handle.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.700
And this is really the trick to getting your
knots to land exactly where you want them

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:29.750
to go!

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:37.211
While the knot is nice and loose, slide in
the awl towards the bottom of the knot, and

00:01:37.211 --> 00:01:38.211
pull.

00:01:38.211 --> 00:01:41.330
The knot should slide easily along the cord.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:45.470
This is how you get it to move wherever you
want it.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:51.960
So we're going to pull on the loose end of
the cord until that knot gets nice and tight

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.090
up against the bead and pull it really tight,

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.390
and then using your thumbnail, kind of push

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:04.710
up against the knot as you slide it off the
awl.

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.380
Give it one more little tug

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.670
and that knot
should be nice and secure right up against

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:12.200
your bead.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.180
Now that is going to be the dangling end of
the bracelet so we're going to go about 2

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.840
inches in and this time we want to make a
double knot.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.620
To do that, you make a regular knot and before
you tighten it up you're going to go back

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.750
up through the knot again with the end and
you're going to have something that looks

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.120
like this.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.670
I usually check my placement with a ruler,
and that way I don't waste any cord and I

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:46.480
can make the ends the same length on both
sides.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.069
Now I'm going to string on three 12mm beads
and then make a knot.

00:02:52.069 --> 00:03:01.750
I'm making all of the knots on the inside
of the beading as single knots.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:07.610
Next is going to be one spacer bead, one 12
millimeter bead,

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.260
and then one more spacer bead.

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:17.610
And another knot.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:28.190
Now three more 12mm beads, a spacer bead,
and three more of the 12mm beads.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:36.569
And a knot.

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:44.440
A spacer bead, a 12mm bead, a spacer bead,

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:51.400
and a knot.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:04:05.590
Now our last three 12mm beads, and a double
knot to finish off the beadwork.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:16.970
Now I'm going about 2 inches out from that
last double knot,

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:19.900
and I'm going to make a single knot.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.250
Again I use the ruler to check the placement
and

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:27.849
tighten up the knot against the awl.

00:04:27.849 --> 00:04:45.289
Add the last spacer bead and then the final
knot to finish up the bracelet.

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.939
Snip the end about 2 to 3 millimeters from
the last knot using some really sharp scissors,

00:04:50.939 --> 00:04:53.300
and then we're ready to finish off the bracelet.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.910
Now I'm going to go over this part pretty
fast because I do have another video that

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.909
is entirely dedicated to making this sliding
knot.

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:01.060
So if this gives you trouble,

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.319
check out that video.

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:09.639
Using another piece of cord about 6 inches
long, you want to make a loop on one end and

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.129
leave a longer end to the right.

00:05:12.129 --> 00:05:15.270
And I'm going
to hold both cords of the bracelet overlapping

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:20.199
in my non-dominant hand and hold the loop
between my thumb and forefinger

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:22.080
with the other cords at the same time.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:29.069
I'm going to wrap the longer end of that cord
around all of the pieces about 3 or 4 times,

00:05:29.069 --> 00:05:33.159
wrapping away from the loop, so in this case
I'm wrapping towards the right.

00:05:33.159 --> 00:05:38.190
I'm going to take that longer end and go back
up through each of the loops of the coil that

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:42.949
we just made, including the first loop.

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:51.840
And then pull both ends tight to tighten up
the knot.

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:58.520
Trim the excess cord about 2mm away from the
knot on each side,

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.969
being careful to only cut that extra piece
of cord.

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:10.180
Now you've got a knotted cord bracelet that's
an adjustable size with a sliding knot!

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:14.879

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:21.569
without using glue.
