00:00:00.252 --> 00:00:02.195
(typing)

00:00:02.195 --> 00:00:04.030
(music)

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:05.940
MAN - OFF SCREEN: All right, is everybody ready?

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:06.900
CHRISTIAN COLQUHOUN: Hi there.

00:00:06.942 --> 00:00:08.193
My name is Christian Colquhoun.

00:00:08.193 --> 00:00:10.409
I was one of the mechanical effects guys

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:13.025
for Jurassic Park 2: The Lost World.

00:00:13.025 --> 00:00:18.991
MAN - OFF SCREEN: Okay, air. (chattering
in background) and go.

00:00:18.991 --> 00:00:22.100
CHRISTIAN COLQUHOUN: This was
our compy attack effect

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.941
that we built for Jurassic Park.

00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:25.941
The actually full name
is procompsognathus.

00:00:25.941 --> 00:00:27.322
This is Eric Ostroff.

00:00:27.322 --> 00:00:28.526
He worked in the art department.

00:00:28.526 --> 00:00:30.109
He is standing in for Peter Stormare,

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:33.192
who ended up being the star
of this particular scene.

00:00:33.192 --> 00:00:37.489
Greg Figiel did the sculpt,
Jon Dawe helped me with the RC

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.359
and a lot of the puppeteering

00:00:39.359 --> 00:00:43.324
and a lot of the little procompsognathus
mechanics and mechanisms.

00:00:43.324 --> 00:00:44.871
(music continues)

00:00:44.871 --> 00:00:47.859
This was the beginning
of the blinking eye.

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:51.777
To this day, I can't remember
if it was me or Jon Dawe

00:00:51.777 --> 00:00:54.276
who actually came up with
idea of doing the cylinder

00:00:54.276 --> 00:01:00.027
that actually rotated a wire that
went through the center of the balls,

00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:04.042
so it would actually make the
imitation nictitating membrane blink.

00:01:04.823 --> 00:01:07.407
These are a number of the little guys

00:01:07.407 --> 00:01:10.693
that would be the attack
procompsognathus in the shot.

00:01:10.693 --> 00:01:15.193
They were all foam latex on a
small understructure of wire.

00:01:15.193 --> 00:01:17.943
Again, the advent of CG,
we're trying to keep this

00:01:17.943 --> 00:01:22.574
out of the CG realm and more
into the practical realm.

00:01:22.574 --> 00:01:24.108
MAN OFF SCREEN: Oh, that's crazy.

00:01:24.108 --> 00:01:25.657
CHRISTIAN COLQUHOUN: That was actually
my claim to fame on this movie

00:01:25.657 --> 00:01:27.193
is stealing scenes from CG.

00:01:27.193 --> 00:01:29.900
MAN OFF SCREEN: Oh my god.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.300
CHRISTIAN COLQUHOUN: The string is
actually a spectra line,

00:01:33.317 --> 00:01:37.489
a super high strength,
zero stretch fishing line.

00:01:37.489 --> 00:01:42.777
This guy, there's a bicycle
housing that runs to a velcro pad

00:01:42.777 --> 00:01:46.989
that is positionable on the
velcro suit that was underneath.

00:01:46.989 --> 00:01:50.406
Wherever you pulled when
you pulled the controller,

00:01:50.406 --> 00:01:53.693
it would pull the spectra
from one pad to the other,

00:01:53.693 --> 00:01:56.825
but then if you pulled in the
middle, like tension both sides,

00:01:56.825 --> 00:02:00.624
it would pull right down
to the middle between them.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:05.074
It has a airline trigger
for a solenoid valve

00:02:05.074 --> 00:02:07.441
that would run air through the tails,

00:02:07.441 --> 00:02:10.664
which would whip them around
in a very frenetic action,

00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:12.694
which looked really great on film.

00:02:12.694 --> 00:02:14.193
It made it look very much alive.

00:02:14.193 --> 00:02:17.157
(music continues)

00:02:17.157 --> 00:02:19.659
This was the stunt man,
who is writhing around

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.275
in very interesting pain there.

00:02:22.275 --> 00:02:26.157
There were some non-functional ones
on there that he could rip off,

00:02:26.157 --> 00:02:27.859
but we had about six or seven puppeteers

00:02:27.859 --> 00:02:29.740
that were all operating these things

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:32.411
completely independent of each other.

00:02:32.411 --> 00:02:36.191
It ended up looking really great
and very frenetic and very violent.

00:02:36.191 --> 00:02:38.192
There was a particular
scene with the RC one

00:02:38.192 --> 00:02:40.610
that actually bit Peter
Stormare on the lip

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.026
and he turns in to camera with
this thing gripping his lip

00:02:43.026 --> 00:02:44.240
and there was a little bit of blood on it.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.111
You could hear people
cringe in the dailies.

00:02:46.111 --> 00:02:47.073
It was amazing.

00:02:47.073 --> 00:02:50.777
This is a great effect and like any great
effect, there was a real team effort.

00:02:50.777 --> 00:02:51.943
I'm going to do a big shout out here

00:02:51.943 --> 00:02:54.534
to Jon Dawe, my fellow
mechanical guy, Shane Mahan,

00:02:54.534 --> 00:02:59.117
Jason Matthews, Kevin McTurk,
Eric Ostroff, Greg Figiel,

00:02:59.117 --> 00:03:01.034
and of course, Crash McCreery.

00:03:01.034 --> 00:03:02.342
My name is Christian Colquhoun

00:03:02.342 --> 00:03:05.094
and that was how we did
the procompsognathus attack

00:03:05.094 --> 00:03:06.966
for Jurassic Park 2: Lost World.

00:03:06.966 --> 00:03:10.183
It ended up being really fun
and just a brilliant assignment.

00:03:10.183 --> 00:03:11.781
Thanks.

00:03:12.367 --> 00:03:24.658
(eerie sound)
