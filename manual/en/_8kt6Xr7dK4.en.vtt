Hey everybody this is TD from AllHailProductions.com.

00:00:26.862 --> 00:00:31.402
I wanted to give you guys a heads up on the latest big project.

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:38.390
The one thing that we did today was we worked with Noriko Coco Komatsu, again.

00:00:38.941 --> 00:00:42.794
This time we did something completely different from what she usually does.

00:00:49.874 --> 00:00:51.325
Hey guys it's Coco!　Coco Desu！

00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:56.395
I just finished a photo shoot with TD by AllHailProductions.com.

00:00:57.161 --> 00:01:00.920
He's a wonderful photographer and we had a boxing photo shoot.

00:01:14.622 --> 00:01:19.715
So.... Because I know one of the members of his gym, he's letting us use it.

00:01:20.745 --> 00:01:25.941
So since we have special access to use his gym, we're going to use it!

00:01:48.293 --> 00:01:51.108
And we had a boxing photoshoot actually.

00:01:51.518 --> 00:01:56.010
Which is really completely different from my normal photo shoots.

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:58.258
Like "Glam" photo shoots, "Bikini" photo shoots.

00:01:58.523 --> 00:02:01.470
It was totally different  and you will be surprised when you see the photos.

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.171
So a few people have asked me a few questions recently.

00:02:21.802 --> 00:02:27.926
About how I come up with my photo shoots and how I plan some of them.

00:02:28.723 --> 00:02:34.720
A lot of people usually think that photo shoots just happen.

00:02:35.382 --> 00:02:42.854
Where there's a situation where I know a model and say, "Hey! Why don't we do a photo shoot."

00:02:43.072 --> 00:02:45.895
We go somewhere, we take pictures, and then it's done.

00:02:46.165 --> 00:02:49.222
It's really not that simple and it's really not that easy.

00:02:49.594 --> 00:02:52.426
Especially with bigger photo shoots like this one.

00:02:52.854 --> 00:03:00.405
There was a lot of planning, a lot of favors, a lot of people made a lot of phone call just to make

00:03:00.691 --> 00:03:03.248
this particular photo shoot happen.

00:03:03.575 --> 00:03:12.420
So I really want to say thank you to Honda Naoki who escorted us into the boxing gym.

00:03:13.043 --> 00:03:18.804
I want to say thank you to the Kaichou or the owner of the boxing gym for letting us use his gym.

00:03:18.804 --> 00:03:22.420
He didn't have to and originally he kind of didn't want to.

00:03:22.746 --> 00:03:29.327
But, you know, with a lot of begging and "Onegai"-ing (laugh) he kind of did.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.979
And I especially want to send a huge thank you to my wonderful assistant, Haruka Toda.

00:03:36.241 --> 00:03:41.170
Who always does her best to make sure the shoots go as smoothly as possible.

00:03:41.527 --> 00:03:47.254
She made a ton of phone calls to make sure that this happened.

00:03:47.502 --> 00:03:56.471
If she didn't and if you know, a lot of the kind of stuff that goes on in the background didn't happen, the shoot wouldn't have happened. Seriously.

00:03:56.741 --> 00:04:03.777
So thank you to all of those people, Thank you to Noriko for coming out. Thank you to everyone

00:04:04.021 --> 00:04:10.808
who believes in AllHailProductions and who has helped to make us a very strong team that

00:04:11.017 --> 00:04:16.112
produces high quality amazing work, and for believing in me.

00:04:16.472 --> 00:04:23.557
And thanks to my mom! (laugh) I can't forget to thank mom for all the endless support, and sending me gear!

00:04:23.975 --> 00:04:34.570
And I would like to thank Haruka, assistant, and Rini also, the make up artist and the great gym people.

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.671
So check it out, all the photos and let me know!

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.245
That's it.
