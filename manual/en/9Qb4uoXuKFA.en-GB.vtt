Hi. This is Alon at the
Label Expo 2013 in Brussels.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.960
Label Expo traditionally has been
a good show for Indigo over the past few years.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.920
It´s very focused on the label market
which is one of our fastest growing segments.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:23.000
We are showing not only the label solutions
and a lot of amazing new capabilities,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.000
we are also showing
the next generation

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.800
– wide formats, 29 inch B2
flexible packaging solutions

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.360
and folding carton solutions.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.360
The Indigo 20000
and the Indigo 30000.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.520
We announced today silver ink for the
HP Indigo digital presses for label production.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.760
Silver is something that customers
have been asking for many years.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.000
We have real samples here
that were run on customer jobs

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.720
and the customers have been
very pleased with it.

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:52.880
We announced the release of the
new enhancement pack for the WS6600

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.720
and the new version 4.0 of the labels
and packaging prints powered by Esko

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:03.240
that together will allow customers
to be more productive in a single shift.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:09.800
The Indigo 20000 is being shown
with a brand new ABG Edale Digicon 3000

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.600
which is being shown for the
first time in the world here today.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.160
On the Indigo 30000

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.640
we are showing the brand new
Tresu iCoat 30000

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.360
that goes inline
with the press.

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.240
So, what we’re showing here truly
is the ability to do end to end production

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.880
of wide web labels, of digital flexible
packaging and digital folding carton.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.560
At Multi-Color we produce labels
for home and personal care,

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.080
food and beverage,
wine and spirits customers.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.560
We have 10 Indigos
around the world

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.960
and we use them mainly for
short runs, high quality

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.440
with value added foil
and screen and embossing,

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.320
quick turnaround requirements
for customers, large and small.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.440
The HP Indigo presses not only give us
a low cost footprint for short run work

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.320
but they give us a lot of flexibility
in terms of lead times

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.320
and also the ability, very importantly,
to help innovate for and with our customers.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.120
We are the market leaders
in the label industry

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.800
and many brand owners are using our technology
to promote their products in the market.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.360
Our users have successfully launched
a campaign with a soft drink company

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.800
where they were using digital printing
for personalizing their label

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.520
– to be able to talk
one to one to the consumer.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.000
This is a fantastic campaign and
based on the success of this campaign,

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:31.480
many other brand owners
are looking for similar solutions.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.080
Some of them can go
to mass customization.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.120
Some of them can go to
different versions of each product

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.600
and some others to the personalization
one to one which is the highest value.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.360
HP Indigo is allowing all of it.
