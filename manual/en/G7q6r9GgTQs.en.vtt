maxim

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.800
projectile and in my backyard

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.880
among their plane discoveries in the
content of that

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.269
paid as welcome to what the fletc ayam

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:38.269
that's that's all right now player

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.550
bring his first

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.440
movie tweeters

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.580
but he had pink eye

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.850
i have a nice to have a lot of down with
him so you guys please discuss the law

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.510
racks you want to describe it yes

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.010
yes the lax

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.460
the war or axes in

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.550
evil horrible little peanut of a guy who
hates big industry henny hates consumer

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:02.759
it's and as the tenant at about two

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:09.490
whose cabinet maker like fell lou dobbs
forty on the right now we have pages

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.789
along a puppet of course and three dash

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:16.520
we have every movie that comes out now
is just liberal and evil and the law rex

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.010
is the easy target because it's about
like

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.299
your conscience and understanding that
your actions have consequences ended

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.070
more immediately it's about
deforestation and the lower taxes the

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.940
guardian of the forest and you know it's
all that liberal hollywood stuff

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.570
ticket

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.370
this is on the

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.829
homes archery

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:44.320
used the use of cruel

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.560
time to see

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.710
real redeemed treat

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.100
tracked down the street

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.799
what

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.479
i think he did easy

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:02.900
and i think that's a deal breaker for
the misconstrued massively

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.119
what inevitably misconstrued i think the
river ride is a movie that argues on

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.290
behalf of environmentalism and against
you know uh... large corporations

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:12.799
destroying the earth

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:17.270
soldier against that then yeah it does
not believe that really you know

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.669
uh... are and what this film i was
really surprised because

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:24.159
uh... that the doctors his movies of
late certainly have a very mix track

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.930
record of the live action network

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:26.670
formal

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.340
for thirty minutes not editors who are
working on the house an abomination and

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.980
new partners who was flying mcnamee beef
with it but this will be having really

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.739
gets a ride

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:40.790
it dot and also i think it's really hard
to turn like a thirty page

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:43.040
children's book into a ninety minute
movie

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:45.340
and assume there's a really good job of
sort of like

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.119
it uses the text of the original book
but it also

00:02:49.119 --> 00:02:53.029
has stopped before and after the kind of
make a full story out of a one that's

00:02:53.029 --> 00:02:54.569
actually the part that lost me

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:55.600
because

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.589
it's such the power of doctor seuss
novels third novels books

00:02:59.589 --> 00:03:03.359
are aaron lake up concentrated they are
in their simple and elegant and poignant

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:07.769
and everything in this movie felt like
filler to me harry i disagree i i

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.539
thought i was attempted to get i think
that gives them the lord of the book no

00:03:11.539 --> 00:03:13.889
more like too much and would like

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:17.709
here's a scene and then everything's did
you know maybe you can go better than

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.340
this actually suggested

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.459
you you get a

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:25.039
in the the the the actual the story the
distance tell his apply factor in this

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:28.379
so you find out what the next up was
which is a real is in this town that is

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.110
made completely out of plastic

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.640
and everybody's buying bottled air
because there's no trees in the you know

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.569
they are qualities and terrible and then
you know the kid gets this e-mail by

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.469
i thought it all work and it's a musical
and i have fallen hotline

00:03:42.469 --> 00:03:46.469
anything like what to do but yes he may
be an interesting and what the migrant

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:48.359
wants and isn't anything off and

00:03:48.359 --> 00:03:53.559
i needed that uh... adam maybe it's just
me uh... villalobos stories about ted is

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:54.469
a little kid

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:57.899
who is in love with a hickey who just
want to see a real treat she's an artist

00:03:57.899 --> 00:04:01.309
and she trusts trees even though how
does she know it might look like and

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:05.239
likewise that zakat front is a little
boy in taylor swift is his girlfriend

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:08.689
and i don't know and there there named
ten audrey which doctor sees his real

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:09.389
name is

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:14.359
you're going to lie on her uses with
those of us we shall of and so he is

00:04:14.359 --> 00:04:18.209
like because hormones are raging in that
leads him to find it

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.060
tree or at least somebody who can tell
them what happened to them so that small

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.300
some of the air

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:26.580
i thought that they were just trying to
keep on bad guys in this and i thought

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.430
that songs were mostly forgettable in
i'd know the kids are gonna love it like

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:34.399
you to your old right maybe a little
dark as katherine at the three d

00:04:34.399 --> 00:04:38.199
how is it really it so it's well that's
not a comes if you're free society

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:43.319
despicable media if if the despicable me
got his israeli nickname then with a

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:46.540
really cute but i i thought that aside
from little kids like

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.720
actors didn't get to resonate with me
and by the end i mean i was kind of

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.180
rooting for the bad tax

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:54.889
uh... okay i i had a totally different
state i was alright actually have a

00:04:54.889 --> 00:04:56.250
little

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:01.340
or already in the position of the
selling a house all almost eight

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.210
democratic crowd when everything is at
the time that is great and i think that

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:08.840
was close but the zack efren taylor
swift sing the songs

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.780
not by themselves but they're also fall
under oath of office lincoln

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.490
i thought the whole thing work i'd
really like that helms as the ones who

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.649
are of my life

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:18.759
how

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:19.669
he

00:05:19.669 --> 00:05:23.289
do you know it with the best intentions
does the worst of things despite the

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:24.520
warnings of a more acts

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:27.520
and that there are consequences that the
cute animals that he has done to know

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.370
and love

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.180
all leave because he has this report is
you know that's the best that that's the

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:35.690
most convincing argument the movie makes
is just the animals are adorable and

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:37.629
that this can harmonize in their graves

00:05:37.629 --> 00:05:40.419
and that's why you shouldn't do back
then and then they kind of busy

00:05:40.419 --> 00:05:45.199
entertaining like a trail of tears
moment where i am should not get does

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:47.669
get dark but i i i do work for me

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.609
are federally moving i whites

00:05:49.609 --> 00:05:52.429
the performances are like the music
uh... irate

00:05:52.429 --> 00:05:55.729
and come down and i'm in for that's why
i thought it was boring and i didn't

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.239
really want to do a little peanut back
to stick around any more women fly away

00:06:00.239 --> 00:06:05.169
and there's going to go over to the war
activities they don't do him at all that

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:09.329
was made to your linden leader like a
little bit goes along with a little bit

00:06:09.329 --> 00:06:11.279
is born again that's enough

00:06:11.279 --> 00:06:15.009
this is exactly this is the passive
aggressive any just the just walks

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.099
around it's everybody feel guilty
doesn't have any power c shows up in

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:18.860
this great

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.110
strike up a lighting bolt and then we
really does nothing else x experimental

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:23.869
work

00:06:23.869 --> 00:06:27.369
better with the character of an ass

00:06:27.369 --> 00:06:29.580
and i was just over this on the

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.669
so sorry didn't happen

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:32.849
portrait of rolling

00:06:32.849 --> 00:06:34.939
failed to that but i like to try it

00:06:34.939 --> 00:06:38.930
out of the other hand i know i was like
i think a i'd like that i have decided

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:42.340
this is uh... seven point four and
pipeline you know i don't i get this

00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:43.809

00:06:55.629 --> 00:07:02.629
education dispersed summary yes sir dot
i have to tell us that taylor swift says

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:06.050
it's happening

00:07:06.050 --> 00:07:10.289
when hypertext honest i think he's
prolly doing a higher than that to make

00:07:10.289 --> 00:07:15.779
a lot matt camelot schedule i can't
answer that you also have a vote on the

00:07:15.779 --> 00:07:16.169
high

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:17.279
five and see if they can
