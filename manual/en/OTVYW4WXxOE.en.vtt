Welcome to Namak Mirch Masala.
Today, we're going to show you how to make

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.999
Stuffed Masala Eggplant.
For this recipe, you need the following ingredients

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:11.950
which are listed in the description down below.
9 Chinese eggplants

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:20.480
2 tablespoons of cumin seeds
2 tablespoons of coriander seeds

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:27.279
2 tablespoons of fennel seeds
2 tablespoons of crushed red chilli peppers

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:31.220
1 tablespoon of sour dried mango powder
½ teaspoon of salt or to taste

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:39.020
¼ tablespoon of black pepper
And ½ cup of corn oil.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:01:01.899
So, we're going to 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.240
start off by adding all the spices to a bowl,
and then chopping all that up in a mini chop

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:19.320
blender.
Add the mini chop blender.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:35.140
Add the cumin seeds.
Add the coriander seeds.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.670
Add the fennel seeds.
Add the crushed red chili peppers.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.631
Add sour dried mango powder.
Add salt to taste, which unfortunately, we

00:01:41.631 --> 00:01:50.950
couldn't show here. Also, add black pepper,
which we also weren't able to show here.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:58.350
Then, add everything to a mini chop blender,
and chop it up.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.680
Make a large cut through the center of the
eggplant.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:13.049
Make two more cuts on the side so the spices
can get in better.

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:18.299
Take the spices and stuff them into the eggplants.
Close the eggplants with toothpicks once you're

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:26.719
done and repeat with all the eggplants.
Add oil to the pan and warm it up.

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:32.549
Now, add the eggplants. We have some leftover
spices so we're going add them to all the

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:49.919
eggplants.
We're going to let these cook for 20 minutes

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:56.849
Now, flip them over.
Cook it again for 10 minutes.

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:22.849
Mash the eggplants, and then serve the eggplants
with chapatti or paratha.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.519
