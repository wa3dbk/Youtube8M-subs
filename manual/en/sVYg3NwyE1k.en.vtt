My name is Brienne Magee.
I'm a Public Affairs Officer with the Coconino

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.060
National Forest. What you're looking at
behind me here is evidence of a forest thinning

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.080
project. Now, at first you'd wonder what
forest thinning has to do with fire

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.120
preparedness, but you got to understand
the fire triangle. A fire

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.150
needs three things to survive - it needs
oxygen; it needs

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.190
heat; and it needs fuel. Well, we don't
have much control over

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:32.220
the oxygen, and, especially with some of
the lightning, we sometimes don't have
much control

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:36.270
over the heat portion
of that fire triangle either.
What we do have control

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.310
over is the amount of fuel. Without fuel
a fire can't burn.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.340
What a forest thinning project does is
it reduces that amount of fuel to

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.380
lessen the severity of fire should it
happen in this area. So,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.420
historically, in this area where we're standing,
this would have been a meadow - a very

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.420
healthy, pretty meadow. Settlers came
through and in about in the 1980s

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.470
they created this area. They made a plantation,

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.570
and they planted these tress. These are
a couple of decades old, and as you can

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:08.620
see, the trees are far too close together,
quite unhealthy [and] not very

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.680
large. In an unplanned fire, these fuels, on

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.750
a very dry day, could turn into ladder fuels.
[Fire could] build from the forest

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.810
ground to these small trees here that
are not health and overgrown,

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:24.920
and into the larger portions of the forest.
So, our crews

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.090
today are reducing these ladder fuels
and helping to create a

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.270
more historically proper area.
Alright, so what are the next steps for this

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.440
thinning project? Obviously, leaving the trees
down like this isn't really helping much

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.630
with the fire danger. They're still
going to lead to some sort of

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.640
escalation of severity if an unplanned
fire were to occur.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:49.680
What's next is that a dozer will come through. 
Our crews will come through with

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.720
bulldozer [to] push these piles together,
and then we'll do a prescribed burn.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.750
In this case, a prescribed pile burn, where
we'll actually set fire

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.790
to these piles and reduce them so that
they're no longer a risk to fire

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.810
severity. Pile burns here in Northern
Arizona tend to require

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:09.840
a little bit extra moisture, so you'll often
see pile burns happening in the

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.860
winter when there's snow on the ground.
That allows crews to put fire to these fuels

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.900
- as you can see, they're larger branches
and fairly

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.900
large trunks - without the worry of the
fire spreading across the forest

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:25.930
floor or spotting very easily. The extra
fuel moisture in the area around

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.960
it [the pile] - the extra precipitation
in the trees and the vegetation itself - helps

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.980
to keep the rest of the forest safe while
the piles consume.
