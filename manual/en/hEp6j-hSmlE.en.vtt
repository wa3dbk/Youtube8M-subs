"My name is Brittany Anderton.

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:23.923
I'm a graduate student here at the University
of California, San Francisco and I'm in the

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:27.150
lab of Dr. Andrei Goga.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.820
I am focused on studying aspects of liver
cancer.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:36.430
I'm interested in asking how liver cancer
cells use nutrients differently.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.290
In the past decade or so, there's been this
whole resurgence of this field known as cancer

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.840
metabolism asking how cancer cells use nutrients
differently than normal cells and how they

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.110
use them to their advantage to proliferate
and make lots of new cells which is essentially

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.000
what the disease cancer is.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.710
I'm working to find ways to better understand
how these cancer cells have altered or different

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:04.540
nutrient metabolism in ways that we may target
that therapeutically.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:08.479
I'm originally from Northwestern, Pennsylvania,
from a very rural community.

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:13.450
I also happen to be first generation to college
as well to graduate school.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.659
That means that neither of my parents went
to a four year college.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.020
My father is a factory worker.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.829
He works for], and my mother is a RN, so she
does have an associate, although she didn't

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:27.600
go to a typical four year school and she doesn't
have a bachelor's.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.240
Growing up, I didn't know much about different
types of science careers.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:37.330
When it came time to go to college, I knew
that I wanted to study biology, but I wasn't

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:39.969
exactly sure what I wanted to do with it.

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:44.569
I kind of thought that based on the careers
that I was familiar with as a child.

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:47.060
I thought maybe I would want to be a veterinarian
or a dentist.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:52.409
I didn't know at the time that people spend
their entire days asking questions and doing

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.409
experiments.

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.340
I feel that as soon as I figured that out
in college that was the career that I wanted

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:03.419
to pursue, and so pretty quickly, I decided
to apply to grad school at the end of college

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:07.609
and pursue a career in research.

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.660
We have a history of cancer in my family.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.220
My grandfather died of lung cancer when I
was very young and also my aunt died of breast

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.430
cancer when I was in high school.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.159
It was a disease that hit very close to home
and I wanted to contribute to better understanding

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:25.540
of it and perhaps leading to future therapies
for cancer.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.280
I find it highly energizing.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.650
I think it's fascinating.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.200
It's actually a very fundamental question.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:38.569
You can imagine that cancer is a disease of
uncontrolled growth and proliferation and

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:45.090
we know that growth requires nutrients and
building blocks and macro molecules for making

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.900
new cells.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.370
The field of cancer metabolism is actually
very fundamental.

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.430
How can we starve cancer cells so that they
just don't have these building blocks anymore

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.640
and can't make more cells.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.310
I feel like I often work in waves in labs.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:06.090
Some days, I will be doing ... Some weeks
even, I'll be doing lots of one particular

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.010
thing and then that will kind of phase out
and then I'll be working on a different aspect

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.620
of my project in a different question and
I'll be working on that for quite some time

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:15.620
as well.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:20.220
Currently, a typical day for me is doing a
lot of molecular biology.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:27.079
I'm working with DNA and I'm working out the
bench and I'm trying to make new DNA structures

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:32.269
where I can express different genes and cells.

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.579
This requires a lot of reactions where we
are cleaving DNA and ligating different pieces

00:03:38.579 --> 00:03:42.189
of DNA to gather.

00:03:42.189 --> 00:03:46.870
To a layperson, it looks like I'm working
with a lot of clear liquids in small volumes

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.290
and doesn't really look like I'm doing much,
but hopefully the output of it will be that

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.250
when I put these DNA molecules into cells,
they will cause different expression in the

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.999
cells that I put them into and will change
the phenotype of these liver cancer cells.

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:05.560
Hopefully, that will lead to some better understanding
of how these liver cancer cells work.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.749
Actually, the field of cancer is moving in
such a way that many people are trying to

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:11.930
find combinatorial therapies.

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:18.459
That means that combining multiple ways to
inhibit multiple different pathways and that

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:24.140
means in the future perhaps my corner of the
field and the research that I'm doing could

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:29.760
contribute to, along with somebody else's
research to a combination therapy for liver

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.470
cancer.

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:34.750
I would like to see greater diversity in scientific
research.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.060
I feel that we have a lot of really bright
minds in research and I don't feel that there

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.120
is any shortage of people being interested
in science research.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.890
However, I feel that we could increase our
diversity as far as people from different

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.260
backgrounds and increase of women in science
of course.

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:03.200
Additionally, I would like to see at the end
of graduate school ... For example, I'm finishing

00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.550
up my PhD and I'll be looking for a job.

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.080
In the next year or two, I would like to see
more options for PhD-holding scientists at

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:16.470
the end of graduate school, versus maybe the
typical tenure track where you go to graduate

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.590
school and you do a project and then eventually
become a professor.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.391
I don't believe that that is the only option
for us.

00:05:22.391 --> 00:05:28.040
I think that getting a PhD and being a scientist
teaches you a lot of really valuable skills.

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.200
Even if you don't decide to stay at the bench,
there are many careers out there, but I would

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:37.760
like to see those options presented earlier
on so that people can be making earlier decisions

00:05:37.760 --> 00:06:03.160
about where they want to go at the end of
graduate school. "
