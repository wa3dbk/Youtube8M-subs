00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:09.230
Laureen: Next stop CPT 36415 replaced with
36410?

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:24.119
Q: Hi, I code CPT 36415 along with labs and
have noticed that Medicare and most other

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.029
carriers deny as global (considered routine
&amp; not is not covered) except when billed with

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.029
physicals.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:38.020
I have also noticed 36415 is not anywhere
on CCI edits, however, 36410 is.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.100
Is 36410 the preferred venipuncture code lab
draws now?

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.010
A: So, what I did as I went out to SuperCoder
and just kind of pulled in the codes so we

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.010
can take a look.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:56.960
This one is actually 36410 is an age-specific
code, so that's for age 3 or under -- and

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:02.920
it is for when the patient is a hard stick;
meaning the physician needs to do it.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:11.221
Maybe the normal person doing the blood draw
just cannot get it to work, so they call the

00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:12.221
physician.

00:01:12.221 --> 00:01:19.720
That's why 36410 venipuncture age 3 years
or older necessitating the skill of a physician

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:26.280
or other qualified healthcare professional
for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:34.930
That's why it's not for the routine venipuncture
it's when they're hard stick, and it's age-based

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.180
as well.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:43.090
36415 is the collection of venous blood by
venipuncture, that's your routine one.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.760
Then I found a good article in SuperCoder
while I was in there.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.460
Here's the link http://codingcertification.org/supercoder,
if you have subscription to it.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:58.870
And it's basically: Our vascular office performs
blood draws and analysis for a local hospital.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:03.680
Can we bill for a lab draw in an office setting,
and if so, what codes should we use?

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.490
And I went to the answer but what struck me
is this statement here: Also keep in mind

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:14.590
that most Medicare carriers allow one collection
fee for each patient encounter, regardless

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.370
of the number of specimens drawn.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:24.740
If an E/M service is provided and billed,
most payers will bundle 36415 into the E/M

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.740
service.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.470
So, that's what you're running into with yours
I would suspect, they're bundling it into

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.140
the other services that you're providing.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:40.380
So, it wasn't necessarily that the one code
was to be used over the other.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:45.610
It's just that 36415 is a routine code and
this is bundled in.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.880
The 410 you would only use if your patient
is 3 years of age or younger and you needed

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.580
the physician to do it.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:03:00.360
Laureen: I'm going to back up to my question
here, that I said "age 3 years or younger,"

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.900
I meant older.

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.780
I read it wrong.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.100
So, it isn't age-based code so that's one
of the differences; if you had someone that

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.500
was younger than 3, you would not use 36410,
you'd use it for someone older.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:20.710
The key difference between 410 and 415 is
needing the physician to come to it because

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:22.160
the patient is a hard stick.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:36.690
So, thank you for clarifying that.
