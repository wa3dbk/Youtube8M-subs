00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:02.250
Is World of Warcraft worth the money?

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.420
It’s so popular, but the subscription is
giving me pause, and making me hesitate to

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.420
pay up.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:12.919
World of Warcraft had a WOW factor, because
it seemed like everyone was playing it.

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:17.310
World of Warcraft was attractive because it
had millions of people and set the standard

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.310
for MMOs.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:24.130
There are now so many alternatives from Eve
Online to Star Wars to Defiance to fantasy

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.330
based MMO that WoW is losing subscribers.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:30.410
But a lot of my friends still play it.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.231
World of Warcraft’s graphics haven’t been
updated for years, while Guild Wars 2 and

00:00:35.231 --> 00:00:40.930
Neverwinter look far better.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.730
Why pay for an outdated game when you can
play a better one for a similar price?

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.240
What do you consider a better deal?

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.760
Guild Wars has a better deal for players,
one $60 payment and you’re set for life.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.260
Your life, or the company’s?

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.960
World of Warcraft is about $15 per month.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.660
But that’s not all!

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.660
Taxes!

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.270
Internet connectivity fees!

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:10.170
Well, yes, but there are also expansion packs
like the Cataclysm expansion pack and the

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.760
Mists of Pandaria.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.159
Not to mention the upcoming Warlords of Draenor!

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:19.200
So you pay that $15 per month plus more for
the expansions.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.140
It is equivalent to less than a dollar a day,
if that is all you did for entertainment.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:29.170
To make matters worse, the subscriptions are
charged to your account whether you play or

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.170
not.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.979
That’s a good deal if all I did for fun
was gaming.

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.560
And you have to pay for all expansion packs
to get the Mists of Pandaria and Warlords

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.670
of Draenor.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.620
And Eve Online makes you buy mods and items
with real money, and you lose money if someone

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:45.700
vaporizes your virtual ship.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.450
There was a news article on a guy being a
total jerk for destroying millions, and Eve

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.670
Online staff didn’t care because they made
money.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.540
If you’re happy with the price, you can
choose how to waste your life.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.790
At least WoW has millions of people who agree
with me on that choice.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.720
I am going to sign back up.
