&gt;&gt; Thomas Daniel, Sales Manager Germany at
TATONKA:

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.980
First check if all straps are loosened...

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.960
...the
shoulder straps and hip belt.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.020
Then put the heavy backpack on the thigh and
slip in.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.899
Look for the location of the hip bones.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.820
You can feel it along the upper body.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.000
This is where the hip belt should sit by embracing
the pelvis properly.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.200
Click in and pull tight.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.020
It is important to have the hip belt sit tight,
so it can't slide later with the load in motion.

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:20.279
Now you realize all the load on the hip tips
over away from the back.

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:23.770
So as the next step grab the shoulder strap.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.990
If you pull forward, nothing happens.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:38.420
But if you pull down and back behind the shoulders
the strap will glide smoothly through the buckles.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.100
Next you can pull the load with the load lifters
forward to your body.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.980
Pull to tighten but not too strong.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.860
Release a little bit of the tension, so you
can feel the load secured between head and

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.979
shoulders and not too wobbly or soft.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.090
When you release the load a little bit from
the shoulder straps you can feel the load

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.579
being transferred to the pelvis.

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:15.349
Don't release to much then it slips away backwards
again.

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:17.969
Just a little bit.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.920
Now you can use the sternum strap to fix the
shoulder straps and prevent them from sliding sideways.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:40.960
Additionally, you can use the stabilizer straps
here to pull the packsack closer to the hip belt.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:46.960
And now you should be able to walk the next
20 kilometers easily.

00:02:47.460 --> 00:03:50.700
