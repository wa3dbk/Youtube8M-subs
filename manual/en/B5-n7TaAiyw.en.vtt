00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:08.960
Hi. I'm Karen for Expert Village. And then
I'm going to just cut along those lines. This

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:19.380
one. This section we'll remove. And this section
we will not remove. So just cut right along

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:26.460
those lines like that. Okay now we'll just
do a little bit of folding. You want to fold

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.910
down this flap like so. Fold it that way and
then fold it the opposite way. Like that,

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:46.230
so you have something that looks like that.
Then, we'll fold this section diagonally up

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.649
like that. So it goes pretty much straight
and even. And flip it over and do the same

00:00:52.649 --> 00:01:00.660
on the other side. It looks a little strange
but you'll see how it works in the end. Now

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:09.500
you're going to fold up the bottom triangles
like that. Flip it over and do the same on

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:21.049
this side folding it up. And then the last
fold we're going to fold the triangles into

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:28.780
the center so we open up the plane a little
bit there and fold in these sections. So what

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:35.509
this does is it makes a nice heavy front for
the plane. And that will help propel it through

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:45.399
the air. Now just take one small bit of tape
and we'll tape the nose closed. Just one piece

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:53.279
of tape right across the nose of the plane.
Now to fly this plane you're just going to

00:01:53.279 --> 00:02:03.499
fold the wings down like this and it flies
very nicely. And you can send it in the mail,

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:15.099
flat like this and just tell them to fold
that down and we're ready to fly. That's a

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:16.969
nice little toy to send through the mail.
