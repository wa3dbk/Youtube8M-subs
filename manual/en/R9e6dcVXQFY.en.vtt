00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:02.480
VivaDens presents

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:05.880
I have them the way I wanted them to be.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.460
Everything was done. Form was done.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.020
Shade was done. Everything was done.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.660
I only may give 10 points out of 10.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.700
Tom's Trip Towards a Beautiful Smile

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.700
Before dental procedures...

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.760
I had always such teeth. 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.620
Teeth are one of the most important things which makes me feel good.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.400
Because my mother is a dentist,

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.220
teeth have always been 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.680
one of the most important moments...

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.640
I had a problem: I was wearing braces,

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.940
because 4 of my teeth were extracted 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.160
when I was a teenager

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.720
because of certain technical considerations.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.720
So, my mouth automatically became smaller.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.240
So, I do not want something miraculous...

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.520
I just simply want to return to myself.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.380
To consultation...

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.860
Beautiful teeth are needed to feel good and look perfectly.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.860
I think that is clear to everyone.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.120
I arrived and visited VivaDens.

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:30.640
And of course, quality and environment here 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.300
I may compliment a lot

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.480
very pleasant environment and service...

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.380
Ready? OK?

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.400
Then, after the conversation with a dentist we decided

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.140
it is better to go for ceramic veneers...

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.580
Ceramic veneers

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.420
Cutting-edge CEREC technology.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.880
I have my teeth the way I wanted them to be.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.600
Everything was done. Form was done.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.820
Shade was done. Everything was done.

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:23.820
BEFORE

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:25.200
AFTER

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.200
I only may give 10 points out of 10.

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.820
Good bye. Good luck.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.600
The naturalness of teeth  

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.160
is the mostly noticed and complimented by others.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.360
that they are not too white, too big, not too small...

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.760
They in fact look the way they should look. 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.960
People who do not know me... 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.380
There was not a single one who have told me: 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.580
 "Yes, I see you have done something with your teeth"

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.640
I think it is a positive sign.

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.580
Thanks to Tom. That helps to choose.
