[EasySep™ - Preparing leukopaks for cell isolation without density centrifugation]

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
[Jason Dixon MSc, Research Technologist]

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Are you isolating cells from leukapheresis samples or leukopaks?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
In a busy lab, preparing PBMCs from leukopaks by density centrifugation

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
prior to cell isolation is time consuming and requires precision.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
EasySep™ Negative Selection Kits from STEMCELL Technologies

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
allow you to isolate untouched cells directly from leukopaks

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
without the need for density centrifugation.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
In this video, we will demonstrate how you can prepare a leukopak

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
prior to cell separation with EasySep™ and the "Easy 50" EasySep™ Magnet.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
To begin, determine the volume of the leukopak suspension.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Place the leukopak bag in an extractor stand.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Open the port on the leukopak bag.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Then insert the transfer set spike.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Close the plate of the extractor stand to apply pressure to the bag.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Open the valve and dispense the sample

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
via the transfer set tubing into a sterile container.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Add an equal volume of ammonium chloride solution to the sample.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Mix by inverting gently and incubate on ice for 15 minutes.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
The ammonium chloride solution is buffered and optimized

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to achieve gentle lysis of any red blood cells in the leukopak.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Leukocytes are not affected.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
If the starting volume of your leukopak is greater than 150 mL,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
it may be easier to first concentrate the cells by centrifugation.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
This reduces the amount of ammonium chloride that is required.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
After the incubation, centrifuge the sample at 500 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Then remove the supernatant.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Next, wash the cells by topping up the tube with the recommended medium,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
PBS with 2% FBS.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
Centrifuge the cells at 150 x g for 10 minutes at room temperature with the brake off.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
After centrifugation, carefully remove the supernatant.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Repeat the wash step one or more times until most of the platelets have been removed.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
The color of the cell pellet may vary from that shown.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
This variation will not affect downstream cell separation procedures.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
If performing cell separation with EasySep™,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:47.000
residual red blood cells will be depleted by components of the EasySep™ cocktail.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Finally, resuspend the cells at an appropriate cell concentration

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
in the recommended medium.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The sample is now ready for cell separation using EasySep™

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and the "Easy 50" EasySep™ Magnet

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
as well as a number of other downstream applications.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
To learn how to perform EasySep™ separations

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
using the "Easy 50" EasySep™ magnet,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000
please see our other technical video

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000
"Portable Large Volume Cell Separation in 25 Minutes".

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.000
The "Easy 50" EasySep™ magnet can process up to 40 mL

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
or 4 x 10e9 cells in a single separation

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
for fast and easy, column-free cell isolation from large sample volumes.
