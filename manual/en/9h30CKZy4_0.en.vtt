00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:09.180
All right today on this 2003 Chrysler PT Cruiser
were going to install part number hm50002.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:12.639
This is Hopkins Smart Hitch backup camera.

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.520
First off we want to get our back up camera
wiring ready for installation.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.560
All we got to do is simply disconnect the
quick connect connector up front and just

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.070
get down to the bare wires.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.730
This case well be down to a red and a black
wire.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:01:07.280
On our PT Cruiser weve 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:38.880
got 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:02:34.680
to find 

00:02:34.680 --> 00:06:53.560
our reverse light.
