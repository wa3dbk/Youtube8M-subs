How to make Gluten free Zucchini Bread

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.900
Hello friends, today we are going to make a loaf of bread

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:17.660
This is a bread made with 5  flours and  it has a novel ingredient

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.760
That we have already used, which is zucchini

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.540
or Squash

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.649
which gives a very special flavor to this bread

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:31.820
so I invite you to see the ingredients and then the preparation

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.000
The ingredients are:

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.600
100 grams of chickpea flour

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.620
100 grams of cornstarch

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.780
2 eggs

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:46.220
1 teaspoon of sugar

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.950
180 grams of rice flour

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:54.110
65 grams of cassava starch

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.080
65 grams of cornmeal

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.300
100 ml of warm water

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.200
50 ml of soymilk

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.920
1 teaspoon and a half [1.5 tsp.] of Dry yeast

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.340
75 ml of vegetable oil

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.910
one level teaspoon of salt

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.790
and a cup of zucchini

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.540
that has to be raw and we're going to grate it

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.900
friends, the preparation is as follows:

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:33.030
In a  bowl where we had warm water, we will place the sugar and the yeast

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.780
and we will mix it well

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.100
and we will wait until the yeast has activated

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.790
that's the first thing we're going to do

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.240
in another bowl, we'll add the 5 flours

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.660
the order doesn't matter, you just simply mix them

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.770
and with the help of a spoon you'll combine all the flours and starches

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:04.870
We add the teaspoon of salt

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.319
and continue mixing well with a spoon.

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:13.049
In a teacup, we're going to crack an egg first, then the other

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:15.749
and we will place it in a bowl

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:20.789
and we will beat them with a fork

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:26.749
once that's done, we're going to add the soymilk

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.479
then, the grated zucchini

00:02:31.479 --> 00:02:35.189
and we mix well with a wooden spoon

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:40.989
then, we're going to incorporate the vegetable oil

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:51.180
and then the yeast, which must be already activated

00:02:52.199 --> 00:02:57.919
we'll keep adding the flour

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:02.779
we will add one hand first, and then will mix well with a wooden spoon

00:03:02.779 --> 00:03:07.299
mixing properly all flours and ingredients

00:03:07.669 --> 00:03:12.579
and then we add the rest of the flours that were left in the bowl

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:14.559
we mix well

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:22.900
once it's well mixed, we're going to leave the mixture to stand for an hour, or an hour and a half

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:25.129
and we will cover it with a washcloth

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:31.149
we will oil a rectangular pan

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:35.539
and, after the hour and a half has passed, we're going put it in the mold

00:03:35.539 --> 00:03:39.759
you see that did not rise much and will not rice, so do not worry about that

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.860
the most important is the rest

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:48.260
then it will go to an oven, which must be preheated at 180Â° C

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.640
and the first 20 minutes, we will use the bottom heat

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:55.169
after the 20 minutes have passed

00:03:55.169 --> 00:04:00.159
the remaining 25 minutes will use the heat up and down

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.149
in total we're going to cook it for 45 minutes

00:04:03.149 --> 00:04:06.969
After that time, we will remove it from the oven

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.420
and we'll let it cool completely to unmold

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.660
we're going to help us with a knife to unmold it

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.740
and you see that tha bread has a perfect golden brown

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.140
we will cut it in half, so you can see how the crumb looks

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.260
and frankly delicious

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:33.420
Well friends, I hope you liked this recipe

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:35.940
our idea is to always bring recipes

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.479
with different types of flour, so you can do these types of combinations

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:47.819
and zucchini or squash, the thruth is that it's an ingredient

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:49.880
that we use a lot in the kitchen.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:55.460
Not only in savory dishes, but also in sweet preparations

00:04:55.469 --> 00:05:01.879
this bread is perfect. The truth is that the zucchini has a neutral taste

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:07.260
so it is ideal to combine with all kinds of sweet or savory preparations

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.180
if you like this recipe, please "thumbs up "

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.320
Another consideration that is important, is that this bread, as always, lasts about 3 days

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.540
if you live in hot climates, the ideal is that this bread is kept in the refrigerator

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:26.160
so it will last maybe even a little more: four days. What is also very interesting

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:30.569
and this bread will surprise you, because it is really very very tasty

00:05:30.569 --> 00:05:33.449
The texture of the bread is perfect

00:05:33.449 --> 00:05:36.140
and you're going to love it

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.680
