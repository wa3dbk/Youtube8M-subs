00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.699
[Intro Music]

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:03.510
&gt;&gt;Jon: Hi everyone! It's Jon

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:04.420
&gt;&gt;Bin: And Bin

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:05.810
&gt;&gt;Jon: And Bin this video is going to [...]

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:06.899
&gt;&gt;Bin: Rock.

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.170
&gt;&gt;Jon: Today we are going to be taking a look
at Pinkie Pie's sister.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.480
&gt;&gt;Bin: Maud Rock Pie

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.619
&gt;&gt;Jon: This is the first time we've learned
that Rock is her middle name apparently.

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.670
&gt;&gt;Bin: (Laughs) But it makes sense that her
middle name would be Rock.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.529
&gt;&gt;Jon: This is from the Toys R Us exclusive
Pony Mania line. It debuted at San Diego Comic

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.210
Con a few days ago and it should be showing
up in stores soon but you can order it right

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.800
now on the Toys R Us website.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.789
&gt;&gt;Bin: That's what we did.

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:39.780
&gt;&gt;Jon: She was less than ten dollars and she
follows other Pony Mania exclusives like last

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.500
years Photo Finish. Except this years Pony
Mania theme, as you may have already noticed,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.800
is flowers. Flower power as CrazyPonyLady
said.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.109
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yes, Flower Power Maud. That just doesn't
sound right. (Laughs)

00:00:55.109 --> 00:01:01.910
&gt;&gt;Jon: Out of all the ponies to cover themselves
in floral patterns Maud wouldn't be my first

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.810
pick. Even though it's awesome to have a Maud
Pie toy

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.220
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yes

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.430
&gt;&gt;Jon: I can't picture her being covered in
flowers.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.150
&gt;&gt;Bin: She went on vacation to Hawaii

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:10.890
&gt;&gt;Jon: Maybe

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:11.630
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yea.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.979
&gt;&gt;Jon: Or I picture her falling asleep and
Pinkie Pie taking a marker and drawing flowers

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:17.820
all over her.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.579
&gt;&gt;Bin: Maybe it was a dare?

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:24.509
"Maud Rock Pie loves to make rock candy with
her sister, Pinkie Pie!"

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.590
&gt;&gt;Jon: I think that expression perfectly sums
up how Maud would react to being covered in

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:29.979
flowers

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:31.590
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yea I think so

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.420
It looks like she has some plastic underneath
her dress so we will take that off. We don't

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.900
need her with plastic on her.

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:49.340
While she dress-less (Laughs) here is Maud.
Here is her cutie mark.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.320
You can see the flowers are only on her hooves
and her face. So let me get her dress back

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.780
on.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.490
Here, now she's back to normal. (Laughs)

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.460
I love how they have her bangs. It's really
nice that they have the attention to detail

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.390
like that because usually the ponies hair
doesn't look anything like it does on the

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:09.880
show.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.290
&gt;&gt;Jon: Now it's hard to tell in the packaging,
even out of the packaging, most of the ponies

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.610
like Pinkie Pie here have their eyes wide
open. So I was wondering if Maud had her eyes

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.140
open or not and she does not. She has the
correct expression on her face.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:31.860
&gt;&gt;Bin: But her hair helps cover it up too.
So it still kind of gives her that look. Her

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.640
hair's messed up in the back

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.760
&gt;&gt;Jon: Try to fix that.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:36.310
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yea.

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.020
It's just the way it came in the package.

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:39.520
Sisters united!

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:42.420
&gt;&gt;Jon: The two Pie sisters.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.380
[Laughing]

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.690
&gt;&gt;Bin: If there are ever two sisters so similar.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:54.900
&gt;&gt;Jon: It's great to finally have a Maud Pie
toy. I wish it were a normal version and not

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.030
the flowered up version.

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.700
&gt;&gt;Bin: Do you know what would be cool? They
have the flowers on this side for the Pony

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.570
Mania thing. It would be cool if they had
the cutie mark on this side as well. Just

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.650
turn her this way and she wouldn't have any
flowers or anything on her and you'd still

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.500
see her cutie mark.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:17.670
&gt;&gt;Jon: Now I know there are supposedly ways
and chemical that you could use to remove

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:18.640
the flowers

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.790
&gt;&gt;Bin: We never have luck with that kind of
stuff

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.020
&gt;&gt;Jon: And even if we did she'd still be wearing
the incorrect clothing. She wouldn't have

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.200
her normal sweater on.

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.170
&gt;&gt;Bin: And I'm not talented enough to make
a sweater.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.810
&gt;&gt;Jon: No we will leave that up to the professional
customizers. Maybe at BronyCon somebody will

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.550
have one up correctly.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.350
&gt;&gt;Bin: Maybe

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:41.450
I would be afraid of trying to take off the
flowers around her eyes. With my luck I'd

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:45.090
end up wiping her whole eye off and then I'd
have to repaint the eye and then she would

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.810
just look like Derpy.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:50.310
&gt;&gt;Jon: So that's our review of Maud Rock Pie.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.560
That's not the last you'll see of flower-covered
ponies on our channel. As you'll see we have

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.980
two more Pony Mania Toys R Us Exclusives left
to review. You'll have to stay tuned the next

00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:02.460
couple of days to see those

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:04.550
&gt;&gt;Bin: And make sure you subscribe so you
don't miss out.

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.500
&gt;Jon: Yea, and like and comment on this video.
Let us know what you think about Maud and

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:13.340
if you're a customizer what you would recommend
using to get those flowers off. Not that we'd

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.120
try it.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.660
&gt;&gt;Bin: No.

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:17.259
&gt;&gt;Jon: That would be Bin's Crafty Bin Fail.

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:23.500
&gt;&gt;Bin: Maybe someday on Crafty Bin I can do
a customizing of one of our ponies. I can

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.130
find one at the Goodwill or something and
customize a pony.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:29.260
&gt;&gt;Jon: And Bin do you know what else would
really rock?

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.700
&gt;&gt;Bin: What?

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.280
&gt;&gt;Jon: If they followed us on Instagram

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.030
&gt;&gt;Bin: Twitter

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.500
&gt;&gt;Jon: And Facebook

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:36.310
&gt;&gt;Bin: Yea.
