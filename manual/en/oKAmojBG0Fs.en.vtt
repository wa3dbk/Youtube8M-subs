00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.020
Today we're going to be taking a closer look at the Tusk UTV rear-view mirror.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:25.340
The Tusk UTV Mirror was developed to give the rider a wider range of vision

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.620
and the ability to see what's behind the machine.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.520
These mirrors are a huge help when backing out of the garage or pulling it out of your trailer,

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.820
and also to see what you left in the dust on the trail.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:46.620
The Tusk UTV Mirror is large enough to provide you with quick, clear vision to the rear end of your machine.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.500
It features a large 8"x4.5" convex-shaped mirror for an extra wide view.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.360
The mirror uses the heavy-duty, clamp-on design billet aluminum clamp that bolts directly to the roll bar.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.060
This heavy-duty clamp was designed to fit all the popular machines, 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.720
along with any other machine that has a 1-3/4" to 1-7/8" roll bar.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.900
When you order the mirror kit, it comes with your convex lens mirror, billet aluminum clamp,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.540
and all of the necessary hardware to mount the piece.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:24.620
We also offer an optional extension kit to extend the Tusk UTV Mirror

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.580
and give you even more visibility from your side-by-side.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.840
This extension kit can be purchased as a pair with your UTV mirror 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.280
or purchased separately if you've already got the mirror on your machine.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:40.600
It can be mounted as either a left or a right side mirror, 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.400
or even as a rear-view mirror in the middle of the roll cage.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.860
Some people would prefer to have one in all three locations, just like your vehicle has.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.980
You can choose to run it vertically for a tighter, more sleek design,

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.530
or run it horizontally for an extra wide range of view.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.460
As you can see, there are many different mounting options for this mirror.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.460
And installation is simple.

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.160
First, we're going to take the back piece of our clamp 

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.780
and place it in the desired location on the roll bar.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.720
Then we're going to position the other piece on the opposite side of the roll bar.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:23.200
After that, pop both of the pinch bolts into place and snug those down using a 5mm Allen-head wrench.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.480
Once the clamp is installed, remove the nyloc nut from the back side of the mirror,

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.240
then slide the mirror pin through the hole in the clamp and thread that nyloc nut back onto the pin.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.720
Go ahead and tighten both nuts together using a pair of 19mm wrenches.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.160
Once it's tight, rotate the mirror until you've got it into the desired position.

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.540
If you're installing the extension with the mirror, 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:54.180
take the nyloc nut and two washers off the provided bolt,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.120
and we're going to use that to attach one end of the extension to the clamp.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.240
Slide the bolt through both pieces, and install the two washers and nyloc nut.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:09.160
After that, use a 17mm and a 19mm wrench to tighten this bolt down.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.820
When that's in place, go ahead and install the mirror by sliding it through the hole in the extension

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:17.260
and threading the nyloc nut onto the pin.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.600
Once again, use a pair of 19mm wrenches to tighten down the mirror.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.380
Once it's tight, you can rotate it into the desired position.

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:30.740
And there you have it, the Tusk UTV Mirror Kit.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.920
