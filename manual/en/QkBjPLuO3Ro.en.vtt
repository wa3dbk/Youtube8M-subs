00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:14.940
President Obama Makes a Mockery of 9/11
Here, at this memorial, this museum, we come

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.590
together.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:27.940
We stand in the footprints of two mighty towers,
graced by the rush of eternal waters.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:35.410
We look into the faces of nearly 3,000 innocent
souls -- men and women and children of every

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:42.329
race, every creed, and every corner of the
world.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:51.239
We can touch their names and hear their voices
and glimpse the small items that speak to

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.940
the beauty of their lives.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.579
A wedding ring.

00:00:56.579 --> 00:00:59.280
A dusty helmet.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.500
A shining badge.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:17.110
Here we tell their story, so that generations
yet unborn will never forget.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.540
Of coworkers who led others to safety.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.970
Passengers who stormed a cockpit.

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.090
Our men and women in uniform who rushed into
an inferno.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.849
Our first responders who charged up those
stairs.

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:39.880
A generation of servicemembers -- our 9/11
Generation -- who have served with honor in

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.720
more than a decade of war.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:53.810
A nation that stands tall and united and unafraid
-- because no act of terror can match the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.739
strength or the character of our country.

00:01:58.739 --> 00:02:11.360
Like the great wall and bedrock that embrace
us today, nothing can ever break us; nothing

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:32.090
can change who we are as Americans.

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.570
There's no honor in feeding us lies about
why we were attacked.

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.630
There's no honor in serving an agenda to suppress
the main motive for why we were attacked.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.860

what motivated the 9/11 hijackers
