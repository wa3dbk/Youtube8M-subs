Hello, Curlies. Welcome back.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.231
This is my wash day routine after a braid-out or twist-out.

00:00:03.431 --> 00:00:09.231
I have already finger detangled my hair and I am going to divide my hair into 4 large sections.

00:00:15.031 --> 00:00:19.531
I am tying each section near the end with Goody hair ties.

00:00:23.031 --> 00:00:26.331
This leaves the bulk of my hair free for shampooing.

00:00:26.331 --> 00:00:34.431
The reason I wash my hair in sections like this is to prevent major knots and tangles.

00:00:34.491 --> 00:00:39.060
This also helps to begin any stretched
hairstyle

00:00:44.621 --> 00:00:51.621
Okay. Now, I'm done and I have four
sections.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:56.231
That's just me just me playing around.

00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:05.271
Now, I am in the shower and I am going to soak my hair with warm water.

00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:10.661
I am using the pads of my fingers to massage my scalp to break up any product residue.

00:01:16.861 --> 00:01:22.931
I put the shampoo on my scalp and the shaft of my hair.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:34.731
To prevent excess drying on my ends, I specifically avoid applying shampoo directly to the ends of my hair.

00:01:48.231 --> 00:01:51.231
I have finished shampooing all four sections

00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:54.231
and I am thoroughly rinsing my hair by allowing the water to pass

00:01:54.231 --> 00:01:57.801
through the middle of each section.

00:01:57.801 --> 00:02:02.011
Now, I'll wrap my little shirt around my hair to catch the excess water.

00:02:02.011 --> 00:02:06.411
I'm going to do things around the
house before I style my hair,

00:02:06.411 --> 00:02:10.721
so I cover my hair with a plastic bag to prevent it from drying out.

00:02:10.721 --> 00:02:15.121
