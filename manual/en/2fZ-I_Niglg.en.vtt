Hi this is Elise McMahon with Expert Village.com
and in this video series we are talking about

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.900
taking your dog for a walk. If you would like
to find out more about my services, you can

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:15.462
visit my website at www.canineheadstart.com.
In this short video clip, we are going to

00:00:15.462 --> 00:00:18.400
be pulling together everything we have been
talking about. We are going to be starting

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.679
with leashing your dog, walking through the
gate, leaving the house, coming down the road,

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.700
having a dog walk by your side and then also
having your dog walk on a loose leash in front

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.140
of you. So we are going to pull everything
together and show you how it will look when

00:00:30.140 --> 00:01:07.590
you are walking your dog. Wait, wait, okay.
Tai, wait, wait, wait, let’s go, let’s

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:40.659
go. Good boy. Good boy. Let’s go Tai, this
way. Let’s go this way. Good boy. Good boy.

00:01:40.659 --> 00:02:00.289
Tai wait. Tai wait. Okay. Good boy. Tai, wait,
wait. Okay. Good boy. So there you have it

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:06.429
we’ve put the series of behavior together
to demonstrate going for a walk with your

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:10.720
dog. We’ve come through the gate, put the
leash on, come through the gate, walking your

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.220
dog nicely by your side and if you need to
have the dog get in and out of the car, again

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.190
you want to have it done in a controlled fashion
where the dog is waiting for you for the release

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.310
to both get in and out of the car. Hopefully
these tips will help you have a more pleasant

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:25.500
walk with your dog.
