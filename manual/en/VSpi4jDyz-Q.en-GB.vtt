00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:11.290
A lip enhancement is a treatment where we
use dermal filler to augment the lips. We

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.860
do this for a variety of different reasons.
It might be to sensualise the lips, to accentuate

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:24.640
the shape, improve the structure of the lips.
So perhaps creating a cupids bow, creating

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:31.089
height in the lip, perhaps creating balance
even between top lip and the bottom lip.

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:36.300
"I'm happy with the fullness of my bottom
lip but I feel that my top lips slightly thinner

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.370
and I just wanted it to be a little bit more
evened out in size." "I have always wanted

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.370
to have full lips. At least a little bit fuller
because I have never been able to use red

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.900
lipstick. So that's my dream - to go to a
shop and buy a red lipstick." It's a very

00:00:53.900 --> 00:01:00.900
short process having a lip enhancement. When
the patient arrives and we've agreed everything

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.720
that we want to actually achieve for them,
the first thing that we want to do, before

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.720
we start injecting lips, is to make it a very
comfortable process. So it's important that

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.900
we numb them sufficiently to make it comfortable
enough because it is an injecting process.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.420
I certainly agree that your top lip is smaller
than your bottom lip. Although that is actually

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.500
an ideal, yours is that little bit too
much smaller than your bottom lip. So dermal

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.140
filler is an excellent way to improve that
and create some balance between your top lip

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.680
and your bottom lip and bring a bit more harmony
to your face. I think by doing your lip this

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.030
would set you off very nicely. "Great." Generally
a lip enhancement will last anything from

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.880
3 - 6 months and anywhere in between depending
on the person. Everyone is very individual,

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.799
so you can never predict how long it is going
to last, you can never predict how quickly

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:04.799
a person might metabolise that product. So
I usually, at the very beginning, say to a

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.560
person "Look, whatever you tend to get from
this lip enhancement the first time is pretty

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:17.079
much what you're going to expect in the future."
So if it lasts 3 months for you, expect to

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:23.099
top up every 3 months. "I think they do look
natural, and that is what I was expecting

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:30.099
from this procedure." And what do you think
of the size? "I'm happy with them. Yes, completely,

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.319
completely happy." If you feel like you'd
like to come in for a lip enhancement, then

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:43.739
feel free to get in touch with botonics and
we can arrange a consultation for you as soon

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:43.989
as possible.
