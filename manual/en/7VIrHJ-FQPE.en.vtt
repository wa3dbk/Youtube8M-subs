00:00:01.579 --> 00:00:11.490
For the vast majority of people that are somewhere,
just in the middle of the mountain bike spectrum,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.470
the stock gearing that they sell is great.
For people who are looking to do really specific

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.740
things, or are really fit racers, or real
extreme riders, they have some other options

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.580
to pursue. For people who race cross country
real competitively, who are really fit, a

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.730
two ring setup with just a middle and outer
chain ring works really well. I find that

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.180
for most people, if they use a 12-32, which
is a standard mountain bike cassette in the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.470
back -- 12 being the smallest, 32 being the
largest, and their being nine gears in the

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.430
middle, something like a 44-30, 44-32, works
really well. If there aren't that many long,

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.400
sustained downhill?s where you race, you can
go to a smaller, big chain ring. Down from

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.440
a 44 to say a 42, or even like a 38 to get
a wider range of gearing in the ranges where

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:55.210
you're riding the most. You want to optimize
the power band of your body to your terrain

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.610
and stuff like that. You can do similar things
by changing out the gears that you have in

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:07.190
the back. You can go from a really tight,
small gear cluster in the back, like this

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:13.210
one, which is really -- optimally, people
designed this as a road cassette, for riding

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:20.470
little skinny tire road bikes on the road.
It goes from 11 to I believe 23, so your average

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.820
mountain bike, let's say it goes from 12 to
32 or 34. So a 32-tooth chain ring is like

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.920
 -- the cog is that big, so it's a really
and it?s bigger steps all between. If you're

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:37.710
staying on flat terrain or you're riding downhill
where you don't have a ton of terrain changes,

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.170
having more tightly spaced gearing allows
you to change your cadence how quickly you're

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.000
pedaling, really precisely to match the terrain
that you're on. Which is why sometimes I'm

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:56.409
a fan of using a smaller large chain ring
even for the XC use. For downhill use, or

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.770
gated racing use, or just real extreme use,
having a chain retention system allows you

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:10.610
to have the utmost security and confidence
that when you go to pedal, your chain is still

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.140
going to be there, and when you finish that
big long gnarly downhill, you're going to

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.340
be able to ride out of it.
