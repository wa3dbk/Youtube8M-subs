00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.219
Hi this is Kat with Beadaholique.com

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.000
and today I wanna show you the Beadsmith's pink camo gun handle

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.189
tool kit. Now when you get your toolkit

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:20.570
it'll come in a really nice package like
this and you just

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.750
slide it off and you'll get this really neat

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:30.750
carrying case. Open it up and inside

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.850
are the set a set of six tools

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:37.960
that you'll get and there's this protective mesh so that your tools won't

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.230
knock against each other

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.460
as you carry it around. So let's take a
look at what you're going to get with

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:43.219
this tool kit

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:48.850
a pair flush of cutters

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.219
and I'll show you quickly on this one, the cool thing about these

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:55.829
is that it has a gun handle so you kind of

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.629
get to hold it a little bit better. So it's a little more ergonomic

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.690
see how it fits in your hand better than let's say

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:08.140
a different type of tool. So you'll get your
flush cutters

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.740
which is what these are here and then
you'll get a pair of

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.770
round nose pliers. Again same kind of
handle design. It makes it really nice and

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:17.880
easy to use

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.840
you get a bead reamer that will actually
come with

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:27.550
three different tips and they'll be stored in my handle here. You just unscrew it

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.569
and they'll come out here for you

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:36.630
you'll get three different tips. You just
unscrew this top part

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.069
it'll release this and that's how you
change it

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:46.110
just put it in and tighten it up and it's good to use, it's nice and tight

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.770
so that's another tool that you'll get. You
also receive

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.899
a pair of knotting tweezers again in this
really cute

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.979
pink camo and they have a nice
pointed tip as you can see so when

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.929
you're doing fine pearl knotting

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:04.039
you'll get a nice pull

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:07.800
with these and then you'll get a flat nose

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.110
plier again same same handle

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.830
and I don't know if you can tell in the
video here

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:15.850
but this is a nice

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:18.610
soft foam. So it actually kinda

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.530
feels really nice in your hand. It
doesn't feel heavy or stiff

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:26.150
which is really great especially if you're working for long periods of time

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.670
which

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.080
I know I am and then

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.420
last but not least we have our

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.040
chain nose plier and again just very

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.430
very simple. Same gun handle. You'll
notice that

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.540
you'll want to fit it so that your pinky goes here and this little notch

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:47.959
and you wrap your hand around and then it should fit right in

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.870
your palm and then again just to reiterate

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:58.560
it comes with this really nice case. It
has a nice fabric on it. So you can take

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.160
this

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.920
for travel and it'll protect your
tools

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.290
and there's little plastic pieces in
here to hold your tools in place so they

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:07.790
want

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.690
bang around when you're traveling. So I
just want to show it to you. I think it's

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:13.600
really cute

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.959
it's just kinda fine if you have a beader
in your life that is looking for

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:18.440
something a little different and

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:21.660
that definitely doesn't wanna mistake their tools when they take a class

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.090
I definitely recommend this. It makes a
great gift and again

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:28.549
just the handle is what really makes
this particular set unique

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.890
it's something that we don't have on any
other set and I'm so happy that Beadsmith

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.280
made this. I think this is going to be one of my new tool kits

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.420
that I get. I just wanted to show it off to you

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:44.799
