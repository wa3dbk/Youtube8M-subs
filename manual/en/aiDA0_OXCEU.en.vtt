00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:06.290
Ok, the next step in our bedroom painting
project is to prime the areas that we have

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:23.310
prepped on the walls. I've got my primer right
here. And again, you want to make sure that

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:33.570
you give it a good stir in case the paint
separated. Now I already have a roller that's

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.340
got primer on it from a previous project and
I put it in a baggie and what that does is

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:49.680
it keeps it wet. So you can use it again and
again if you need to. Now this is a smaller

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.350
version of the rollers we've been using thus
far. They call them hot dog rollers and they

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.630
come in really handy when it comes to things
like priming where you don't necessarily have

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:26.210
a big area to cover. Ok, I'm going to take
my drop cloth because again, we want to protect

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:53.700
our floors. Dip the roller and then I'm just
going to hit these spots that we patched earlier.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:07.040
If you see areas where there might be some
smudges and stuff, you might want to hit those

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:27.170
too.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:35.069
Ok, so most primers only take about an hour
to dry so we'll let that dry and then we'll

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:35.860
get on to paint.
