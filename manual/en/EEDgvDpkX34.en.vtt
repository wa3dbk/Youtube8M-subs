Hi everybody I'm John Graden and I'm a professional
speaker, trainer and the author of seven books

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.519
including The Impostor Syndrome. Let's talk
about how to write a proper press release.

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.169
And let's correct things right off the bat.
It's no longer a press release, in today's

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:19.330
electronic dissemination, electronic media
it's now called a media release. And really

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:24.939
the best way to write a media release is not
to write a media release. It's better in today's

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:31.949
world to write an article on your subject
and site you as an expert being quoted in

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.050
the article. Or talk about the benefits of
using your product or service. Because typically

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.370
with media releases we are trying to gain
attention for our product or service. And

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:51.190
if we write a straight xyz corporation unleashed
the new phantom xyg configulater, who cares.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.340
Nobody cares about that, so we have to have,
if we can structure the release into an interesting

00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:02.109
article that has benefits for the reader and
site our new product or site ourselves as

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.370
experts we can gain more attraction. It's
going to be a lot more interesting to the

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:13.120
editors and they will typically be more inclined
to run an article, a media release disguised

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:19.030
as an article rather than an advertisement
disguised as a media release. I hope that

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.460
makes sense to you. Let's talk about the structure
of the media release. Imagine that only the

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.090
first paragraph is going to be written, that
the editor is going to cross everything out

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:35.850
and they are only going to run with that first
paragraph so you want to make sure that all

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.420
the important information is in there, who,
what ,when , where, why. That's the beginning,

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.450
the middle we expand upon that, quoting ourselves
talking about the product or service and at

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.450
the end we have typically our biographical
information, our contact information or website

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.950
or phone number etcetera. So we've got a beginning,
a middle and the end. Once that's written

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:02.520
I then go back and I spend most of my time
on the headline. I want a provocative compelling

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:09.909
headline that grabs that editor's attention
and or grabs the readers attention. Six ways

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:17.129
to reduce debt, or six ways to travel at half
price. That's obvious benefit headlines. So

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:25.430
when you write your headline, here's the test.
Look at it and you go, so what. XYZ corporation

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:35.319
announces the defibrillator, so what. Six
ways to reduce debt and grow wealth now. It's

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.189
kind of, if you are in debt it's hard to say
so what to six ways to get out of debt. So

00:02:40.189 --> 00:02:47.569
if you have a challenge in your life and my
media release, or my article can solve that

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:50.549
challenge and help you with that problem,
that's going to be of great interest to you.

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.819
So that's what I call the so what test. Read
the headline look at it and just think, you

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:58.719
know is that a so what, does anybody really
care and make sure that headline passes the

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:04.390
so what test. And that they do indeed care.
If it's a hard copy submission make sure it's

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:10.380
double spaced, on the top left, for immediate
release. Contact, your name, phone number,

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.780
email address, website. The title, the body,
again double spaced, try and keep it to one

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:25.489
page. At the bottom, at the end dash then
the words, end-E N D in capital letters and

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.739
another dash. So we can make it clear to the
editor this is it, you are not missing anything.

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.510
If you have to go on to more pages then that,
make it page two of four, page three of four,

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.430
page four of four end again we want to make
it very clear. Our job is to make it as easy

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.609
as possible for that editor to turn it over
into his publication. I'm John Graden, I hope

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.539
that helps you to write a proper media release,
thanks.
