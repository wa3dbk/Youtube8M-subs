SHEENA DIMATTEO: Maroon 5 moves
like Jagger, Joseph

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.990
Birdsong dances disco, and
Melanie Moore is crowned

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:12.990
America's favorite dancer.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.223
This is Just Dance for
August 18th, 2011.

00:00:17.223 --> 00:00:31.385
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:31.385 --> 00:00:31.650
[MUSIC - MAROON 5, "MOVES
LIKE JAGGER"]

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.210
I was just getting over the
ab-alicious shirtless message

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.850
sent especially to me by The
ICONic Boyz when a new

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.230
shirtless phenomenon graced my
YouTube screen, Adam Levine

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.790
and his new music video for
Maroon 5's "Moves Like

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:45.330
Jagger."

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.760
Most of the YouTube comments for
that video were requesting

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.200
that Adam never put his
shirt on ever again.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.820
So, I'll let you decide
for yourself.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:57.390
Lisa Eaton did an awesome job
recalling Mick Jagger's iconic

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.740
dance moves and bringing
them to us in a

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:00.585
whole new way in 2011.

00:01:00.585 --> 00:01:02.695
LISA EATON: Hi, my name
is Lisa Eaton.

00:01:02.695 --> 00:01:06.180
And I recently choreographed
Maroon 5's "Moves Like

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.820
Jagger." The concept of the
video was to originally get

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.820
Mick Jagger to come and do
a guest spot in the video

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:15.610
because the song is about moves
like Jagger, his type of

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.070
movement, his freedom, the
androgynous sexuality that he

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.210
has, that comes across in his
performance that they wanted

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:22.740
to capture.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.860
The director, Jonas Akerlund,
was very specific.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.790
He wanted all different types
of people that would embody

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:31.990
Mick Jagger essence.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.190
We had a couple Mick Jagger
impersonators.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.460
And the impersonator was very
nice, and he had definite

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.990
opinions on what Mick would do
and what he wouldn't do.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.740
But he wouldn't say Mick, he
would say, (SPEAKING IN

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.621
BRITISH ACCENT) I would do this,
and when I come out, I

00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:46.310
kind of use my hands.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.760
He would even talk in an accent
which was hysterical.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.860
SHEENA DIMATTEO: The Smirnoff
Night Life Exchange Project

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.260
just launched a brand new
online dance competition

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.380
searching for a very special
dancer to go on tour with

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.410
Madonna in 2012.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.740
Anyone can submit a video
for this project.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.960
I've already seen a slew online,
people from Australia,

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.230
United States, England.

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:09.830
One of my favorite contestants
so far is LiL Buck, a

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.950
23-year-old from Memphis,
Tennessee who is bringing us

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.470
Memphis Jookin.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.470
I really thought it was
interesting the way he can

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.860
turn his feet kind of out so
far that it looks like his

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.810
heels are leaving his foot.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:23.250
I mean, I don't know.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.350
Don't hurt yourself Lil Buck.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.220
Choreographers Rich and Tone
will be judging this

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.370
competition And based off the
fierce dancing I've already

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:31.940
seen, they're going to have
a pretty difficult time.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.870
The top 10 finalists will be
flown to New York City for a

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.150
live streamed finale featuring
Madonna herself.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.500
I was super thrilled to stumble
across this video by

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.380
Israeli band, The Young
Professionals entitled

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.470
"D.I.S.C.O." (WHISPERING)
disco.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.680
And now I'm going to turn it
over to my buddy in Arkansas,

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.040
Joseph Birdsong,
for the scoop.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.950
JOSEPH BIRDSONG: I don't even
know how to begin to discuss

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.200
how awesome D.I.S.C.O, Disco is
by The Young Professionals.

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.790
My absolute favorite part of the
video is when the dancers

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.920
put boxes over their heads
and start jamming out.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:06.300
I thought it would be a good
idea to put a box over my own

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.480
head and break out with some of
my own awesome dance moves.

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.630
But apparently the dancers in
the music video are a lot more

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:13.560
coordinated than me.

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.460
My friends keep catching me
humming this song, and I

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.610
recommend it especially as a
summer jam with your windows

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.840
down and your speakers up
while driving around.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.880
SHEENA DIMATTEO: My favorite
dance scene from the movie

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.530
Something Borrowed is now
available on Blu-ray combo

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.520
pack, on demand, DVD, and
digital download.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.680
Some things you didn't see in
the movie theaters are a

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.680
hilarious gag reel, so many
deleted scenes, and many more

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.940
special features.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:37.540
Here's the deal.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.490
I have a few copies of the DVD
of Something Borrowed, and I

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.650
want to give them away to you.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.500
Send me a comment below on why
I should send you a free copy

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.820
and you just might find
one in your mailbox.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:49.870
The season finale of
the Glee Project is

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:50.990
right around the corner.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.430
This past week, our final four
were tested on their

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.170
generosity.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.440
The cast performance
to My Chemical

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.930
Romance's "Sing" was awesome.

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:00.390
That music video was totally
inspiring, loved seeing the

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:02.310
kids in it, and everyone playing
their instruments.

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.990
ROBERT ULRICH (OFFSCREEN): We're
looking for contenders

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.980
who will be able to help their
little co-stars perform the

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:08.320
best they can.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.660
Now it's their chance to see
what it's like to be a mentor,

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.230
and, hopefully, they
can pull it off.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:14.110
SHEENA DIMATTEO: Ryan Murphy
and producers threw the

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:17.269
generosity right back by not
eliminating anybody.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:20.350
The final four are going to
battle it out this Sunday.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.190
Who will take home that coveted
spot on the next

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.100
season of Glee?

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.760
So You Think You Can Dance
wrapped up its eighth season

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.070
crowning the amazing dancer,
Melanie Moore, as America's

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.280
favorite dancer.

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:36.770
Melanie not only won $250,000
but a spread in Dance Spirit

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:39.440
magazine and also a Gatorade
ad campaign.

They are kicking it off in

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.010
For all you theater-goers out
there, the revolutionary

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:59.280
Broadway musical Rent is back
in New York City, this time

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.890
off Broadway at New
World Stages.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:04.200
It has the original director
and choreographer but

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:07.190
completely new sets,
staging, and cast.

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:09.322

00:05:09.322 --> 00:05:10.381
thought about it.

00:05:10.381 --> 00:05:13.970
