Howdy folks it is Barry here welcome to myvirginkitchen
today I am going to be showing you how to

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:13.210
make some salted chocolate Nutella cream eclairs,
I hope you agree they look amazing they taste

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:17.310
out of this World and trust me eclairs they
are not as daunting as you would think to

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.189
make I used to be really scared of making
them these are actually pretty darn easy but

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:25.220
do not tell your friends make sure you give
them a go here are the ingredients, hit pause

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.369
write them all down, you kind of just want
to rub them all over yourself different kind

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.550
of video to food and drink really, but lets
do it.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:38.590
Start off by grabbing yourself a medium saucepan,
pouring in your water add a pinch of salt

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.390
and then your butter now what you want to
do over a low flame is melt that butter so

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.520
stir it all through until it is nice and combined
but whatever you do, do not boil that butter

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.920
you want to keep it over that low flame and
the minute it does start to bubble you want

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.290
to take it off of the flame and add in your
sifted flour as soon as you can.

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.950
Make sure it is sifted, we do not want any
lumps in there and as you stir it will start

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:03.880
to thicken and almost join like a sort of
tennis ball that is the best reference I have

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:08.180
got but yeah it will form that amazing funky
dough so all you want to do is cook flour

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.740
and I never realised you had to cook flour
before in the past, well I learnt it a few

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.360
years ago but before I did not even know that
which is cool so anyhow one minute back on

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:19.720
that flame just to stir it through and cook
through again and then you want to sit it

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.470
in a bowl just to rest.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.050
So after that dough has cooled for at least
5 minutes we are going to gradually add in

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.260
our beaten egg do not pour it in all in one
go and do not do it while still hot or you

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:33.590
will make scrambled egg eclairs which may
randomly taste ok if you put savoury cream

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.990
in the middle, you know with a bit of crab,
bit of chives, do not know where I am going

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.940
but do not do that, so keep mixing it together
with a whisk until nice and combined again

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.210
and then your dough is all ready to be shoved
into a piping bag get a baking tray nice and

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.600
greased and lined in there and squeeze down
some lines, make them nice and consistent

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.530
give them some spacing obviously the larger
piping nozzle you use the bigger it will be

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.340
also you can use a zip lock bag if you snip
it off like that but get your lines in there

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.970
and it is ready to shove it in the oven.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.030
Just before baking sprinkle your tray in a
little bit of water nothing too much ok that

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.461
will help it steam and rise our pastry right
there so what you want to do is whack it into

00:02:12.461 --> 00:02:16.300
your oven make sure it is pre-heated gas mark
6 or equivalent the temperatures are on your

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.660
screen, you need to be really patient right
now do not be tempted, I am the sort of person

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.710
that needs to open the oven and see what is
going on do not do that otherwise this will

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.710
fail.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:29.780
So give it 15 minutes at that stage and once
you hit fifteen minutes again do not open

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:34.610
the door, turn it down by half to gas mark
3 again the equivalent is on your screen right

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:38.200
now and that will just sort of cook through
the centre ok because if you take it out it

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.520
is just going to go flat and you do not want
that you want it to hold that nice firm shape.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:46.060
So once you get it out at the ten minute stage
at that lower temperature you will see that

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.880
it is all nice and puffed and risen what we
will do is get a bamboo skewer and just pierce

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.890
each one just to let a little bit of steam
out and then bake it again at that same temperature

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.090
just for 3 or 4 minutes to hold it nice and
firm.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.930
Take them out, let them cool down and you
have made eclairs.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.090
You have just got to fill them now, yeah!

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:08.002
To make the Nutella cream filling I combined
some cream which I whipped previously with

00:03:08.002 --> 00:03:13.120
some Nutella and got some big old scoops of
that about 2 heaped tablespoons mixed it through

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.160
until it sort of dyed its colour and became
a milk chocolate colour and then added in

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.410
some chopped hazelnuts got that through again
and that was our Nutella cream all done but

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:26.489
of course you could do traditional cream maybe
vanilla and icing sugar or a lemon meringue

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.360
cream whipped cream with some lemon curd lemon
meringue eclairs oh my gosh I have to do that,

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.530
if you do that let me know down below how
you get on but that is our cream all done

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:39.451
my friends so in terms of piping it you could
just pierce some holes in the top kind of

00:03:39.451 --> 00:03:42.690
like twinkies I have made twinkies in the
past check out the video if you want to look

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.030
at that, you can cut a layer from the side
some people cut them in half some people go

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:52.100
from the bottom I actually went from the top
I used some food scissors to make that and

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:58.000
pushed it in with spoons to nice and messy
but get it nice and full and your cream is

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000
all in there.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.250
And all that is left to do now is grab the
eclairs, dump them in some melted chocolate

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:07.800
lift them back onto a tray to completely set
again, whack them in the fridge to speed that

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:12.220
up and once they are set give them a nice
finish of sprinkled salt, oh yeah baby that

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:15.709
is completely optional by the way some of
you guys might be like ahhh no salt with chocolate,

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:20.329
but I am absolutely addicted to it put some
nuts on it whatever you want to do they taste

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:25.570
amazing and you may spot that I did a big
old profiterole one too that was just a lump

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.540
of dough simply on the baking tray and that
just expands exactly the same times and temperatures

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.390
it is just say as a big ball when you pipe
it on your tray not a line a big ball and

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:38.470
it will rise and you can fill it from underneath
so that is it then guys I really hope you

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:45.330
