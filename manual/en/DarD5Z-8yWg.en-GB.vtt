00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.560
Her pink face smiles from everything from
tins of pasta to sunglasses and backpacks.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.999
And today, 10 years after she hit TV screens,
Peppa Pig is such a phenomenon it’s hard

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:16.490
to imagine a world without her. Five-minute
cartoons of Peppa plus family and friends

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:22.300
are shown in more than 170 nations, and yesterday
we told how her earnings are set to top one

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.800
billion dollars. It’s an incredible British
success story that almost never happened because

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.920
Peppa’s creators – three mates who met
at Middlesex Polytechnic in the 80s who are

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.720
now all millionaires – struggled to get
anyone interested. The idea was born in 2000

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.830
when out-of-work animators Neville Astley
and Mark Baker joined forces with producer

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:47.690
pal Phil Davies to create a children’s character
and get it commissioned. But as their funds

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.309
dwindled with no interest they were on the
verge of shelving Peppa. Neville, 57, says:

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.489
“The year 2000 was hard. We had to spend
a lot to make Peppa plausible as an idea and

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.290
I only earned £400 in 12 months. We survived
by raiding our savings. “It got to the stage

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:11.520
where we almost had to split up and go and
earn money. Phil adds: “That was pretty

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.790
tough. I had to watch the pennies and what
we bought in the supermarket. I had to avoid

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:21.820
the finer range aisles, put it that way!”
Thankfully for millions of parents around

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.150
the world who get five minutes of peace when
Peppa comes on screen they were saved at the

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.600
last minute. “Between us we got a commercial
that kept us going and then Peppa got commissioned.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.409
“I like the thought that young generations
will think of Peppa Pig when they grow up

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:41.590
in the same way I still remember Bill and
Ben. That’s pretty special.” As soon as

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.979
the first episode aired on Channel 5 in May
2004 it began building legions of followers.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.750
And the team recognised at once the importance
of selling merchandise. The fact that could

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.460
adorn children’s bedrooms – and the kids
themselves – with Peppa branded products

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.640
helped it become a way of life rather than
just a TV cartoon. One episode featured Peppa

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.190
sporting a pair of fairy wings and a real-life
version was in the shops in time for Christmas,

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.410
along with a Peppa-themed fairy castle which
topped the Christmas toy charts. Now more

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.550
than 200 episodes of have been made along
with more than 12,000 branded products, from

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.810
garden sets to crayons and wellies. Entertainment
One, who own the licensing rights, estimate

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:31.580
earnings will break the $1billion (£640m)
barrier by the end of this year. Peppa has

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.460
cracked America and an exclusive licensing
deal with toy giant Fisher Price put Peppa

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.010
products exclusively in US Toys R Us stores.
When that expires a new deal with Jazwares

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.970
will land Peppa sold in 4,200 Walmart stores.
“They love the Queen’s English – the

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.480
British accent,” said Entertainment One’s
boss Darren Throop. But where there’s a

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.690
hit there’s a writ and this week it was
revealed that an Italian woman called Gabriella

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:02.470
Capra is suing the show for £80,000. The
show’s Gabriella Goat character is called

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.250
Capra (Italian for goat) in their version
and she says she has never lived it down since

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:14.230
the goat bleated (in Italian) “Hello. I
am Gabriella Capra. Baaa.” And in September,

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.010
a Facebook campaign to have Peppa banned for
offending Muslims was revealed as a hoax that

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:25.290
thousands of people fell for. Still, none
of it comes close to denting Peppa’s popularity.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:30.430
“You get protective of her,” says Phil.
“There are certain things we wouldn’t

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:35.300
involve her in, like political campaigns.”
The trio in fact turned down an invitation

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.380
from the Labour Party to get involved before
the last general election. Phil says his own

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.730
family provides inspiration for some story
lines. “There are episodes completely based

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:50.890
on family experiences,” said the father
of two. “Either from my childhood or through

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.230
having children. “One was based on me and
my sister trying to sell our old toys outside

00:03:56.230 --> 00:04:01.150
our house when we were kids to raise money
to buy sweets.” Peppa Pig is now made by

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:06.530
a 30-strong team at the Elf Factory - the
London HQ - along with the trio’s more recent

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:11.490
show, Ben and Holly’s Little Kingdom. The
brand may have grown beyond the wildest dreams

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.510
of its creators but the trio have tried to
keep their feet on the ground. Neville says

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.769
he is still “frugal” while Phil concedes:
“I can shop in the more expensive supermarket

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.030
aisles now. “Sometimes, I even treat myself
to Marks and Spencer crispy duck.”
