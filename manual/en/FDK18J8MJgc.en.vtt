This episode of DNews is brought to you by
Ting: Mobile that makes sense.

00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:08.410
If you're one of the millions of people who
fears going to the dentist - then good news!

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:13.549
Science has a cure, and it's not drugs - it's
virtual reality.

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:22.120
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and I might
be one of the only people on the planet who

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.640
actually enjoys going to the dentist.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.280
It's like a tiny massage for your teeth.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.080
But I understand that's weird, and if you're
one of those people who HATES going to the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.610
dentist - then you're in luck!

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.220
A new study in the journal CYBERPSYCHOLOGY,
BEHAVIOR, AND SOCIAL NETWORKING finds that

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.120
virtual reality may be the key to minimizing
pain and anxiety when it comes to dental procedures.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.020
This isn't the first research of its kind
- in fact, many studies have shown that virtual

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.540
reality can help manage pain with all kinds
of procedures, like chemotherapy, physical

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.460
therapy, and burn wound changes.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.040
Still, painkillers continue to be the first-line
solution for managing dental pain, but they're

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.070
not always effective.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.750
Pain perception is known to have a strong
psychological component, which is why a person

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.460
needs to be conscious in order to feel pain.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.750
The idea behind virtual reality - is that
by distracting the patient and re-focusing

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:14.600
their thoughts, there's less attention available
to focus on the pain.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.170
For this study, they recruited 5 adult patients
undergoing routine dental procedures, and

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.880
asked them to fill out a questionnaire - both
before and after their treatment - to assess

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.810
their levels of anxiety and fear.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.350
Each patient was also hooked up to a biofeedback
device, which measured certain physiological

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.439
aspects, like heart rate and breathing rate.

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:37.340
When it came time for the dental procedure,
doctors performed the first 5 minutes as normal,

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.310
and then the next 5 minutes, they had patients
hooked up to a virtual reality device.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.479
Not an Oculus Rift, since that requires a
lot of head movement - but a similar device,

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.340
where patients could navigate through relaxing
nature worlds, like beaches and forests and

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.340
mountains.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.310
Researchers found that not only does the distraction
of VR help alleviate pain - it also reduces

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.130
anxiety surrounding dental procedures.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.680
But it's not just the distraction factor that
makes it work.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:06.490
Other studies have tried seeing if watching
a movie can help minimize pain during dental

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.620
procedures - but it was found to be only slightly
more effective than no distractions at all.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.150
Certainly not enough to be significant, and
still nowhere near as effective as virtual

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.900
reality.(2) So clearly, the key is a combination
of distraction and immersion.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.951
The authors of this study say that once newer,
better, and more immersive virtual reality

00:02:24.951 --> 00:02:29.480
worlds are built - they could reduce a patient's
pain, down to almost nothing.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.480
Very cool.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.140

tired of getting screwed over by your cell

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.810
