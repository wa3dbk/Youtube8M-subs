I'm Felix Cartal from Vancouver, Canada.
Producer and then DJ, in that order.

00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:35.368
I kinda stumbled my way into bands in high school.

00:00:35.368 --> 00:00:40.790
The thing that I try to take away from those days
into the DJ world is just the energy of it.

00:00:40.832 --> 00:00:42.959
It's so much fun when the crowd is interacting.

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:48.381
Having a mosh pit go crazy at a crazy moment
is a great feeling.  People wanna get excited.

00:00:48.381 --> 00:00:50.008
When they get excited, I get excited.

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:52.802
Even when I was in a band I was
working on, like, little projects.

00:00:52.802 --> 00:00:56.431
Once you use software you can kinda jump
around and do lots of different things.

00:00:56.473 --> 00:01:00.060
Funnily enough, when I was in high school...
I guess grade 11... we had a class in school

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.065
called "Music Composition."  I think we had Reason...
1.0 or 2.0.  It was definitely the beginning days.

00:01:05.148 --> 00:01:11.696
Reason had all the effects built in and
everything that I ever used in a band

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:14.324
environment was already there. 
You could just play with it.

00:01:14.324 --> 00:01:19.204
My first songs, though, we kind of like "happy
accidents."  I think maybe the fact that I wasn't

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:23.500
really brought up in the club scene some of my
tracks might have sounded a little more inovative

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.587
just because they didn't follow the typical
dance structure.  I was taking rock formulas

00:01:27.587 --> 00:01:29.255
and applying them to dance music.

00:01:29.255 --> 00:01:31.883
Malstrom is the thing I used the most.

00:01:31.883 --> 00:01:35.261
I had Reason 3.0 while I was doing my album
and then Reason 4.0 came out and I was like,

00:01:35.261 --> 00:01:39.015
"I don't want to switch in the middle of things.
I just want to get it done."  

00:01:39.015 --> 00:01:43.228
I missed the Thor until Reason 5.0 and now I
like that as well.  So now I'm kind of in between

00:01:43.228 --> 00:01:44.312
the MalstrÅ¡m and Thor.

00:01:44.312 --> 00:01:49.609
This track is called "The Riddler."  It's the B-side to
my last release, "The Joker."  It's kind of the more

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:52.570
melodic track on the record.

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.255
There's one bassline that trudges along doing
one note the whole time and then

00:02:10.255 --> 00:02:12.799
there's the lead melody that does
all the work of the track.

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:20.140
So the main lead is just a Malstrom.  A simple little
melody.  It's kind of semitoned to make it a bit evil.

00:02:20.306 --> 00:02:25.020
A bunch of other ones going with it at the same time.

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:30.483
So that's three different synths together
to kind of give it some depth.

00:02:30.692 --> 00:02:36.322
I'm a reverb guy, for sure.  I kind of do a 
lot of fills at the end of each phrase with reverb.

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:42.245
Like right there you can hear it fill out the end
of the phrase and it will come in again right here.

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:48.960
It's basically just cutting it from dry all the way
to 100% wet for like... half a second.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:53.173
I have a breakdown where I
fade in a full chord section.

00:02:55.467 --> 00:03:00.013
Right here on the Modulation A,
it's just the pitch.

00:03:04.642 --> 00:03:10.231
So pitching it as high as it will possibly go... so
basically jumping 40 octaves every one beat

00:03:10.231 --> 00:03:12.442
for a sixteenth note.

00:03:16.488 --> 00:03:22.327
And then if you look at the automation...

00:03:23.828 --> 00:03:29.250
I kinda did some more rolls with it near the end so 
that it kind of really builds up.

00:03:29.668 --> 00:03:32.170
You'll hear it at 129.

00:03:32.754 --> 00:03:36.549
So it actually sounds like
someone's whipping it by hand.

00:03:52.107 --> 00:03:57.320
I experiment with that pitch knob a ton on
a lot of my tracks.  Like the A-side "The Joker" is

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.199
pretty much the entire bass line
is moving that knob around.

00:04:17.507 --> 00:04:20.218
My theory with music is like, 
"every genre has a formula."

00:04:20.218 --> 00:04:24.264
A jazz song has a formula.  Your A, your
B section, and your "coda" or whatever.

00:04:24.264 --> 00:04:28.143
And then Rock... it's verse, chorus, verse
chorus, bridge, double-chorus.

00:04:28.143 --> 00:04:31.938
Dance music is like mix in, drop, mix out.

00:04:31.938 --> 00:04:35.316
You can step outside the box but you don't
want to step so far outside that you're

00:04:35.316 --> 00:04:37.277
like in a different box altogether.

00:04:37.277 --> 00:04:40.947
When it comes down to it, it's still party music
and people want to dance to it.

00:04:42.073 --> 00:04:45.910
Just from DJ'ing you know what's going
to work in the club.  To remove that one

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:49.122
element of "the drop" then it's just kind
of like what's the point?

00:04:49.122 --> 00:04:54.210
I've done album number one and I think that's
kinda of what I want to do.  I just want to focus

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.798
on albums.  Like I'm an album person.  I think that's
maybe the band background coming through a little bit.

00:04:58.798 --> 00:05:02.135
So I think it's just, like, building
my discography that way.

00:05:02.135 --> 00:05:07.557
I know that dance music, you don't need to do that.
You could just live off of singles but I want to make

00:05:07.557 --> 00:05:10.602
dance music albums that are listenable full albums.

00:05:10.602 --> 00:05:13.897
The singles have to work on their own but
within the context of the record they have to

00:05:13.897 --> 00:05:15.398
work too.  

00:05:19.986 --> 00:05:24.657
That's the formula I guess I'll be
searching for for the next... few years.
