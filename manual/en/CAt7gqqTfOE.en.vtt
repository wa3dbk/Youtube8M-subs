00:00:02.930 --> 00:00:08.910
One, two, three. 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.970
 Dance is such a wonderful communicator of expression and ideas and life. 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.430
One thing - the thing I love about dance - it doesn't discriminate what background you 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.410
come from, what colour your skin is, what language you speak because dance is a universal 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.170
language. 

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.350
Kulture Break is about bringing everybody together in harmony. 

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.600
It's about celebrating everybody's uniqueness, regardless of their background or their 

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:38.350
situation. 

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.880
It's about celebrating them and we have this statement 'you don't become somebody, you 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:43.280
are somebody'. 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.275
Five, six, seven. 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.930
There's freedom in dance. 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.640
There's no right or wrong. 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.450
It allows people with freedom to express what they feel inside and I just guess…you 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.560
know…I wish everybody in the world could dance. 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.760
It would solve a lot of heartache and problems if we could communicate through dance as 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.690
dance is the universal language. 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.690
It brings everybody together to celebrate life. 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.772
You're mingling with African brothers, Australians, man I've danced with all kinds of 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.243
races and just when we come together it's like you forget. 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.090
It is like a culture– you end up becoming your own culture and that's the powerful thing 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:41.812
about dance for me, is that it's brought a lot of different cultures together. 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:50.338
Dance to me is meeting new friends, being part of a brotherhood and expressing myself. 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.280
My life without dance would be boring. 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.275
I would be hanging out in shopping centres, getting up to no good, trying to be the 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:09.075
person I'm not. 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.930
We've got one person from Kenya, we've got another from Thailand, the Philippines, we've 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.923
got four of us of Maori New Zealand background, we've got an Arab from Lebanon. 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:29.003
For some of us boys, that's where we came from, some of us were in gangs, some of us were 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.510
bullies, but when we started getting into dancing, it sort of brought the humble side of 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:48.660
us out of it.
