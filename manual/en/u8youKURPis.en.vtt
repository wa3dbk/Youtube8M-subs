Freedom!, do you want one tip to get your
videos ranked higher on YouTube and get better

00:00:05.223 --> 00:00:10.704
watch-time on those videos as well? I'm going
to let you in on one secret that you may have

00:00:10.704 --> 00:00:17.104
actually tried before, but it didn't produce
the correct results. If you click right here...see

00:00:17.104 --> 00:00:22.094
that little button on the video player? Yeah,
give it a click, why don'tcha? I've included

00:00:22.094 --> 00:00:27.364
the video transcript in a text file for the
closed captionings on this video because it

00:00:27.364 --> 00:00:33.824
actually ranks videos higher on YouTube and
it's been proven in studies to increase view-time.

00:00:33.824 --> 00:00:38.793
A lot of YouTubers actually use the built-in
transcript tool to transcribe all of their

00:00:38.793 --> 00:00:42.774
audio for their videos, but it actually kinda
works against them because it's going to get

00:00:42.774 --> 00:00:49.774
the audio text incorrect. YouTube takes keywords
out of these transcripts and it can help boost

00:00:49.974 --> 00:00:56.084
your ratings on YouTube when users search
for certain keywords. And closed captioning

00:00:56.084 --> 00:01:01.634
isn't also just for hard-of-hearing or deaf people.
It's actually a great teaching tool for people

00:01:01.634 --> 00:01:07.503
that are trying to learn English, what I'm
currently speaking, as a second language.

00:01:07.503 --> 00:01:14.164
And since Freedom! is a global network on
YouTube, a lot of our partners don't actually

00:01:14.164 --> 00:01:20.153
speak English. Or, English is maybe a second
language to them and they can benefit from

00:01:20.153 --> 00:01:24.613
these closed captions and they can learn some
of these words that we're saying in the video

00:01:24.613 --> 00:01:28.463
and they can better relate to the things that
we're presenting them. So if you're one of

00:01:28.463 --> 00:01:34.064
those YouTubers that wants to take your videos
and your channel that extra mile, then closed

00:01:34.064 --> 00:01:38.943
captioning might be for you. It can be a little
bit tedious, it takes a bit of time to transcribe

00:01:38.943 --> 00:01:44.164
all of the audio correctly, but it could be
worth it guys. So, I wanna hear in the comment

00:01:44.164 --> 00:01:49.043
section down below, are you a fan of closed
captioning your own videos? Are you going

00:01:49.043 --> 00:01:53.613
to try and close caption your videos from
now on? I'd love to hear it guys! I've been

00:01:53.613 --> 00:02:00.613
