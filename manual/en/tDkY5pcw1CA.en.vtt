00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.739
I've been a production woodturner 
almost all my working life

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.020
and I suppose I'm known as a bowl maker

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.500
although I do my fair share of spindle turning

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.680
in this DVD I'm gonna show you some of the techniques I use to sharpen my tools

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.910
on the various sharpening systems - we'll take a close look at each tool

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.010
used for both spindle and bowl turning

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.489
you'll see how to produce crisp turned work

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.951
with a minimum of sanding necessary

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.360
I'm also going to show you how to present
the tools to the piece of wood

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.280
to achieve a great finish and also avoid

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.479
some of those nasty tool catches which
are as much a part of

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:14.380
learning to turn as falling off a
bicycle is part of learning to ride

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.260
you'll get a chance to see some great close-up footage

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.380
of the tools in action - we'll look at using
your body to shape to work

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.979
because fluid body movements help
produce flowing curves on the lathe

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:30.179
or the perfect edge at the grinder - so what do I mean about using your body

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.360
I've been told I have a great pair of
hands, and certainly my hands hold the tools

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.121
my feet take me to the lathe, but it's my
body that shapes the piece

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.679
my legs, shoulders, and arms all moving in rhthym

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:46.739
so not sure about the phrase "a great pair
of hands" - a great body might be more appropriate

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.839
now that's a title I could live with!
so having sharp tools is the most important

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:52.009
element of woodturning

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.580
when they're sharp, time spent on the late
it's just so rewarding

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.960
it takes a lot of practice to master the
techniques of turning

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.660
but once you have the desire to learn

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.890
to be as good as you can be
you can just bring the lathe to life
