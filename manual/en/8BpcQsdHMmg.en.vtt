00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.149
The Wild West may bring to mind visions of
John Wayne, Clint Eastwood, and The Magnificent

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.850
Seven, but we can’t help but think of the
near-legendary campfire scene in Mel Brooks’s

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:14.030
Blazing Saddles.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.820
Fittingly, Gameloft’s Six-Guns drops quite
a few bum notes of its own.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.480
As usual, Gameloft has taken inspiration from
elsewhere in the video game world, and Six-Guns

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.920
borrows plenty of ideas from Rockstar’s
popular Red Dead Redemption.

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.949
You’re thrust into a large, sandbox-style
world and expected to complete 40 different

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:32.949
missions.

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:36.660
Success earns you cash with which you can
purchase new items and upgrades.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.839
While the premise may boast Gameloft’s traditional
lack of originality, the visuals are also

00:00:40.839 --> 00:00:45.129
in tune with the company’s usual standards
- in short, they’re fantastic.

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:49.319
Six-Guns looks amazing, with detailed character
models and breathtaking scenery.

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:52.870
The only drawback is that it does tend to
chug a little when there’s a lot of action

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:54.030
occurring.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.370
Six-Guns has a well-crafted touchscreen interface
which is easy to navigate and intuitive to

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.370
use.

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.749
You can open a map, call your horse, or discharge
your sidearm with a single button press.

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:07.710
Combat is also pleasantly straightforward,
thanks largely to an auto-aim system that's

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.990
so effective it practically finds your target
for you.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.590
Six-Guns starts well, and ensures that you
have all the information you need to become

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.850
fully accustomed to the controls and game
mechanics.

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.860
But cracks begin to appear once you’re a
few missions in - while there are different

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.850
objective types, most of the tasks fall into
the same basic template.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.520
The repetitive nature of the missions is made
even more glaring by the fact that Six-Guns

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.050
is almost entirely devoid of plotting.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.620
You are literally told nothing about your
character, his motives or his relationship

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.350
with the people in the game.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.650
Given Gameloft’s penchant for solid storylines
in its games, this can only be seen as an

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.930
uncharacteristically odd choice.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:46.970
Without a plot to drive the game forward,
you simply move from mission to mission without

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.630
any sense of actually achieving anything.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.160
This is a crying shame as the game is very
enjoyable once it starts flowing.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.700
The ability to upgrade your equipment keeps
things interesting, and the power to quickly

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.570
jump to points on the map to prevent tiresome
riding is a welcome one.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.170
Six-Guns is free to play, but you’ll soon
discover that it's heavily skewed in favour

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.930
of in-app purchases.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.860
If you’re dedicated (and skilful) enough,
you can happily finish all 40 levels without

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.939
actually spending a single penny, but it’s
not an easy task.

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:19.159
We wonder if Gameloft has deliberately kept
costs down by avoiding cut-scenes and plotting,

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:23.019
instead choosing to offer a bare-bones action
experience which will hopefully tempt enough

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.239
people to open their wallets and make in-app
purchases.

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.959
The game is certainly persistent.

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.709
As soon as a commodity - be it health or ammo
- is running low, the game prods you forcefully

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.079
in the direction of the in-game store.

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:38.209
Six-Guns has style, and it manages to nail
the western atmosphere with relative ease.

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.329
It’s just a bit curious that Gameloft has
decided to push the game out to market with

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:46.900
no plot attached - something that leaves it
feeling disjointed, aimless, and repetitive.
