The Perfect Cosmopolitan Recipe

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Today on Drinks With Diablo

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Hello, welcome once again

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
to TheFNDC.com's YouTube channel.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Today, we're on a quest for the Perfect Cosmopolitan.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
I've assembled all the ingredients.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I've got an empty shaker glass, no ice.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'll add ice in the last step.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I've got a fresh lime.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
And I've got some orange peel for later.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Here's the rest of the ingredients:

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You're going to need a high end, or medium end

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Citrus Vodka.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
I've got Absolut Citron.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
This is the one that the original recipe had.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Ketel One or Stoli will work fine, too.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Whatever you've got.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I've got Cointreau, of course.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
You can substitute Grand Marnier if that's all you have.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
This works pretty good. I'd stay away from the Patrón orange liqueur.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I've got cranberry juice, and I've got orange bitters.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This is an extra; you only add a little bit.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
This could work.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
If you have it on hand [ orange bitters ], that's good.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
So we add the ingredients in a very specific order.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
And we go, 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Two ounces of your citrus vodka.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
One ounce of your Cointreau.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And for the record, I really do love this liquor.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
t's pretty amazing.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Go with one ounce of cranberry juice.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
We add them in this order because they have to get cold at a certain rate.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And we cut our lime.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
We just need to use half a lime.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I don't have a juicer, so we're just going to squeeze it right in there.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
If anybody wants to get me a juicer, that would be awesome.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
[ Update: I got a juicer shortly after this was filmed. :) ]

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
[ So, juice from ½  a lime ]

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Okay, put that down for now.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000
And a dash of orange bitters.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Add a little ice.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Shake it really good, until it's nice and cold.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000
When I feel my hand getting cold, then it's cold enough.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
OK, let's strain this out.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Some people strain it further than this. They use use the little hand thing (strainer).

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
You see it's a very light pink.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
That's how it should be. It shouldn't be overly red.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
I'm going to attempt to flame 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
this orange.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000
And if anybody doesn't know what that is,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
just look up another video online. They can probably do it better than me.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000
This gets it ready; it brings the oil to the surface.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
And I guess you're supposed to hold it like -

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
this? I don't know.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
&gt;&gt; Lilly Smalls: [ giggles ]

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
&gt;&gt; Dîablø: You're supposed to like, zest it, into the flame.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000
WHOA

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Like that!

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
So then you put it in there. 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
* IMPORTANT: Use a smaller piece and twist it first before garnishing*

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
And that's it. You can also use a regular lime wheel, that's fine.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Okay, so let's try it. Wow. I can't believe I did that.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
First time I ever tried it.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000
[ sipping the Perfect Cosmopolitan ]

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
It's pretty good. 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000
That's pretty, pretty good.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
It's different from a lot of other Cosmopolitans that I've had.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
But I like that one.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
