00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:04.900
&gt;&gt; Court: This is the e-JOE Epik.

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:11.059
It's a folding electric bike with a lot of
extra features at a pretty good price.

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.200
Let me go through some of the specs on this
thing.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.770
So, it comes in two flavors actually, there's
the Epik and then the Epik SE which actually

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.160
has a rear cassette and like seven speeds.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.860
This one's a single speed bike.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:26.290
And, you know that works out pretty well,
it keeps the chain from you know, rattling

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.290
around.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:30.029
There's going to be less maintenance and the
gear's fairly standard.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.840
It's kind of like if you're a kid and you've
got a, you know single speed bike.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.530
It worked okay; going up hills could be a
little bit trickier but you know, that's where

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.660
the pedal assist and the electric motor really
help on this bike.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.190
So it's kind of neat, it comes in a few different
colors.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:48.500
There's like black, red, blue and then kind
of a green color.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.520
Its got these nice fenders, front and rear.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.370
And its got lights built in.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.270
Now the rear light isn't actually connected
to the system, so that means extra batteries

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.940
and a little bit of extra messing around,
but the front light is.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.449
So as soon as you turn the bike on there's
actually a switch up there on the controller

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:07.630
that lets you activate the light.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.190
So I think that's pretty cool.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.550
Its got that rear rack, you know that's just
kind of handy if you're carrying around a

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:15.220
bag or panniers or something.

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:20.780
A lot of times you keep a bike like this on
a boat or maybe in your RV, something like

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.520
that and it's just nice to have that extra
carrying capacity.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.780
You've even got the, you know kind of like
spring loaded gripper right there which is

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:31.810
pretty cool.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.330
So yeah, in terms of folding, you know the
bike is fairly easy to deal with.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.780
Um, let me just kind of get over there and
grab the thing and show you.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.210
Just slide this up, pop that out like that
and then the frame folds right there.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.880
And you can actually see, that's the battery
pack.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.110
And you can charge this on or off the bike
which is super cool.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.600
Not a lot of folding electric bikes allow
that, especially ones that have batteries

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.600
built into the frame.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.110
Erch, I'm going to try to fold this back up
real quick, there we go.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.250
And it's kind of nice that they offer that
because you know, you could take the battery

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.170
pack off, makes this bike even lighter weight.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.890
The bike's already pretty light weight, it's
like 37 pounds.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.270
Um, you know, very liftable.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:25.641
The other folding points are right here, the
neck sort of slides up and down, the seat

00:02:25.641 --> 00:02:28.220
slides up and down or completely off.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.210
And then that folds down that way.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.500
There aren't any, you know, magnets or clasps
built in to keep it folded.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.060
You might want to carry a bungee cord or something
with you.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.770
But otherwise, you know, it works fairly well.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.260
The seat actually kind of does that swivel
up and that's because some of the other Ejoe

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.680
bikes have a battery that sits right there.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.960
So it's, you know, overall a pretty cool little
bike and I feel like the price point is really

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:02.550
a good selling point here, it's under $1,500
and you've got kind of the standard rim brakes

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.880
and stuff that you're dealing with.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.270
So overall I think the components are fairly
decent.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.060
And in terms of the drive system here, what
we're looking at is a 250 watt geared rear

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.060
hub motor.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:17.090
So the gearing means that it can offer a little
bit more torque, little bit more power for

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.270
the smaller size.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:21.370
250 is kind of small but that's sort of standard
in Europe.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:25.290
And frankly, for a bike like this that's sort
of light weight, that's, you know that's pretty

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:26.290
good.

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:27.290
It's not too bad.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.900
The battery is 36 volt 7 amp hour.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.510
Again, right there in the downtube.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.580
You can charge that on or off the bike.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.750
And again, that's pretty, you know kind of
middle of the range there.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.810
Seven amp hours isn't a whole lot but that's
part of what keeps it light weight.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.380
So, you know, overall a decent system.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.790
It's Lithium polymer, which is, you know there's
Lithium-ion, Lithium Iron Phosphate and Lithium

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.720
polymer is a step up from Lead acid and stuff.

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:54.990
It might kind of have like a medium lifespan.

00:03:54.990 --> 00:04:00.330
But the fact that it's replaceable is pretty
cool and this is a pretty big operation.

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.150
They're, you know, I feel like they support
their bikes pretty well.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.200
And overall, this bike rides fairly well.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.240
I've been cruising around parking lots and
stuff here, and alley ways.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.770
And it feels decent going over the bumps.

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.900
There's no shock absorbers or seat post shocks
or anything but the tires are a little bit

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.600
bigger and they're like Kenda thorn resistant
tires.

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.570
But you know, they're not pre-Slimed, it's
just kind of standard, standard issue.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:27.600
But again, you're saving some money and frankly
it works well enough.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.460
This only comes in one size.

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.720
I'm about 5'9" and it feels pretty good, you
know the seat's adjustable up and down.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:38.300
So let me just hop on and you know I can show
you the motor.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.139
But first, this is the control panel right
here.

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.400
You just turn the bike on, you can see it
light up.

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.790
It shows you how much power is left.

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.780
There's no speedometer, nothing really fancy
up here.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.840
There's three different modes of pedal assist,
so low medium and high.

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:57.960
And it uses a pedelec sensor, you can kind
of see in there.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.300
So there's like a little sensor and it just,
whenever your crank passes it tells the motor

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.620
"activate" and then this is basically telling
it how strong the motor should be.

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.400
Well the cool thing is, you can actually use
the trigger throttle in conjunction with the

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.040
pedelec system at any time.

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.220
So you can just press that and it will go;
you can stop pedaling.

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.560
And if you want, you can turn off pedal assist
completely and go scooter style which works

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:21.810
pretty well.

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:26.750
So I was impressed, again I'm not super heavy
I'm like 140 pounds, but the bike you know

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.280
the geared motor design is pretty effective
at getting you going.

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.500
Especially on the flats.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.200
I'm just going to put it in low here and show
you the motor.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.260
And you can listen for it.

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:45.490
[motor whirring] Well, pretty smooth, pretty
quiet and efficient.

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:49.130
I'm going to do the twist throttle, or the
trigger now.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:59.530
[motor whirring] Kind of what you'd expect,
um not too bad.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.690
You know it's a fairly polished folding electric
bike at a pretty good price.

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.310
I'm going to go ahead and put on the wide
angle lens so you can see what the riding

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:10.669
position looks like here.

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:12.410
There we go!

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:16.340
I'm going to go up to medium.

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:37.690
[wind and motor noise] You can kind of see
the handle bar position there.

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:46.790
[wind noise] So there you go!

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:47.800
Woo!

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:50.820
Haha, pull over.

00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:57.290
