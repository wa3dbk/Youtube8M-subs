VIVIAN LEUNG: Hi.

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:09.470
We're on the first stop of the
Google App to School bus tour.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:12.920
We're in sunny Los Angeles,
and let's see what the

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:14.910
students have to say about what
they like about using

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.530
Google Apps.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.920
MALE SPEAKER: We are using
a lot of Google apps.

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:20.830
MALE SPEAKER: Google
Documents.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:21.690
FEMALE SPEAKER: Google Docs.

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.570
MALE SPEAKER: Google Docs.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.740
MALE SPEAKER: We use
Google Calendar.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.090
MALE SPEAKER: Google Calendar.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:27.560
FEMALE SPEAKER: Gmail.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:28.070
MALE SPEAKER: Gmail.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.630
MALE SPEAKER: Gmail.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:30.216
MALE SPEAKER: Gmail.

00:00:30.216 --> 00:00:31.466
FEMALE SPEAKER: I use
all the apps.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.250
MALE SPEAKER: I love Google Docs
because I can access them

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.160
from computers on campus
and from home.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.270
FEMALE SPEAKER: For sharing
documents with our professors

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:44.340
and other TAs.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.620
Things like rosters
and grade books.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.890
MALE SPEAKER: We're the student
run radio station, and

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.435
trying to coordinate volunteers
to host shows or to

00:00:52.435 --> 00:00:55.450
go out and flier in Hollywood at
clubs and things like that.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:57.460
It'll make a form for you, and
then just fill that straight

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:58.480
into the spreadsheet.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.310
But that saves all of
us a ton of time.

00:01:04.585 --> 00:01:07.710
MALE SPEAKER: I specifically use
Calendar dealing with our

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.270
college television station.

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:12.720
On our interview show, we use
Calendar to bring tons of

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.420
guest onto the show, and we use
the calendar to book them.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.490
That way, all of the student
producers can be on the same

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.350
page, and they can all edit
the same calendar, and it

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.290
really helps.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.960
FEMALE SPEAKER: My roommates
and I all share the Google

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.510
Calendar, so we know where
everyone is at any given time.

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.060
MALE SPEAKER: I'm a music
industry major, and one of our

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.260
artists is out on
tour right now.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.280
I can throw dates into Google
Calendar, tell him exactly

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.780
where he's supposed to
be the next night.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.430
We keep all of our different
shows separate from our radio

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.475
dates, and it's easy to tell
what's going on by colors.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.070
MALE SPEAKER: I've been
using Gmail since the

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:47.374
second day it came out.

00:01:47.374 --> 00:01:49.110
I'm an old-school user.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.700
MALE SPEAKER: The conversations
are the best

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.570
with a professor.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.270
You don't have to keep tracing
back where your email is from.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.940
It has all my contacts
ever saved.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.930
Just type in search, and
every person comes up.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.800
MALE SPEAKER: A lot of the other
email accounts that I've

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.890
had kind of got filled
really quickly.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.010
If I wanted to save something or
archive something, it just

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.120
wasn't feasible, especially with
all the class projects

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.699
that I have.

00:02:09.699 --> 00:02:12.610
When I started using Gmail, if
I ever needed anything, I

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:13.320
could just search for it.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:14.780
So I could archive it and
not think about it,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.350
and it would be fine.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:16.920
MALE SPEAKER: They make
everything easy and

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.930
integrated.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:19.830
MALE SPEAKER: It just makes
for a really seamless

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.790
experience.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.640
MALE SPEAKER: My whole life
is on that thing.

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.740
MALE SPEAKER: Google gave me the
tools, and I figured out

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.990
how to use them.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:31.310
VIVIAN LEUNG: Do you have
your own story about

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:32.010
using Google Apps?
