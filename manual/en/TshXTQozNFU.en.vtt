00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:04.980
In this tutorial I'm going to walk you through
the process of creating a blur effect in Flash.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.959
I have a simple scene with a bouncing basketball
character, and I want to improve it by blurring

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:17.970
his shadow and by adding a motion blur effect
behind the character when he is moving quickly.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.480
First, select the object you want to blur.
I'll start with his shadow.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:38.180
Now, convert the object into a symbol and
give it a name.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.640
This next part is important. Make sure the
"type" option for your symbol is set to Movie

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.390
Clip. The filter options won't be available
if you make it a graphic!

00:00:46.390 --> 00:01:05.040
Now that your object is a movie clip, make
sure it's selected and find your Filters panel.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.080
This might be a bit difficult to find!

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.720
I'm using Flash CS5, so the filters panel
shows up in the properties tab. In earlier

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.630
versions of Flash, you need to manually enable
it, by going to the Window menu and enabling

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:19.720
the Filters panel.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.230
Now that you have your filters panel enabled
and your object selected, click the "new filter"

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:30.520
button in the lower left of the Filters panel.
It has the same icon as the "new layer" button

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.120
in the Timeline panel.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.130
You can't see it in this video, but a menu
will pop up. From this menu, select the Blur

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.229
option. This will add a blur filter to the
movie clip.

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.010
Now it's time to adjust the blur settings.
You can blur objects either horizontally or

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.360
vertically, or a combination of both. Since
the shadow is in perspective, I'm going to

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.080
blur it more horizontally than vertically.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.780
The quality setting lets you make the blur
softer, but Flash runs more slowly when you

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.729
use high quality blur. I recommend low or
medium quality for most things.

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.039
Next I'm going to add the motion blur for
the character.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.029
You can apply blur to drawings, symbols, or
images. The only thing that matters is that

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:17.370
they are symbolized as a movie clip.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.120
Again, convert the object into a symbol.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.420
Give it a name and make sure its type is set
to Movie Clip.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.819
Find your filters panel, either in the properties
tab in CS5, or from the Window menu in earlier

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.109
versions. Add a blur effect, and blur it in
the direction of the motion.

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:39.180
I'm going to speed this next part up as I
fumble with the keyframes.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:44.599
Next, I'm going to animate the blur's alpha.
This will let you make your symbol more transparent.

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:50.040
It's the same as the Opacity setting in Photoshop.
I'm going to use this to fade the motion blur

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.019
in and out.

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.260
In your properties panel, there should be
a section labeled color effect. Select Alpha

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.889
as the style.

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:06.499
You can key frame the alpha effect, the same
way you do with an object's motion. Create

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:11.389
your motion tween, then set the alpha value
at each keyframe.

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:24.659
The alpha effect is useful for effects such
as cross-dissolves.

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.120
You can also keyframe the amount of blur in
the same way. I'm going to use this to make

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.790
the shadow sharper when the ball is near the
ground, and softer when he is in the air.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:41.040
I also key framed the alpha value, so that
the shadow becomes more translucent.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.099
Here's the finished result!
