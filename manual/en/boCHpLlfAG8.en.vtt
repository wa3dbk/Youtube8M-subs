00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.260
Nothing is known of Enigma's background.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:29.410
There are only stories and legends, most of
them apocryphal, passed down through the ages.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.520
In truth, Enigma is a mystery for whom the
only true biography is description: he is

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.850
a universal force, a consumer of worlds.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:42.781
He is a being of the void, at times corporeal,
other times ethereal.

00:00:42.781 --> 00:00:48.250
A beast between the planes, older than the
time itself.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.390
A beast aimlessly wandering through the endless
universe, feeding on galaxies and planets.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:03.490
Some believe that Enigma was the first collapsed
star, become sentient, a black hole of nothingness.

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.710
Some even say it is a traveller from another
dimension where our space is just a drop in

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.890
the ocean where matter is a hated thing, only
an energy that feeds the enigma and its kind.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.120
It could be that the enigma was banished from
its home, cursed or even lost, now trying

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.180
to find its way back using this dimensions
energy for power.

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.689
What ever the reason, we only know of its
destructive and merciless nature.

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.060
It is safe to assume that every time one sees
a dying star in the night sky the enigma was

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.219
present consuming its energy growing ever
more dangerous.

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:42.729
Other legends speak of a great Alchemist of
the old times, searching for the deepest secrets

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.689
of the universe and was cursed for such arrogance.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.690
Many people blindly hope that this is the
truth, for this truth is easier to accept.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.210
It spreads less fear.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.369
If the Enigma was once like us, an ordinary
human being trying to find the answers, why

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.520
would it destroy galaxies and worlds?

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.880
People like to believe the easy answers and
most do.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.440
However there are those that know the truth
and push through the fog of apathy.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.600
They warn that the problems wont go away and
trying to avoid them wont help.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.319
The enigma is coming.

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.950
The enigma is coming here, and even if every
living soul on our planet makes the ultimate

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.569
sacrifice the enigma will brush over us, hardly
hindered.

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:26.931
The only thing we can do is hope and have
faith.

00:02:26.931 --> 00:02:31.180
Faith that the enigma will never find our
small world.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:37.750
But will that be enough?

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.780
But how to explain the enigmas actions?

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.370
Does it feel hatred to the universe that created
it?

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.390
The universe that began the enigmas meaningless
life.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:51.659
Once it has consumed the myriad of planets
and stars in the universe what will be left?

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:57.180
The most powerful being in our dimension,
but the ruler of a wasteland of nothingness.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.610
The enigma will be alone.

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.909
Or will he?

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:04.200
After consuming everything, will he truely
be, alone?

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:06.819
Is our limited comprehension of the being
betraying us?

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.290
How can we understand a presence that has
existed since the beginning of this dimensions

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.290
time.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.239
In any case, our stories and hopes do not
affect the enigma on its quest to consume

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:18.760
worlds.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.140
Even as we speak, there are stars dying and
imploding, making it even more powerful.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:28.280
Millions of living souls are being silenced
every hour by this star consumer.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.720
So be wary and watch carefully.

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.640
When there is a clear night sky, look for
the dying stars.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:37.099
If some vanish it means it is here.

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:43.819
And if it is, it's already too late.

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.310
It won't stop as long as there are stars and
planets left and when all you can see on the

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.000
night sky is the black void of nothingness
it will steal your sun and the blackness will

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.950
consume your planet.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.060
There is nothing that can be done, but to
hope that your own star is not shining too

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.000
bright to draw its attention.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.099
But one day, it will, and the enigma will
pay your planet a visit.

00:04:05.099 --> 00:04:07.359
And you will feel the consuming power of the
black hole.

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:10.989
You will feel the fear and terror within you
as you are petryfied.

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:12.980
unable to move or scream.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:23.420
Once this day comes, you will only be able
to close your eyes and embrace your death.
