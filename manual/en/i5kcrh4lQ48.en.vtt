Hello, I’m Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:04.370
[pause]

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.049
and welcome to DermTV.

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.910
Most of us experience a blister at one point
or another. Blisters usually

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.090
occur either from burns or from rubbing. The
ones from burns are usually on

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.130
our fingers or our hand or our arm because
often they come from cooking,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.989
the ones from rubbing are usually either from
shoes or athletic equipment.

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:30.479
Bottom line is if you do nothing for a blister,
of course it’s going to

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:35.050
heal but by not treating it you increase the
chances of an infection and it

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.390
takes longer to heal. If you don’t treat
it over a period of time it dries

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.719
out, the skin breaks, settles down you get
a scab or a crust but again

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.960
allowing that to happen increases the chances
of infection and the amount

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.039
of time it takes and if you treat the blister
properly you decrease both of

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:58.399
those. So, it really doesn’t take four years
of medical education to treat

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.199
a blister but there are certain steps you
should follow. First of all get a

00:01:03.199 --> 00:01:07.450
good skin disinfectant like Hibiclens, available
without a prescription and

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.750
gently but thoroughly disinfect and cleanse
the area where the blister is.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.600
In this case were going to assume that the
blisters on the back of my hand,

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.909
so you would disinfect around it and then
on the top. Then take some

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.740
alcohol, and this is 70% rubbing alcohol,
Isopropyl, and that’s what’s

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.229
usually available in your pharmacy. Take some
on a cotton pad or a cotton

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:34.869
puff and gently again, cleanse and disinfect
around the blister and then

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:40.840
gently over the roof of the blister. Third,
take a needle, most of us use a

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.659
sewing needle, and the needle needs to be
sterilized you can either boil it

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.259
in water for five minutes or you can put the
very tip in a flame like in

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.930
the stove, for 3 or 4 minutes until it turns
red hot and then it’s

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.700
sterilized but of course please be careful
when sterilizing the needle to

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.750
make sure that you don’t burn yourself.
Next, you want to take the needle

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.770
and puncture the very bottom of the blister.
Let’s assume that this is the

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.790
blister, you take the needle and by puncturing
it at the very bottom you

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.840
will allow for the blister fluid to run out
the bottom and the top skin,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.950
the dead skin, collapses flat down onto the
base. You don’t want to remove

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.970
the dead skin because it’s very valuable.
It serves as a very good, what we

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.390
call, biologic dressing, and it makes it heal
faster and helps to keep it

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.500
sterile. Next, take some antibiotic ointment,
this is bacitracin- you can

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.030
use polysporin or aquaphor healing ointment.
Don’t put the ointment in the

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.870
top of the blister, rather but the ointment
on a band-aid because if you

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.071
put it on the band-aid and then apply the
band-aid on top of the blister

00:02:48.071 --> 00:02:53.120
there’s less of a chance that you’ll rub
off the top surface of that dead

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.000
skin which again we want to preserve. Change
the band-aid and apply new

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.310
ointment to a new band-aid three or four times
a day and that will both

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:05.700
speed the healing of the blister as well as
helping to prevent and

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.280
infection.
