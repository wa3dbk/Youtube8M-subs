00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.771
Hey what's up guys, I'm Justin from AmericanMuscle.com,
and this is our appearance bolt on build up

00:00:13.771 --> 00:00:16.780
for all 05-09 Mustang GTs.

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.060
The idea with this build up was to take our
stock 07 GT, pick out some of our favorite

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.700
appearance parts, as well as some top rated
customer picks, and combine them to form the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.220
ultimate appearance package, to totally transform
our GT.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.230
Some of these parts include a new set of AM
wheels, some styling parts from MMD, some

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.340
AmericanMuscle graphics, and some new lighting
from Raxiom to name a few.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.370
It's safe to say any one of these mods would
be a welcome addition to any 05-09 GT, and

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.090
for a complete list of mods used check out
the bolt on built up page for 05-09 GTs.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.440
But there are a few parts that we think really
set this ride off, and completely change the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.940
attitude so let's check them out.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.170
So up front we went ahead and installed these
really cool Raxiom pre-painted bucket lights,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.740
these lights really compliment that cool retro
60's vibe of these 05-09 Mustangs.

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.740
They even took it a step further with these
pre-painted buckets.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.180
As you can see behind me on this pre-painted
GT, they really flow well with the lines of

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.180
this car.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.800
The install itself isn't too bad, it should
only take you about an hour, and that's only

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.920
because you have to pop the front bumper off.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.080
After that they're completely plug and play.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.430
These are one of our favorite appearance parts
and are also a top rated customer part as

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.430
well.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.760
Next thing I want to hit is one of the easiest
ways to completely change the look of your

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.610
car, without paint.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.970
We put on a set of these matte black AmericanMuscle
graphics lemans stripes, to really give us

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:39.300
that race car look.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.880
You've probably seen these race stripes on
just about every car you can think of, and

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.770
I think you'll agree with me when I say they
look right at home here on our Mustang.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:53.130
One of the coolest dress up parts on our Mustang
GT has to me these MMD retro style mirrors.

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.280
These mirrors are a total throwback to the
60's and 70's Mach 1, and feature that really

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.130
cool Bullitt shape, that flows extremely well
with some of our other retro parts on this

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.130
car.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.530
The mirrors are available in an unpainted
black finish which looks great on its own,

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.479
or a pre-painted options like our torch red
here.

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.920
As for the install itself, you need to transfer
the mirror motors and the harness over to

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.689
the new housing, but after that it's a piece
of cake, should only take you about an hour.

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:18.870
Alright, we saved the best part for last.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.100
We've got a whole new set of staggered deep
dish Bullitt wheels with an 18x9 up front,

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.510
and an 18x10 out the back.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.170
This is probably one of the coolest Mustang
wheels of all time, and is by far and away

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.740
our most popular wheel and setup here on the
site.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:36.750
That staggered look combined with the deep
dish option, is a real final compliment to

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.080
the aggressive lines of this car.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.290
Doesn't get any more retro than that.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.020
With this bolt on build ups the goal was to
take a pack of appearance parts that would

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:49.680
take any 05-09 GT to the next level, by putting
all these parts on our stock looking 07 GT,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.510
we were able to really nail that retro vibe.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.459
The best part is, these parts can be installed
by anyone, in the comforts of your own garage.

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.800
Be sure to check out some of our other 05-09
bolt on build ups where we tackle the handling,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.219
help give our GT more power and help get it
off the line.
