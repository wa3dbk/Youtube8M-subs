Hi, today I'm going to show you how
you change the cabin filter in a Mercedes

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.610
C class. I will also change the hood

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.670
emblem because it has been broken off
again. I will show that in another video.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.710
I have chosen the BOSCH filter because I
think the they fit very well

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.220
and I think they might be the original
equipment

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.780
manufacturer, but I'm not sure. First

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:33.780
open the hood.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.750
The air filter is located here.
Start by

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:54.750
loosening these three clips

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.710
and now you can take it away.

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.000
Now you remove the old filter from the
housing

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.429
Now we refit the filter housing. These lips,

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:09.429
they will go in here,

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.959
like this, and then you close

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:22.079
the retaining clips.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.030
Now you're all set. Thanks for watching.
