00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:04.000
Let's talk about why you're not as hungry

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.620
as you maybe were before you started doing
the P90X Nutrition Plan.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.540
Hey guys, it's Dave and today I wanna talk
about a really common question

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.880
I get from a lot of my customers.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:18.000
So, let me kind of set up the background scenario first

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.100
and then I'll get to the question

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.620
and then some of the reasons why I think some of that stuff's happening.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.690
So, scenario is, you've got somebody who is
30 or more ponds overweight;

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.540
let's just say 250 pounds, OK?

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.580
And, they contact me and say "I've been doing P90X for

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:39.539
a week, maybe 2 weeks and I'm following the
nutrition guide

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:44.439
and I'm really doing my best to, you know,
do everything I'm supposed to do

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.201
AND eat all this food.

00:00:46.201 --> 00:00:51.439
The problem is - it's too much food. I cannot
eat all this food."

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.940
So, let's talk about this a little bit because
I think this is the common

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.000
issue that people have.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.520
And I understand the motivation behind it because

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.810
people want to do what's required in order
to get results.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.241
So, they read in the book

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.610
"This is how much food you need to eat and
this is what you've got to do"

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:09.329
and so they're doing it and they're thinking

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:12.849
"If I can't eat all this food, I'm not gonna
get the results I want."

00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:15.009
So, let's go through it a little bit.

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:20.140
OK, so if you're 250 pounds and P90X Nutrition
Guide suggests 36000 calories, okay?

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.820
That's a suggestion.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.480
Everybody should be working with a coach

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.359
to make sure you've got the 
right calorie number for you.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.860
That number is also not 
designed to encourage weight loss;

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:34.420
it's really a number that's designed to have
you avoid any sort of calorie deficit.

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:37.209
So, you need to be working with a coach to make sure

00:01:37.209 --> 00:01:39.000
first of all, that you've got the calorie number right,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.090
'cause you may just be eating too much food.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.231
That's why you can't eat all the food, because
it's just simply too much.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.150
So, work with a coach; if you want to work
with me, I'm totally open to that.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.010
My email's here on the screen.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:56.920
Now, the other thing that happens is it's
the type of foods you're eating, okay?

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.340
And I think this is really more than the calorie
number being right, because the thing I know

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.800
is that if you're 250 pounds and that happens
to be 30 to 50 pounds overweight,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.480
again if you're really, really tall and you're
250; you know if you're Shaking

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:10.990
and you're 250 - it's different deal.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.330
But, for most people, let's say you're 250
pounds, what I know

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.530
is you've been eating 36000 calories a day.
I mean, that's just the truth.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.350
BUT, what you've probably been eating and
when I start to dig down

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.170
with most of the people who ask these questions,

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.240
and I start to figure out "Okay well, talk
to me about what your diet was before,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.840
because I know what it's like now, if you
tell me you're following the phase I of P90X

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.050
Nutrition Guide - I know you're on a

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.350
high-protein, moderate fat, low-carb plan."

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:43.230
Most of the people that I talk to are telling
me that this is just too much food.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.820
We're on a very high-carb hydrate,

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:52.730
fairly low protein, fairly low fat diet; most
of the food are coming from carbs.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.880
So, that's where this all makes perfect sense.
So, there's a little bit of science behind

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.760
why that's the case,

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.810
but essentially without getting into all the
hormonal break-down of everything...

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.380
Your body has a switch that goes off, okay?
And the switch says

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:10.780
"Stop eating now, because you're full. You
don't have to eat anymore."

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.920
It's called your safety signal signal, okay?

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:18.580
And foods, that are high on protein, high
in fat trigger that signal very quickly.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:26.160
Carbs, in particular, you know, kinda junky,
high-glycemic index carbs, like sugars and

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.740
chips and white bread and all that type of
junk - that... those types of foods don't

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:34.090
trigger your safety signal.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:36.470
You know what else doesn't trigger it - soda.

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.190
64-ounce soda; think about how many calories
are in a 64-ounce soda.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:43.580
Most people are just drinking those calories;
they don't even realize they're taking them in

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:47.330
and the body doesn't ever have a chance to
say "Woah, okay! I'm full now!"

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:52.420
Like it does when you eat a diet that is higher
in protein and higher in fat,

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.760
which is exactly what the P90X Nutrition Guide
provides for you.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:58.440
Phase I is a very low-carb plan.

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.730
Sort of position as a high-protein plan, but
it's actually really low-carb plan.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:06.820
And there is a whole host of reasons for that
and I've got another video that

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.280
explains why BeachBody decided to do that;
it's actually really

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.300
just mentioning science behind that as well.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:15.619
But, what happens to people when they start
doing Phase I

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.700
is they start eating foods that trigger to
their body "I'm full. Stop eating."

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.869
And that maybe... that's totally different
than what they were doing before.

00:04:23.869 --> 00:04:29.460
So, what I always tell people and what I do
generally - I don't count calories anymore

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.970
I kinda know how many calories are in the
food that I'm eating.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.670
On days that I have big, long workouts, I
eat more food and I am really intentional

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:39.740
about fueling up for those workouts.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:41.930
But, as a general rule

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.590
when I'm hungry I eat food.

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.170
When I am satisfied - I stop eating the food.

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:51.270
Okay? If that means there's food left on my plate,

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:54.180
that means there's food left on my plate, OK?

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.590
So, I'm not stuffing myself; there is a difference
between being satisfied and full.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.190
If you're eating to the point where you're
full or you feel like urgh!, you know,

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:04.640
your belly hurts 'cause you've eaten so much,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.849
you're eating too much food.

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:09.739
I can almost universally tell you - you're
eating too much food or

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:11.450
you're eating too much food at one time,

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:15.910
you know spacing meals out is another thing
that has been effective for me.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.080
I don't necessarily think you have to eat,
you know, 5 or 6 meals a day.

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.120
What I do think you wanna do though is eat
when you're hungry

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:25.390
and stop when you're satisfied, okay?

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.990
And that's really good rule of thumb, so again
a couple of things:

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.190
One, make sure your calorie count is right;
make sure you're working with somebody who

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:35.140
can help you dial that number in.

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:38.940
Also, make sure that the person you're working
with is gonna keep working with you

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.480
because as your weight changes, your calorie
numbers are gonna change.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:44.670
At some point your weight might plato.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.160
One of the easiest ways to get out of a plato

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:50.280
with weight loss is to start staggering calories

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:52.510
and start doing some different things with
your calorie intake.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.090
So, make sure you are working with someone
who understands all that stuff

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.130
and can help you through that process.

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:00.110
And then, look at the types of different foods
you're eating

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:03.700
and make a mental note, I will tell you that
if you have...

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:07.660
If you've had an avocado, right, nice-lot-a-fat-in-it
avocado, you have an avocado

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:09.080
to almost any meal,

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:13.960
you will feel full quicker, than if you don't
have that extra little bit of fat on your plate.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.400
So, just another tip from me to you, I hope
you guys find this information helpful

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:20.260
and again contact me with any questions.

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.500
I am happy to help you sort all this stuff out

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:23.500
and I hope you have a great day.
