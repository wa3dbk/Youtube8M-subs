Hi I am Jigna Mehta. I am a mehndi artist.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.880
 I am going to show you different mehndi designs.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.100
This is the arabic design I am doing on her hand

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:28.600
The arabic design always covers one finger with little bit of thicker design

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:36.400
This can be done in 10 mins

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.460
In Arabic design the colour comes darker because the mehndi design is little thicker

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:54.060
This goes to a single finger. It doesn't cover all fingers.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:05.920
An arabic design can be done anytime - if going for a party or wedding
