00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:06.279
1920's attire for men. Oh, we have Trevor
here sporting a great every day look of the

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.190
1920's. I'd like to point out a few things.
The golf caps, which you can use a modern

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.170
day golf cap and no one is really going to
know the difference. But I do want you to

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.740
notice that the style was a little bit bigger
in the cap for the 1920's. So, if you do have

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.500
a fatter cap, a golfer style cap hat, I would
suggest wearing something like that. It is

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.420
going to be a little bit more period and if
you have the choice, take it. You will also

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.040
notice that he has the matching vest and pants
on. I suggest trying to do a matching set.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:41.300
Most of your suits of the time period were
of matching sets. Though, do feel free to

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.310
wear a pair of plain slacks with a printed
vest and that will be alright as well. But

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:52.079
if you can do matching sets, that's a better
way to go. Also, take note of the printed

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:58.489
tie. Try to give yourself a printed tie. Very
often they have lots of prints in their ties,

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:04.379
their pocket scarves, their socks and anywhere
else they could stick some prints. As far

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:09.130
as other details, you could add a pocket chain
to this attire and that would be a fun look.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.310
You will want to notice that there are no
pleats on the pants and that you have a firm

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.070
seam down the front. You can choose either
to do a cuff or no cuff on the pant and you

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.330
will want to take note of the two tone shoes.
If you don't have anything two tone like this,

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.369
you will want to maybe perhaps add a spat.
Those can be easily made or even fudged and

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:35.680
hot glued together for a fun two tone look
if you don't have any shoes that look remotely

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.380
close to the period style. That spat will
take any shoe, particularly a tuxedo shoe

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.590
or what not and make it period for you. Try
to stick with your curved toe shoes, nothing

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:55.549
overly square or large healed. If you wanted
to take this look and do more of a knicker

00:01:55.549 --> 00:02:02.210
style or let's say you wanted to go as a 1920's
director. You could very easily take the men's

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:15.200
pants, pull them up to where the calf is and
just simply with a fold in, and if you wanted

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.859
to, you could close it off with a piece of
blue screen ribbon or elastic, for a quick

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:25.150
fix. If nothing else, just a simple safety
pin up and underneath. Definitely adding a

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.919
fun sock, either striped or argyle, whatever
it is you have around, to give yourself a

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:37.720
nice knicker pants look. Other accessory pieces
for the 1920's fellow besides the tie is a

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.290
bow tie. Once again, don't be afraid of prints,
those are all great. You will also think about

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.930
perhaps, suspenders. Those are another good
look for the 1920's fellow as well. There

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.480
are also very many hat options to choose from
besides the golfer cap. Just to show you a

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.480
few. The Godfather style, made very popular
by Al Capone, as well the bowler, that's always

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.779
a great look. And the fedora, you can't go
wrong with one of these guys. Maybe a little

00:03:07.779 --> 00:03:14.530
detail on the side is a good add-in as well
to bring some color out. Always easiest to

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.439
borrow a hat from someone. Too small, not
much I can do for you. But, if it is too big,

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:27.231
just a quick trick. Make a little fan out
of paper towels there, and you will always

00:03:27.231 --> 00:03:32.019
have a little edge, just pop that puppy right
up underneath the edge there and that will

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:39.269
be a quick size down to fit any head. A more
formal 1920's attire look other than the vest,

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.689
suspender shirt look, is to put the three
piece suit together. Adding the jacket over

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:50.609
the vest and giving it a much more formal
look. This is great with the bowler hat or

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:56.849
fedora. I want you to know that there are
great looks from 1920's for hair. First thing

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:01.369
is, is that the gel was very thick back then.
So make sure you have a nice thick goopy gel

00:04:01.369 --> 00:04:07.669
really plastered in there to get it nice and
heavy weighted, as such. The most important

00:04:07.669 --> 00:04:14.239
thing to a 1920's mens hair is to give it
a very hard side part. Come way over to the

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:21.069
side giving yourself a very solid part. From
there, it is up to you as to what you want

00:04:21.069 --> 00:04:28.319
to do. Very often they had the little tufts
in the front there. Sometimes just pushing

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:33.900
it completely forward and flat, sometimes
pushing it to the back. Regardless, always,

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:39.509
always the hard side part. So, if you don't
have a hat to choose from perhaps a 1920's

00:04:39.509 --> 00:04:46.169
hairstyle is a better option for you. As well,
fun things, paper clips with loads of money,

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:52.250
tipping away. Cigars and flasks, all wonderful
accessories to add to a 1920's attire.
