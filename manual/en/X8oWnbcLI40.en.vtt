00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:14.260
Squids and octopods, also known as cephalopods,
use an intriguing variety of feeding strategies

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.180
to pursue and capture food.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.520
What they all have in common though, is the
fact that they hunt for living prey.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:27.340
This paradigm has recently shifted with a
discovery by scientists at the Monterey Bay

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:33.829
Aquarium Research Institute (MBARI), who studied
the feeding habits and behavior of the elusive

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:35.510
vampire squid.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:41.940
The vampire squid is an ancient animal that
shares characteristics with both squids and

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.120
octopods.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.870
Vampire squid have eight arms, two long filaments
and a cloak-like web, but they lack the feeding

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.750
tentacles used by many squid for capturing
prey.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.660
When disturbed they wrap their arms around
their body exposing rows of spiny looking

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.370
projections, and drastically changing their
appearance.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:09.320
Their scientific name, Vampyroteuthis infernalis,
was given to them more than a century ago.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:15.439
In all that time no one knew exactly what
or how the vampire squid eats, until surprising

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:22.280
details on their feeding were revealed in
a paper by MBARI researchers.

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:28.119
Using remotely operated vehicles, over the
past 25 years, MBARI has observed nearly 200

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.009
individual vampire squid in their natural
ocean habitat.

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:39.009
Vampire squid were frequently observed drifting
motionlessly, with their fins gently undulating,

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.310
and one of their two filaments extended.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:47.869
The function of these long, retractile filaments
has puzzled marine biologists for years.

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.829
During feeding experiments in the lab back
on shore, food particles were found to adhere

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:58.719
to the filament and vampire squid were observed
repeatedly drawing a food-covered filament

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:04.600
between their arms, removing particles, and
depositing them near their mouths.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:10.979
Stiff, microscopic hairs on the filament likely
function to secure particles, while a layer

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.660
of sensory cells may signal the presence of
food to the brain.

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.330
After drawing the filament between their arms,
the food is wrapped in mucus secreted from

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:27.209
glands in the suckers, then finger-like projections
called cirri move the resulting mass towards

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.459
the mouth.

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.350
In their natural environment, marine snow,
or sinking organic particles, were found on

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:39.700
the squids’ filaments, arms, or in their
mouth.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.709
Ingestion of marine snow aggregates was further
confirmed by examination of the stomach contents

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.739
of animals from museum collections.

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:54.650
The ingestion of non-living food is unknown
for any other cephalopod.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.730
Vampire squid are typically observed at depths
with very low levels of oxygen, also known

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.319
as oxygen minimum zones.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.019
Most other animals become stressed or die
in the extreme oxygen conditions found in

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.959
these regions.

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:15.330
However, vampire squid have developed several
adaptations that enable them to live successfully

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.890
where there is little oxygen.

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:23.620
The dark appearance of vampire squids reduces
their visibility to predators and therefore

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.099
the need for rapid escape.

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:32.770
They also have several types of bioluminescent
display, which may deter predators.

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:37.530
Vampire squid are neutrally buoyant and they
have very low metabolic rates.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.599
All these adaptations reduce the need for
investment in muscle tissue for locomotion,

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.299
and save energy.

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:51.489
The vampire squid’s remarkable ability to
feed as a passive detritivore sets them apart

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:56.670
from other cephalopods and gives them yet
another energy-conserving advantage for a

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.690
life in the oxygen minimum zone.

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.249
This hostile environment supports few animals,
but aggregates of marine snow sinking from

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:08.560
the water above are plentiful.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.549
Using its many unique adaptations, the vampire
squid thrives in the center of the oxygen

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:25.349
minimum zone, where its food source is abundant,
and predators are few.
