00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:06.460
I was a young black male, 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.160
just recently released from prison.  There's not a lot of people that's gonna hire me.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.029
When I filed for divorce I found myself
basically out of a job as well because I worked

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:17.190
for the family business

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.340
When I hit my chin...I threw my neck back...
and

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.290
next thing I knew I was a C5 quadriplegic.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.680
I found myself in a position that I was
looking for employment

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.460
and um

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.610
I was at an age where is pretty scary

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.400
to be really honest with you.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:46.900
I came from a rough lifestyle. I mean, my mom was a crackhead. Pops was absentee and wasn't there for me. So I grew up basically, in the streets.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.100
What changed in my life is that by me moving to Milwaukee and a new state and new environment, 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.350
I knew I can do better than what I was
doing.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.960
When you see our billboards in your
local neighborhoods that say when you donate

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.600
we train people work that's really what
Goodwill is all about.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.990
When people think of Goodwill they most
often think about our Goodwill Store and

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.300
Donations Centers and that's very
important because it is our economic

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.980
engine.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.549
When you donate and you shop at Goodwill the income is then invested in our training

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.360
programs and employment opportunities
for individuals that are disadvantaged

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.229
disabled

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.600
or they may be dislocated workers.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.080
We serve people from all walks of life
you don't have to be referred to us

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.600
it doesn't matter what your income level
if you're seeking training or a job

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.250
you can come to a Workforce Connection
Center we'll help you with your resume

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.619
we'll help you with your interviews but
more importantly we can connect you with

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.409
employers.

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:55.890
Being unemployed is, is scary, and I think
when you surround yourself with people

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.070
that are upbeat

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.479
and all solution-driven and creative
in ways on how you can get out of

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.500
this dilemma, that's very uplifting.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.950
Going to Goodwill, provided me with resume writing skills, the

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.250
practice interviews, all, all the little essential 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.160
things that they did for me help bring

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:18.540
confidence to who I am.  Goodwill gave me a chance

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.800
by giving me skills that I already had

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.160
but they...they brought them out more.  If you think you don't have the

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.880
skills

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.590
the find them in you.  It was a godsend for me. They give you able to have skills to work

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:36.510
at retail period.  And I didn't have a
medical background no medical

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.690
training whatsoever other than what I
took in high school

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.400
the lessons learned there were phenomenal.  

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.110
Goodwill Great Lakes is very
important to our organization

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.830
and our mission.  I say Great Lakes...a great job
for you

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:58.000
if you're looking for a great job and good
pay too.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.930
We operate the Navy's largest
foodservice operation. We provide

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:04.860
janitorial,

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.350
administrative, laundry and an array of
logistic services.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.450
I serve...I do beverage. I tell them to have a great dinner.

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.600
Yup, I'm really happy about my job

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.340
Cafe 1919 is probably one of the leading
foodservice operations

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:27.849
in southeastern Wisconsin for anyone who
is seeking to be trained

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.859
in food service.  The culinary program, it's like 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:34.379
one of the best experiences that I had because

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:38.150
I met some, a lot of individuals that really liked showed that they cared for me.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:41.480
It was the most greatest thing that happened to me

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.900
besides my kids. I met people that I never thought I'd meet.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.700
In and out of the streets, I never had nothing that I could depend on, or had nobody that really showed me

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.319
that they was

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.930
dedicated at helping me to succeed.  Just to have somebody, you know, 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.310
not so much hold your hand but to

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:04.169
provide direction is something that I
could not replace.

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:08.219
And I don't know if I could have found that anywhere else. And I would have to say every time I

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:09.079
left the

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.650
Workforce Connection Center I did have an
uplifting

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.669
feeling and, and, felt positive

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:21.840
about what might happen in the future. I
didn't give up. People around me didn't

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:25.260
let me give up, cuz they seen something in me that I didn't see.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:30.200
And I love them people for that.

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.670
Goodwill's mission is more than the
programs and services that we offer.

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:42.240
For me, it's really about real names,
faces,

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.100
and life stories. When you work at Goodwill you come to work every day and you

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:49.450
get to see lives transformed you see
confidence develop,

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:54.640
you see problem-solving occur, you see
the dignity that comes from work.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.650
Goodwill is all about a hand up and not
a handout.

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:00.880
As a quadriplegic, one of the things you 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.750
struggle with is independence

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:04.890
And let me tell you

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:07.759
a job

00:05:07.759 --> 00:05:11.720
is that independence. A job means a lot
to me,

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:15.550
because like I said I hadn't worked in
while.  And now

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:17.030
I can

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.150
have my own responsibilities. Because I'm
working

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.780
and because all the people that have touched
me along the way to help me get to this

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:25.280
spot, I'm

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:26.550
hopefully

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.180
reflecting all the good things that they've passed on to me.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.700
They was there when no one else was. I
didn't have a way to work, Goodwill provided that.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.100
Goodwill showed me a lot of love. I will always come back to Goodwill.

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.710
To be able to take care of myself, earn a living. Go out and buy my own groceries,

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.420
pay my rent, those are things that

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.480
help me live a good life.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:56.210
You have money and you buy your own
stuff and

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:58.660
do stuff

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.910
that you want to do with your own money. I remember the first time I got my first paycheck.

00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:07.100
What did you do with your first paycheck?

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.180
I brought my mom and my dad out to dinner. 

00:06:12.180 --> 00:06:13.620
I went from

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:16.830
from streets to like being people that
make a difference in life.

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:21.280
it gave me the opportunity to be good at
what I do and

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:25.170
to show my kids that hard work pays off
that

00:06:25.170 --> 00:06:28.930
you can do anything, with the right training
the right attitude

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.639
you can do anything. I don't want to be back on the streets I don't want to be homeless.

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:36.210
That's why I learned all these skills through the Goodwill

00:06:36.210 --> 00:06:39.840
and I was using them on a daily basis.  My newfound independence

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:43.870
mean to me that I can be in my son's life

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:49.270
and be in my family's life...

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:51.710
and be a better me.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:55.969
I would say, Goodwill

00:06:55.969 --> 00:06:58.610
they kinda, they kinda saved me.

00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:02.600
They kinda saved me.

00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:13.800
