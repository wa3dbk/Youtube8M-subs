00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:14.890
FEMALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.880
So, my stylist asked me
what I wanted to wear.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.680
She pulled this lovely bodysuit
and leggings.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.360
And I was like, you know
what, we got to keep it

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.210
futuristic, you know.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.070
And I said, you know what,
I want to wear a cone.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.894
You know the cones that dogs
wear around their head?

00:00:30.894 --> 00:00:31.850
And she said, really?

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:32.650
A dog cone?

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.515
I said yes.

00:00:33.515 --> 00:00:35.596
And she said, I love it.

00:00:35.596 --> 00:00:37.930
Because my stylists are very
daring themselves.

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.480
They love their job, and
they love what they do.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.862
So we come up with
a greatness.

00:00:43.862 --> 00:00:46.267
ICONIC BOYZ 1: We're dancing
to Kanye West.

00:00:46.267 --> 00:00:47.060
I.AM.ME 1: Kanye West.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.930
I.AM.ME 2:Kanye West.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.420
Sweet.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.368
ICONIC BOYZ 2: Our three songs
by Kanye tonight we're dancing

00:00:50.368 --> 00:00:54.512
to is "On Top of the World,"
"Love Lockdown," and "Gold

00:00:54.512 --> 00:00:54.760
Digger."

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:56.962
I.AM.ME 2: Yeah, it's
three songs in one--

00:00:56.962 --> 00:00:59.860
"Love Lockdown," "Gold Digger,"
and "Touch the Sky."

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.090
ICONIC BOYZ 1: They gave us for
each song a style to do.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:06.540
So I don't think it
was that hard.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.826
But it's going to be hard
because all the crews have the

00:01:08.826 --> 00:01:11.440
same song, just different
mixes.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.380
So we really have to give
it our all tonight.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.660
I.AM.ME 2: I think with us--

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.520
I think it's pretty natural
because the styles that were

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.200
chosen is somewhat what we
already do individually.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.950
So once we heard the challenges,
we were really

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:29.570
excited, so we know
how to click it.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.380
When each song comes on, we
can turn it on and off.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.050
FEMALE SPEAKER: The crew that
has the best chance of winning

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.500
this round tonight is
the ICONic Boyz,

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:39.703
period, hands down.

00:01:39.703 --> 00:01:41.675
Because they're my favorite.

00:01:41.675 --> 00:01:42.661
I don't know.

00:01:42.661 --> 00:01:45.710
You can call it biased.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.607
You can call it because they're
sweet, because they're

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:48.700
cute, because they're young.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.280
I believe that they are
extremely talented young kids

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.640
who are setting an example for
other young children all over

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.890
the globe starting
with America,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.370
and it makes me happy.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.768
ICONIC BOYZ 3: I think that
it's nerve-racking that we

00:02:05.768 --> 00:02:07.990
have to keep switching
in each song.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.531
But it's a lot better because we
get to do different styles

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:14.870
in one whole dance, and
it's fun to do.

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.922
I.AM.ME 1: This week
has really pushed

00:02:17.922 --> 00:02:19.510
us to our max, obviously.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.635
We've had to do a lot of work,
not only with this challenge,

00:02:22.635 --> 00:02:24.780
but with another challenge.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.670
So less sleep, but
we feel really

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:29.380
good right now, obviously.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.040
The stress is off, and
we're ready to go and

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.100
perform and go hard.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.750
I.AM.ME 2: No, it's just been
one of those crazy weeks where

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.940
you have to learn three routines
in four or five days.

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.490
So you don't really have much
time to clean or really think

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:44.160
about how your piece looks
until the day of.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.905
So we'll see what happens.

00:02:45.905 --> 00:02:50.214
ICONIC BOYZ 1: My dad helps
me whenever I'm nervous.

00:02:50.214 --> 00:02:51.693
He calms me down.

00:02:51.693 --> 00:02:57.280
And our dance teacher, Geo, he
helps the crew get ready, and

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.580
he calms us down, and
he prepares us.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.960
I.AM.ME 2: I'm nervous
and excited.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.600
I'm ready to get up,
just go for it.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.590
But right now, like I said,
you're still thinking about,

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.670
man, is it going to look good?

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.122
We didn't really clean
till last night.

00:03:12.122 --> 00:03:14.740
But it's one of those things.

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:16.030
I think we'll be OK though.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.870
Individually, we have our
moments to where we go to the

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.420
next person and we're
like, hey, chill.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.300
It's going to be OK.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:25.400
I know Philip tells us a lot,
like, all we have to do is

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.100
this and this, and we'll be
fine, So we listen to it, even

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.920
if we don't want to hear it.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.785
If it's like 4 o'clock in the
morning, we're like, come on

00:03:31.785 --> 00:03:33.430
man, let's just go.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.010
But we really take it in.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.080
And sometimes it helps to come
from some people from outside

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.880
to tell us, you know
you all got it.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.370
You'll all be OK.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.165
So that really helps
out a lot.

00:03:43.165 --> 00:03:44.320
PHUNK PHENOMENON: We are Phunk

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:46.180
Phenomenon, and you're watching--

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:48.300
I.AM.ME: Just Dance
on DanceOn.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.550
FEMALE SPEAKER: Thank you.
