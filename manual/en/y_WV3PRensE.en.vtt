00:00:04.467 --> 00:00:06.167
Greetings pilots!

00:00:06.267 --> 00:00:12.567
Today we will discuss with you the German tier VI fighter, the Bf 109F “Friedrich”.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:27.400
This aircraft is more advanced than the Bf 109E at tier V.

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:33.833
Even in its stock configuration, Friedrich outmatches its precursor greatly.

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:39.933
Its great altitude performance becomes even greater and its rate of climb improves drastically.

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:44.200
Initially, the 109F does not boast strong firepower.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.433
The only gun that is not a stock weapon is the 15mm autocannon inherited from the 109E.

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:55.600
However, persistence is rewarded as you will regain up to three 20mm autocannons,

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:58.467
which fire even faster and are more destructive.

00:00:58.567 --> 00:01:02.267
Greater firepower will reduce manoeuvrability characteristics, though.

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:05.500
This is due to the two wing autocannons becoming outboard weapons,

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.000
rather than internally wing-mounted like on the 109E.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.733
Because of this, the Friedrich loses a half second in a 360 turn in its top configuration compared to its top-configured precursor.

00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:19.133
Those are the differences between these two aircraft.

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:24.167
Now let’s compare the 109F with the other fighters at tier VI.

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:28.267
Durability - it’s simple, there are no other airframes to research.

00:01:28.367 --> 00:01:31.267
However, the Friedrich still has plenty of hit points.

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:36.900
Only three fighters – two American and the Focke-Wulf A-5 are more durable than the 109F.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.667
Regardless of its configuration, the 109F shows the best altitude performance.

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:46.600
Even American fighters, let alone aircraft of other nations, have trouble keeping up with it.

00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:50.067
Firepower is a different matter.

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:56.367
You can choose two different sets of weapons, each of them affecting the Friedrich’s speed greatly.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:01.100
The first option is a machine-gun setup with a single 15mm autocannon.

00:02:01.267 --> 00:02:06.600
Flying in this configuration, the 109F adds great speed to its excellent altitude performance.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.267
This allows Friedrich to compete with the P-51A and Yak-1M.

00:02:11.367 --> 00:02:17.633
However, you will have to close in with enemy aircraft and open fire at a very short range.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.633
The second option is completely opposite.

00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:28.233
Three rapid-fire 20mm autocannon give the Friedrich crushing firepower which is nearly as good as the Fw.190A.

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:33.533
However, speed characteristics will be considerably lower in this configuration.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.767
Manoeuvrability won’t be affected greatly by what weapons you choose.

00:02:37.867 --> 00:02:43.400
In both configurations, the Friedrich is slightly more manoeuvrable than the A-5 and American fighters,

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:47.067
but it loses in manoeuvrability to Japanese and Soviet fighters.

00:02:47.167 --> 00:02:50.300
Enough for comparison, let’s battle!

00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:56.500
If you are at the top of the list and consider all the characteristics of your aircraft,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.267
the best tactic is to play in “eagle style”.

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:02.600
You should climb to the highest optimum altitude,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:07.333
and then fly over the combat zone looking for the most assailable enemy aircraft.

00:03:08.833 --> 00:03:15.800
You should never try active manoeuvring combat because you will lose your entire speed advantage.

00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:21.600
The only exception are heavy fighters that you can counter at high altitude.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:26.933
The priority target list depends on the role of the 109F in the battle.

00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:29.900
You should try to take down high altitude adversaries first,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.767
then enemy aircraft that have greater speed.

00:03:32.867 --> 00:03:38.000
Manoeuvrable but slow aircraft should be the last on your priority list.

00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:43.767
Boom &amp; zoom tactics are the best choice for the Friedrich. Just don’t stay long at low altitude.

00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:48.400
You should either use your speed to break away from the group of enemy aircraft,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:51.933
or return to your optimum altitude immediately.

00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:56.700
Now a few words on how to oppose heavy fighters and attack aircraft.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.700
Despite the Friedrich’s powerful weapons, you should avoid head-on attacks.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.567
Some enemy aircraft may be equipped with very large calibre autocannons

00:04:05.667 --> 00:04:10.333
that cannot only hit your engine but destroy it with a single shot.

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:14.533
Occasionally, you will find yourself at the bottom of the list.

00:04:14.633 --> 00:04:19.167
But even then, the Friedrich is still able to show who the master of the sky is.

00:04:19.267 --> 00:04:23.467
You should stay close to your allies and avoid flying at very high altitudes.

00:04:23.567 --> 00:04:25.633
The Friedrich is a high-altitude aircraft,

00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:30.000
but there will be many other higher-tier aircraft in the battle as well.

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.900
Tactics will mainly remain the same.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.167
Always avoid head-on attacks!

00:04:36.567 --> 00:04:38.300
Let’s summarise:

00:04:40.033 --> 00:04:44.133
The Messerschmitt 109 series of aircraft differ considerably.

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:47.200
Each aircraft has its unique features and behaviour.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.900
So does the Bf 109F.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.833
Perhaps, some players will think of this aircraft as a pass-through at first,

00:04:53.933 --> 00:04:59.067
but later, good pilots will realise that the 109F is an all-around aircraft.

00:04:59.167 --> 00:05:04.067
You just need to choose the weapons preset that best suits your style of playing.

00:05:04.167 --> 00:05:05.567
Try and experiment.

00:05:05.667 --> 00:05:08.300
The Friedrich will help you with this.
