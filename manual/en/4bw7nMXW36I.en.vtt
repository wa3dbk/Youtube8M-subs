00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.400
Did you know that how you wash your hair and the products you use could go a long way

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.780
in maintaining smooth, shiny hair?

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.360
Follow these simple tips from dermatologists to maintain healthy hair:

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.200
How often you wash your hair should be based on how much oil your scalp produces.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.620
If your scalp is oily, you may need to wash it as often as once a day.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.440
If you have chemically-treated hair, your hair may be drier, so you may want to wash it less frequently.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:37.140
As you get older, your scalp makes less oil, so you may not need to shampoo as often.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.820
But if you see flakes in your hair, you may not be shampooing enough.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.240
This can lead to dandruff and other scalp diseases.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.080
When washing your hair, concentrate on cleaning primarily the scalp,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.660
rather than washing the entire length of the hair.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.300
Washing only your hair can create flyaway hair that is dull and coarse.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.780
Regardless of cost, many shampoo and conditioner brands provide the same benefits.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.560
It’s important to choose a shampoo and conditioner formulated specifically for your type of hair.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:16.100
If you color your hair, use a shampoo designed for color-treated hair, as it is gentler than regular shampoo and can help extend your hair color.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.220
If dandruff is a problem, then try a shampoo formulated to fight dandruff.

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.800
The key is finding the product that works best for you.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.500
If your hair is damaged or chemically treated, consider a “2-in-1” shampoo, which cleans and conditions your hair.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:42.800
If you do not use a “2-in-1” shampoo, dermatologists recommend using a conditioner after every shampoo.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:53.800
While a conditioner cannot repair hair, it can increase shine, decrease static electricity, improve strength, and offer some protection from harmful UV rays.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.300
This, in turn, can significantly improve the look of damaged or weathered hair.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:07.800
Since conditioners can make fine hair look limp, they should only be used on the tips of the hair and not the scalp or length of the hair.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:15.700
If you are a swimmer, protect your hair from the damaging effects of chlorine by wetting and conditioning your hair before swimming.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.600
Wear a tight-fitting swim cap and use a specially formulated “swimmers” shampoo and deep conditioner to replace lost moisture.

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.300
If you have questions about caring for your hair, you should make an appointment to see a dermatologist.

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:37.600
