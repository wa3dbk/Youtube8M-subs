Hey guys, it's Jeff from ATHLEAN-X back here
in the kitchen again for the second part of

00:00:28.022 --> 00:00:29.022
our series "How to eat to gain more muscle"
and we're gonna deal with lunch.

00:00:29.022 --> 00:00:30.022
Now I'm not forgetting the snacks that you're
gonna have in the mid-morning and afternoon.

00:00:30.022 --> 00:00:31.022
We're gonna deal with snacks later on in the
series, but for now let's put our attention

00:00:31.022 --> 00:00:32.022
to lunch and specifically what I like to eat
and some other options that you like to eat,

00:00:32.022 --> 00:00:33.022
that are simple, a little bit creative and
that are not gonna taste so bad.

00:00:33.022 --> 00:00:34.022
Basically...I know it looks like we have a
lot of stuff here on the counter and, like

00:00:34.022 --> 00:00:35.022
I said last time, if you buy this stuff in
whole, it becomes very very easy to do your

00:00:35.022 --> 00:00:36.022
job in preparing your lunch.

00:00:36.022 --> 00:00:37.022
It becomes very easy to make sure you always
have this stuff on hand and ready to go.

00:00:37.022 --> 00:00:38.022
So I wanna start at this end over here.

00:00:38.022 --> 00:00:39.022
One of my main things that I like to eat is
grilled chicken, kind of like chicken sandwich.

00:00:39.022 --> 00:00:40.022
Stay away from the deli meats, guys.

00:00:40.022 --> 00:00:41.022
They're loaded with salts...you'll see they'll
come in a big bawl.

00:00:41.022 --> 00:00:42.022
When was the last time you saw a turkey that
was actually in the shape of a bawl?

00:00:42.022 --> 00:00:43.022
This stuff is actually processed and thrown
together, not good for you.

00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:44.022
Stick to the real stuff, stick to the chicken
breasts.

00:00:44.022 --> 00:00:45.022
I've got a big bag here...a 10 pound bag,
again you can buy it at BJ's, Costco, Wholesale...

00:00:45.022 --> 00:00:46.022
Take out a lasagna pan, a big pan to hold
these, take about 8 or so...whatever you use

00:00:46.022 --> 00:00:47.022
for lunches or dinners and we'll talk about
using the same things for dinner.

00:00:47.022 --> 00:00:48.022
But for your week, you shouldn't have to worry
about cooking every single day.

00:00:48.022 --> 00:00:49.022
Let's take enough so it will last us for a
week, so it'll be a lot more convenient.

00:00:49.022 --> 00:00:50.022
You throw those in here, one can of tomatoes...it's
real simple guys.

00:00:50.022 --> 00:00:51.022
All you have to know is how to open it with
a can opener.

00:00:51.022 --> 00:00:52.022
Put in here a little onion, some garlic.

00:00:52.022 --> 00:00:53.022
Now spices...there's some dry mushrooms, pasta
sprinkler...so this right here, sandwich sprinkler.

00:00:53.022 --> 00:00:54.022
They make these spices grouped together just
for the guys like us that don't really know

00:00:54.022 --> 00:00:55.022
what to do in the kitchen.

00:00:55.022 --> 00:00:56.022
We can just put them in here, we know we're
getting a blended mix...it has oregano, it

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:57.022
has basil, it has everything in one shot.

00:00:57.022 --> 00:00:58.022
Put that in here into the oven on 4:25 for
just an hour.

00:00:58.022 --> 00:00:59.022
That's it!

00:00:59.022 --> 00:01:00.022
Let it stay uncovered.

00:01:00.022 --> 00:01:01.022
Now this will be done...use this throughout
the day.

00:01:01.022 --> 00:01:02.022
For lunch, I'll take this, I'll put some whole
wheat bread, a little lettuce, tomato, some

00:01:02.022 --> 00:01:03.022
salsa and that's it.

00:01:03.022 --> 00:01:04.022
It's a great sandwich, you can even toast
the bread up to get a little texture change.

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:05.022
But it's really good, that's what I have all
the time, when I have the time to do that.

00:01:05.022 --> 00:01:06.022
I love it, I take it on the go, I eat it in
the car.

00:01:06.022 --> 00:01:07.022
Some other options you have here...tuna.

00:01:07.022 --> 00:01:08.022
I used to kid around with my wife, but I used
to eat this from the can in college.

00:01:08.022 --> 00:01:09.022
It was sort of what I survived on, but we
can make it taste better now.

00:01:09.022 --> 00:01:10.022
We can do a better job simply by having some
other things to mix it with.

00:01:10.022 --> 00:01:11.022
If you're gonna go on the mayo route, as in
making a tuna salad sandwich, stick with the

00:01:11.022 --> 00:01:12.022
light mayo or the non-fat mayo.

00:01:12.022 --> 00:01:13.022
It's just gonna save you a lot of calories,
a lot of unnecessary fat.

00:01:13.022 --> 00:01:14.022
You can switch it up, you can use some salmon
instead of using the actual tuna instead.

00:01:14.022 --> 00:01:15.022
You can put it on with some sandwich...again,
with bread, with some vinegar, some lemon

00:01:15.022 --> 00:01:16.022
juice, some red peppers.

00:01:16.022 --> 00:01:17.022
Whatever you want just to increase the taste
of this, it will taste a lot better than just

00:01:17.022 --> 00:01:18.780
plain tuna, like I did.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:28.262
Put it on a sandwich, you can even mix it
with a little bit of salad.

00:01:28.262 --> 00:01:29.262
So we sort of cleared up all this space here,
but one of the best things that I like is

00:01:29.262 --> 00:01:30.262
sort of my secret weapon.

00:01:30.262 --> 00:01:31.262
When I am behind schedule, when I'm running
late and I need to get something in...go to

00:01:31.262 --> 00:01:32.262
cereal.

00:01:32.262 --> 00:01:33.262
You'll see in the meal plans two of the ones
that I recommend the most are: Go Lean and

00:01:33.262 --> 00:01:34.262
Heart to Heart.

00:01:34.262 --> 00:01:35.262
Now don't get it confused with the Go Lean
crunch..a lot of sugar in that, extra fat...it's

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:36.262
not equivalent to the Go Lean by itself.

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:37.262
What's great about this is there's actually
12 grams of protein in this cereal and there's

00:01:37.262 --> 00:01:38.262
a lot of fibre too.

00:01:38.262 --> 00:01:39.262
I challenge you to find other cereals that
taste this good and have that nutritional

00:01:39.262 --> 00:01:40.262
content.

00:01:40.262 --> 00:01:41.262
And the Heart to Heart is not too far behind.

00:01:41.262 --> 00:01:42.262
A bowl of cereal, some skid milk, a little
extra protein with the yogurt, your favorite

00:01:42.262 --> 00:01:43.262
kind of yogurt...they're all pretty much the
same.

00:01:43.262 --> 00:01:44.262
But a non-fat yogurt is really good and that's
it...for 3 minutes and then out the door and

00:01:44.262 --> 00:01:45.262
I feel like I've definitely got a good meal.

00:01:45.262 --> 00:01:46.262
So again, I've got sort of my go-to meals,
I've got some alternatives for when I'm on

00:01:46.262 --> 00:01:47.262
the run.

00:01:47.262 --> 00:01:48.262
There's also fruits that you can grab at any
point in time, real quick and easy.

00:01:48.262 --> 00:01:49.262
Guys, these are the meal plans that have a
lot for me the potential to build muscle and

00:01:49.262 --> 00:01:50.262
to burn fat, much easier than it would have
been before in terms of what my option were.

00:01:50.262 --> 00:01:51.262
I wanna give these meal plan to you, as well.

00:01:51.262 --> 00:01:52.262
90 days worth of meal plans that come with
the ATHLEAN-X training system.

00:01:52.262 --> 00:01:53.262
When you combine the two of those, in the
next 90 days you won't believe how much of

00:01:53.262 --> 00:01:54.262
an impact it can have on you, just through
a concerted effort through your diet.

00:01:54.262 --> 00:01:55.262
And we don't even have to call it a diet,
because this is not restricting yourself here.

00:01:55.262 --> 00:01:56.262
You'll see there's tons of food here you can
eat.

00:01:56.262 --> 00:01:57.262
As a matter of fact, on these meal plans we
don't even focus on portion sizes.

00:01:57.262 --> 00:01:58.262
So head over to athleanx.com right now, grab
your system, get the meal plans, start putting

00:01:58.262 --> 00:01:59.262

00:01:59.262 --> 00:02:00.262

Guys, thanks for watching.

00:02:01.262 --> 00:02:02.262

I'll talk to you soon.
