00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.800
Hello everyone, it's Aunt Frenita. 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.950
And we're studying Lesson Nine: "For All People"

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:27.175
The message for this week is: I worship God with my worldwide church family.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.875
The memory verse is from Revelation, chapter 15, verse 4.

00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:36.600
“All nations will come and worship before you”

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.070
Have you ever had a special guest come to your church?

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.250
Was that person a well-known preacher or singer?

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.300
The Israelites invited an extra-special guest to their new church—God.3

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.020
He even promised to live in their temple!

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.550
Solomon’s eyes sparkled. It was finished!

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.620
All the furniture was in the right place.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.200
Every detail was complete.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.520
It was time now to dedicate the temple to the Lord.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:16.220
Solomon called the leaders of all the tribes and families of Israel to come to Jerusalem.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.570
The first part of the dedication involved bringing the ark to its new home in the temple.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:30.850
Everyone watched as the priests took the ark from Obed-Edom’s house, where it had been stored for three months.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.200
They carried it slowly, with great respect and joy, to the temple.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.170
King Solomon and the people sacrificed sheep and oxen along the way.

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.720
In their joy, they sacrificed so many sheep and oxen to the Lord that no one could keep count!

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.850
The priests carried the ark containing the law of God into the Most Holy Place of the temple.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:05.800
They set it carefully beneath the wings of the two great carved, gold-covered angels.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:12.300
Then all the Levites who were musicians stood near the altar playing their instruments—

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.670
cymbals, and harps, and lyres.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.900
The musicians sang and played loudly and powerfully together.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.950
They praised and thanked the Lord.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.750
“He is so good!” they sang. “His faithful love endures forever!”

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.900
And at that moment, the most amazing thing happened!

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.050
A great cloud filled the temple!

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:42.900
The cloud held the glorious presence of the Lord!

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.770
The priests could not continue their work.

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.750
They had to leave the temple because of God’s glory!

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:54.970
Solomon saw the cloud and his heart swelled with thankfulness.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.620
The temple was finished, and the Lord had moved in!

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.650
He turned around and looked at all the Israelites standing before him.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.450
“Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel!” he shouted.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:10.870
Then Solomon knelt down.

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:17.700
He lifted his hands toward heaven in front of all the people. He began to pray.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:26.300
“Oh, Lord, God of Israel, there is no God like You in all of heaven or earth!"

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.570
"You keep Your promises and show unfailing love to all who obey You."

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.950
"May You watch over this temple both day and night."

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:41.470
"May You always hear the prayers I make toward this place."

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.100
“If Your people are ever defeated by their enemies because they have sinned against You,..."

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:54.350
"and if they turn to You and call on Your name and pray to You here in this temple,..."

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.550
"then hear from heaven and forgive their sins."

00:03:57.550 --> 00:04:00.950
"Forgive Your people who have sinned against You."

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.350
"For they are Your people—Your special possession whom You brought out of Egypt.”

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:15.650
When Solomon finished praying, he stood up and shouted a blessing over all the people of Israel.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.720
“May the Lord our God be with us as He was with our ancestors!"

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:25.600
"May He give us the desire to obey His commands!"

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.750
"May people all over the earth know that the Lord is God!”

00:04:32.275 --> 00:04:38.420
Then the king and all the children of Israel offered sacrifices to the Lord.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:44.070
Solomon and the Israelites celebrated together for 14 days.

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:50.400
No one would ever forget it! They would tell it over and over again.

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:56.425
Finally someone would write down the story so people could read it forever.
