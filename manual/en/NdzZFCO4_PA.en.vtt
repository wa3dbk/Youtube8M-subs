hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.139
welcome back to another session with

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.990
your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today we're

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.210
going to learn how to make a very simple

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.810
dal that is using moong dal but with

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.150
kacha pachha chutney kind of preparation so

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.460
for this first we're going to take a

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.160
blender and in this we're going to add

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.759
good amount of garlic in this add lot of

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.280
green chilli if it is too hot then reduce

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.340
and also some chopped coriander in this

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.440
if you want you can add little bit of

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.440
water and make this into a coarse paste

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.170
now look at this, this is coarsely ground

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.300
the garlic is what's going to make this

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.110
special

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.120
first we're going to take some oil and

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.640
in this add some chopped onion into this

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.250
add salt

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.670
let's cook the onion till they sweat when

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.640
the onion slightly sweat add turmeric and

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.739
curry leaf

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:07.920
ok now in this we're going to add our

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.580
chilli, coriander, garlic paste these kinds

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.820
of simple dals are like you know very

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.009
popular in home cooking and they want to

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.280
have different flavors in dal so it's

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.070
not always put a tadka and put some

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.080
powders in it and cooking so these kind

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.330
of variations make this very very tasty

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.409
with now look at this now you want this

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.689
masala to be slightly cooked that's when

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.909
we're going to add the split green gram

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.250
that is the moong dal but soak it in the

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.439
water for at least two hours then we're

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.180
going to drain this water and add to

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.970
this, once this masala is nicely cooked

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.549
in this we're going to add that dal

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.530
that is the moong dal that we have soaked

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.009
in the water for about two hours now mix

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.770
all of this if you want you can also add

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.810
some water not too much because you want

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.590
the dal to be slightly dry and most

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.110
important thing we'll check if the salt

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:04.950
is enough

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.950
yeah that's good

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.739
put the lid, reduce the flame and

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.920
let it cook in a slow flame for around five

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.930
to seven minutes till the dal is nice

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:16.739
and soft

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:18.569
you don't want the dal to be mashy it

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.430
has to be grainy but it has to be cooked

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.330
now you know look at this the awesome

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.540
the dal is all ready but now you want

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.489
this to dry out before that we're going

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:31.440
to add some coriander powder to this

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.129
just to give some additional favor ok ah

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:38.580
mix it squeeze in little bit of lemon

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:39.209
juice

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.879
this is optional and put the lid on

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.790
switch off the flame and let it rest for

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.519
2 - 3 minutes how when you make a nice pulao

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.250
you want the rice to rest after that

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.290
the rice will become nice and fluffy

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.989
and grainy same with this dal after you

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:56.670
cook it some more moisture is still

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.920
there we put the lid on and let it rest

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.480
for 5 minutes after which we going to

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.340
try after a few minutes

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.680
look at this and this is very simple

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.680
