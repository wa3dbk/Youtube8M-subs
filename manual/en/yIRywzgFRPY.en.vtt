00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:13.190
<c.color000000>New Orleans, LA</c>

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:21.540 position:97%
<c.color000000>As you know, the city flood during Katrina and Easton received anywhere between 8 to 10 feet of water.</c>

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:29.110 position:97%
<c.color000000>So the whole first floor, all the gym, and everything else was underwater.</c>

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:34.180 position:70%
<c.color000000>It remained underwater for a good 2, 3 weeks.</c>

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:54.570 position:98%
<c.color000000>There were rumors that it was going to be changed into a hotel, it would be sold, that it would not open back as Warren Easton and this could not happen as a lot of the teachers and alumni had decided to do.</c>

00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:06.660 position:97%
<c.color000000>When we learned that the school might not reopen after Katrina, a group of us got together and said you know we’re going to get our school open, they’re not going to close this 130 year history.</c>

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:12.520 position:97%
<c.color000000>We actually went to the school board and asked if we could charter the school, and surprisingly they said yes.</c>

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.890 position:97%
<c.color000000>We now run it as a charter school and we’re just so proud of it.</c>

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:27.500 position:98%
<c.color000000>Coming in on a wing and a prayer, everybody here including our board, Sandra Bullock actually fell in our lap as Godsend.</c>

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:39.380 position:97%
<c.color000000>Because not only has she given the school great visibility, but she’s also put a lot of her personal time and money into the school.</c>

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.730 position:66%
<c.color000000>This auditorium was just an absolute mess.</c>

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.920 position:56%
<c.color000000>So she decided to do the auditorium.</c>

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.680 position:97%
<c.color000000>She’s done many other things, but that was the first donation.</c>

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.050 position:73%
<c.color000000>It’s a beautiful building and a beautiful room.</c>

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.090 position:98%
<c.color000000>We thank her for what she’s done to make it come to life again.</c>

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:15.060 position:98%
<c.color000000>We call Warren Easton the miracle on Canal Street, that’s where we’re located and it helped bring back the Mid-City neighborhood in which it’s located.
This is something worth saving and we’ve been blessed, and I think it shows you what can be done when people decided just to go get it, and that’s what we’ve done.</c>

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.310
<c.color000000>This is hope.</c>

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.660
<c.color000000>This school is hope.</c>

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.880 position:83%
<c.color000000>Therefore if this school is hope, this city has hope.</c>
