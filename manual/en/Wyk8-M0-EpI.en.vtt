What's up guy and girl players of World of
Warcraft. This is Ryutarou Aka Tarou answering

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:11.570
this weeks crazy 'what if'! For more FREE
WoW guides, check out my website at tarouwowguides.com

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.940
Ok, so you're down on your luck. Having spent
your last gold coin on some repairs after

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.930
wiping nonstop in a horrible heroic PuG that
went absolutely no where because noone in

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:29.260
the group but you the healer, knew they had
these awesome abilities called 'CC'.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.670
Just then you were watching the trade channel
and saw the deal of a life time, or so you

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:43.479
thought. For a measely 29.46g you could have
a chance at 5,000 gold. With 5,000 gold you

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:48.420
could finally get your epic flying or that
new ring you've been wanting or even level

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.879
up that profession to 525 you've been working
on. All you had to do was get a Mysterious

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.179
Fortune Card; WoW's equivalent to scratch
offs. Then you thought, 'what if' you bought

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:05.950
5,000 gold worth of Mysterious Fortune Cards.
You'd be sure to win then, right? So you borrowed

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.909
5,000 gold from your guild and headed straight
for the Auction House filled with lucky thoughts.

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.340
Heck you even through in some rabbit's feet
in your bags to boost your luck. You were

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.170
set to be a thousand-aire.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:23.619
That was... until you started flipping and
vendoring the cards... 10 silver!? 1 gold!?

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:29.610
What was this nonsense. 5 gold!? Come on big
money, you said to yourself over and over

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.469
again. But when you're 170 Mysterious Fortune
Cards were all flipped and you checked to

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:40.880
see how much gold you made. And when this
gold you made equaled an insanely amazing,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.630
measely 227 gold, you learned a valuable gambling
lesson, the house or Inscriber in this case,

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.329
always, always, always, wins.

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:59.219
Wow, so umm that sucks. So my advice to anyone
is ... these cards are a waste of your money

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:05.009
but if you're a dreamer think you can win,
do it in moderation expecting zero from it.

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:10.610
Don't go pawning off your epic pants or you
just may turn into a naked beggar on top of

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.400
the Org Auction House mailbox.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.360
That's it for this week 'what if' and I hope
you liked it.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.410
"Now Go PvP or Something!"

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:29.300
Come on man, let me borrow like 5,000 more
gold. I promise I'll pay it back this time.

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:35.960
I'll give you interest and, and how about
1,000 gold in interest. Ok, fine 2,000 gold

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.230
in interest.. Come on man... please... please...
