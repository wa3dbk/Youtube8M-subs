00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:04.436
&gt;&gt; I really love Melbourne.

00:00:04.766 --> 00:00:06.216
It's an awesome place to live.

00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:08.236
There's heaps to do.

00:00:08.236 --> 00:00:09.106
The food is great.

00:00:09.106 --> 00:00:10.096
The coffee's great.

00:00:10.096 --> 00:00:12.546
And Melbourne Uni is kind of
right in the heart as well.

00:00:12.716 --> 00:00:14.376
&gt;&gt; It has something
for everybody.

00:00:14.376 --> 00:00:16.846
If you're sporty, it
has the sports precinct.

00:00:16.846 --> 00:00:19.066
If you're a hipster, there are all these like cafes

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:21.986
and like niche corners of the city.

00:00:23.306 --> 00:00:27.706
&gt;&gt; The first time when I came to
this university, it almost felt

00:00:27.796 --> 00:00:31.526
like everyone's partying every
day, but it's not the case.

00:00:42.116 --> 00:00:45.176
&gt;&gt; You've got everything
from the really artsy people

00:00:45.296 --> 00:00:50.266
to the hardcore science people,
and everything in between.

00:00:50.346 --> 00:00:58.006
It's a really good place to meet
people from every walk of life.

00:00:58.146 --> 00:01:00.346
&gt;&gt; I thought I was
always a science person.

00:01:00.346 --> 00:01:01.246
I loved chemistry.

00:01:01.246 --> 00:01:02.286
I loved biology.

00:01:02.966 --> 00:01:05.766
But when you stay here for
several years, you kind of grow

00:01:05.766 --> 00:01:07.196
and learn as a person.

00:01:08.256 --> 00:01:12.006
I think at one stage I've just
realised, I really want to go

00:01:12.006 --> 00:01:14.196
into some communication.

00:01:15.556 --> 00:01:18.476
&gt;&gt; the Melbourne Curriculum allowed me to
do a diverse range of subjects.

00:01:19.516 --> 00:01:22.256
&gt;&gt; And you have to do
breadth subjects

00:01:22.376 --> 00:01:24.646
which are subjects
outside of your discipline.

00:01:24.766 --> 00:01:27.476
I did subjects like
creative writing, choir.

00:01:27.616 --> 00:01:29.096
I did a lot of psychology.

00:01:29.096 --> 00:01:30.666
You can really get involved

00:01:30.666 --> 00:01:32.556
and do something
completely different

00:01:32.706 --> 00:01:33.986
to what you're used to.

00:01:33.986 --> 00:01:35.186
&gt;&gt; In the beginning,
it's like, "Wow,

00:01:35.186 --> 00:01:36.026
I love this uni [phonetic].

00:01:36.026 --> 00:01:36.956
I want to do everything.

00:01:37.146 --> 00:01:40.396
Now gradually through
studying here and having a lot

00:01:40.396 --> 00:01:43.286
of different experiences, I
kind of narrowed things down

00:01:43.596 --> 00:01:47.376
and everything kind of points
towards where my heart really is

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:49.566
and what I'm really
passionate about.

00:01:50.076 --> 00:01:54.556
&gt;&gt; I've always thought positively but
this university has reinforced

00:01:54.556 --> 00:01:57.106
that positive thinking and that
sense of creativity

00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.226
and innovation and wonder.

00:01:59.206 --> 00:02:01.926
&gt;&gt; I have big dreams.

00:02:02.996 --> 00:02:04.336
&gt;&gt; Obviously, I want
to help people.

00:02:04.536 --> 00:02:07.686
That's why everyone
becomes a doctor.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:11.720
&gt;&gt; When I leave university,

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.340
I think I'll be a
completely different person.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.630
I feel like I've really grown.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.940
I feel like I've really matured.

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.860
&gt;&gt; I'd love to bring
whatever I learnt in science

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.700
and a passion in community
engagement together.

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.920
&gt;&gt; I think I've grown a lot.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.550
I've learnt to motivate myself.

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:32.200
&gt;&gt; I think I've become
assertive and confident,

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.700
and really know what
I want to do,

00:02:34.956 --> 00:02:36.976
and what I want to
be in the future.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.240
This uni just feels
like my second home.
