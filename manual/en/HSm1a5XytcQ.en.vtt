00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.260
Camp Harmon has been here since
1964 it was donated by

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.889
two amazing women the Harmon
sisters that felt that this land needed

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:19.579
to be given to an organization that
would help people with special needs

00:00:19.579 --> 00:00:23.789
Camp Harmon is more and then just a
camp it's a home away from home

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.709
for people with special needs

00:00:25.709 --> 00:00:28.910
ranging in age from eight up to sixty
five

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.270
and it's just a place where our campers

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.990
know to be their place it's their place
their brothers can't come their sisters

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.050
can't come

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.359
they get to get away from their families
it's safe it's fun

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:46.180
we have traditional songs and games and
activities that they absolutely love

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.400
they talk about it

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.550
from the moment they leave to the moment
they come back what they're going to do

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.660
next year how to make it different
fun

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.470
and they get to reunite with friends that
they only see once a year and it's just

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.980
it's a magical magical place

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.450
so registration day at Camp Harmon is a
very unique experience if a family has

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.350
never been to Camp Harmon they might be
a little taken aback by how warm and

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.470
welcoming the staff is how much
we are so excited to see these campers

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.920
the counselors have studied a campers
file for quite a long time to learn this

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:21.390
camper to to know the most about them so
they can provide them with the best care

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.290
possible

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.780
and they honestly get disappointed if
they don't show up because they've

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.010
already developed a bond with these
campers

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.180
the parents of campers drive into camp

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.060
we get excited there's another parent
another camper coming the moment that

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.729
they get out of the car and we
learn who that is we celebrate everybody

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:39.150
starts yelling "yeah Jimmy's here

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:46.130
from cabin four It's so great
we're so excited"

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:52.659
"Cabin 5!" Counselor: "Nice to meet you
I'm Kaitlin."

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.549
A lot of times the parents and the
campers are like wow

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:59.000
am I a rock star am I famous am I...

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.210
what's the deal but that's just the way
it is

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.790
that's the way it is at Camp Harmon
we say

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.480
campers are kings and queens and their
is no such thing as "no" at Camp Harmon

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.629
for our campers

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.200
we treat them as if they are royalty as
if they are a super star

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.490
therefore they want to come back year
after year because it is so absolutely

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:21.790
special to them another wonderful aspect
of Camp Harmon is that we do have two

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.000
registered nurses onsite at all times
and that means twenty four hours a day

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.049
they are here on call

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:32.569
and we uh... they are available to
take take care of the campers the same

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.559
way they would be taken care of it home
that means any medications that they

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:37.780
take any special needs that they may
have

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.640
we've had campers with tracheotomies
that have to be changed and cleaned

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.019
we have campers that have

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:45.950
you know special things that have to happen
in the middle of the night

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:50.259
you know it's not an issue we are here
to provide services to the campers

00:02:50.259 --> 00:02:54.079
and to the families to make sure that
the campers are safe well cared for the

00:02:54.079 --> 00:02:55.919
same that they would be at home

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:59.879
and so that the parents or caregivers
can also have a little bit of a respite

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:03.539
and be in total trust that the campers are
going to be well-taken care of

00:03:03.539 --> 00:03:08.449
the dietary restrictions for campers can
vary depending on a disability, allergies,

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:09.980
medical sensitivities,

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.599
we are able to accommodate all those
different sensitivities or

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:15.580
allergies and special diets

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.230
so even though we might have a a regular
menu to provide food we also have an

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.430
amazing cook

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.800
she is available prior to the camp

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.190
so that parents can call in and say "No
my camper has to have this special

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.160
something or other, they have to have this

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.130
they can't have sugar, they can have this,
they're a gluten-free diet. So parents can work

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.839
directly with our cook

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:38.219
to make sure that she is able to provide
the same diet that that camper would have at home

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:41.609
the ratio for Camp Harmon
is three to one

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.749
that means that we have three campers to
one counselor they are other times when

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:48.729
we might have a one on one camper and
the parents will sign up the camper

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:50.379
ahead of time knowing that

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.329
if somebody is a one-on-one camper we
know that they are not necessarily able

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:57.540
to participate in group activities on a
regular basis

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:00.390
maybe they can go but they need to leave
immediately

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.510
maybe they have a little more medically
sensitive issues that need to be dealt

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.139
with

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.999
uh... but the basic ratio is
three-to-one that means in every cabin

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:11.929
they'll be six campers two counselors to
a lot of times three counselors just

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:16.849
depending on how things play out and so
those counselors are responsible for

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:20.989
the wellness the happiness the fun
goings of the campers in that

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:22.180
particular cabin

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:23.459
and they are with them

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:27.049
twenty four-hours-a-day from the time
they check in to the time they leave

00:04:27.049 --> 00:04:31.349
so they really do develop a strong
bond and they even continued to you know

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:34.900
stay in touch afterwards the campers
become friends with the counselors

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.690
counselors become friends with the
campers and they want to know what's

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:40.580
going on in each other's worlds after the
fact

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.669
on the last day of camp it's always
bittersweet because the campers are tired

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:46.380
they've had so much fun

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.740
they've been around their friends
they're ready to go back to their beds

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.340
and their t_v_'s and such and at the same
time they don't wanna leave and there's

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.710
many tears on the last day because they
have developed sense

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.669
amazing friendships with the campers and
the counselors

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:03.609
and so we do memory books they have
photos they get signatures and their

00:05:03.609 --> 00:05:05.330
friends they chit-chat

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:10.030
and then parents come and they look at
their parents like what are you doing

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.870
here

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.370
and oh there's mom there's dad

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.990
and it's very hard for the parents to
know that they just haven't been rearing

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:18.950
at the bit to see their parents but

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:22.330
at the same time the parents are so
relieved that they were able to leave their

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:26.460
campers and know that they had a great
time and they really don't want to go

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.460
that's the way it should be

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:33.270
i personally am humbled by the
experience here at Camp Harmon this

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.180
is one of the most beautiful places i
have ever spent and it has been an honor for

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.690
me to be able to spend time in the
redwood trees listen to the birds

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.189
it's and magical place and I

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:44.550
am so

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:48.189
just in awe of the Harmon sisters and how
with their generosity they provided this

00:05:48.189 --> 00:05:49.699
for such a magical

00:05:49.699 --> 00:05:53.300
experience for so many people to be
able to take advantage of

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:56.280
i'm hoping that you might find
interest in it and come check it out and

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:57.919
to see how magical this place is
