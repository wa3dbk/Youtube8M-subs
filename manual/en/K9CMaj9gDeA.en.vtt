00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.960
[Music]

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.800
[Supporter] Joe Biden's in town. Our Vice
President. I'm really excited.

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:13.730
[Vice President Biden] How you doing? Good
to see you.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:14.610
[Supporter] Welcome back to Waterloo!

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.899
[Vice President Biden] It's good to be back
man!

00:00:15.899 --> 00:00:16.250
[Supporters] Fired up! Ready to go!

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.790
[Supporters] Biden! Biden! Biden!

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.619
[Speaker] Ladies and gentlemen, please help
me in welcoming the Vice President of the

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.480
United States, Joe Biden.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.330
[Applause]

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.486
[Vice President Biden] Hey folks, how are
you? It's good to be back in Black Hawk County.

00:00:29.486 --> 00:00:31.222
[Music and applause]

00:00:31.222 --> 00:00:37.140
[Vice President Biden] When Barack and I got elected,
we were determined to restore America's

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.359
middle class. We did all we could do to end
the practice of outsourcing. And reward American

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:48.179
manufacturers who stayed in America or brought
their factories back to America.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.000
[Applause]

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.019
[Vice President Biden] Ladies and gentlemen -

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.900
[Applause]

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.010
just last week,
a major article in the Washington Post

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.882
did an extensive examination of Bain
Capital. And here's what they said.

00:01:02.882 --> 00:01:08.990
During the 15 years that Mitt Romney was actively
involved in running Bain, it owned companies

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:15.360
that were pioneers in the practice of shipping
work to overseas call centers and factories.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.770
Bain and their companies, they made a great
deal of money, but in the process, they devastated

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.600
whole American communities. So you got to
give Mitt Romney credit. He's a job creator

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:33.990
- in Singapore and China, India. He's been
very good at creating jobs - overseas.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.101
[Music and applause]

00:01:37.101 --> 00:01:42.990
[Vice President Biden] As governor, his administration
signed $160,000 a month contract to pay people

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:50.889
abroad to answer the phone. So folks, here's
the cruel irony. An unemployed worker in Massachusetts,

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:58.439
picks up his or her telephone, calls the state
of Massachusetts to ask about their unemployment

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:04.350
benefits, and she ends up talking to someone
in another country that her job was outsourced to.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.929
[Audience sighs]

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:08.580
[Vice President Biden] And Romney said the
president is out of touch when the president

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.720
encouraged young people to try to get manufacturing
jobs. He said out of touch.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.520
[Laughs]

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.550
[Vice President Biden] Out of touch? A prospect
of a president with a Swiss bank account and

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.080
retirement investments in the Cayman Islands?
Y'all can decide did you ever think you'd

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.390
be choosing between two people running for
president, one of whom had a Swiss bank account?

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.110
No. Out of touch?

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.770
[Music]

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.450
[Supporter] We represent the middle class.
We represent the common, working blue-collar

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.790
citizen of the United States. I do feel the
president and vice president stand for those

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.830
values because of how they started out, where
they came from.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:49.510
[Supporter] It's the most important election
that has ever been actually, to me.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:54.660
[Vice President Biden] We have a long way
to go, but we cannot step back, we must move

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.230
forward. God bless you all, and may God protect
our troops. Thank you all very much.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:00.889
Thank you.

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:01.740
