00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.179
growing up, my whole family would swim all the time in what we called the "hot tub"

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.539
before we moved in, my Dad built it himself

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:16.209
the in all started with an old water
tower

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:17.650
he bought it

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.410
dismantled piece by piece and brought every piece down one by one from the 60 foot tower

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.369
then he transported it and reassembled it by himself

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:31.330
he designed and installed all the
plumbing and filtration systems

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.170
he was a hippy at the time who was really into solar power

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.000
so he designed and built a solar panel to heat it

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.010
the water would be pumped through the black pipes into the panel

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.010
heated with reflected light

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.210
then returned back to the hot tub

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.540
he installed plastic pool liner to hold the water

00:00:48.541 --> 00:00:50.670
then he made steps and a door 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.470
he tied a rope from the rafters to swing on 

00:00:53.471 --> 00:00:55.070
and a hammock to relax 

00:00:55.071 --> 00:00:58.469
not to mention his own little personal touches

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.830
it was amazing

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:07.190
our summer nights were filled with the smell of chlorine, old wood and plastic

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:12.060
it was one of those things at the time we
didn't really didn't think twice about

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:16.060
it was in a main stay of our childhood

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:21.440
but looking back now, it was truly an amazing and unique accomplishment

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:26.670
when we moved, the new owners tore it down to make room for their garage

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.650
it will always be remembered by us; a true work of art by a true artist

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.650
lost forever in time...

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.450
