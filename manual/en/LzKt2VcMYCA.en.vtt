00:00:03.251 --> 00:00:06.339
The next thing we want to talk about 
 is teaching this horse to guide. 

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:11.215
Now we've already moved his shoulder, which is a big part 
 of that, but we want to improve on that. 

00:00:11.215 --> 00:00:19.807
Ultimately when we ride this horse, the direct rein controls 
 the face. The horse doesn't follow it necessarily, 

00:00:19.807 --> 00:00:26.030
and some trainers will have a horse follow their nose a lot, but 
 basically we want this horse just to give us his face 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.324
when we take hold of the reins, but not necessarily the feet. 

00:00:31.324 --> 00:00:37.593
What we want to do, is we want to be 
 able to control this horse's shoulder independently,  

00:00:37.593 --> 00:00:46.045
so when we pick up the outside rein, we will bump with 
 this outside leg, and get this shoulder to move across. 

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:53.759
Just like we did on the ground. Move the shoulder, we're going 
 to move the shoulder while we're on the horse's back. 

00:00:53.759 --> 00:00:58.723
Now, we'll start this like we start all things, 

00:00:58.723 --> 00:01:02.969
we just stand here, hold the horse straight, don't try to turn him, 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.547
just hold your horse straight, and when you pick 
 up that rein, bump bump bump bump

00:01:07.547 --> 00:01:10.798
bump with that leg until the horse moves. 

00:01:10.798 --> 00:01:19.853
Then, the next day or two, we bump bump bump bump with 
 that leg until the horse moves a few more steps. 

00:01:19.853 --> 00:01:25.333
until ultimately we can walk the horse all the 
 way around and move his shoulder. 

00:01:25.333 --> 00:01:32.299
Again, we want both reins to be independent. I want 
 to be able to pull this horse's head around,

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:38.383
with the inside rein and the shoulder stay up, stay straight, like 
 if I was going to show a western pleasure horse

00:01:38.383 --> 00:01:41.220
I would want his nose in but his shoulder to stay up, 

00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:47.890
and when I pick up with the outside rein, then 
 I want the shoulder to move across, 

00:01:47.893 --> 00:01:56.600
so I'll be able to walk in a circle, or trot in a 
 circle, to get this horse to move that shoulder away. 

00:01:56.603 --> 00:02:02.350
Moving the shoulder is basically a function of what we call a "counter arc."

00:02:02.346 --> 00:02:11.450
Now, not everybody uses it quite the same, but we want to be able 
 to bring the horse's nose outside, or at least keep it straight, 

00:02:11.448 --> 00:02:14.630
we want to keep his body straight so the shoulder 
 moves and the hip doesn't go.  

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:20.690
So we'll hold his shoulder straight, and his head 
 straight, and we'll move his shoulder. 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:24.940
We call it a counter arc because the head is to 
 the outside, and the shoulder is to the inside. 

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:33.020
So we're going to walk this horse in a circle, with his 
 head to the outside and his nose to the inside. 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.220
And we just keep bumping with this leg to 
 get that horse to move across. 

00:02:38.221 --> 00:02:45.140
When he's moving good, you sit still, if 
 he resists, you just kind of bump

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.740
and get him to move a little bit more. Now, as he 
 gets better at that, in everything that we do, 

00:02:50.736 --> 00:02:53.950
when we speed up, the maneuver gets harder, 

00:02:54.057 --> 00:02:58.980
and the horse will be a little more resistant. So if 
 you're trotting and trying to do a counter arc, 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:04.270
and he starts resisting, go back to the walk. So, 
 we're going to ask the horse to trot, 

00:03:07.524 --> 00:03:16.780
And we'll pick up this outside rein, and move the shoulder, so the shoulder is 
 going across, and making the hips go in a small circle,  

00:03:16.783 --> 00:03:20.810
the shoulder's going in a smaller circle, and the shoulder's moving across. 

00:03:20.806 --> 00:03:26.560
This gives us our guide, so that if we're loping the horse 
 down the pen, we just drag our neck rein 

00:03:26.565 --> 00:03:31.740
for the horse to go the direction we want him to 
 go. Now, as they get better at that, 

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:37.480
we'll go to the lope and do the same thing. 

00:03:38.578 --> 00:03:44.120
So we pick up the outside rein, we have the head 
 to the outside, the shoulder to the inside, 

00:03:44.119 --> 00:03:50.760
so we can move the shoulder in, and 
 get the horse to be controlled. 

00:03:51.828 --> 00:03:58.140
If the horse starts to resist at some point, then we'll 
 just shut him down, go back to the walk, 

00:03:58.144 --> 00:04:00.140
and/or standstill, and get the horse to move it's shoulder.
