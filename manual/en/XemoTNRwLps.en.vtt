00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:06.609
O.k. Once you have your fabric all ironed
out flat. You're going to go ahead and grab

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.960
your adhesive paper. You'll be able to feel
which side the glue is on. Make sure that

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.110
that's the side, you put the fabric on. I
never cut out the shape that I want, until

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.610
I have the adhesive on. Because it's much
harder to put the adhesive on, if you don't

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.670
have a flat area covered. Because you'll end
up with adhesive all over your iron. So I'm

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.170
going to piece it on that, the best you can.
So all pieces, it's better to over lap a little

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.020
on the fabric. And have all the glue covered.
Then to try to skimp on it. Not usually cut

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.890
it before I iron it. But I do make sure that
my iron does not go over the edges. It's o.k.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.530
if the very edges aren't on there. These are
all scraps of material, anyway. So if we lose

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:58.800
a little, it's not a big deal. Now the thicker
your material is, the harder you'll have to

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.920
push down. And the longer, you'll need to
iron it. These aren't too bad. So it won't

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:13.020
take real long. Once you that, be careful
not to touch it. Because it does get hot.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:20.420
But it should stick like that. Then you're
going to go ahead. And on the back, take your

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:31.440
template. And trace it, upside down. You want
to flip it. So the side you colored, is down.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.920
Go ahead and trace. Might as well go to the
edge. So we don't waste it. Because whatever

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.880
I have left over, I will stick in a bag. And
I have a nice big bag of applique scraps that

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:54.720
already have adhesive on the back. That I
can grab into, whenever I need to. And actually

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.380
the piece, that I'm using for the trunk does
not have the parer on the back. It already

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.150
fell off. So I'm just going to kind of, trace
it right on there. And I'll be able to see

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:17.329
the imprint, well enough. This is one, I did
from before. That I really liked the fabric.

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:19.569
And that's how you get the template on the
fabric.
