Hi everyone and welcome back to Beauty Recommended,
I'm Anna from Vivianna Does Makeup and today

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:16.230
I'm going to show you five steps to super
glossy, healthy looking hair. So I'm going

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.660
to share with you my top tips and then I'm
going to throw in at the end a little hair

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:24.520
styling routine so that you can show off your
shiny tresses. So, let's get started. Step

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.660
1 and of course that is to shampoo and conditioner
your hair but I would recommend looking out

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.200
for something that's more geared towards that
sort of shiny haired, healthy looking finish.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.710
So today I used the Herbal Essences Naked
Shine Shampoo &amp; Conditioner. Now these banish

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.100
dry ends and just leave your hair looking
really luscious and amazingly soft and obviously

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.210
looking very shiny. So I'm just working through
the shampoo here, getting a good lather with

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.500
it. It smells incredible, very minty, very
refreshing and revitalising. Then I'm just

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.829
rinsing it out and going in with a touch of
the conditioner as well. Now this is amazing,

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.320
it's definitely not one to be scared of because
it doesn't weigh the hair down at all and

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.720
it just leaves your hair feeling very soft
and manageable afterwards. Step number 2 is

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.200
to use some kind of deep treatment or mask
in your hair and today I used the Aussie Take

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.860
The Heat 3 Minute Miracle Deep Treatment,
which may just be the best smelling hair product

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.640
in the world! I took a decent dollop of this
and then distributed it through the lengths

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.860
of my hair, waited three minutes, and rinsed
it out. And this one is great because it also

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.870
helps to protect your hair from heat as well
and it conditions at the same time, it's just

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.869
a really good all-in-one and your hair will
feel incredible afterwards. Step 3 is not

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.939
for the faint hearted and it is to give your
hair a blast of cold water at the end of shampooing

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.080
and conditioning and treatmenting and everything
else that you've done. It's not the most comfortable

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.340
of steps but the cold water just helps to
seal down your follicles and just make things

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.541
look really shiny and for there to be less
flyaways and all of that kind of stuff so

00:01:51.541 --> 00:01:55.869
it's definitely worth it. After I've done
all that, I just comb through and then dry

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.540
my hair as normal. When I'm drying my hair
I tend not to be as rough as I do when I want

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.690
a bit of volume so this time round I'm kind
of combing my hair as I'm drying it and that

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.910
just helps to smooth it out as well. Step
4 is to get in there with some straighteners

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.160
and just smooth everything out. Now I've used
the Braun Satin 7 Straighteners and you could

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.349
just do a standard kind of straight hair working
it through the pieces of hair and just have

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:21.280
a straight haired look at the end but I fancy
something a bit different, so I'm just going

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.830
for a wave here. Now this could seriously
not be easier, once you've sectioned your

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.400
hair off all I'm doing is going through and
just pulling the straighteners through like

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.410
you would when you're straightening your hair
but just kind of turning the barrel of the

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.900
straighteners in opposite directions, almost
at like a 180 turn and that just leaves you

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:42.459
with this really nice, slightly textured but
still very glossy-looking wavy look at the

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:47.519
end. Then finally step number 5 is to use
some kind of spray, now here I've used the

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:51.800
Nioxin 3D Neospray, which is new to the range.
Here I've just sprayed it all over and then

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.550
just worked it through and it just leaves
a really nice light hold on the hair. It doesn't

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.170
weigh it down at all and it's really easy
to brush out. But I quite like because any

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:05.260
flyaways that I have got, it just helps to
really smooth those down. Just smooth them

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.810
down now! And that concludes my five steps
to super glossy hair. If you have any more
