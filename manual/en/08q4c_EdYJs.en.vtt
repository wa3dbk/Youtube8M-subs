00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:09.429
Lake Seminole and Jim Woodruff Dam was completed
in 1957. It's original authorized purpose

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.640
were hydropower, navigation and subsequently
over the years, recreation has been added

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:23.640
through various acts of Congress, as part
of the overall project purposes. The navigation

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:36.460
aspect was created to provide navigation from
the Apalachicola, Chattahoochee and Flint

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.210
system, up the Flint River to Bainbridge.
And up the Chattahoochee system to Columbus.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.790
That also included a series of other dams.
George Andrews Dam just above us and then

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.110
above that was Walter F. George Dam. Those
dams and Woodruff are the three navigation

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:01.110
dams on the system. Woodruff is the first
one that was built in 1957. Followed by, I

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.570
believe, Walter F George and Andrews at about
the same time, 1962 timeframe. This dam has

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:15.710
three turbines that provide about 43 megawatt
hours of generation through the turbines.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:24.340
It's part of a network that ties into our
power systems in the Florida area and we work

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:28.680
with the Southeastern Power Administration,
which is the government marketing agency to

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.729
market the power generated here to preference
customers which are small utilities located

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:41.729
in the rural areas. The energy generated from
the project helps to pay for the project itself.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.540
The revenues generated from the energy goes
back to the US Treasury which in turn funds

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.950
the project to provide operation and maintenance.
On the upper end of the system, of course,

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.600
in the metro Atlanta area is the issue of
water supply. Lake Lanier on the upper end

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.610
of the system at the headwaters of the ACF
system provides water supply for the metro

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:10.369
Atlanta area which has continued to grow.
And in the mid to late 80's that became a

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.849
contentious issue which prompted the lawsuits
against the Corps by the States of Alabama,

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:22.849
Florida and Georgia. And it's referred to
as the water wars. And so to try to meet the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.409
needs of that metro area, we've had to operate
the projects to try and supply water supply

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:33.889
while still trying to meet all the other project
purposes. At the upper end of the system you

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:40.510
have several lakes that support flood control
and water quality of the water supply, so

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:47.510
the entire system has to take a look at all
those demands on the system and try to meet

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:54.319
those as best we can. During times of increased
flows like we're experiencing right now, where

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.400
it's kind of in the flood season, that's not
a problem because you've got adequate water,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.370
but when you get into the drought conditions,
that's when the problems arise. Because there's

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:10.019
just not enough water for every purpose to
be fully met. For instance, during droughts,

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:16.459
navigation tends to decline and become nonexistent
because there's just not enough water to support

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:23.349
navigation. And then the other purposes, hydropower,
water supply and water quality become limited

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:30.349
due to the drought conditions. And then it's
a balancing act, trying to meet those purposes

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:38.769
and be equitable to all the needs on the system.
One of our biggest challenges here at the

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:46.049
project is in the lake itself we have invasive
plants that are non-native species, hydrilla

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:54.269
and several other plants that tend to inundate
areas around the shoreline and becomes a hazard

00:03:55.879 --> 00:04:02.129
for boaters and fisherman. And then during
high water, here is when all this grass breaks

00:04:02.129 --> 00:04:07.959
loose, they start to clog up the turbines
and present a problem there. What you see,

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:14.689
just in the tailrace is some remnants of water
hyacinth and other weeds that have come through

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:21.689
the dam and found its way downstream. On the
other stream side, especially in appearance

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:28.020
when it's really bad, it will be so bad that
they have to shut off the turbines, rake some

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:35.020
of these weeds out and pull them away from
the turbines so that we can get the most efficient

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.490
use of the turbines.
