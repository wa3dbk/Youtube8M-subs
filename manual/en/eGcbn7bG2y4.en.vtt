00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:02.379
What is up people?

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.810
It's currently Thursday the 3rd January and
true to form over here in the UK, it's currently

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:12.389
lashing it down with rain and it's chuffing
cold to boot!

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.070
Now, before I get into the topic at hand,
which is "how to get more views on your YouTube

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:23.009
videos" I just want to touch upon the gameplay
in the background: it's obviously Black Ops

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:28.329
2, playing some CTF on Slums and it was recorded
during launch week. Which means the only thing

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.790
I know is that I was playing the objective.
This video has been in my bookmarks for a

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.360
while so I'm hoping it is fairly entertaining
to watch.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.070
Now, let's get down to business.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.000
Some of you might know this already but most
of you won't: in the real world I'm actually

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.519
paid to teach people the art - and it's definitely
an art and not a science - of search engine

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.070
optimisation. Which means it's up to me to
show them how to get their website to the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:53.980
top of Google.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.949
In a nutshell, search engine optimisation
is about three things. The subject is often

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.339
shrouded in mystery but really it's quite
simple.

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:09.860
First of all, you have your on site SEO, which
is everything you can see on a website plus

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.900
something called the "meta description".

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.910
Second you have your off-site SEO, which is
any reference to your website elsewhere on

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.900
the internet, whether it's a forum, a blog,
a directory, whatever else - that is all considered

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:23.550
off-site SEO.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:30.550
Third, and finally, you have your code and,
in short, clean code is good code. If a website

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:36.860
loads quickly then it's much better in terms
of search engine optimisation than one that

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.990
takes forever and a day.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.570
Now, I might come back to these at a later
date if the video goes well, but for now I

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.760
just want to draw parralels between those
three things and YouTube which is, believe

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.580
it or not, the second biggest search engine.

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:58.270
Between Google and YouTube they have 98.5
per cent of the search market on a daily basis,

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.360
so they pretty much dominate.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:06.360
And in particular, I want to talk about on-site
SEO from a YouTube perspective. Now, this

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.890
covers: the title, the description, the video
tags, the thumbnail and the video itself.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.659
And, without doubt, the biggest mistake people
make when they are uploading their video is

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:25.620
to not use the description feature as well
as they could.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.829
So, here's the tip. Here is the top tip from
this video: when you are uploading a YouTube

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:38.200
video you optimise the first two to three
sentences of your video's description.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:44.060
And when I say optmise I mean make it a really
concise summary of what your video is all

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:51.060
about. Now that is not to say spam keywords,
you need to make this thing read well. And

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.370
here is why.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:03:01.370
When you put your video description into YouTube,
Google will take the first 160 characters

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:07.609
as the meta description. Now this is what
Google uses to determine, along with the video

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.170
title and tags admittedly, what your video
is all about.

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.499
So if you have for example two identical videos
with the same title and same tags, if one

00:03:16.499 --> 00:03:20.620
video starts with a concise description and
one starts with links to social media and

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:27.269
a t-shirt website for example, then the one
with the concise description will out perform

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:28.379
the other one.

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:35.379
Now, the second reason is the first 120 characters
are shown next to your video in any given

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.980
YouTube search. And if you have a well written
description - one that reads well - that will

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.349
potentially encourage someone to click on
your video as opposed to one that might appear

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.159
above it in the YouTube search results.

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:56.939
Now, as I said before, YouTube and Google
search engine optimisation is an art: it's

00:03:56.939 --> 00:04:02.409
not a science, so there's no right or wrong
way. But I can - almost - guarantee you that

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.519
by tweaking your meta descriptions you will
see an increase in views.

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:10.900
And the reason that I say "almost" is that
any SEO or anyone that is involved in SEO

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:15.859
that says they can guarantee results - they
are lying. There is never any guarantee in

00:04:15.859 --> 00:04:19.950
search engine optmisation. I can tell you
that, right now.

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.850
However, to try and prove the point that what
I'm talking about really works, I am going

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:31.840
to upload this video twice. Once to this channel,
my gaming channel, and once elsewhere on a

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:38.840
personal channel that I have. And in a month's
time I will compare the amount of hits that

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:44.590
both videos get from search only. And the
main difference between the two - I'm going

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:49.170
to use the same video footage, the same title,
the same tags - is that in the video on my

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:55.260
gaming channel I will use a concise description
where as in the one on the other channel I

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.380
will open up with links to my social media
profiles.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.290
So, hopefully you guys enjoyed this video.
If you like it, I'm happy to go into all sorts

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:07.100
of other stuff on search engine optimisation.
If anyone is thinking about starting a business

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.990
this stuff is really important because it
helps you get out there.

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.980
Anyway, I might come back to that at a later
date. In any event, I will see you in around

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.090
about a month to see the results of this test.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:17.710
Later.
