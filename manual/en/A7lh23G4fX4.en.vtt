00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.210
[SOFT BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.700
To me as a dance moving theatre artist

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.169
calaboration not really an option, there is no working alone

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:17.009
the idea of an artist in residency in a school really appealed to me

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:20.009
but as a theatre artist I can't do that by myself

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.960
I have to work with other people from my practice

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.619
dance is a communication, it is a sharing

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.409
and it is an investigation of the space between me and another person

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:36.479
so the idea of being given time to figure out what that space between 

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:40.159
the two of us as artists could be was what called both Julie and I

00:00:40.159 --> 00:00:42.159
to the AIR residency to begin with

00:00:42.159 --> 00:00:48.890
[SOFT BACKGROUND MUSIC]

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:53.070
when meeting Kelly we had real similarities in our work

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.480
We're both physical based - but hers is much more physical and abstract and mine leads into the text

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:02.710
so it seems like we had a nice place to meet together

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.530
I thrive and I create best

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.300
in that friction of rubbing up against

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.870
somebody else's ideas

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.680
and that that is really exciting place

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.750
I'm not a performer - I'm a director

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.070
but in this environment I've been a performer

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:21.330
and that has challenged

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:27.320
but it's made me re-look my practice again from different perspective as well

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.210
we sit in an office together

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.710
twice a week - and talk

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.570
which has a dance artist is fantastic

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.970
because usually I'm just interested in the verbs - give me the words so I can go do something

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.270
but to have to actually sit and say what are we doing and why are it

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.460
and how could he do it differently and what just happened at lunch time

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.380
When we came to Kingston we really just took some time to look around

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.300
and get a feel of the place and see what happened

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.290
we came into the residence with this idea of 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.040
being given gifts, and originally that was going to be physical gifts

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.960
but it very quickly became this school was the gift

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.810
it's a very unique environment - it's very new

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.239
and there's a lot about it that we've been responding to

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.379
The gift was the architecture - was the place of this school

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:15.760
and was the community of people in it

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.180
both students and teachers.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.999
We've just moved to a brand new site here

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:24.020
we've kind of picked up all our old staff

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.189
and moved to this beautiful new facility

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:29.499
the whole site

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.719
is about 750 meters long

00:02:31.719 --> 00:02:34.879
so it's quite a way from one end to the other

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.430
so without any overt markings

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.909
we've discovered that

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:43.739
students have separated themselves along
the length of the school.

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.180
We see this learning street

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:49.359
and the pods - grade 7 at the bottom of the hill

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:52.899
and they stay predominantly there in their pod - they might zig-zag a little

00:02:52.899 --> 00:02:57.589
but basically as you work your way through the high school, you work your way up the hill

00:02:57.589 --> 00:03:02.259
our first group were largely grade 9 and 10 students out of one drama class

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:06.069
and then we did a call to the whole school saying - who else would like a go

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.839
and we ended up with grade 7's and grade 10's

00:03:09.839 --> 00:03:12.639
and a few grade 9's and they didn't know each other

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:17.179
so a lot of the work became about how do you connect, how do you get to know somebody.

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:21.639
So we've done a lot of impulse work, we've done choreographic dance work with them

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:25.289
but always with an improvised element to it

00:03:25.289 --> 00:03:29.859
and we play performance games and turn them into performances

00:03:29.859 --> 00:03:33.749
we're trying to give them the skills to have the confidence to play outside

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:37.089
infront of their peers to encourage their peers to join in

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:39.729
so that the performance becomes

00:03:39.729 --> 00:03:44.609
an opportunity to enguage and join in a sense of community.

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:52.819
It's just been like - awesome, getting to know heaps of new people and having that sort of bond

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.159
I get really nervous

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:59.159
so it was quite scary but once we'd worked with Kelly and Julie for awhile 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:06.159
it was good to just do whatever and have no shame

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:08.549
the fact that they're working

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.819
publicly caused a bit of a challenge from time to time

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:13.199
I think the first time

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:18.869
they went out there was some concern they would create mobs of students 

00:04:18.869 --> 00:04:21.820
because if a big congregation like that happens it usually means

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.459
something bad is happening

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:24.810
but it meant that kind of went

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.270
 - you know is it OK if students gather

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.009
and form these tight groups, how do we feel about that - just to question 

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:35.520
I think is a really useful thing

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.959
It was crazy - everyone was following them around

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:42.669
it was just amazing to see what everone else thought of what they were doing

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.840
because we all have our own opinions and stuff

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.890
whether they're a crazy lady or doing some cool kind of art movement kind of piece

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:53.850
Julie just did that thing where she moves really slowly

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.729
and after awhile people were like - hang on, wasn't she there?

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:01.250
The beautiful thing about performance
is that there's nothing left

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:04.580
you do it and it's gone, it's live performance

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:09.650
so we thought let's figure out ways to articulate that and try to capture it in the moment in some sense so we can return to it

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.059
so we started a blog

00:05:12.059 --> 00:05:15.759
so we've got this history basically once
a week sometimes more

00:05:15.759 --> 00:05:17.969
we both posted to that blog

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:19.900
it's been a beautiful way

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.460
of figuring out how do we translate what we're doing to different communities

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:25.469
and different audiences

00:05:25.469 --> 00:05:29.169
and perhaps the blog is another attempt at that translation

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.089
what we have done physically or what we thought about

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:34.289
or what we've talked about

00:05:34.289 --> 00:05:38.650
into this virtual world which others can share in

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:43.259
this residency has been about experiment and exploration

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.169
but it's brought us to a point where we go -

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:49.520
yes we want to continue this

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.539
the most interesting is a new compound

00:05:51.539 --> 00:05:55.119
that we don't compromise in any way - who we are or what we're doing

00:05:55.119 --> 00:05:57.189
we're not looking for a mix

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:01.249
but what is really Julie and Kelly what
if you put those two things together

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:06.160
what new compund have we created, and so with more time I'll be ready to see what that

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.220
compound can grow and what it can contribute

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:15.800
both to us as individual artists but also the art that we are determined to make
