00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:14.000
Hey everyone!

00:00:14.201 --> 00:00:15.101
My name is Rus.

00:00:15.302 --> 00:00:19.702
I’m from Russian Rockers and now I’m going to tell you about Moscow Rocking Tour.

00:00:26.503 --> 00:00:27.403
Before I’ll start,

00:00:27.504 --> 00:00:30.704
I’d like to tell you some few words about who the Russian Rockers are?

00:00:31.005 --> 00:00:32.705
And where they came from?

00:00:33.706 --> 00:00:37.006
Russian Rockers are association of people who like Melbourne Shuffle.

00:00:38.007 --> 00:00:40.007
We got together in 2012.

00:00:41.908 --> 00:00:43.808
There are 4 talented persons such as Rus,

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:51.209
Boris,

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.310
Vall

00:01:03.511 --> 00:01:04.211
and Danila.

00:01:10.512 --> 00:01:15.312
You could hear about us under nicknames like B.R.O.M., Slider, Kakao and Nixon.

00:01:16.513 --> 00:01:18.013
Until the time we’ve got together,

00:01:18.514 --> 00:01:21.014
we were dancing singly, by ourselves.

00:01:23.015 --> 00:01:26.015
We were communicating in social Network and helping to each other.

00:01:29.216 --> 00:01:31.016
Then we decided that we should unite together.

00:01:33.817 --> 00:01:36.317
So we’ve got the group of good dancers and friends.

00:01:39.818 --> 00:01:42.018
Now I’m going to tell you about Moscow Rocking Tour.

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:49.519
Moscow Rocking Tour is series of videos that me and Boris shooted in February.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.820
We’ve found the beautiful abandoned building

00:01:58.221 --> 00:01:59.821
and decided to shoot it there.

00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:05.022
I'll show you some of the backstage scenes.

00:02:10.523 --> 00:02:11.223
Let's go!

00:02:13.224 --> 00:02:14.724
Look at him.

00:02:19.825 --> 00:02:20.225
Again!

00:02:21.126 --> 00:02:22.026
Come on Rus, let's go!

00:02:24.827 --> 00:02:25.427
Look at him.

00:02:30.828 --> 00:02:31.728
Ok, alright, listen to me!

00:02:37.729 --> 00:02:39.129
Come on, let's go!

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.130
Look at him.

00:02:46.131 --> 00:02:47.231
Haha! Enough Rus!

00:02:54.632 --> 00:02:55.732
F*ckin' earphone!

00:03:05.333 --> 00:03:06.533
D'oh!

00:03:12.134 --> 00:03:18.034
(Boris is trying to repeat Hiltzy's dance for fun)

00:03:24.635 --> 00:03:26.235
It was really interesting and good day,

00:03:27.536 --> 00:03:30.336
we had some fun and also we will continue this project.

00:03:37.137 --> 00:03:38.137
Thanks for your attention,

00:03:38.538 --> 00:03:39.538
it was Rus,

00:03:40.139 --> 00:03:41.039
greetings from Russian Rockers

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.040
and see you later.
