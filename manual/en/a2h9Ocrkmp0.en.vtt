This is Sony Xperia Tablet Z. We will play with it for a quick hands-on review.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:21.200
The display of the tablet is covered by tempered glass which makes it extremely glare. When the screen if turned off the protective glass looks like almost a mirror.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.800
Xperia Tablet Z comes with magnificient display of 1200x1920 pixels resolution which makes is among the leaders on the market. The overall sharpness and picture contrast is quite balanced.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.800
You can rely on great responsiveness and fast reaction at every touch. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.800
There is Android 4.2 Jelly Bean onboard with some Sony modifications and special UI.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:07.800
The embedded software has wide selection of preloaded widgets for the home screen. For example - weather widget is showing animations and personalized content.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:20.800
Xperia Tablet Z comes with the same design language as Xperia Z smartphone. Actually, it looks like bigger Xperia Z wih the same shape and frame construction.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:45.800
Chrome browser is coming by default, but it still lacks flash support (exactly as Xperia Z smartphone). Having in mind this disadvantage, we like it - easy to use and pretty fast.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:27.800
The infrared port is returning back to the mobile industry - there is such built in! A special "Remote control" application has been developed for controlling your tv, dvd, stb other 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:50.800
When started for the first use, you have to "add" the device you want to control through the dedicated menu. We will add TV now... You can choose not only Sony branded appliance, but various brands are under the list for selection.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:19.800
Now, we will add the main controls for gestures use. There is no need for locking/unlocking the screen for using the common functions under gesture control.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:33.800
You can change the skin upon your desire and mood as well. When you finish the wizard process, an icon of your added device is displayed under Remote Control application.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.800
This is the control panel. You can switch on/off your TV, increase the volume or change the channel by your Xperia Z tablet.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:57.800
Now, we will add second device under the remote control - a DVD player. The same wide selection between different brands and types is existing. 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.800
The list is displaying already added devices, ready to control.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:20.800
A remote control icon is placed in bottom. When opened, a widget appears on the screen with most functions and common buttons.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:05:02.800
All types of videos and movies are looking really impressive on the HD screen. The picture is vivid and sharp. If 10' screen is not enought for you, you can share content (pictures, movies etc.) to your home TV with no need for cables.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:46.800
The virtual keyboard is very well realized. All buttons have island type separation. Text prediction is switched on as default.

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:42.800
A clear audio function can be set on for better sound. The tablet has stereo speakers which are producing sufficient sound quality for non-rigorous users.

00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:02.800
