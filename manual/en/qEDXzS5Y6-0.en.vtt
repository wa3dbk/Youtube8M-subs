00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.751
Let’s talk about getting that first kiss in a bar or on a date.

00:00:02.768 --> 00:00:11.114
And there’s a simple, well, maybe simple process to this
and it comes with understanding how to dance.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.554
I’m not talking about how to dance physically.
I’m talking about dance emotionally.

00:00:15.554 --> 00:00:18.981
When you can actually look in somebody’s eyes 
and if you can hold that eye contact

00:00:18.981 --> 00:00:23.320
and you relax in your body, you’re going to 
start to feel this tension between you and another person.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.302
Especially the beautiful woman you’re looking at.

00:00:25.302 --> 00:00:30.292
And if you’re really getting good with
women, you should start to be able to enjoy that tension.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.018
You'll want to be able to relax into it and enjoy it. Let yourself feel it.

00:00:34.018 --> 00:00:35.747
And that tension is like surfing.

00:00:35.747 --> 00:00:41.127
When you’re surfing on a surfboard, you’ve got to
be able to feel the movement of the wave.

00:00:41.134 --> 00:00:43.992
And how it’s moving and you’ve got to 
adjust to it any given moment:

00:00:43.992 --> 00:00:48.127
left, right, up, down, - however 
you’ve got to move to get that board,

00:00:48.127 --> 00:00:50.016
to get yourself from wiping out.

00:00:50.044 --> 00:00:53.575
It’s true in almost any sport if you’re riding 
motocross, you’ve got to feel the bike.

00:00:53.902 --> 00:00:56.433
If you’re jumping out of a plane and you’re surfing the air,

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.321
you can fly it through the air like superman 
by just adjusting your body, and floating on the wind.

00:01:00.321 --> 00:01:03.079
Well this tension is in everything. It’s also in communication.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.254
If you’re doing standup comedy, you’re going to
feel the tension with the audience or public speaking,

00:01:07.254 --> 00:01:10.410
you’re going to feel that tension and you’ve 
got to bounce off and relate to it.

00:01:10.893 --> 00:01:12.812
Well, when you’re talking to a girl, it’s the same thing.

00:01:12.812 --> 00:01:16.477
As you’re talking to her, you’re going to feel that 
tension building between you two.

00:01:16.477 --> 00:01:22.029
Your job is to just step into it a little bit and hold it. And watch her.

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:26.813
She might start to get more nervous, she might start 
to giggle, she might start to look away.

00:01:26.813 --> 00:01:28.713
Your job is to relax into it.

00:01:28.713 --> 00:01:33.959
And the more you relax into it, and just wait and be
patient and give her some space

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:38.922
without letting your head roll and think a lot, 
the more she’s going to get relaxed.

00:01:38.922 --> 00:01:42.886
It might take a few seconds, 30 seconds, a minute,
and she’s going to start to get more relaxed.

00:01:42.986 --> 00:01:46.781
It might take a few minutes, and you continue 
to enjoy the moment with her,

00:01:46.781 --> 00:01:51.622
talk about little things, because really the tension’s doing all the work.

00:01:51.622 --> 00:01:57.737
And as you step in again, getting closer, pushing a
little further, she’s going to start to enjoy it more and more.

00:01:57.854 --> 00:01:59.840
She’s going to get more turned on.

00:01:59.914 --> 00:02:05.733
And she may get more nervous again and your job again
is to sit and stop right at that point like a train on track

00:02:05.733 --> 00:02:10.349
and just relax for a little bit, let her get comfortable
in it and then you move forward again.

00:02:10.454 --> 00:02:14.248
Now you may find that some girl loves tension.

00:02:14.248 --> 00:02:19.540
And you start to push it and all she does is get – 
look at you deeper, get more attracted, more turned on,

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.288
and in that case, you’re doing really well.

00:02:23.288 --> 00:02:27.319
And you’ve got to realize that some girls, might 
even be a little better at this than you.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.633
And your job is to start to relax even more. 
They’ll be the ones that teach you to be more solid as a man.

00:02:32.633 --> 00:02:36.534
And you keep moving forward. And if you keep 
working this tension like taffy and you feel it.

00:02:36.584 --> 00:02:39.666
The eye contact between her, the touch between you and her,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.055
you’re not thinking a lot-you’re feeling it. Then what’s going to happen is

00:02:43.055 --> 00:02:46.650
you two are going to pull closer and closer
together and eventually you’re going to kiss.

00:02:46.698 --> 00:02:49.248
Just keep feeling that and you enjoy that moment.

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.597
If you can’t feel this tension I’m talking about...if 
you’re not aware of it, it’s like if you’re an athlete

00:02:54.597 --> 00:02:57.980
and you can’t feel the wave for some reason, you’re
just falling off the board all the time

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.837
because you just can’t figure out what people are talking about,

00:02:59.837 --> 00:03:02.695
like when I used to be in my head a lot and 
I couldn’t stay on time dancing,

00:03:02.826 --> 00:03:05.924
Because I couldn’t feel the rhythm, that’s something you can learn.

00:03:05.924 --> 00:03:08.019
That’s something you can pick up and I encourage you to get up

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:11.913
to the next gathering and start learning about this concept.

00:03:11.913 --> 00:03:17.431
What it is to play and dance with tension, because 
to a woman, that’s what it’s all about.

00:03:17.431 --> 00:03:19.661
That’s what she’s looking for when she goes on a date.

00:03:19.661 --> 00:03:21.452
That’s what she’s looking for when she meets you in a bar.

00:03:21.516 --> 00:03:24.645
That’s what she’s looking for before she’s going to let you kiss her.
