00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Welcome to New Mombasa

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.068
Bip, Bap, Bam

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.250
This is Firefight

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.750
And we need every able we can get,

00:00:31.164 --> 00:00:31.900
Even yours.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.675
you boys can thank me later right now i got something to do.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.650
Lucky for you your squad is the best of the best

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.900
Orbital Drop Shock Troopers

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.909
Problem is we got alien bastards in our house

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.780
Each new wave means more bad guys

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.200
Five waves make up a round

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.480
Three rounds in a set

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.200
Sounds easy, huh?

00:00:51.218 --> 00:00:52.418
Wrong!

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.000
See these skulls?

00:00:54.488 --> 00:00:55.638
When they activate

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:57.400
They turn a casual covenant make-out session

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.000
Into a full-on test of your manly prowess

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:04.193
Catch makes the enemy toss grenades like it going out of style

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.100
Black-Eye only way your getting health back

00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:08.400
Is to walk up and punch an alien in the chin

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:09.808
And the others?

00:01:10.565 --> 00:01:11.865
Lets just say they call them 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.440
Difficulty Multipliers for a reason 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:17.750
As long as your feeling cooperative 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.200
There ain't no need to go it alone

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.500
Get cozy with up to four players

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:23.501
Over system link or xbox live and firefight

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.700
with your friends through ten battlefields

00:01:25.555 --> 00:01:27.000
All over New Mombasa.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.250
But its not just about greasing bad guys

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:34.905
Sometimes its all about the glory

00:01:35.162 --> 00:01:37.862
But your boot up enough alien backsides

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.000
 and the Corps will pin rows of medals on your chest

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.600
Might even earn some achievements too

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.300
"Bad Ass Unlocked"

00:01:44.146 --> 00:01:46.150
Now i know what you're thinking

00:01:46.057 --> 00:01:48.860
"Sergent Major Johnson these sound like

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.350
overwhelming odds i don't wanna drop

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.820
Into hell without an airtight insurance policy"

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.330

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.280

Me! that's right

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.240
The toughest, cigar choppiness marine there is

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.660
Yours to play in FIrefight

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.400
Here we go, next wave coming in.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.440
Get set troopers, this is gonna get hot.
