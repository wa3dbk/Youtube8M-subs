00:00:00.693 --> 00:00:01.930
- [Carl] You gotta chew 'em up

00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:02.890
and swallow them all

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:04.708
in less than a minute.

00:00:04.708 --> 00:00:06.861
(playful music)

00:00:06.861 --> 00:00:09.019
(laughing)

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.686
(dubstep music)

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:18.956
Hey, guys!

00:00:18.956 --> 00:00:19.895
- What?
- What?

00:00:19.895 --> 00:00:21.839
- [Carl] Have you ever had
a Ferrero Rocher chocolate,

00:00:21.839 --> 00:00:22.871
or however you say it?

00:00:22.871 --> 00:00:23.704
- No.
- No.

00:00:24.912 --> 00:00:25.790
- [Carl] They're delicious.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:26.720
And guess what?

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.553
- What?

00:00:27.553 --> 00:00:29.228
- [Carl] The world
record is nine chocolates

00:00:29.228 --> 00:00:31.252
in less than one minute.

00:00:31.252 --> 00:00:32.355
But you guys are gonna try and do

00:00:32.355 --> 00:00:34.753
four chocolates in less than one minute.

00:00:34.753 --> 00:00:36.241
Do you have a timer on your phone, Ginger?

00:00:36.241 --> 00:00:37.549
- [Ginger] I've got a timer!

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:39.966
- [Carl] Okay, are you ready?

00:00:41.035 --> 00:00:41.868
Get set!

00:00:43.578 --> 00:00:44.669
Go!

00:00:44.669 --> 00:00:48.862
(candy wrappers crinkling)

00:00:48.862 --> 00:00:51.012
They have to be swallowed.

00:00:51.012 --> 00:00:52.628
- [Ginger] Chew faster!

00:00:52.628 --> 00:00:53.722
- [Carl] You gotta chew 'em up

00:00:53.722 --> 00:00:57.587
and swallow them all
in less than a minute.

00:00:57.587 --> 00:01:00.170
(all giggling)

00:01:06.487 --> 00:01:08.154
You're over halfway.

00:01:10.064 --> 00:01:11.404
(all laughing)

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:14.964
40, wait, you're at 35 seconds, right?

00:01:14.964 --> 00:01:18.210
Oh, it's counting down! Sorry.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.877
(playful music)

00:01:21.736 --> 00:01:22.592
Go, go, go!

00:01:22.592 --> 00:01:23.425
Go, go, go!

00:01:23.425 --> 00:01:24.406
Go, go, go!

00:01:24.406 --> 00:01:25.665
You have 20 seconds left.

00:01:25.665 --> 00:01:26.608
Can you do the last?

00:01:26.608 --> 00:01:28.691
Can you swallow them all?

00:01:29.536 --> 00:01:32.119
(all laughing)

00:01:33.643 --> 00:01:35.310
Go, Gage, go!

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.393
Go, Gage, go!

00:01:37.344 --> 00:01:38.339
Go, Kyle, go!

00:01:38.339 --> 00:01:39.512
You look like a chipmunk

00:01:39.512 --> 00:01:42.648
that ate a big mouthful of poop.

00:01:42.648 --> 00:01:44.834
(all laughing)

00:01:44.834 --> 00:01:46.219
(timer beeping)

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:47.121
Oh!
- [Ginger] Oh!

00:01:47.121 --> 00:01:47.954
- [Carl] Time's up! Open your mouth!

00:01:47.954 --> 00:01:50.537
(all laughing)

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:52.603
Not quite.

00:01:52.603 --> 00:01:53.808
Can you believe

00:01:53.808 --> 00:01:55.302
that a man named Furious Pete

00:01:55.302 --> 00:01:57.672
did nine in one minute?

00:01:57.672 --> 00:01:58.716
You guys did four.

00:01:58.716 --> 00:01:59.730
That's crazy, huh?

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.289
Did they taste delicious, though?

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.595
They do, huh?

00:02:03.595 --> 00:02:07.518
Alright, now me and mom are gonna try.

00:02:07.518 --> 00:02:09.511
Now the rule is you
can't open the wrappers.

00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:11.158
When the time starts,

00:02:11.158 --> 00:02:12.933
you have to open them each individually,

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:14.196
eat them each individually,

00:02:14.196 --> 00:02:16.906
and open your mouth in between each one.

00:02:16.906 --> 00:02:17.989
- Oh, really?

00:02:18.863 --> 00:02:19.727
- Ah! Like that.

00:02:19.727 --> 00:02:20.745
Yep.

00:02:20.745 --> 00:02:21.618
And it does--

00:02:21.618 --> 00:02:22.451
- I'm pretty sure I've done
this before on Christmas.

00:02:22.451 --> 00:02:24.039
When you got me that big case of 'em.

00:02:24.039 --> 00:02:25.299
- Yeah.

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:26.132
- I'm sure I've done that in a minute.

00:02:26.132 --> 00:02:27.188
- But, Guinness wasn't
watching and they are now.

00:02:27.188 --> 00:02:28.132
- That's true.

00:02:28.132 --> 00:02:29.085
- Are you ready?

00:02:29.085 --> 00:02:30.229
- Okay, ready?

00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:31.446
Timer's ready.

00:02:31.446 --> 00:02:32.449
- Okay.

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:33.585
My goal's just to beat you.

00:02:33.585 --> 00:02:34.418
I know I'm not gonna beat Furious Pete.

00:02:34.418 --> 00:02:35.251
- What?

00:02:35.251 --> 00:02:36.163
- Yeah.
- Puh-lease.

00:02:36.163 --> 00:02:38.193
- Game on! Ready?

00:02:38.193 --> 00:02:39.385
- One, two, three.

00:02:39.385 --> 00:02:41.668
(candy wrappers crinkling)

00:02:41.668 --> 00:02:43.307
- You didn't even say
go, you just said three.

00:02:43.307 --> 00:02:44.224
Oh my gosh!

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:51.924
(chewing loudly)

00:02:51.924 --> 00:02:52.757
- No way!

00:02:54.202 --> 00:02:55.035
Ah!

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.290
Mmm, delicious!

00:02:58.566 --> 00:03:01.962
(kids laughing)

00:03:01.962 --> 00:03:04.629
(playful music)

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.473
Ah!

00:03:07.466 --> 00:03:08.883
We tied that one.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:17.320
(laughing)

00:03:19.214 --> 00:03:20.047
Ah!

00:03:20.995 --> 00:03:24.662
(candy wrappers crinkling)

00:03:30.624 --> 00:03:31.457
Ahh!

00:03:35.246 --> 00:03:36.079
No way!

00:03:37.548 --> 00:03:40.119
(Carl groaning)

00:03:40.119 --> 00:03:41.130
(timer beeping)

00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.541
- Oh my gosh!

00:03:42.541 --> 00:03:44.041
- My jaw is tired.

00:03:45.558 --> 00:03:46.845
- Look at all the chocolate I ate,

00:03:46.845 --> 00:03:48.319
and I didn't even taste it!

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:49.585
- You didn't even enjoy.

00:03:49.585 --> 00:03:51.526
(laughing)

00:03:51.526 --> 00:03:53.127
Wow!

00:03:53.127 --> 00:03:53.960
- Shucks!

00:03:55.002 --> 00:03:56.528
- Those were delicious chocolates.

00:03:56.528 --> 00:03:59.015
- This is just the pits!

00:03:59.015 --> 00:04:00.127
I mean--

00:04:00.127 --> 00:04:01.596
- We got all these chocolates left over.

00:04:01.596 --> 00:04:02.950
- Look at these chocolates
we have left over.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.658
- Let's just see if we can eat them all.

00:04:04.658 --> 00:04:07.856
- What are we gonna do
with all this chocolate?

00:04:07.856 --> 00:04:09.918
I mean, really.

00:04:09.918 --> 00:04:12.353
Sometimes I think to myself, why am I fat?

00:04:12.353 --> 00:04:14.094
(kids laughing)

00:04:14.094 --> 00:04:15.241
- I'm gonna hide these two for later

00:04:15.241 --> 00:04:17.349
and then sneak 'em when you're not around.

00:04:17.349 --> 00:04:18.999
- No, because I'm gonna eat all of mine,

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:21.108
and I'm gonna eat all of yours.

00:04:21.108 --> 00:04:22.853
- I have a third one right here.

00:04:22.853 --> 00:04:25.020
I have three. Right here.

00:04:27.795 --> 00:04:30.323
This is a fun challenge
that even kids can do.

00:04:30.323 --> 00:04:32.024
And there is an actual, legitimate

00:04:32.024 --> 00:04:34.033
Guinness Book of World
Records record for this,

00:04:34.033 --> 00:04:36.020
nine in one minute.

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.187
- And they're so delicious.
- So delicious.

00:04:38.187 --> 00:04:41.072
- This is seriously what
Carl gives me for Christmas.

00:04:41.072 --> 00:04:42.661
I love these candies.

00:04:42.661 --> 00:04:43.835
- That's right, they are so good.

00:04:43.835 --> 00:04:45.048
This is probably the funnest

00:04:45.048 --> 00:04:47.257
and easiest challenge for us yet.

00:04:47.257 --> 00:04:48.090
- Best one.

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.120
- Try this with your kids at home,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.933
make a video, come post
it on our Facebook page.

00:04:51.933 --> 00:04:54.873
We have a Facebook, Instagram,
and Twitter account,

00:04:54.873 --> 00:04:56.410
so links are all down in the description.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:57.809
If you want to buy an Olinselot t-shirt,

00:04:57.809 --> 00:05:00.443
you can go get one, or
a mug, or even a hat,

00:05:00.443 --> 00:05:02.590
got all kinds of cool stuff.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:03.572
And we'll see you next time.

00:05:03.572 --> 00:05:04.405
- See ya!

00:05:04.405 --> 00:05:07.072
