Hi I'm Kim from Simply Beautiful in Austin,
Texas. Let's talk a little bit about how to

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.850
unclog those pores. It's really important
to get those pores unclogged because that's

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:16.600
the leading cause of blemishes and acne. So
you want to do everything you can to get them

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:24.060
unclogged so the oil glands can flow freely
and you won't have any breakouts. The most

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.700
important thing is to keep your daily regimen.
Twice a day cleanse with a gentle cleanser.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.000
I really, really recommend Acetaphil, it's
a very nice cleanser. Tone with an alcohol-free

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.590
toner. I'm going to recommend that you use
a oil-free moisturizer so it doesn't clog

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:48.870
the pores any further. Important is that you
exfoliate your skin once or twice a week.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.170
If you have breakouts then once a week is
going to be enough and press only very gently.

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.120
So I'm going to demonstrate on Megan's hand
how to do that. I'm going to tone, then we're

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.880
going to take a dime size of a very gently
exfoliater. The beads in this exfoliater are

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:12.759
perfectly round so they won't tear up your
skin. Very gently in a circular motions all

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:20.279
around your face. Don't forget the jawline,
the chin, around your nose, really important.

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:27.859
So what we're doing is sweeping away the dead
skin in this process. Once we have that done

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:34.719
you want to rinse it off with some warm water,
just splash your face a few times, get those

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:43.709
beads right off. While your skin is still
damp I want you to follow it up with a mud

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:49.880
mask. Your choice, just a mud mask. There's
lots of them on the market. Borgepha has a

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.539
really, really good one I love it. In the
case of this mask, for this cause, we're going

00:01:56.539 --> 00:02:03.119
to put it on a little bit thicker. You don't
want to be able to see your skin through it.

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.690
Just spread it. Don't forget all the areas.
Get in the creases of your nose, on your chin,

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:14.140
on your forehead, any place that tends to
breakout especially thick. So leave this on

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:21.660
for about 10 minutes, don't let it dry, and
then rinse it off with warm water. Follow

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.190
that with a splash of cool water. And then
go back over with your toner. Your skin's

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:33.180
going to be free of dead skin cells and your
pores will appear much tighter and you'll

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.670
have more of a flawless finish.
