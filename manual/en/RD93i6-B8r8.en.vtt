about what really

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:18.580
happened.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:19.180
It's the video, seen by

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:21.060
tens of thousands, since

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.620

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.430
readily admits he cut off

Kimberly Ong, then began

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.060

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:39.510
her rage. BEEP BEEP!

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.240
When the two wind up at a

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.140
stop sign, he honks...and

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:46.740
she storms right up to

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.210
his window ... WHEN YOU

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:49.740
CUT ME OFF I ALMOST

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:50.280
BLEEPING WRECKED YOU

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.690
BLEEP!!!! FILM THIS!

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.390
DON'T TOUCH ME! DON'T

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.950
TOUCH ME!

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:00.490
YOU CAN HEAR ME ON THE

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.090
VIDEO SAYING, THAT'S

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.660
ASSAULT, THAT'S ASSAULT

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.990
BUT SHE REALLY DIDN'T

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.560
CARE SHE WAS PRETTY MUCH

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:06.490
OFF ON THE DEEP END

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.790
ALREADY SHE WAS PRETTY

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.400
UPSET.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.370
3222 I WAS REALLY MAD

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.900
BECAUSE JUST FOR THE LACK

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.670
OF CONCERN AND HE'S

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:15.670
REVERSEDING AND TRYING TO

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.300
CRASH ME. Even with the

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.940
video, it's still a case

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:21.510
of he said, she said. He

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.140
says, she overreacted

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.080
after he cut in front of

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.710
her, a move he made

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.110
because she wasn't moving

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.250
with traffic.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.850
SHE WASN'T PAYING

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.450
ATTENTION AND I CUT IN

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.050
FRONT OF HER OR CHANGED

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.920
LANES TO GET IN FRONT OF

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:33.450
HER AND SHE PROBABLY

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.620
LOOKED UP, PROBABLY

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:36.160
STEPPED ON THE GAS AND

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.290
PROBABLY ALMOST REAR

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:38.860
ENDED ME AND PROBABLY WAS

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.460
UPSET THAT SHE HAD HER

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:42.300
SON IN THE CAR AND ALMOST

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.930
GOT INTO AN CAR ACCIDENT.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.300
She says, it was entirely

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.730
his fault.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.330
EVEN MY SON SAID, AUSTIN

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.680
THE GUY STARTED IT, MY

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:52.210
SON WAS ALSO UPSET. WE

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.560
WERE BOTH IN SHOCK THAT

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.450
HE TRIED TO REVERSE AND

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:59.010
CRASH US. And she says,

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.220
even after all this...

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:02.850
BLEEP BLEEP BLEEP She's

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.690
not ready to apologize.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.860
3414 TO BE HONEST WITH

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:09.460
YOU, I DON'T TOTALLY 100%

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:10.060
REGRET IT. LIKE I SAID,

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.160
MAYBE COULD HAVE CHOSEN

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:12.790
SOME BETTER WORDS. I WAS

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.930
EXTREMELY ANGRY. 23//3900

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:15.460
IF YOU TREAT ME WITH

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.030
ALOHA AND THE OTHER

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.440
DRIVERS WITH RESPECT,

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:23.000
THAT

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.010
WILL COME BACK TO YOU AND

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:27.310
RESPECT AND ALOHA . 3908

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.880
Arakaki has turned over

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.780
the video to police.

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:32.380
They're looking into it -

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.880
and tell us the case is

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:33.950
classified as an

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:34.520
unauthorized entry into

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.120
motor vehicle. Lots of

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.470
you weighing in on this
