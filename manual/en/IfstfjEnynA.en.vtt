00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:07.629
Two and a half thousand Afghan leaders gathered
in Kabul to discuss the country's pending

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:11.349
Bilateral Security Agreement with the United
States.

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:16.350
After days of talks, they agreed to the deal
and urged it be signed this year.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.650
This important decision will also pave the
way for the NATO's planned mission to train,

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:26.490
advise and assist Afghan security forces after
the International Security Assistance Force

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.720
is withdrawn due to start after the ISAF mission
is complete at the end of 2014.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.060
The country's president opened the Loya Jirga
by reminding the assembled delegates what

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:38.150
was at stake for the people they were chosen
to represent.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:48.580
"The people of Afghanistan are waiting outside
for your decision.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:01:03.240
All those people who have suffered, during
these 30 years of war, they want peace, security

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.000
and a stable country.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.260
They are waiting for your decision."

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:24.990
A Loya Jirga is a large assembly made of tribal
leaders, community representatives and experts.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:34.470
The 
decisions made by the Loya Jirga have no constitutional

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.320
decision making power, but they carry a lot
of weight.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.610
The Jirga had been broken down into 50 committees
to discuss a wide range of specific security

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:50.810
issues relating to the presence of US troops
in Afghanistan after 2014, including the jurisdiction

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:56.250
of foreign forces from prosecution, damage
reparations and the continued ability of foreign

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.880
troops to enter Afghan homes in limited circumstances.

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.909
Outside the conference, Afghan Security Forces
formed a ring of steel around Kabul as government

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:11.770
workers and public institutions were given
a five-day holiday to ease congestion.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.700
The visible presence of the security forces
on Kabul streets was tangible evidence of

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.020
Afghan forces' growing capacity and performance.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.731
Yet, it was also a reminder of security.

00:02:20.731 --> 00:02:22.150
Ensuring that those gains are consolidated
after 2014 and of the continuing security

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.590
challenge.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:28.620
Ensuring that the Afghan forces can continue
to grow into a fully professional and sustainable

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.200
force after 2014; a strategic focus of the
Jirga.

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.950
Following the Loya Jirga's approval, the Bilateral
Security Agreement still must be approved

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.870
by the Afghan parliament and the President
has said he wants to hold on any agreement

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.349
until after the country's elections in April
2014.

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.209
For the NATO channel in Kabul, this is Joe
Sheffer.
