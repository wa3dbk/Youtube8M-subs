00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:01.269
Hi everyone.

00:00:01.269 --> 00:00:02.269
It's Alejandra.

00:00:02.269 --> 00:00:05.540
And in this video, I'm going to share with
you guys how to organize all of your warranties,

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.969
your manuals, and all of your big ticket receipts
that you have maybe on your home office desk

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.840
or on the floor or maybe they're already in
the filing cabinet or maybe they're in a random

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.530
pile in a random corner somewhere in the house.

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:20.750
Either way, I'm going to show you an easy
way to do it, something that doesn't take

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:25.250
a lot of time to set up and it's inexpensive
to buy some of the supplies.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.830
So let me grab the camera and show you guys
exactly what I've done.

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:28.830
OK.

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.270
So these are my warranty and manual binders
and I have two of them.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.710
So let me quickly explain why I have two of
them.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.700
So this one right here, this is the warranty
and manual binder that has stuff that comes

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.270
with the house.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.210
So when I move from the current house I'm
living in, I'm going to give these warranties

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.360
and manuals to the new homeowner.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.930
I'm not going to take them to my new house
with me because the stuff inside the binder

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.070
is stuff that I'm going to leave in the house.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.530
So that includes like the refrigerator, the
washer and dryer, the oven like I'm not going

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.750
to take that to my new house.

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:01.180
In some cases, some people might do that.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.000
So if that's the case, you wouldn't keep that
stuff inside this binder.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.509
The other reason why I have two binders is
because the binders are pretty thick like

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:14.109
that one is a 3-inch binder and that one is
a 2-inch binder.

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:17.249
So I didn't want to have one really thick
binder that was overflowing.

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:19.729
I want to break it down into two categories.

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:25.249
So again, this is stuff that stays in the
house when I move to the new house and I'm

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:29.399
just going to give this to the new homeowner
or whoever is moving in or moving back in.

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:30.909
OK.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:37.810
So this binder right here is warranties, manuals,
and also big ticket receipts of expensive

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.810
stuff I buy.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:47.200
So that includes like gadgets like a camera,
your new computers, kitchen appliances like

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:55.329
an expensive blender you might buy or a mixer
or a toaster, what else does it include, furniture

00:01:55.329 --> 00:02:02.320
so like maybe a mattress, a sofa, or artwork,
expensive art that you buy, beauty so that

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.759
might be like in there I have my flat iron,
I have - what else do I have?

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:08.759
I can't remember.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.970
And then there is like phone so like your
cell phone or your home phone and then sporting

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.850
stuff so like your new bike or any kind of
sports equipment that's really expensive to

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:19.850
buy.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:20.850
OK.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.050
So now that you understand why I have two
binders, let me quickly explain how I set

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.690
it up, what kind of supplies I used, and I
why I choose what I chose.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:29.690
OK.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.790
So let's take a closer look at my warranties,
manual, and big ticket receipt binder.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.480
First off, I just want to say doesn't it just
look really organized?

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.030
I'm really happy the way it turned out.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.500
I did this project last week and after I did
it, I just kept telling Ed that I was so happy

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.500
the way it turned out.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.062
It just looks really organized and when you
go like this, like shake the binder or turn

00:02:49.062 --> 00:02:53.390
it upside down, small papers, small receipts,
nothing comes out.

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:57.720
So it functions really nicely while all looking
really organized.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.060
So let's take a look and see what I used inside.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.850
So, I used these poly envelope pockets that
are made for binders because they have holes

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.850
in them.

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:16.190
Now, they are very different from your traditional
sheet protector that some people might use

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.410
to organize all of their warranties and binders.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:24.060
Now, I'm not saying that sheet protectors
are the wrong things to use or aren't good.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:29.480
What I am saying is that I showed one here
because I want to show you guys the difference.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.790
Sheet protectors are made to hold one sheet
of paper.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.190
They're not made to hold a little booklet
or like 20 pages.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.700
And if you ask why and let me show you the
difference here.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.870
When you turn this page like it doesn't turn
very nicely like the booklet might fall out.

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:54.340
It doesn't have a closing or it doesn't like
zip or clasp or whatever up at the very top.

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:59.750
So when you - if you go like that or you go
like that, something could fall out of the

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:00.750
binder.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.470
So again, sheet protectors are made to hold
one sheet of paper, not a booklet.

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:09.130
Now, I mentioned that because I used to travel
to people's homes and a lot of people were

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.959
organizing their warranties and manuals in
sheet protectors.

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:17.269
So moving on, so these are made by Staples.

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.660
I have an extra one here to show you guys.

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:20.959
They're made by Staples.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.070
They're Staples brand.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.449
They're called Binder Pockets and they hold
up to 200 sheets of paper.

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:35.110
They have a nice Velcro clasp up here so once
you're done putting your papers inside, you

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.210
close it and nothing is going to fall out.

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:41.129
And they have binder holes, perfect for a
binder.

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:42.389
So I love these.

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:43.389
These are awesome.

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.470
And so yes, so that's what I used.

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:50.770
So what I have inside, let me show you what
I do here.

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:55.550
Every time I buy something expensive, this
is the receipt from my GPS in my car.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.461
Whenever I buy something expensive, if I get
a warranty or there's a manual or there is

00:04:59.461 --> 00:05:04.400
some kind of paper that I need to keep to
access later in case something happens, I

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.900
will just staple the original receipt to the
warranty.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:09.800
In this case, this is the Best Buy warranty.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.249
So I just took the receipt, stapled it, and
then I put it inside of my gadget folder.

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:19.370
So if there is some problem down the road,
since it was an expensive purchase I would

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:24.360
just come to this folder and easily find exactly
what I'm looking for.

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.500
So it's the same thing with other things in
every pocket here.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:36.880
And then these since these don't have like
dividers and also, since these are extra wide,

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:41.430
if you had a traditional divider, it would
just be covered by the pocket folder.

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:49.120
So what I've done here is I've used these
little, they are called, they are filing tabs.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.009
They are little stickies made by Post-it Notes.

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:55.470
I just stuck them to the top of the poly envelope.

00:05:55.470 --> 00:06:01.710
I kind of put them next to each other.

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.370
And then I just took my label maker and I
used a clear tape to label the category of

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.749
what's inside the poly envelope.

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:16.880
So a combination of a Staples envelope plus
Post-it Note filing tabs plus my label maker

00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:22.559
plus the only binders that I use, I did a
whole video on this, these are made by Staples

00:06:22.559 --> 00:06:23.559
brand.

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:28.479
They come in every size and every color and
they now actually have designs because I guess

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:30.389
the binders are so popular.

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:37.009
So yeah, so binder, filing tab, envelope,
and you have yourself a nice warranty and

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:41.979
manual binder where nothing is going to fall
out because the envelopes are closed.

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:43.340
It looks very organized.

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:48.029
It's very contained and it's very obvious
where to find a receipt or where to find a

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:52.490
warranty or manual if something breaks or
something needs to be fixed.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.849
Something else I love about these poly envelopes
is how easy they are to turn.

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:01.639
Like there is probably about maybe like 15
pages inside of this poly envelope and I just

00:07:01.639 --> 00:07:07.499
simply turn it and it turns so easily like
nothing - it doesn't turn like the sheet protectors

00:07:07.499 --> 00:07:08.499
turn.

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:09.499
It just turns very easily.

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:10.499
OK.

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:14.520
So that's how I'm organizing all of my warranties,
my manuals, and my big ticket receipts.

00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:15.740
It's pretty simple to do.

00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.319
It doesn't take a lot of time and it's not
too expensive to set up.

00:07:19.319 --> 00:07:22.789
If there is a different way that you organize
your warranties and manuals and you want to

00:07:22.789 --> 00:07:27.110
let us know or you want to show us, leave
a comment below, let us know or create a video

00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.589
response and let us see exactly what you do.

00:07:29.589 --> 00:07:30.719
That's all I have for you guys.

00:07:30.719 --> 00:07:31.919
I will see you guys soon.

00:07:31.919 --> 00:07:32.919
Bye!

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:32.920
