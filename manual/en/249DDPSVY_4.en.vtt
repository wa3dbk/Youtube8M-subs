Get Inside the Tanks

00:00:02.660 --> 00:00:04.060
Richard "The Challenger" Cutland

00:00:04.300 --> 00:00:07.180
The Muckleburgh Collection

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.420
Hello and welcome
to a very special place...

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.400
...for anybody
who likes to see armour in action.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.820
The unique Muckleburgh Collection,
on the East coast of England.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:50.240
With over 150 tanks, guns and vehicles,
plus many other military exhibits...

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:53.600
...Muckleburgh is the largest private collection of its kind in Europe.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.660
And it’s certainly
one of the best locations I’ve seen...

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.160
...for watching tanks on the move...

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.360
...with thousands of acres of unspoilt land
running all the way down to the sea.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.580
Muckleburgh has
a long military history...

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.760
...of guarding
Britain’s east coast from invasion.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.020
In the First World War
the area became a front-line defence...

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.880
...with hundreds of troops housed here...

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.960
...supported by pillboxes,
gun emplacements and trenches.

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.420
In 1936, and during World War 2...

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.420
...it became
an anti-aircraft artillery base...

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.900
...for the purpose
of shooting down German bombers...

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.280
...and was still in operation until 1958.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.780
The original
World War 2 gun pits are still here...

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.960
...and have recently been restored
and re-equipped with a 3.7 inch AA gun...

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.200
...effective up to 25,000 feet
as well as a 40mm Bofors L70.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.360
The camp was even visited
by Sir Winston Churchill in 1941.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.620
What I love about this place
is the sheer variety of kit.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.940
There are warplanes, missiles...

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.960
...and it houses a fabulous collection
of military models and dioramas...

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.120
...and a huge collection of ammunition.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.400
Lots of artillery too.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.220
Muckleburgh houses
one of the best armour collections...

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:22.600
...to be found anywhere,
most of it still running.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.540
There’s a very nice T34/85...

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.320
...a Sherman Grizzly...

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:32.900
..an M5 Stuart...

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.320
...and an M24 Chaffee...

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:44.240
...and just recently restored,
this absolutely mint Comet.

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.440
And there is this Churchill 7
due for restoration next year.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.720
In our next three episodes
of ‘Inside the Tanks’...

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.720
...we’re going to be taking
a closer look at the M5 Stuart...

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:59.620
...the M24 Chaffee...

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:03.880
...and also the M47 and the T55.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:08.580
Watch this space.
