00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:01.210
Hey what's up Youtube?

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.210
This is El Tiro.

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:05.380
And today, you're going to learn how to do
head isolations.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:12.240
That's coming right up.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.240
Thanks for tuning in.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.300
Today's tutorial Thursday where you learn
a new dance concept to add to your freestyle

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.970
choreography and where going to be learning
awesome head isolations, which is a popping

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.919
or animation robotic type of movement.

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.320
Now I did make a tutorial on this before.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.539
But it was like one of my firs tutorials ever
years ago and it's super bad.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.440
So I had to redo it, spice it up.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.579
Even if you know how to do this, you got to
keep watching coz I'm going to give you different

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.399
variations on how to do it.

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.160
All right, let's loosen up those necks.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.440
We're about to get started.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.520
So on level of difficulty, this is advanced.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.930
This is really hard because you're using muscles
and controlling parts of your body that you

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.239
would not normally use in everyday motion.

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.239
Ok?

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:53.339
So the first one is your neck.

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:55.960
Here's what you want to do.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.860
See my face and I'm holding it like this?

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:05.420
I do not want it to move sideways or turn,
need to be still facing forward.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:13.990
Once you have that intense focus, you're going
to try to move your neck only to the right.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.350
Only using your neck.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.041
I'm trying to lean it as much as I can.

00:01:18.041 --> 00:01:21.590
I can have my hands kind of like guide it.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.329
And I'm only moving my neck keeping still
just like that.

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.380
Try to go to each side of my knuckles here.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.370
Indian dancers are going to be great at this.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.060
Now if you've never ever done this before,
then maybe your neck is going to be like going

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.700
to be this little bit.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.840
And that's ok because the more you do this
move; you're kind of like stretching this

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.840
muscle.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.130
And now I can really move my neck out like
super far and it kind of looks like a creepy

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.540
Frankenstein.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.220
And it's actually a good thing coz that means
my head isolations could be nice and big when

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.220
I do that.

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.220
Another FYI is this.

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.210
It may not be the move you get the first try.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:02.450
You might have to practice this.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.890
So first up is if you can control moving your
neck, and you think you got that down without

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.840
moving the rest of your body, you're ready
for the next step.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.830
If you're not there yet, then you might need
to pause this tutorial and really focus and

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:15.830
get that down.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.050
Here's the next step.

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.410
I'm going to only move my neck to the next
side, and I'm going to keep it there.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:24.510
If you just did that with me, you're 50% there.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.330
But here's where it gets difficult.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:33.760
I'm going to take my right hand, and I'm going
to kind of grab my chest not right here my

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.860
chest.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.180
And I'm going to push or pretend like I'm
pushing my body down which is going to lean.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.730
As I lean, my neck is going to go to my right
side.

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.310
So there's two things happening.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.650
I'll break em down.

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.880
One is this whoop lean.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:50.630
The second is this.

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.540
My neck's on the left side, I'll bring it
to the right.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.341
So really I'm doing that, both at the same
time.

00:02:56.341 --> 00:03:01.630
One more time coz I know that this is really
really difficult.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.510
I'm going to put my hand now on my temple.

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.190
And I'm going to push that to the left and
I'm going to keep it there.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:13.220
Then, I will put my right hand on my chest
and I'm going to move that down.

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:20.250
I'm going to lean while my neck and face go
to the opposite side, like this.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.760
It's all in the neck.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.260
If you can get that down, you can get this
little motion down like this, then I'm going

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:28.260
to go one, two.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.420
We're going to keep moving ourselves down.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.520
If you're getting this down, and you already
know how to do this.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.650
Here's a couple variations.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:45.200
You kind of use a little robotic like twinkle
fingers, you can go.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.820
You can also even incorporate some Beyonce
put a ring on it, some twisting action.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:58.180
You can even incorporate a jaw isolation when
you move.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.880
I mean there's tons of different variations
you can do.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.000
It's all up to you to make it your own.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.080
So that's your tutorial Thursday for today
on learning how to do a lateral head isolations.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.590
