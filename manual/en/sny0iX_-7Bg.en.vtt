00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.400
one agb angle kitten unfortunately it
did not remain on this planet for very

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.370
long aahet died almost immediately after
was born uh... but

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.049
it's scary looking

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:12.980
was watch

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:15.859
who indirectly using

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:18.919
these it's are very cute

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:23.130
the an will with its as good as a
cyclops that

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.300
of today

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.339
so ari from an election

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:27.160
now

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:31.820
we run out of the time without a sound
never stick around the budget

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.690
about but this is all about

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.320
specify alot about what he did have

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.880
the caterer here's my point

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.330
no people argue yes evolution the

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.620
you know the religious is a state

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:51.200
well happening again from my no line to
all of sudden hot

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.000
well gotta be created

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.530
and so they would also say like profit

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.059
believe we had what i

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.440
how could we possibly get that to us

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.720
or bring it to us how could we possibly
get to one hour

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.840
you see is sometimes is read the new
patients

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.340
now in this case the

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.760
didn't take the dot

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.200
but if it turns out it was an incredibly
advantageous mutation

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.500
he could possibly take off

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.890
what if we had

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:23.310
the weather

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.430
i bet you didn't pay about

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:28.570
obviously

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.299
unrest like this

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:34.000
evolution

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.710
released all the recited

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.020
about the issue explanations budgeted

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:40.729
but

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:44.070
that we could go to set a whole new show
called bad so i don't know what they

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.870
were using conservatives would use that
to make their argument

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:48.689
the defense

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.860
it's my version of the bed an argument
that religious people

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:52.560
but

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.080
hotter the better get it should

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:57.840
perfectly fits in your ad

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.100
r_b_c_ dr made it that way

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.349
and right now is it showed that that

00:02:02.349 --> 00:02:05.370
or color for its got their shape

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.740
uh...

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.049
reaction in a predominantly wooded any
of the bananas

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:19.149
forgettable looked at the ship like
really act like you

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:22.069
so he didn't know of course not so great
