00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.280
Today, we will do a makeup switch-up

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.420
I have no idea what this is

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:13.280
 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.380
The makeup switch-up is when

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.060
The girls are doing their 'army' look

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.280
Which is camo on their face

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.800
And the guys have to do all the girls' makeup

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.960
And we have to do a 'smoky eye' look

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:24.800
It's uh...chromy colours, Revlon

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.960
Stop smelling it!

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.500
No smell one

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.480
This looks like some kind of medieval contraption

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:31.020
For...

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:33.180
Toenails?

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.400
Many other boys, they don't know what the products are

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:35.900
But I do

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.360
We're gonna beat everyone else

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.520
Because...

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.660
I have Audrey

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:41.840
Yeah, I'm a makeup guru, come on

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:43.360
Do you even know what this is?

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:43.860
Tell me what is this

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.780
Not really

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.480
What's this?

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.040
But you know right, I look pretty already

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.220
So I think, no need right?

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.200
I'm out

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.480
Can I ask you something?

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:51.980
Yes?

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.740
Do you use black or green first?

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.920
...

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.600
Uh, founda-

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.660
This is foundation la!

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.100
Are you kidding me?

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.900
It's not?

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.520
2,1...Go!

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.380
Oh my gosh

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.420
Looks like a worm

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.540
Oh my god

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:11.260
I wanna see, I wanna see

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:14.260
Is this enough?

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.840
No, more than that!

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:18.480
Wah, eh

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:18.980
Wah

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.940
The colour so vibrant my god

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:21.000
Can use as makeup eh

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.300
Oh, it's quite moisturizing

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:24.920
How do guys do this?

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.780
Well we don't put it there

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.500
We just put it on our face

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.340
All over ah?

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:30.100
All over

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.360
Put it...rub it all over

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:33.280
Yeah

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.180
Get your game face on

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.820
Alright!

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.320
Okay, more and more and more

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.080
Blend, blend

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:36.660
Blend?

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.160
Yeah

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:38.920
This is not my colour

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.060
This is not my colour!

00:01:40.497 --> 00:01:41.897
Oh my god it smells weird

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:43.440
It's beautiful

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.660
Look at my sloppy eyeshadow

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:46.800
Oh my god it's everywhere

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.940
I don't know what this is

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:50.340
What's the first thing I have to do?

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:51.520
Does this have SPF?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.120
So...all over my face?

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:54.720
Or like, just-

00:01:54.888 --> 00:01:55.668
All over your face

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.800
Later I cannot take out then how?

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:57.900
I go home looking like this ah?

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.380
Girls take a long time to do makeup

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:01.300
To look beautiful

00:02:01.555 --> 00:02:02.875
Please respect them, okay

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.640
Ooh, Chanel

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:06.360
Chanel, right?

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:06.980
Yeah

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.480
I look like a Vincent van Gogh painting already

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.040
What happened?

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.960
Alright

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.039
Working that foundation

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:19.600
Why you got heart shape?

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.638
How you gonna conceal in the jungle?

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.300
Oh my god

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.400
My eyebrows are gone

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.040
They disappeared

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.660
Oh my god

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:28.860
Closer to your eye

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:30.242
I don't wanna go so near my eye

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.960
You need to!

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.100
I might poke my eye!

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.680
Oh, easy

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:33.600
So it's on top, right?

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.140
Yes

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.900
If not where

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.780
Inside your eye is it?

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.040
Ooh

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:40.730
Oh no, this is not lipstick

00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:42.085
What is this?

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.720
Uh, colour-

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.320
Try and colour...

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:49.600
Inside the lines

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.640
More?

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.400
More eyeshadow at the back

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.596
You need more everything

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.940
You do this

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:57.235
And then after that you put it

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.340
I feel

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:00.460
I feel it like...

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.620
Cracking on my skin

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.160
Ew, really?

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.160
I look like Mulan

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.920
What's the guy?

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.420
The-

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:05.260
The fat guy?

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.480
Pack on the powder!

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:08.860
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:09.360
Yes!

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.260
She like army sergeant now ah

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.880
I'm done

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.220
My encik will scold you I tell you

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.900
Oh my god

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:21.940
Christina

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.880
Alright

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.200
Rock and roll

00:03:25.845 --> 00:03:27.325
Every guy's gonna buy me a drink

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.660
Give it up for Miranda Sings

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:34.320
You look...

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.020
Can I...can I join the army now?

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.520
No

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.680
They're all brushes

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.060
And on top of that

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.740
Inside each one already has a brush, you know?

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.540
Each-

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:45.900
Sorry

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:49.140
Okay, they must have anti-aging properties

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:51.139
SPF will keep your skin fresh

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.360

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.500
