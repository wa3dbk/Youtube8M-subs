00:00:00.482 --> 00:00:02.179
If an island, like Haiti

00:00:02.319 --> 00:00:05.469
had about several hundred million dollars

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.966
in assets. But they went on, and they printed more money

00:00:08.106 --> 00:00:10.409
than they had things to back it up, or gold.

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:14.049
Then that money has no value. If a little island, say like

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:17.195
St. Croix printed lots of money and just came to the US

00:00:17.335 --> 00:00:20.059
trying to buy things (they ran their printing presses night and day)

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.939
the money is not backed, that's why it doesn't have anything.

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:25.229
Your whole banking system's utterly corrupt.

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:27.739
Your lending institutions have loused up the system.

00:00:27.879 --> 00:00:30.229
But there's nobody out there telling you what's wrong with it.

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.014
So it looks okay to you.

00:00:32.296 --> 00:00:35.339
The national debt has grown too large

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:37.242
for the National Debt Clock.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.090
Failed systems

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.300
None of the world's economic systems have eliminated our most dire problems.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.245
All social arrangements to date have remained plagued with war

00:00:50.385 --> 00:00:55.067
poverty, crime, racism, elitism and most of all:

00:00:55.873 --> 00:00:58.691
scarcity.

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:01.338
There's no way of making this system just.

00:01:01.478 --> 00:01:05.041
We have to make a system that assures human rights.

00:01:05.181 --> 00:01:07.981
When everybody has free access to goods and services

00:01:08.121 --> 00:01:10.819
you don't have to fight for women's rights or black rights;

00:01:10.959 --> 00:01:14.145
it's automatic in a society that's set up that way.

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:17.754
Today we have highly advanced technologies, but our social

00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:21.945
and economic system has not kept up with our technological capabilities

00:01:22.085 --> 00:01:25.516
which could otherwise easily create a world of abundance for all people

00:01:25.656 --> 00:01:27.666
free of servitude and debt.

00:01:27.806 --> 00:01:30.802
This system will keep installing more and more automation

00:01:30.942 --> 00:01:34.118
cutting down on the purchasing power of the majority of people.

00:01:34.258 --> 00:01:38.046
It's not China or India taking our jobs away

00:01:38.186 --> 00:01:40.234
the machine has beaten the man.

00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:43.659
There will come a time called the gaussian curve

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.945
where employment is that, production is this

00:01:47.085 --> 00:01:50.277
and purchasing power is that. The system stops.

00:01:50.878 --> 00:01:53.249
A social alternative

00:01:53.755 --> 00:01:58.048
Our problems and their solutions are technical, not political.

00:01:58.664 --> 00:02:02.042
Most problems can be solved when technology and the methods of science

00:02:02.182 --> 00:02:06.328
are used with human and environmental concern to serve all people

00:02:06.468 --> 00:02:08.321
rather than a select few.

00:02:08.777 --> 00:02:13.112
It'll all be based on a form of dynamic equilibrium.

00:02:13.252 --> 00:02:17.722
That means operating everything at the highest potential

00:02:18.323 --> 00:02:21.272
without environmental neglect.

00:02:21.864 --> 00:02:27.179
When we unleash science and technology directly into the social system

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.961
without the restrictions of the marketplace, finances

00:02:31.101 --> 00:02:34.822
or patents, we could achieve a very high standard of living

00:02:34.962 --> 00:02:37.472
within a very short period of time.

00:02:38.543 --> 00:02:43.699
We have the brains, the know-how, the technology and the feasibility

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:46.672
to build an entirely new civilization.

00:02:46.882 --> 00:02:50.078
Paradise or Oblivion

00:02:50.218 --> 00:02:54.615
