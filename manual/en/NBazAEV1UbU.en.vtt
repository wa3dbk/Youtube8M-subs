hi this is karen titus from stamping on the
back porch and i'm back today with another

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.320
in our series of stamping through the alphabet
we are up to letter q for quick christmas

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:17.340
cards i'm going to show 2 variations on this
card i think these are both really pretty

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.320
so i'll show you how i did that and of course
this gets really simple now some people would

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.329
look at this and say karen that is not simple
you have to cut it out but keep in mind that

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.489
i always do my cutting out when i'm either
waiting in the car for someone i always keep

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:37.100
some work handy or when i am half heartedly
watching tv even if it's during the commercials

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.850
so i still consider this very quick and easy
so this is with the lovely single christmas

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.769
stamp the christmas star it is really pretty
and i've stamped it in cherry cobble and then

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:58.329
the card base is crumb cake regular size and
i attached a piece of paper from the season

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:04.500
of style that is two and a half inches by
five and a half inches so that's on the bottom

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.100
now in this one you can see i just wrap the
ribbon around and with glue dots put it right

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:16.549
there no tying nothing because this is going
to cover it and i have my dimensionals on

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.130
the back i will just take that off and figure
out which way i want my star and that one

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.149
is finished now to do this one you can notice
that i have come through here and i added

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:31.690
a little know so thats what we're going to
do today so i have my star and i punched a

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.460
hole in the middle so i'm going to bring my
ribbon around and it want to make sure that

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:45.759
my ends are really pointed so that it will
be easy to get through the holes i'm going

00:01:45.759 --> 00:01:52.200
to point them even more that they are and
of course the biggest trick is to make this

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.539
part easy and again i would do all of this
while watching tv i always have my little

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:05.470
tray that moves with me from room to room
and anything i'm doing half heartedly when

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:12.040
we have our 18 month old grandson i take that
tray with me and follow him from room to room

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:19.069
so i'm there watching him play but i'm working
on my own stuff too ok so i just brought ths

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:37.459
through did a half know and then i just took
the ends wherever i wanted them to be and

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:46.811
did a whole bunch of little snips we'll see
how easily i can do that i did as many of

00:02:46.811 --> 00:02:54.380
these as i could and i just ruffed that up
to make this fun little bow right here and

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.310
then the star again i put dimensionals on
to give so that is it so short video quick

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.989
and easy of course and enjoy this idea for
quick and easy christmas cards check on all

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:09.360
the single stamps they are all so fun to work
with and its easy to make cards when you are

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.540
only going to stamp one image and add a little
paper you're done thanks for watching karen

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:15.030
