00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:03.899
In 1996 genetically modified foods were
first

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:06.980
allowed into our food supply in America.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.550
The GMO machine has been extraordinarily
effective in squelching the conversation.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.480
The biggest problem with genetically

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.410
modified organisms or genetically
engineered foods

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.130
is that we don't know the long-term
outcome.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.079
And to show how strong the agenda is

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:26.130
how could anyone argue against at least

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.490
labeling foods GMO?

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.070
If they have nothing to hide, if GMOs

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.290
are safe and effective or propose any
threat to

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.200
individuals who consume them, why would
you be worried about putting it on the

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.130
label or the food that you sell?

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.220
There something that seems kind of sneaky

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.580
about people manufacturing food and

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.180
researching it and engineering it and
marketing to us and for some reason

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.940
or other they don't want to tell us what's in it?

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.730
I find that odd, I know that if you buy

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.810
you know a shirt, or a pair of pants, I have to
say that it's, you know, ninety percent

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.450
cotton and ten percent lycra.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:07.009
So I wanna know within my food if I know
what's in my pants.

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:13.159
We have supposedly, some parts of our government that are designated to protect our interests.

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.100
These people are paid with our tax dollars to
safeguard our well-being,

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.990
in these realms, yet it's not happening.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.979
So now let's look at the FDA, let's
look at the FTC, let's look at our regulators.

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.109
I think it's because most of

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:32.539
the FDA and EPA and USDA are

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.420
infiltrated with appointed, very high
level executives, that came from the

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.460
biotech industry.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.710
It's the wealth of the force behind

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.249
the GMO initiative that's causing
this to occur.

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:49.659
What's for sale? It can be
bought!

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:53.490
The hearts and minds of the culture
and the compulsion to force them into

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.189
behaviors, can be bought .

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.950
So we have a huge
challenge on our hands

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.499
to reeducate people from the top down
and from the bottom up.

00:02:02.499 --> 00:02:05.719
You know, from there gut and from their head.

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:09.750
The reality is there are other countries
who have said no GMOs.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.180
They've looked at it and said, "this is
disturbing, there's is not enough evidence we've

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.580
made a choice not to do this."

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.790
But we're supposed to be in the united
States, the land of the free, where those

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.590
types of things don't happen.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.000
But this is such a issue

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.760
as far as saying, "this is scary this is
disturbing, this is unknown,

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.560
but other countries who technically
might be less free as far as individual

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.049
rights are concerned are saying no to GMOs until there is more data.

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.180
Yet here, we say yes.

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.939
It's indefensible, obviously there is

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.980
something to hide, obviously there is a
concern.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.579
Obviously they think that individual
consumers, given the choice,

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:50.180
would prefer not to buy that food. So
what is their solution?

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.610
Don't let them know

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.900
they're buying that food.

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:58.920
That, to me, as a feel even the hairs on the back my neck standing up,

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.560
is evil personified.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.680
What I would like to say to the biotech industry and the food industry

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.010
is, "stop messing with my children's health,

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.600
with my husbands health, with my family's
health.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.630
Enough is enough, let's go back

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:21.250
to real food, conventional farming

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.730
with out GMOs and taking care of the people

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.360
and putting the people first. Not profits."
