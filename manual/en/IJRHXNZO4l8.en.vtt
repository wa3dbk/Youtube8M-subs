00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.452
(Subtitles by Thomas Giles)

00:00:00.454 --> 00:00:01.266
Hey everybody.

00:00:01.268 --> 00:00:04.189
Final Thoughts time for <i>Mistfall</i>.

00:00:04.191 --> 00:00:05.471
And actually it's interesting...

00:00:06.095 --> 00:00:08.063
Hopefully that was a
runthrough that will give

00:00:08.065 --> 00:00:10.028
you a pretty good idea
of how the game plays,

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.015
so you can decide whether you
want to back it on Kickstarter.

00:00:12.017 --> 00:00:14.247
Because there's the link for
Kickstarter right there

00:00:14.249 --> 00:00:16.226
so you can go learn more about the game.

00:00:17.094 --> 00:00:18.319
But it's interesting.

00:00:18.321 --> 00:00:23.465
Long-time fans of my show might remember
I did a runthrough at Essen 2013

00:00:23.467 --> 00:00:25.393
for a game called <i>Songs of Artha</i>.

00:00:26.803 --> 00:00:29.636
Which was looking to be
independently published by

00:00:29.638 --> 00:00:32.591
this very designer right here whose
name I can't remember how to pronounce.

00:00:32.593 --> 00:00:34.480
I think it was "Blaza Kibaki"?
(Błażej Kubacki)

00:00:34.482 --> 00:00:37.572
I don't remember.
I'm sorry "Blaza"... I think.

00:00:39.137 --> 00:00:40.760
Polish names... I'm very sorry!

00:00:40.762 --> 00:00:42.181
But he was a very nice guy.

00:00:42.669 --> 00:00:44.909
I sat down with him, did a
runthrough for <i>Songs of Artha</i>.

00:00:45.752 --> 00:00:47.871
This game, <i>Mistfall</i>,

00:00:47.873 --> 00:00:51.629
is basically <i>Songs of Artha</i> evolved.

00:00:52.216 --> 00:00:53.497
Adding a whole bunch of new stuff,

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:55.428
adding a world-map that you travel around,

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.826
adding a bunch of new
concepts and all that,

00:00:57.828 --> 00:01:02.088
and... I have no inside information.
I have no idea what happened.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.675
But when I sat down to start playing
this with Jen for the first time

00:01:04.677 --> 00:01:06.177
I was like, "Wait a minute.

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:08.504
"<i>I</i> remember playing this
game two years ago!"

00:01:08.506 --> 00:01:10.673
And so I mention this because

00:01:10.675 --> 00:01:12.556
while the runthrough I think
did a pretty good job of

00:01:12.558 --> 00:01:15.753
showing how all the basic stuff
works and how the flow works,

00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:17.244
the one thing I <i>didn't</i>
do a very good job...

00:01:17.246 --> 00:01:19.151
Because you really need to
spend more time playing.

00:01:19.153 --> 00:01:21.611
You need to start putting
in a lot of really...

00:01:21.613 --> 00:01:25.155
some of your cool, higher-level
abilities and whatnot into your deck.

00:01:25.157 --> 00:01:27.194
The game really comes alive

00:01:27.196 --> 00:01:30.344
when you start doing these
very very cool chains...

00:01:30.346 --> 00:01:33.010
combo chains with all the
different cards in your hand.

00:01:33.012 --> 00:01:36.989
And pulling off absolutely
mind-bogglingly cool moves

00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:38.794
over and over and over again,

00:01:38.796 --> 00:01:40.396
which is what you need to be able to do

00:01:40.398 --> 00:01:42.997
to take out the really big
super-tough bad guys.

00:01:43.497 --> 00:01:45.428
You have to be able to set
up almost this little

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.548
engine of death and destruction with
all the different cards you've got.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.237
The things you've got equipped,
this things in your hand,

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:54.024
the things that you have recently
put onto the top of your deck

00:01:54.026 --> 00:01:56.502
or into your discard pile,
or into your burial pile.

00:01:56.504 --> 00:01:59.337
Because you have so many ways
that these cards can interact.

00:01:59.339 --> 00:02:00.981
I mean, every card in this game

00:02:00.983 --> 00:02:03.090
has, like, 3 or 4 keywords on it.

00:02:03.092 --> 00:02:04.552
And there are so many cards that say,

00:02:04.554 --> 00:02:07.328
"All cards with <i>this</i> keyword or
<i>that</i> keyword or <i>that</i> keyword."

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:09.550
And that's really the crux of
what this game is all about.

00:02:09.552 --> 00:02:10.552
Now...

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.060
I mention again <i>Songs of Artha</i>

00:02:12.062 --> 00:02:14.399
because if you want, there's
a link right there.

00:02:14.401 --> 00:02:17.156
You can go watch the runthrough
I did for <i>Songs of Artha</i>.

00:02:17.158 --> 00:02:20.734
It was a very quick one, just went
through 1 or 2 rounds of combat.

00:02:20.736 --> 00:02:24.347
And I think it showed some of the
really cool combinatorial things

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:26.829
that I didn't necessarily show
very well in this runthrough,

00:02:26.831 --> 00:02:28.478
because I was still kind of
at the beginning of the game

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.185
and I was fighting some
really weak enemies.

00:02:30.187 --> 00:02:33.633
So if you want to get an idea for what
this game is like at the higher levels,

00:02:33.635 --> 00:02:35.684
when it really starts clicking,

00:02:35.686 --> 00:02:36.864
go check that out.

00:02:36.866 --> 00:02:37.866
But anyway...

00:02:38.292 --> 00:02:40.118
Otherwise, what can I say about...

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.798
Well, the art is gorgeous.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.554
It works really well.

00:02:44.091 --> 00:02:47.167
The rules are very
meticulously well thought-out.

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:49.516
Seems like they've really dealt
with every little thing,

00:02:49.518 --> 00:02:51.197
and that's an important thing,

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:53.492
because this is a <i>hugely</i>...

00:02:54.396 --> 00:02:55.864
Well, I was going to say complex...

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:57.806
It's a <i>deep</i> game.

00:02:57.808 --> 00:02:58.836
There is so much going on.

00:02:58.838 --> 00:02:59.845
There is so much power,

00:02:59.847 --> 00:03:03.142
so many opportunities you
have for mixing and matching.

00:03:03.144 --> 00:03:06.487
And again, you can check out the <i>Songs
of Artha</i> video to get a better idea,

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.373
of just how intricate--<i>that's</i> the word--

00:03:09.375 --> 00:03:13.080
<i>intricate</i> the moves you
take in this game can get.

00:03:13.082 --> 00:03:14.702
And that's what makes it special.

00:03:14.704 --> 00:03:16.051
And it's really really cool.

00:03:16.053 --> 00:03:19.302
When you come up with a really
cool move that just makes it...

00:03:19.304 --> 00:03:21.838
It's impossible to consider
at the beginning of the game

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.839
what you can go towards
the end of the game.

00:03:23.841 --> 00:03:25.339
Very satisfying.

00:03:25.341 --> 00:03:27.484
If I had any complaint
about this game at all,

00:03:27.486 --> 00:03:30.384
it would be I think that
it's a bit on the long side.

00:03:30.386 --> 00:03:32.648
Much like last year's <i>Assault at Doomrock</i>,

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:36.084
which was another fantasy co-op adventure
game Jen and I absolutely loved,

00:03:36.086 --> 00:03:38.166
but <i>also</i> suffers from being way too long,

00:03:38.168 --> 00:03:39.148
<i>Mistfall's</i> a very long game.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.360
I mean... the box proudly proclaims...

00:03:41.362 --> 00:03:43.454
although this is a prototype box,
so it proclaims nothing.

00:03:43.456 --> 00:03:48.096
But I believe the default length
the box says is two hours.

00:03:48.098 --> 00:03:49.858
And I can certainly see it going longer.

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.620
Now, it does come with
a shorter adventure...

00:03:52.427 --> 00:03:53.211
to be fair.

00:03:53.213 --> 00:03:56.408
But... I think you really
do want to play a long game,

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.533
because this game is really at its best

00:03:58.535 --> 00:04:00.357
<i>after</i> you've been playing
for quite a while.

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:01.970
And you've spent a lot of resolve,

00:04:01.972 --> 00:04:04.059
and you've got a lot of
really cool abilities

00:04:04.061 --> 00:04:07.343
that interact in all kinds
of neat and interesting ways.

00:04:07.345 --> 00:04:09.573
And really to be able to
have that experience,

00:04:09.575 --> 00:04:10.785
You've got to play for a while,

00:04:10.787 --> 00:04:12.846
and level up, and get all that stuff.

00:04:12.848 --> 00:04:14.575
So I just mentioned that

00:04:14.577 --> 00:04:17.105
because for some people a 2+
hour fantasy adventure game

00:04:17.107 --> 00:04:18.516
that's really intricate

00:04:18.518 --> 00:04:22.586
and really very demanding
of your mental bandwidth,

00:04:22.588 --> 00:04:23.588
might be a bit much.

00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:26.619
So that's something to be wary of.

00:04:26.621 --> 00:04:29.972
One thing... I have to admit I'm not
really all that crazy about the fact

00:04:29.974 --> 00:04:31.414
that every time
your start playing...

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:35.632
the deck of stuff you can
buy is always the same.

00:04:35.634 --> 00:04:38.186
Personally, I would love
to see something where,

00:04:38.188 --> 00:04:39.908
"Hey, you know what?
Every time you play..."

00:04:41.237 --> 00:04:42.957
A third of these cards
are what's available.

00:04:43.677 --> 00:04:46.445
Maybe a third of the
level 1s 2s 3s and 4s,

00:04:46.447 --> 00:04:47.983
so that you...

00:04:47.985 --> 00:04:49.368
it gives a little bit more feel that,

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:51.998
"Okay, in this particular game,
this is the way I can evolve."

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.444
As opposed to the more
sandbox-y approach

00:04:54.446 --> 00:04:55.648
that this game has taken.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:58.481
It's very much like modern
Uwe Rosenberg games like <i>Caverna</i>,

00:04:58.483 --> 00:04:59.500
where it's a sandbox, where...

00:04:59.502 --> 00:05:01.778
"No! Every thing's available to you.
You can do whatever you want.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:05.175
"It's up to <i>you</i> to find new
and different ways..."

00:05:05.177 --> 00:05:07.102
Personally, I would love a
slightly more restricted,

00:05:07.104 --> 00:05:09.732
"Well, this is the kind of
character you can evolve into.

00:05:09.734 --> 00:05:12.517
"Let's figure out the puzzle of how
best to leverage that character."

00:05:12.519 --> 00:05:14.463
Where in this game it's sandbox-y...

00:05:14.465 --> 00:05:16.489
The puzzle is to figure out,

00:05:16.491 --> 00:05:18.571
"What is the best character I can build

00:05:19.471 --> 00:05:22.296
"taking into account the creatures
I'm fighting right now,

00:05:22.298 --> 00:05:24.952
"and the creature I am also going
to face at the end of the adventure."

00:05:24.954 --> 00:05:26.202
You know, the final bad guy.

00:05:26.467 --> 00:05:27.628
It works really well,
don't get me wrong.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.809
It's not really a valid complaint.

00:05:28.811 --> 00:05:31.294
It's just kind of like a little
peccadillo for me and Jen.

00:05:31.296 --> 00:05:34.858
It's just... this is a
very broad decision space.

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.579
You have a <i>lot</i> of options here,

00:05:36.581 --> 00:05:38.648
and personally for my
taste, and Jen's taste,

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:39.810
we'd like a few less options.

00:05:40.324 --> 00:05:41.963
And... but...

00:05:43.156 --> 00:05:44.464
Really, that's a...

00:05:44.466 --> 00:05:46.083
I think we're really on the outs.

00:05:46.085 --> 00:05:48.181
Most people <i>prefer</i>

00:05:48.183 --> 00:05:50.478
the more broad, wide-open,
do-whatever-you-want...

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:52.134
"Look, here's a million options.

00:05:52.136 --> 00:05:53.866
"Go nuts! Go to town,

00:05:53.868 --> 00:05:55.852
"pick and choose, and every time you play,

00:05:55.854 --> 00:05:59.336
"you can evolve and create a unique,
different take on that character

00:05:59.338 --> 00:06:01.061
"so every time you play he's going to be...

00:06:01.063 --> 00:06:02.899
"or she, if it just happened
that you're female,

00:06:02.901 --> 00:06:05.354
"is going to be a different,
unique, fresh approach."

00:06:06.087 --> 00:06:07.730
And that's it. I don't
know what else to say.

00:06:07.732 --> 00:06:08.997
It's a solid game.

00:06:08.999 --> 00:06:11.277
I think it's <i>definitely</i>...

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:13.065
<i>easily</i> expandable.

00:06:13.067 --> 00:06:15.254
I could see this becoming
an evergreen system.

00:06:15.256 --> 00:06:17.693
If it were coming from <i>Fantasy Flight</i>
you'd <i>know</i> that would be the case.

00:06:17.695 --> 00:06:21.423
They'd be putting out new card
packs with new types of enemies,

00:06:21.425 --> 00:06:24.766
new types of characters, new types of
abilities for existing characters,

00:06:24.768 --> 00:06:25.932
new encounters.

00:06:25.934 --> 00:06:27.965
I said this right up front,
but I've got to say...

00:06:27.967 --> 00:06:30.106
Probably more than anything else,
the thing I really appreciate

00:06:30.108 --> 00:06:33.360
is how much variety you get
out of these encounters.

00:06:33.809 --> 00:06:35.279
Just in the video you saw,

00:06:35.281 --> 00:06:37.027
the "Hunter" encounter I had

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:39.335
is <i>radically</i> different in feel

00:06:39.337 --> 00:06:40.488
than whatever the
second encounter was.

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:43.799
Oh, the... whatsit. The...

00:06:43.801 --> 00:06:45.386
"Sentinel Under Assault",

00:06:45.388 --> 00:06:48.070
versus "Ambush" which feels very different

00:06:48.072 --> 00:06:49.369
than "Winds of Death",

00:06:49.371 --> 00:06:51.529
which feels very different
than "The Black Coach",

00:06:51.531 --> 00:06:54.370
which feels very different
than "Relentless Pursuers".

00:06:54.372 --> 00:06:57.571
I <i>love</i> the variety that's in this game.

00:06:57.573 --> 00:07:00.659
The variety... even though you're playing
with the same four characters every time,

00:07:00.661 --> 00:07:02.423
the characters can evolve
in very different ways,

00:07:02.425 --> 00:07:03.821
the encounters you get

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:06.292
will evolve in different ways.

00:07:06.955 --> 00:07:08.655
Or the specific <i>series</i> of encounters.

00:07:08.657 --> 00:07:10.674
But the way those two things interact

00:07:10.676 --> 00:07:12.370
will make every play of this game fresh.

00:07:12.372 --> 00:07:14.376
And so if you're willing to sit down

00:07:14.378 --> 00:07:15.949
for 2+ hours to do it,

00:07:15.951 --> 00:07:17.018
I think you'll have a great time.

00:07:17.020 --> 00:07:19.213
And you'll get a really great
sense of satisfaction as you

00:07:19.215 --> 00:07:21.064
level up-up-up-up-up-up-up.

00:07:21.066 --> 00:07:22.551
Although of course it can
be very very frustrating

00:07:22.553 --> 00:07:25.053
if you spend all those two
hours and then at the end

00:07:25.055 --> 00:07:27.127
you don't cross the
finish line and you lose.

00:07:27.129 --> 00:07:28.574
Heck, maybe that's
Jen's and my problem.

00:07:28.576 --> 00:07:31.408
We just don't like co-op
games that take 2+ hours.

00:07:31.410 --> 00:07:34.026
Because a co-op game like
<i>Pandemic</i> that we can finish,

00:07:34.028 --> 00:07:36.386
win or lose, easily in under an hour,

00:07:36.388 --> 00:07:37.825
we don't mind so much if we lose.

00:07:37.827 --> 00:07:40.709
But if we play for two or three hours,

00:07:40.711 --> 00:07:42.397
and we make it all the way up
to the end and then we lose,

00:07:42.399 --> 00:07:43.883
oh, that's crushing. That's devastating.

00:07:43.885 --> 00:07:45.679
So it's just something
to bear in mind.

00:07:45.681 --> 00:07:47.641
But again, who cares what Jen and I think?

00:07:47.643 --> 00:07:49.540
Hopefully, between this runthrough

00:07:49.542 --> 00:07:52.070
and, again if you want to go check
out the <i>Songs of Artha</i> runthrough

00:07:52.072 --> 00:07:56.180
to get a sense for some of the more
intricate interplay between the cards,

00:07:56.182 --> 00:07:57.686
hopefully you have a pretty
good idea of whether

00:07:57.688 --> 00:07:59.903
Mistfall is something you might
want to back on Kickstarter.

00:07:59.905 --> 00:08:01.425
Because again, the link's right there.

00:08:01.777 --> 00:08:02.790
So that's it, folks.

00:08:02.792 --> 00:08:05.592
Questions, comments, concerns,
as always very appreciated.

00:08:05.594 --> 00:08:07.750
Any mistakes I've made,
I'd be more than happy to note them up,

00:08:07.752 --> 00:08:08.982
although if you notice any mistakes

00:08:08.984 --> 00:08:11.470
please check to make sure Paulo
didn't already catch them,

00:08:11.472 --> 00:08:12.556
because he normally does.

00:08:13.290 --> 00:08:14.625
And that's it, folks.

00:08:14.627 --> 00:08:15.298
Thanks for watching.

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:16.313
Talk to you later.

00:08:16.315 --> 00:08:16.920
So long.

00:08:17.833 --> 00:08:18.973
Bye bye.
