Okay, do you guys remember the clip i uploaded a few days ago?

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:06.690
Hey

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.100
Another player, cool bro. I'm level 19, what level are you?

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.360
Yes... 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.280
Something special happened the time I looked at that person in the game.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.920
Because I got under an hour later a message on my YouTube Trailer 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.440
That told me that the person was a streamer and he went to the bathroom, and all in the chat saw me.

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.680
And everyone in the chat loved me.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.440
I also learned that they all hailed me as a god.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.040
I began to find out what the hell his name was, and find his stream. And funny enough, he was still streaming.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:50.640
So I went in and said hello as my user SonMichael.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.340
And here's the result...

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.920
I didn't record the live video yet because I didn't expect it to be such a big deal. :D

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.780
Live comments

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:27.100
I say I'm Danish

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.640
This is just AWESOME!

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.320
After a bit fun and almost crying because it felt fucking great.

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:58.000
I decided to join the game to prove that it was me who wrote in the chat.

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.640
And that made it more hysterically hillarious!

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:05.860
The big moment

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:25.140
I subbed as thanks for the experience.

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:48.320
This is one unique experience that I am very positively happy with,

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:51.080
And I think it was really fun to watch

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:55.980
Let this be something you guys watching the video can take to yourselves.

00:05:55.980 --> 00:06:02.100
No matter what, something positive will happen to you. For instance someone who praise you during an livestream.

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:07.060
Or you find â‚¬500 lying on the street, or a third completely awesome thing.

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:12.100
You always have to think about the positives, and then it will happen to you.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.260
I hope you all have a fantastic day after watching this video.

00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:18.460
See ya

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.300
AND!

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.080
To all my french friends out there.
