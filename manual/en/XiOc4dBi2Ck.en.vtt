00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.680
quiero morales president bolivia in a
meeting in russia of course uh... where

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.190
all other countries that export energy
were there to discuss economic issues he

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.219
was asked at the time piano would you
consider getting asylum to head were

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.720
snowden who of course of the leaks on an
essay here the united states of america

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.009
and morales was only one of two leaders
who've said he would consider it

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:24.269
other was mature all of them as well

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.920
so apparently we had in our heads the
u_s_ government did in our

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.579
allied forces if you will

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.379
that uh... morales was going to take
things into his own hands

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:35.380
and actually sneak snowden

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.620
onto who's playing

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.559
and was still a way to bolivia

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:40.860
coming out of the caps

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.600
now first of all yet understand how
stupid this is

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.710
his plane took off

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.810
from a different airport in russia

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.730
then the when stone is that

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.190
so he would have had the women stones
airport and then take which he didn't do

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.300
nonetheless we were convinced archive
got a lot of land

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.699
so now in oregon timberland him morals
as plain as that

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.509
land somewhere and we feel their
original idea was their refuel in

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:06.630
portugal

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.689
but it turns out before they took off

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:11.829
the governor portal said hey we have
some information that you might have

00:01:11.829 --> 00:01:13.829
someone on board that you not allowed to
have

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:16.450
so you're not allow the land in fortune

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.160
bucket that is

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:19.700
a huge diplomatic issue

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.090
to begin with right there tell that

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.190
somberly elected leader of another
country you're not allowed to land in

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.970
our country and wheat and by the way of
course oblivious to say he's not on

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:29.909
board

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.060
n_s_a_ yet we don't believe you know a
lot of torture

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.310
and then he's going over to

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.220
she's flying over france

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.130
or about the flyover france for services
no

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.289
your towel on the flight over france we
think you've got

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:46.180
a fugitive on board

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.910
this is the president of bolivia ask
frazy

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.620
so now they're in a little bit of a
pedicure try to figure out where to go

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:57.750
eventually they gotta go to austria
because they got a land

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.979
in fact we have a clip of the pilot here

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.019
talking about how he's not sure about
how much fuel he has left

00:02:03.019 --> 00:02:06.200
and he's talking to ground control in
the analysts

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.389
prepared the hold

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:13.999
para room

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:17.839
para

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:24.839
we are

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:34.719
corporate ho

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:43.959
so what you heard there was still at the
time fuel situation i don't know how

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:46.109
much fuel and left panel and

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:50.629
now some people here that said well i
mean he didn't sound dire

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:52.810
suspect that abuses original and

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:55.590
anne woodland a minute let in land in
other places

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.460
he's got a land somewhere

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.490
you think you should get into a lot like
the valid but we're having a diplomatic

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.570
situation here

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:04.350
am i really want to check with you
diplomats busy might not allows the

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:08.480
lender either while we run out of fuel
while he's saying i cannot let you know

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.019
i have agarwal ant

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.659
so they land in vienna

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:13.470
that now

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.319
we get into a whole host of
disagreements

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.539
boston say well we boarded the plane
which i could see who was on it

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:23.119
we check every body's passport does this
border a policy and that's what we're

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:27.899
supposed to do of arouses governments
say alwyn this are playing with a lot of

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:29.259
check in

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:33.069
it in fact that the overall a setback in
a permit the plane to be searched

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:36.570
his and that some delinquent and because
this is an official plane

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.239
the president has been voluble immunity

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.689
well he's very right about that but i'm
not sure that's how it went down

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.259
who's the one part that i believe the
europeans then

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:47.969
i believe doctor foster has said they
checked the planet probably check the

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:48.710
plane

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.309
because they had a orders

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:54.219
they'd american government apparently
was very insisting the snow not go

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:55.199
anywhere

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:58.519
and if he s a breakthrough in voluble
immunity

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:00.269
of and other

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:01.470
president

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:05.209
president bombing apparently would do
that in a second

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:08.430
they still haven't we feel that any
statement like that in december ten

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:09.919
hours that right

00:04:09.919 --> 00:04:11.479
now they gotta get back up

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:15.699
and they got to go the canary islands in
spain to refuel over there

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.719
but things that we're not sure we'll let
you in so they send the spanish

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:21.060
ambassador indiana to apply

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:22.430
angus arouse sent

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.350
there on the tarmac in these like or
they're in the v_i_p_ allows an airport

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:27.950
aware borealis it overnight

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.740
is that at the spanish messes like well

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:34.369
how about we have some coffee inside the
plane

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:38.180
because you want to get on the plane
nations those not their at and morale is

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.259
ask who's so concerned about what some
might play

00:04:41.259 --> 00:04:42.850
answers quote

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:45.419
friends of spain

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.620
gee i wonder what they're talking about

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.789
could it be a friend named obama

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:52.949
that your friend in the united states of
america

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:54.229
loca

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:55.860
our of america

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.459
and not a good way

00:04:57.459 --> 00:04:58.509
that there

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:01.379
pushing around another president

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:04.829
while he's trying get back to his home
country saying you're not allowed to go

00:05:04.829 --> 00:05:06.770
there were going to search your plane

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:10.319
you can't land there you can't go
through that airspace

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:11.919
wrong in this world

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:16.269
by the way system erica not all
concerned

00:05:16.269 --> 00:05:17.849
about the criminality

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:21.539
that's known revealed innocent program
is illegal

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:22.889
section two fifteen

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:27.080
of the patriot act says that you must be
searching for tangible things

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:29.110
that are relevant to us this event

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.839
investigation

00:05:30.839 --> 00:05:35.330
format and out of all americans is not
relevant to a specific investigation

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:37.619
they're breaking the law

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:39.500
now already wear short ma'am

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:42.490
for the head of an essay for the head of
the eighth national intelligence for

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:45.089
president ball or i don't know any of
that right

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:47.360
but my god the guiding revealed

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.710
the criminal actions

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:53.380
of our government that we need an
international manhunt for and if we had

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.430
make sure that the plane on it

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.430
democratically elected president

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.580
is brought down and not allowed to go
anywhere with and that's what we're

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:01.499
gonna do

00:06:01.499 --> 00:06:02.840
amazing

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.299
now of course of your being covers are
back early

00:06:05.299 --> 00:06:08.809
this is a big of an enormous diplomatic
problem right now all the latin american

00:06:08.809 --> 00:06:11.189
leaders who uh... meeting

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:14.080
their and so we outraged by what
happened here

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:16.850
are argentina that as well as ecuador

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.010
every one of them saying they want us to
surmise is of little all colonial days

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.290
where the west can do whatever they
wanted to us

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:24.320
it isn't audible

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.330
also will breach

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:27.520
diplomacy

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.969
and how we're supposed to conduct

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:31.289
affairs among governments

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:35.110
but america's top ten of the rule lost
close so long ago

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.379
that they think well whatever is in a
week regularly other kind of law

00:06:38.379 --> 00:06:41.319
why don't we break this kind of that
just blah but

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:43.300
uh... certainly house was conduct

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:44.689
international affairs

00:06:44.689 --> 00:06:48.840
so now as you wonder well are there
appear vigorous tell the truth all may

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.740
be all morales is made out they had no
problems with their space

00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:55.000
well this french president francois
whole lot holland

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.409
he said as soon as i knew that it was
the plane oblivious president

00:06:59.409 --> 00:07:03.800
i'd immediately give wealth recent
authorization for the overnight flight

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:05.469
in other words

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:08.869
you did not give authorization before

00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:13.239
now he's got this tragic all i did
jotted on the president was on a flight

00:07:13.239 --> 00:07:16.870
but obviously you redirected the flight

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:19.530
the europeans

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:22.089
portuguese spanish etcetera

00:07:22.089 --> 00:07:24.059
not telling the truth here

00:07:24.059 --> 00:07:26.810
in almost a large forty appears to be

00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:27.969
telling the truth

00:07:27.969 --> 00:07:29.899
and by the way snowden was not

00:07:29.899 --> 00:07:34.300
on the plane

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:36.659
once you let go of the rule of law

00:07:36.659 --> 00:07:38.449
there are no bounds

00:07:38.449 --> 00:07:40.429
this is how we treat the rest of the
world

00:07:40.429 --> 00:07:42.129
and how we wonder why the

00:07:42.129 --> 00:07:45.550
then look at us with the state

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.699
perhaps wheat burned
