00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:07.020
Reach is a fictional planet in the halo universe
where the spartans were created.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.790
When the covenant found it, they glassed it.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.450
So what would it take to actually glass a
planet and is it even possible?

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.650
The geography of Reach is somewhat similar
to that of earth.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.410
It has mountains, deserts, and forests though
with about 43% more surface area and a second

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.289
moon, the system is a lot larger and more
complex.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:33.530
With a diameter of 15,275 kilometers and a
surface area of 733 million square kilometers,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.601
covering this planet with really anything
would be quite the feat of engineering.

00:00:36.601 --> 00:00:37.601
To say bombarding a planet with plasma is
impossible is like if Thomas Jefferson said

00:00:37.601 --> 00:00:38.601
putting a human on the moon is impossible.

00:00:38.601 --> 00:00:39.601
So for all intents and purposes, it’d be
wise to not underestimate the technologies

00:00:39.601 --> 00:00:40.601
of some foreign alien species and acknowledge
that we may not know everything.

00:00:40.601 --> 00:00:42.559
To achieve the glassing effect, the covenant
bombard the surface with plasma that melts

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:45.350
all natural rock, soil, and sand down.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.320
In the process, all of the oceans are vaporized
and essentially any living creature would

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.910
be, well not living anymore.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.989
Glassing isn’t quite achieved like the pretty
graph would lead you to believe.

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.570
It requires more appropriately sized ships
with proportionally sized plasma beams.

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.360
So traveling at 50 kilometers per hour, a
covenant battleship equipped with the necessary

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:14.780
equipment to produce a 5 square kilometer
plasma beam would take 332 years to complete

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:15.780
the operation.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.780
With 500 similar ships, this transformation
can be completed in a little over 8 months.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.560
This seems like a long time, but considering
Reach has been around for about 1 billion

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.630
years, destroying it under one is essentially
a blink of the cosmic eye.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.540
Plasma is generally measured in amount of
energy per unit volume, but for comparison

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.180
purposes let’s take a look at temperature.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.780
The average melting point of most silicates
is about 1200 degrees celsius, therefore you

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:44.560
need to make sure the plasma has enough exposure
time per unit area to transfer the necessary

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.320
energy into the ground to raise the temperature
to 1200 degrees.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:48.320
The z-machine is a man made plasma system
that has measured temperatures as 2 billion

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:49.320
degrees celsius, though this is not sustainable.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.320
This system generates temperatures in the
hundreds of millions and this interactive

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.320
model let’s you view the system in high
level.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.320
It’s pretty clear that even our most advanced
plasma technology, humans won’t be glassing

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.320
planets any time soon.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.320
If the covenant could transfer that much energy
through the atmosphere and onto the surface

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:55.850
it would be quite the sight to see.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.060
As the air molecules reached the high temperatures,
it would begin to glow various colors depending

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:05.299
on the composition and brief sprites of electricity
would jump from the air as magnetic fields

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:06.729
are altered.

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:11.790
Since the plasma would likely be created by
an energized beam, it would be difficult to

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.379
control over long distances as the electric
arc jumps from the ship to the surface.

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:18.792
As beautiful as this transformation would
be, you can’t help but feel the scale of

00:02:18.792 --> 00:02:19.792
the universe as millions of different species
from both plant and animal are erased.

00:02:19.792 --> 00:02:20.792
Millions of years of evolution and adaptation
are gone and it’s significance is merely

00:02:20.792 --> 00:02:21.792
a flicker of light in the nights sky from
the neighboring planet.

00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:23.380
So, that’s the science and devastation one
can expect from a process like glassing.

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:27.989
Now the question of the day is, where would
you hide if Earth was being glassed?
