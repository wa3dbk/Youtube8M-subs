00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.600
This is the elimination order of BFDI Season 1

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.500
made with paper cutouts.

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.140
Here I have the two teams,

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:13.920
the Tiny Loser Chamber to put eliminated contestants in,

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.300
and even the host!

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.440
So, here we go!

00:00:18.494 --> 00:00:22.494
Flower is the first one eliminated because she's very mean.

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.180
Then Spongy, Blocky, Woody...

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.540
...and Pin.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:44.060
Then Needle is eliminated, and Firey switches teams.

00:00:44.944 --> 00:00:49.184
Now the Squashy Grapes really outnumber the Squishy Cherries!

00:00:49.738 --> 00:00:52.858
And to make them even... make them even bigger,

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:56.700
Blocky rejoins on the Squashy Grapes.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.066
Now the Squashy Grapes are exactly twice the size of the Cherries,

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.540
so they will split up into two new teams.

00:01:07.506 --> 00:01:10.226
I have Another Name's square right here.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.560
So here are the current teams.

00:01:23.403 --> 00:01:28.283
Snowball switches to the Squishy Cherries, and Teardrop is eliminated.

00:01:30.334 --> 00:01:34.974
Rocky switches to the Squishy Cherries, and Golf Ball is eliminated.

00:01:34.974 --> 00:01:36.160
(mixed things up with Tennis Ball, but everything's okay now)

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.700
Tennis Ball switches to the Squashy Grapes, and Coiny is eliminated.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.960
Now we're at the Final 12. Teams merge at this point.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.260
Now the elimination order after the merge:

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.720
Snowball, Match...

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.760
Spongy rejoins...

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.780
Eraser, Pen, Blocky again...

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.080
Then Tennis Ball is eliminated, followed by the debut.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.360
I actually have David right here, hidden under the TLC.

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.120
[Aw, seriously?]

00:02:26.507 --> 00:02:29.067
Then Pencil and David are eliminated.

00:02:29.067 --> 00:02:32.400
[Aw, seriously?] Say something else. [No!]

00:02:36.567 --> 00:02:38.647
Then Ice Cube is eliminated...

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.300
...and Flower rejoins.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.500
In episode 22, the Announcer died.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:03:00.060
So Firey and Flower used replacement boxes to host the show.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.220
Rocky was eliminated,

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.160
and in the next episode,

00:03:06.426 --> 00:03:09.946
an Announcer Recovery Center fell down from the sky.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.680
*pop*

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.380
And the Announcer came back.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:16.280
*Bubble Recovery Center activates*

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.060
Spongy was eliminated again,

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.860
followed by Flower.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:25.980
Now we have the Final 3.

00:03:28.596 --> 00:03:29.796
In third place...

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.040
Bubble, sorry, but you don't win.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.440
The eliminated contestants are also released.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.640
Let's see who wins.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.140
*drumroll*

00:04:00.777 --> 00:04:01.577
Firey wins.

00:04:02.853 --> 00:04:05.733
So that's it. That's the elimination order

00:04:05.733 --> 00:04:07.860
of Battle for Dream Island Season 1.

00:04:09.631 --> 00:04:11.071
Thanks for watching.
