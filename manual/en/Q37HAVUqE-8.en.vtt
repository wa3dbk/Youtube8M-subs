00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:09.099
We're going to do a little test together – Take
a look at this image and tell me what you

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:10.099
see.

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:17.769
Okay, and now this one, this one and this
one.

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:23.140
This is an inkblot test, similar to the famous
Rorschach test, designed by Swiss psychologist

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:25.860
Hermann Rorschach in the 1920s.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.529
It’s been used since 1939 to examine your
personality by looking at what you associate

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.150
with these random ink blots.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:40.360
So when I look at them I see… a masquerade
mask, two people surrounded by evil leg-eating

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.800
fish, a leaf and a clown face.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.390
But we haven't only tested these images with
people.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.210
Recently Google researchers showed these images
to four different artificial intelligence

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.350
systems.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.740
They labelled their participants robot 1,
2, 3 and 4.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.940
And the robots all had quite different responses.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.720
In the first image, the robots saw a hook,
barrette, art and one said it was a Rorschach

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.500
inkblot.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:17.250
In the second a jigsaw puzzle, fleur-de-lis,
a design and a black ink splotch illustration.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:23.940
In the third a mask, pin, isolated and another
Rorschach inkblot.

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:30.450
And in the fourth image a hook, handle-bar
mustache, a print and a black face paint print.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.130
So… if a machine can understand and independently
answer a personality test...

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:38.049
Can computers have personalities?

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:46.540
The term “Robot” was coined by Czech playwright
Karel Capek, in his 1920 play Rossum’s Universal

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:47.800
Robots.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.150
Typically the word makes people think of a
metal-clad machine with blinking lights and

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:58.240
a monotone voice, or a modern version of that,
but robots include machines that dispose of

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.250
bombs, perform delicate surgeries and virtual
software agents, what we also call Artificial

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.260
Intelligence or A.I.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.220
In his 1950 paper, "Computing Machinery and
Intelligence".

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.310
Alan Turing proposed a test called 'The Imitation
Game', where a human examiner would listen

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.690
to a conversation between another human and
a machine.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:25.290
If the examiner can’t tell who is human
or machine, the machine wins the imitation

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:26.290
game.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.810
It’s artificially intelligent.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.600
That test is now widely known as The Turing
test.

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.630
A strength of the Turing test is that it’s
really simple.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.180
It doesn’t matter how we define intelligence,
the examiner sits there and decides who is

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.190
human and who is machine.

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.550
It’s still considered a milestone in Artificial
Intelligence.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.720
Though in contrast, the Rorschach test is
pretty out of date.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.860
A big part of the test involves you explaining
why you see what you see.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:03:00.930
And an examiner uses a scoring system to tell
you what this says about your personality.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.470
Studies have shown it’s not reliable or
valid.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.599
Really, the Rorschach test is better described
as a problem solving task that gives us some

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.069
indication of your past and future behaviours,
or at least some of your thoughts.

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:19.390
And the fact that mechanical brains can have
unique thoughts, enough to distinguish responses

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:22.300
in a task like this, is pretty cool.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.360
It does set them apart in some way – but
is it personality?

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.720
Personality can be defined as “The unique
psychological qualities of an individual that

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:37.080
influence a variety of characteristic behavior
patterns across different situations and over

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.430
time.”

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.670
But how does it apply to robots?

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:47.540
In his collection of stories I, Robot, Isaac
Asimov introduced “Robopsychology” as

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:51.270
the study of the personalities of intelligent
machines.

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:56.330
It started out as fantasy but Heather Knight,
a roboticist from Carnegie Mellon University,

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:01.599
argues that robots need personality so we
can achieve things with machines that neither

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:03.599
of us could do alone.

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.959
And earlier this year Google patented a method
to download and customise personality to a

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:10.959
robot.

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.409
But, what does a robot personality look like?

00:04:14.409 --> 00:04:19.109
In humans our personality traits are our thoughts,
feelings and behaviours that distinguish us

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:21.100
from each other.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.470
The Five Factor Model of personality suggests
your traits are organised in terms of five

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:27.820
broad factors.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.780
Research indicates these traits are present
from a young age, come from both nature and

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:36.320
nurture and can change throughout your life.

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:41.040
The plasticity principle suggests personality
is an open system that can be influenced by

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:42.840
your environment.

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.460
Research suggests change is most likely at
certain ages or life stages (think 20-40 or

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.510
when you become a parent).

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.220
We tend to think of robot personality like
we think about human personality, that everyone’s

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:58.380
different based on our makeup and experience.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:03.580
After all, those different A.I. saw different
things in the inkblot test.

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.370
But if one A.I., like Apple’s Siri, has
millions of interactions every day, what does

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:11.900
that mean for its personality?

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:17.820
Siri, do you have a personality?

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.659
I can’t answer that.

00:05:19.659 --> 00:05:22.590
Let me know what you think in the comments.
