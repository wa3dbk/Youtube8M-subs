00:00:00.203 --> 00:00:02.360
- Today we are making a Wolf's Bite.

00:00:02.917 --> 00:00:05.231
It's like you got bit by a wolf.

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:09.970
(laughs)

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:12.268
- This is one of the first
drinks I ever gave you

00:00:12.268 --> 00:00:13.359
on Tipsy Bartender.

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:13.963
- Really?

00:00:13.963 --> 00:00:15.240
- Do you remember what happened?

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:17.537
- I couldn't take it.
- Exactly.

00:00:19.246 --> 00:00:20.862
(gulp)

00:00:22.717 --> 00:00:26.347
- (coughs) Too much!
- [Bartender] I'm a genius, right?

00:00:26.726 --> 00:00:28.262
- [Bartender] I'm a genius, right?

00:00:29.193 --> 00:00:31.072
That shit's still lit up.
(girl coughs)

00:00:31.445 --> 00:00:32.581
- It's too much!

00:00:32.815 --> 00:00:33.951
(laughs)

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.482
Absinthe, pour.
- Okay.

00:00:36.995 --> 00:00:38.664
It's that damn Absinthe, man.

00:00:39.247 --> 00:00:40.568
- Midori, pour!

00:00:42.985 --> 00:00:44.446
Pineapple juice, pour.

00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:45.770
Stop.

00:00:47.157 --> 00:00:49.926
Shake it and keep it sexy!

00:00:54.374 --> 00:00:57.292
(laughs)

00:00:59.287 --> 00:01:02.023
That's the most horrible
orgasm look I've ever seen.

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:03.906
Stop about here.
- Okay.

00:01:05.263 --> 00:01:08.921
- Keep going, go, no keep going, stop.

00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:12.288
Sprite, top it off.

00:01:12.847 --> 00:01:13.567
- All the way to the top?

00:01:13.567 --> 00:01:14.772
- Little more, okay stop.

00:01:15.378 --> 00:01:17.071
- This is the bite.

00:01:19.474 --> 00:01:21.460
- Here, pour some of
that in, just drip it.

00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:26.057
Okay, that's it.

00:01:26.825 --> 00:01:28.936
- So, I'm a new woman.

00:01:29.704 --> 00:01:30.424
- What?

00:01:30.424 --> 00:01:32.237
- I'm a new (laughs)

00:01:32.237 --> 00:01:33.719
- What do you mean you're a new woman?

00:01:34.046 --> 00:01:36.622
- (laughs) I couldn't
take the drink (laughs)

00:01:37.854 --> 00:01:39.688
I couldn't drink the
drink before, (laughs)

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.985
but it's a new day.
- Okay.

00:01:42.118 --> 00:01:43.660
- [Girl] I'm a new woman.
- Okay.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:44.171
- It's a new day.

00:01:44.171 --> 00:01:46.098
- And there you have it, the wolf's bite!

00:01:46.098 --> 00:01:47.074
Go ahead for Christ's sakes.

00:01:47.074 --> 00:01:48.836
- So take it one shot?

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:50.183
- [Bartender] It's so sexy, though.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.530
Don't mess this up.

00:01:54.434 --> 00:01:56.152
- There you have it!

00:01:56.921 --> 00:01:57.636
- And how is it?

00:01:58.172 --> 00:01:59.194
- It was good, actually.

00:01:59.194 --> 00:01:59.844
- You like it?

00:01:59.844 --> 00:02:00.528
- Yeah.

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:05.068
It's like, I don't usually
like black licorice taste,

00:02:05.068 --> 00:02:08.365
but it's masked very well with the Midori

00:02:08.872 --> 00:02:10.667
and everything else that we added,

00:02:10.667 --> 00:02:11.807
the pineapple and stuff,

00:02:11.807 --> 00:02:14.255
and you just have an
aftertaste of Absinthe.

00:02:14.255 --> 00:02:15.795
- And more importantly, it's sexy.

00:02:15.795 --> 00:02:17.223
- It's sexy though.

00:02:17.223 --> 00:02:18.736
Look at those eyeballs.

00:02:18.736 --> 00:02:20.106
- I like to reiterate this though.

00:02:20.106 --> 00:02:23.299
Absinthe was never designed
to be done as a shot,

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:24.738
it's supposed to be mixed with water

00:02:24.738 --> 00:02:26.596
and a little bit of sugar
- ...and sipped on.

00:02:26.596 --> 00:02:28.511
- [Bartender] ...and you sit
there and you sip and chill.

00:02:28.511 --> 00:02:30.123
- And then you hallucinate like
- But!

00:02:30.123 --> 00:02:30.736
- a crazy ass.

00:02:30.736 --> 00:02:33.364
- Because of it's potency,
we put it in shots

00:02:33.364 --> 00:02:36.113
just to put hair on
these girls chests, okay.

00:02:36.113 --> 00:02:39.050
Because we love our chicks
hairy on Tipsy Bartender.

00:02:39.294 --> 00:02:41.406
- Yeah, hairy, that's how I am.

00:02:41.616 --> 00:02:44.006
I still can't take big shooter shots.

00:02:44.426 --> 00:02:45.724
It's too much liquid.

00:02:45.773 --> 00:02:47.096
- [Bartender] But you
need to man up, though.

00:02:47.096 --> 00:02:48.582
- But it's not the alcohol content,

00:02:48.582 --> 00:02:49.718
it's the liquid.

00:02:50.022 --> 00:02:51.508
- Pee before you come to set!

00:02:51.508 --> 00:02:53.828
- If it was water, I couldn't
chug that much liquid either.

00:02:53.853 --> 00:02:56.639
- [Bartender] Pee before
you come to set, okay?

00:02:59.406 --> 00:03:00.741
- I'll show you pee.

00:03:00.921 --> 00:03:02.658
- [Bartender] Go ahead, pee, go ahead.

00:03:02.658 --> 00:03:04.893
Dude, this will be awesome,
you could pee right there.

00:03:04.893 --> 00:03:06.053
Oh my God! (laughs)

00:03:06.668 --> 00:03:09.464
This a super creative shot,
I love this whole setup.

00:03:09.536 --> 00:03:11.206
Okay, girls, are you ready?

00:03:11.718 --> 00:03:12.459
Go ahead.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:13.445
- Cheers Meghan.

00:03:13.445 --> 00:03:14.665
- Cheers!

00:03:14.806 --> 00:03:15.435
(screams)

00:03:15.435 --> 00:03:16.713
- [Bartender] Hold it, hold
it, hold it, lock it in.

00:03:16.713 --> 00:03:17.554
- Good luck.

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.123
- [Bartender] Lock it in.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.999
Jenny, you better finish that shot.

00:03:24.094 --> 00:03:25.426
There goes Meghan, look at that.
