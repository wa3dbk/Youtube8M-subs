00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.480
is this litany candidate really talking here
about

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.240
classic in modern games centuries

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:11.179
this is going to keep

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:12.820
great counsel

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.179
out

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:16.750
and since well informed

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.909
this controller

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:21.399
it's already been here now

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:22.869
look at it

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.890
what did the tried and true

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.900
but you can still hold on the planet

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.960
you know third party history

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.820
I've got this one person

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.580
why do many things

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:42.170
a concern party says there should be making
progress tend to be less expensive but how

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.790
deeply regrets

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.190
firstly

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.030
there's different things there is a slow but
now don't get it

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.520
there's a collar vote in

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.060
are cleared and said

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.940
on the other coast of Florida

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.560
but one how do you hold this

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.160
you like this

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:59.570
for what

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.960
it's really use of that company

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.360
on this one

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.479
and so you know the was a retrospective deeper
cut

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:11.690
look at this

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.020
it's even worse things once in the head and
all you have to live with it

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.750
how do you plan like this

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:27.750
it's just ridiculous

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.460
a game morning

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.630
be taken there are the game ratings have been
certainly

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.900
no more taxes

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.620
it should've been bilking but

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.730
and we stood by nintendo the ground level
he is is the key their homes batteries

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.380
to tripoli

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.210
one battering

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.500
if they're interrogated in the course

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.200
it's a wire

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.719
they had these big yet they need their own
battery just to make the control of the remote

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.820
does that make sense to anyone

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.810
why would you want more there is absolutely
nothing that took power cord

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.289
that's the point

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:13.260
you're the generators

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.980
I don't get one limine regarding it's a cartridge
then

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.539
she revealed controllers be controlled

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:24.239
and shoving

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.969
he

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:27.569
the new year

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:31.259
now you can take your memory your friends

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:33.469
like in the bill that in your something

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:34.950
it's pretty useless

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:37.650
the vaccine Peter eighteen

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:42.370
like that's at least a different set of the
these games magazine

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.759
but still look at the to use it

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:45.980
our reviewer

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.230
one by nintendo

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:48.559
that's a small one

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:52.029
as well as the wife of it's more

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:55.749
here's the third party wants

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:59.519
my initial big and why is it in one times

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:00.350
what will

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.329
one time what than four times

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:05.289
why don't you get the east

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:07.679
they don't even make sense

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:10.589
somebody needs the memories games

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:16.229
now on thank you

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:19.889
it's also a great system

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.029
he's to control

00:03:21.029 --> 00:03:24.609
it's a little better than sixty four still
pretty weird

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:25.959
but no

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:28.199
do you think parents are state controlled

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:32.489
look it is whenever a clear inference nobody
wanted to use it

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.049
well the only good things will get it

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.760
it's so messed up I don't even get it

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.949
like they're paying close is but still who
wants the it looks horrible

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:48.590
and or standards regarding controllers is
that if you ask for comptroller for christmas

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.479
thirdly whatever you can get a what I wanted

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:53.670
by accident we know that you need

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.669
they should be made to us to actually better
fierce next box control

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.309
it's horrible just just trust me

00:04:02.309 --> 00:04:04.629
the bodies of his favorite or talks this

00:04:04.629 --> 00:04:07.189
it's the her like an hour

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:08.140
these things

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.949
and so he's going to do

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:16.900
and i'd also to wireless was of these as a
noxious national tentative about that

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:17.609
now

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:18.630
I don't have one

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.439
to the superintendent

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:21.569
look at this

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:23.650
it looks exactly the same

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:25.379
so what's the point

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:26.580
why would you take it

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.210
that's it for comptroller

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:30.970
if it's exactly the same all the differences

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.389
green here

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:34.599
no super nintendo

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:37.180
why were you scared

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.969
he said here's another thing

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:41.150
he is making more grand scheme of parliament

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:44.699
this is when they made together according
also works on the more times

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:46.479
she turned on

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:50.839
this really is pretty hard to see seven this
late

00:04:50.839 --> 00:04:54.279
which you can see there

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:56.150
there you go

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:59.990
it doesn't make much of a difference

00:04:59.990 --> 00:05:01.909
when carrot that's that's the look

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:05.330
no difference

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:08.830
if you lights

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:11.330
here's a it with nothing

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.389
there's a poll and you can see clearly but
how many times are you playing at art

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:20.099
thank you miles

00:05:20.099 --> 00:05:24.449
sir

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:26.080
there it is to the left

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.550
you can see pretty well

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.349
what's the point

00:05:32.349 --> 00:05:34.639
also the more intense

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:36.439
good that's good

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:41.740
I really did was engaged with him at the controllers
but

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:47.470
this point is that the portable in small you
don't think we're talking he can't convince

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:49.900
war thing in your pocket

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.139
on you know why I haven't the yes

00:05:52.139 --> 00:05:53.689
now this is the worst fears

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:55.529
third party can see of all time

00:05:55.529 --> 00:06:00.059
I got that he was during the day came out
so the theory that he shared and I was like

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:00.710
a pro

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:03.139
so I expect that he was really the issue

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:06.370
Mike from by microsoft

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:08.179
here's what we got

00:06:08.179 --> 00:06:11.729
microphone already broke off a a it never
worked

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:13.100
look at this

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:14.409
what's the point

00:06:14.409 --> 00:06:17.859
if it doesn't work what he didn't give a damn

00:06:17.859 --> 00:06:20.119
it was a waste of time

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:23.809
the one thing that they're great you should
make these charges

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:25.720
when he loses been used to

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:28.110
while heaping fifty dollars for something
that came with it

00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.020
was a fifty dollar system

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:33.839
we need to make third party things in the
east and that'll be useful

00:06:33.839 --> 00:06:35.250
look it

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.710
lloyd bentsen speed dialing center

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:41.029
you can replace the batteries is that

00:06:41.029 --> 00:06:45.749
if anyone knows then they would make some
money and make her case

00:06:45.749 --> 00:06:46.650
right now

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:47.929
oh yes

00:06:47.929 --> 00:06:50.389
is this once again

00:06:50.389 --> 00:06:53.110
some that's my review of excess trees

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:54.889
today he

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:57.569
comment on the economy the hopeful lawyers

00:06:57.569 --> 00:06:59.740
his party to ask you you've ever seen

00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:01.530
we're in with

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:03.859
first party won

00:07:03.859 --> 00:07:05.069
it's a trend

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:05.919
he's out

00:07:05.919 --> 00:07:08.840
this is what's he like

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.570
really quick shot share of your

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:12.350
check your it's and yes point

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:13.619
really good videos

00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:15.860
I actually don't personally

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.909
chickens and turkeys channel overall not going
to sidebar

00:07:18.909 --> 00:07:19.389
that's it for now
