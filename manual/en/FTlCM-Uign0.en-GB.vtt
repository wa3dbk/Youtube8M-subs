00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:06.410
The 4x4 market has changed enormously in recent
years. Compact SUVs fill the sector, with

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.100
each new model becoming softer and less focused.
Indeed, many aren't even four-wheel drive.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.960
So what are your options if you still need
transport for the depths of the countryside?

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.720
Luckily, there is one manufacturer that knows
more about four-wheel drive than almost any

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.820
other - Subaru - and one of their more practically-minded
options is the Forester.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.419
Now in its fourth generation, the Subaru Forester
occupies a niche all of its own. Something

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:33.199
of a cross between a large estate car and
a full-blown off-roader, the new Forester

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.149
is taller, wider and longer than the model
it replaces.

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.640
The new Forester now wears a hexagonal front grille, flanked by a pair of aggressive 'hawk-eye'

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.019
headlights.
The shape has been refined, most notably by

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:49.530
moving the A-pillar forwards and curving the
roofline as it flows towards the rear, and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.339
these changes improve its aerodynamic performance.
The interior has been tidied up, and although

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.309
some of the materials are still a little behind
the softer competition, there's everything

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:05.630
you could need in here, with all models benefitting
from climate control and heated seats. The

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.780
Pioneer satnav fitted to some models does
looks a little down-market by comparison,

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.460
though.
The dials are clear and easy to read, and

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.240
the separate display on top of the centre
console shows a variety of information regarding

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.360
MPG, both current, average and historical,
and a funky screen that shows what the wheels

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.110
are up to.
There's plenty of room in all directions for

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.829
five adults and, even with the world's largest
sunroof, there's sufficient headroom for a

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:37.460
car full of Abraham Lincoln impersonators.
Gaining entry is easy thanks to the extra-wide

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.579
opening doors, and rear seat passengers are
well accommodated once aboard, with a new,

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:47.299
lowered transmission tunnel.
Cargo space has been increased over the old

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:53.039
model, with 505 litres with the seats in place.
A series of storage compartments can be found

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.030
under the boot floor, including a space to
store the otherwise rather fiddly load cover

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.399
when it's not in use. With the seats folded,
there's 1,592 litres available, although with

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.960
the seats down there's a slight step in the
load floor. Tall drivers will need to watch

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:13.150
their heads, too, as the tailgate doesn't
open quite far enough.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.700
Three engines are available: a 2.0-litre petrol
with 150PS, another 2.0-litre taken from the

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.430
BRZ but with an added turbo taking power to
240PS, and this, the 2.0-litre 'Boxer' diesel

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:31.430
with 147PS.
Its unusual layout offers up an appealing off-beat

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:38.569
thrum from inside the cabin, while its willing
throttle response makes it feel more urgent

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:45.569
than its 10.2 second 0-62mph time would suggest.
It's efficient, too, with emissions of 150g/km

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:52.920
and we had no trouble achieving a mid-40s
mpg figure.

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:00.510
On the move, the six-speed manual gearbox
shifts efficiently if somewhat mechanically

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.120
through its well-chosen ratios, although there
isn't quite enough room between the transmission

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.970
tunnel and clutch pedal to use the foot rest.
The steering is wonderfully light at parking

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.780
speeds but weights up usefully once on the
move, and the long-travel suspension does

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.860
an excellent job of soaking up even the largest
of our road network's pot-holes.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:24.319
What's unique about the Forester is its ability
to maintain its road-holding even when conditions

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:31.319
deteriorate. On rain-soaked, mud-strewn, or
even snow-covered roads, the Forester's four-wheel

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:37.260
drive starts to pay real dividends.
All Forester models feature Subaru's symmetrical

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:44.260
all-wheel drive system which, on manual models,
uses a 50/50 front/rear torque distribution.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:49.030
Throw in the Forester's ground clearance of
220mm, beating that even of a Land Rover Freelander,

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.200
and the Subaru becomes the perfect tool for
navigating farm tracks, traversing a muddy

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:58.329
field at your local point-to-point, or rescuing
stricken festival goers.

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:02.959
Prices for the Subaru Forester start at Â£24,995,
and standard equipment on even the base model

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.290
includes alloy wheels, heated seats and climate
control. The Forester range also benefits

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:14.470
from a five-year 100,000 mile warranty.
It's around this time of year that local TV

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.700
news programmes fill with reports of flooded
roads, sheep swallowed by snow drifts, and

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.560
the plight of a motorist who turned their
Metro into an impromptu submarine.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:28.460
With the Subaru Forester, none of that matters.
Wade past submerged motorists, rescue Dolly

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.780
from a hilltop. Or, just take the kids to
school safe in the knowledge that no matter

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.580
what the weatherman tells you, as far as you're
concerned, the road is clear.
