00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Annyeonghaseyo; je ileum Crown On inmida!

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.000
First of all, before I tell my life story and reveal my skills,

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.200
I would like to thank everyone who supported me and still support me;

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.600
Thanks to you I was able to reach the final round.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:18.040
It’s so touching when I see you helping me achieve my dream. 

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.900
All these comments… All these messages…

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.854
When I see that, I really have the feeling of becoming invincible. This is a very strong feeling. 

00:00:23.854 --> 00:00:25.520
Thank you so much for all this.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.340
All this energy, this courage, this love that you gave me.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:30.620
Thank you so much for all these things!

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.920
So now, it’s time to introduce myself.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.220
My name is Oscar, I am 17 years old and I study Music in France.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.120
I discovered this art at the age of 5 when I took my firsts piano lessons.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.220
 In fact, I learned music at the same time I learned to read and write.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:56.040
It’s been 12 years that it’s by my side in everything I do.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.080
Learning the piano, singing, discovering rap and writing lyrics.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.280
 I had the time to do a lot in 12 years.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.960
I even had the time to find a dream!

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.500
Entering the Asian Musical Industry and then living and traveling through my art. 

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.500
Now that you know these few details about me, let me tell you about these last past weeks. 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.900
For those who already know me, I am going to repeat some things I already have said some time ago.

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:25.520
At the end of October, on soompi.com, I randomly found on an article about the “Soompi Ulzzang Contest 2014”, a beauty contest.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.600
For me, this competition had no real interest, but I confess that I quickly changed my mind. 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.500
Why?

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.854
 For the same reason that brought the 1 000 other participants to take part to this competition:

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.360
An interview with TS Ent. for the winners. An opportunity to integrate the agency.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.540
As I have already said, my thoughts about this beauty contest have quickly changed!

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.360
Clearly I had to take part!

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.880
 I never wanted to miss opportunities to realize my dream.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.640
I am not particularly handsome, how to get to the end?

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.014
That’s right, I should have thought of this before…

00:01:56.014 --> 00:01:58.700
It was more than obvious that I did not have my place here!

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.680
While I continued my research, I found a page that talked about the competition of the past year

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.340
where Round 4 allowed participants to turn a one-minute video and reveal their talents…

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.680
The competition really took a meaning at that time.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:14.340
I was going to do everything to reach the final round! I was going to work again and again, always harder for the final round.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.940
It became a real obsession!

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.120
So much that I had forgotten the original intent of the competition: reward the most beautiful people!

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:23.038
I’m only 17 years old. I can only be a kid for you!

00:02:23.038 --> 00:02:25.820
Become a star: All the children dream of that one day! 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.340
I’m one among many others. This dream will maybe get out of my head.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.540
You must have these kind of thoughts while watching my video.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.660
But I’m not an ordinary kid…

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.980
I’m the worst, the most stubborn kid ever!

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.800
No matter how long it will take me to get there, I will do everything to make my dream come true.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.880
No no… I will not give up… Never…

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.620
The shy boy that I am will become a strong man. I don’t want to miss other opportunities. 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:51.240
Fighting ~!!!

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.700
You can see, finally, that the rules of this year’s competition are not the same as the one of last year !

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.280
No videos…

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.980
No opportunity for me to show my skills …?
I failed.. ?!

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.875
No no, I became much stronger ! 

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:06.460
I have no regrets ! I really did my best !

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.534
Although the contest did not require this, I’m going to show you what I can do !

00:03:10.534 --> 00:03:13.440
I have to do it because you have done so much for me …

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.320
If I reached up to there, it’s thanks to you. Thank you for supporting me !

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.960
I will never forget what you have done for me !

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.260
♥♥♥ Saranghaeyo ~! ♥♥♥
