00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.590
IN Temple Texas, Mary Lew and David Quesinberry
want a garden, not a lawn.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.469
They didn't want seed all at once flat demention
either.

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:24.310
We moved here in 1998 it was a long flat narrow
lot with cedar elms and probably about three

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:25.780
live oaks.

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.130
This wasn't their first garden but when they
fell in love with this property they realized

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.590
the plants they'd grown wern't going to work.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:40.260
We moved here and we saw these beautiful deer
peaking out from the woods and they just had

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.429
these huge racks and we were so excited and
we had a herd of 27 deer when we moved here.

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:53.870
Rather then fence out the deer, they planted
plants that usually are safe from nibbling.

00:00:53.870 --> 00:01:00.479
We hate fences so we wanted a living fence
or a screen and so that's what we did all

00:01:00.479 --> 00:01:07.549
around the property was-we'd have little seedlings
come up and we'd just plant around them.

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:13.680
Orchid trees come up and we just dig them
up and plant them in various places.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.870
Rather than be mad at the deer we wanted the
deer to be welcomed in the garden.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.510
In back the dementional view for watching
wild life starts neer the house.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.480
It's panorama enterance from the patio indoors
refreshes even when it's hot.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:37.770
Seasonal changes join perpetual structure
Musicians tune up in the shady cove.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.160
When mary Lew and David saw this group of
trees for the first time they knew at once

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.750
that it was the perfect spot for a picnic
table.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:55.720
A near by shed harbors the tools that are
in their hands every spare minute.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:02.140
A decomposed granite pathway seperates the
cove from sunnier gardens that frame the garden

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:05.000
with evergreen distiguous trees and shrubs.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.160
They frame textures and colors with wildlife
attraction all year.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.920
Perenials join self seeding annuals.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.870
Moving around the bend, they change perspective
with the first burn they built.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.650
That garden evolved because there's no water
back tehre.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.639
And the land back there was just flat.

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:28.049
We don't like just flat land.

00:02:28.049 --> 00:02:37.010
A dry streen diflects crazy rain but mainly
it simply adds to the charm.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.409
They got help with the largest boulders but
mostly they haulded them all themselves.

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:45.159
The family calls it Grandpa's Garden.

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:46.799
But they didn't stop there.

00:02:46.799 --> 00:02:53.739
We were just gunna have one back there and
we said well your not supposed to have just

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.180
this one thing back there lets do three.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:01.109
Have three burms.

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.549
We did it one rock at a time.

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:04.650
One plant at a time.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.870
We had no plan.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.680
We just, it was like playing.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.629
It was like lets pretend like when you're
a kid.

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:18.700
Let's pretend lets do this this way then the
other one will go yeah, well what if we do

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:28.020
this. and we just kind of knocked ideas off
of eachother and basically around one plant.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.069
What if we buy this plant, what are we going
to do with it?

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:36.090
We bought plants and didn't know what to do
with them after we got home.

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:38.790
That was all mowed.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:42.290
We took hours and hours to mow it.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:47.249
This is so silly.

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:52.040
Along with habitat and food for wildlife,
they make sure there is water too.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.400
Their plants dont need much, but their creatures
do.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:59.230
People ask well what do you do about pest
control?

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.209
You don't need any pest control.

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:04.239
If you have water, you have the birds.

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.769
The birds take care of everything.

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:10.510
I came out here one night, we have a bird
bath there in the back.

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:16.260
And there was a screech owl in there taking
a bath at night time.

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.240
We got a picture of him too!

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.510
He was so cute.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.350
He just kinda turned around to look at me
and he went back to taking his bath.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:32.830
Your wasps and bees and spiders and everything
now have a purpose so we don't try to kill

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.280
anything except fire ants.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:44.070
Their newest project in spare time is a pond
and waterfall as much for the wildlife as

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:45.290
for them.

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:51.380
We've extended the patio so that a lot of
that soil rather than have them carry it off

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:53.170
we just had them stack it back there.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:55.650
We thought oh we'll make a waterfall.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:03.390
A lot of the inspiration we get from in the
house looking out at the windows and we go

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.220
that seems like the perfect spot to put it.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.790
Cuz we'll enjoy it when we're in the house
too.

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:14.150
And certainly, its all a wonderland for kids.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:19.070
My grand children love it here.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.380
They just wanna come outside all the time.

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.940
They just love playing out here.

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.850
My grandson has a little electric car and
he just drives all over the roads.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.710
He's so cute.

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:35.940
And I think my little granddaughter is going
to be a gardener.

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:36.940
She just loves it.

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:43.150
She loves raking she just loves working in
the garden.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.250
When they get a little older we're going to
put them to work.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:53.740
In front, they changed the formerly dull demention
with multiple hardscapes destinations and

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.440
plants formal and casual.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:01.080
they didn't banish all the lawn but they did
exchange buffalo grass for water wides,pallacades.

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:03.860
Origionally we had buffallo out there.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:11.640
But when they put the grass in there with
little sprigs of bermuda in the dirt and I

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:18.090
mentioned that to them and they didn't seem
to mind the bermuda just kinda overtook the

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.090
buffalo.

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.730
In an outcove, they didnt swamp it with shrubs
when they replaced the grass, instead they

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.370
made it a cozy view point.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:32.060
When we virst moved here, we had grass from
the house to the street.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:40.210
And we built beds all around taht area to
get rid of the grass and we just thought it

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:42.030
looked prettier.

00:06:42.030 --> 00:06:45.730
It's just boring just to have grass from the
house to the street.

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:49.550
We just have those little islands of grass.

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.880
You have to have the grass to let your eye
rest.

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:58.700
If it's too wild, you get tired.

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:02.850
Antique horse hitches that they rescued in
Temple mark the entrance from the side walk

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.970
to the front door.

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:09.520
David and Mary Lew have always gardened but
she took the step to become a Bell county

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:14.300
master gardener with encouragement from collegues
at Scott and White Hostpital.

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:20.990
It's wonderful to be around people that are
just so excited about nature and plants.

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:22.830
are Mary Lew and David finished?

00:07:22.830 --> 00:07:25.160
Oh, probably not.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:26.470
It's just like a painting.

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:34.160
You just wanna keep making it pretty.
