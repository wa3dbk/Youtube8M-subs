00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:26.330
The world is going through a convulsion right
now and how the economics of Greece and Baghdad

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:32.800
and the dishonest kinds of economics that
have been going on in the industrial world,

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.350
how all this is going to play out, I don’t
know. But it was very clear to me five years

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.589
ago that even before any of this came over
the horizon that there’s two factors at

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:52.001
work that are going to cause everybody in
the English speaking world to get poorer and

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:56.970
it’s unavoidable. And one of them is the
fact that there’s a billion Chinese and

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.350
there’s a billion Indians now in the labour
market, these are well educated hard working

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.880
people, they may be better educated and harder
working than most people. And they’ve been

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:14.390
suppressed for a long time and kept out of
economic activity, now they’re in the game.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.900
And we in Australia are going to have to compete
with a billion Chinese and a billion Indians

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:25.530
who work for one twentieth of the wages that
we do. There’s only one thing that can possibly

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:33.730
happen as a result of this. Our wages and
their wages are going to equalise and 20 years

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.009
from now the Indians and the Australians are
probably going to be more or less equal in

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:47.560
balance. No war, no legislation, no tariff
barrier, nothing the government can do is

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.679
going to stop this. The only thing that might
stop it would be a collapse in global trade

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:54.390
which of course would even give us a bigger
problem to deal with. So that’s the first

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.740
thing we’re all going to have to deal with.
The second thing is actually over something

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:09.770
called peak oil, I’m sure you’ve heard
of peak oil. There is going to be ever less

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.310
oil available to us from here on in. And that
means that the price of oil is going to go

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.790
ever higher. And that’s in real dollars,
it’s going to go higher and then higher

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.430
again. And since everything in our world is
made out of oil, all food is basically oil,

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.860
I mean without oil we can’t grow the food,
we can’t make the tractor to turn the ground

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.360
over, we can’t make the chemicals to make
the fertilisers, the entire food system is

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.940
based on petroleum, and so everything that
we buy is going to start costing more. So

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.940
on the one hand we’re going to get poorer,
our wages in real dollars are going to go

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.130
down because we’re having to compete with
the Chinese and the Indians and on the other

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:02.120
hand everything we buy is going to cost more
because oil is going to go up. And one answer

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:07.770
to this bind that everybody is going to find
themselves in is growing a vegetable garden.

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:14.260
Food gardening is very counter cyclical in
economic terms. When things are prosperous

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.100
people don’t want to have a garden in the
summer time, they want to get in their car

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.930
and go on a vacation. When times get hard
they think about food gardening. And so being

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.360
in the gardening business is actually pretty
good insurance against hard times. So times

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.450
are going to get tough. Times are tough. They’re
going to get tougher and then are going to

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.840
get tougher again. And even if the government
tells us we’re having good times, most people

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:37.950
are going to have a hard time.
