00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:17.090
Good afternoon.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.960
With me today are Richard Muth. Director of
the Maryland Emergency Management Agency.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:30.189
Standing next to him in the General's uniform
is General Adkins of the Maryland National

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:31.189
Guard.

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.930
To my right is Beverly Swaim-Staley, Secretary
of Transportation and to her right is Neil

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.070
Pedersen.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:46.410
Let me give you an update on this snow emergency.
It's going to be a big snow.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.890
We're prepared to deal with whatever Mother
Nature throws at us.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.670
We've had some experience already this year
and this one is going to be even bigger than

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:58.800
the last one if the predictions come through.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.120
Right now, as you know, the latest forecast
that we've seen indicates that Maryland could

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.640
get anywhere between 20 to 30 inches of snow

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:13.240
and it appears from the track of this that
it is bearing right down on the I-95 corridor.

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:16.600
And that's where we believe the snow fall
will be heaviest.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.740
Namely, where most of the population lives.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.000
We're also on guard for a couple of effects
on the Eastern Shore.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.280
Because this is a Nor'easter we are on guard
and highly sensitive to the potential of coastal

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.599
flooding.

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:38.560
Because this is a Nor'easter and because of
the winds on the Eastern Shore, they're far

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.739
more likely to encounter blizzard conditions
than we are here although we may still encounter

00:01:43.739 --> 00:01:44.890
those here.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.069
Lesser amounts of snow fall in Western Maryland
than on the Eastern Shore. Director Muth will

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:53.539
provide us with some more specifics in a second.

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:58.470
A few moments ago, I issued the emergency
declaration, the state of emergency for the

00:01:58.470 --> 00:01:59.470
state of Maryland.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.360
What does that allow us to do? A few things.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.599
It allows us to activate the Maryland National
Guard and to support local first responders

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:13.470
especially with the Humvees which are very
helpful to local paramedic units that may

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.301
have trouble getting into those side streets
for many of our neighbors who are in need

00:02:17.301 --> 00:02:19.410
of transport to a hospital.

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.510
For the past two days, MEMA and the National
Guard have been discussing potential needs

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:31.070
and deployment. We did have deployment in
the last emergency for a time anyway.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.110
Assuming the storm follows the predicted path,
as I said, guard units will assist local first

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.110
responders.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.630
The declaration also begins the process to
attain federal assistance depending on the

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.200
amount of snow which I'm told is 28 inches

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.170
in order for Uncle Sam to participate with
us in this battle.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.860
We'll have to hit about 28 inches they say
and we'll hope our federal partners will measure

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.100
in a snowdrift.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.180
Also, this morning, for our state employees
we issued liberal leave. It took effect at

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.180
noon.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:07.320
Given the magnitude of the storm we're expecting,
we want to encourage all citizens if you don't

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.540
have to go out in this, don't go out in this.

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:13.710
This is a great time to stay at home. Get
some quality time with your spouse and your

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.710
kids.

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:20.210
Curl up with a book and stay off the roads
so our crews out there and do the job that

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:26.010
we need to do which is to keep the highways
open for emergency vehicles and do our best

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.569
to get back to normal once this big event
passes.

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:35.440
Also, I want to encourage everybody to check
in on our neighbors. Particularly our senior

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:43.090
citizens who might not have had occasion to
do their usual grocery run before this storm

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.902
came upon them, so reach out to your neighbors.

00:03:44.902 --> 00:03:48.380
There's nothing more important than neighbors
looking out for each other in these events.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.810
Particularly our senior citizens.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.819
We all need to work together. We all need
to help each other.

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:00.220
For those of you counting along and like the
measurables, we have more than 266 thousand

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.430
tons of salt on hand.

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:12.569
We have 2,400 pieces of equipment that are
out there on the road. More than 2,700 personnel.

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:17.970
We also are calling in contractors, private
contractors to help us out as we've done in

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.970
the past.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:25.949
Our transportation team can monitor the storm
from this central operations center where

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:30.750
all of you can see about 150 cameras stationed
all around our state.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.230
In fact, if you were watching closely, you
would have seen President Barack Obama's motorcade

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:42.070
pass around the 495 beltway going to his small
business event that he's doing today and he's

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.070
always welcome.

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.880
Rain, sleet or snow.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:50.490
We're also at full strength at the MTA and
Thurgood Marshall Airport.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:54.080
Our goal is to keep MTA trains and busses
running as long as possible.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.820
We probably kept them running a little too
long last time meaning that we had to deploy

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:06.590
assets to tow busses, so we'll keep an eye
on that and try to improve upon that in this

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.020
event.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:13.661
If secondary streets become impassible, we
may have to divert busses to snow emergency

00:05:13.661 --> 00:05:16.930
routes and that's all part of the evolution
of this event.

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:21.370
During the overnight hours when we do not
keep MTA service, MTA will keep several trains

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:25.000
running that we call the snow trains just
to keep the tracks clear.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.320
At Thurgood Marshall Airport, we have 200
pieces of specialized snow removal equipment.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.250
More than 350 people that are prepared to
work.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.660
And due to the magnitude of this storm, as
you might imagine, some of the airlines have

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:45.900
already discontinued for the time being service
to our airport as well as other airports - Washington

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.830
as well as Philadelphia - so if you do have
travel plans you need to check in with your

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:51.940
airlines before you go to the airport.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:06:00.710
For updates on road conditions, all citizens
can go to www.roads.maryland.gov and citizens

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:08.490
can see many of the cameras that we are monitoring
as we see snow and icing conditions.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:17.720
For MTA transit updates you can call the MTA
transit center at 410-539-5000 or if you prefer

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:25.000
not to talk to a human being, you can log
on to the website at www.mta.maryland.gov.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.949
And for BWI Thurgood Marshall Airport information,
we ask you to contact your airline.

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:46.650
Thanks a lot!
