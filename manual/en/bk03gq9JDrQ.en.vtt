The IDVR-E4 surveillance recorder from cctvcamerapros
includes a free DVR viewer iPhone app that

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.469
lets users log into their recorder and view
live video from an Apple iPhone, iPad or iPod

00:00:12.469 --> 00:00:14.180
touch device.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.830
This video will demonstrate the app using
an iPhone 3GS.

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.730
I start the app by typing on the icon on the
iPhone desktop.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.869
I first need to add my DVR to the device list
by tapping on the plus sign.

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.919
In the name field you could choose any name
for your DVR.

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:36.160
I will use IDVR-E4 since that is the model
recorder that I am using for this demo.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.870
Next I type my DVR IP address in the host
field.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.680
Please note that you must include a colon
and a port number of the DVR on the end of

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:47.590
the IP address.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.809
Last I enter the user name and password and
then tap done.

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:58.320
The app will test a connection to the DVR
and if successful the DVR is added to the

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:59.829
device list.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.290
To view the DVR tap on the device in this
list that you want to access.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.800
The app connects the DVR and the default four
camera quad view is opened.

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.950
I tap on the OSD button to hide the camera
names and date.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:22.360
I then double tap on camera one to see that
camera in single view.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:29.750
I can access the other cameras in single camera
view by swiping my finger across the screen.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:42.470
You can easily browse to and from cameras
by swiping back and forth.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:48.150
I can go back to quad camera view by tapping
on the quad icon.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:54.130
This DVR viewer app is also capable in viewing
in nine and sixteen camera grid screens using

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.570
the eight and sixteen channel model IDVR recorders.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.290
If we wanted to configure and access a second
DVR we tap on the home icon to access the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.950
DVR device list again.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.450
CCTV Camera Pros is very proud to offer this
free iPhone app for our IDRV video surveillance

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.650
recorders.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.849
We believe that this is the best DVR viewer
iPhone app available for viewing CCTV camera

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:22.340
systems.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.780
