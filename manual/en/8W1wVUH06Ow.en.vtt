00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.650
The goal of the treatment of breast cancer
is to get rid of it forever and cure you of

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.849
the disease. There are two parts of this treatment.

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:23.769
The first component is to get rid of the disease
from the breast and nodal areas. This is called

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:26.080
"local control."

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.779
The second component of treatment is designed
to minimize the risk of the disease spreading

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:38.330
with the use of chemotherapy and/or hormonal
therapy. This is called adjunctive systemic

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:45.140
treatment. In this video, we will discuss
each component of treatment. The first decision

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.090
you will have to make after your diagnosis
is what type of breast surgery you want to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:58.010
choose in order to achieve local control.
There are two basic choices. Breast conservation

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.870
or a modified radical mastectomy. Your surgeon
will discuss these options with you.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.619
In breast conserving therapy, the surgeon
removes the breast tumor and some normal tissue

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:16.179
around it. This procedure can be referred
to in many ways, lumpectomy, wide excision,

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:19.789
and partial mastectomy.

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:25.160
During the operation, lymph nodes may also
be removed from under the armpit, referred

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.390
to as an axillary lymph node dissection.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.490
Frequently, blue dye, or a radioactive material
is injected around the tumor to identify the

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.300
sentinel node or nodes. It is becoming increasingly
common to remove just the sentinel node. This

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.190
is because the fewer nodes that are removed
from the axilla, the less chance there is

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.940
of developing arm swelling, or lymphedema.

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.290
If the sentinel node is negative, no other
lymph nodes need to be removed. However, if

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.390
the sentinel node shows cancer cells, it's
typical for the surgeon to remove more nodes

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:08.250
from the axilla, or armpit. After breast conserving
surgery and sentinal lymph node biopsy, radiation

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:15.370
therapy follows at a later date. We will discuss
radiation therapy later in the video.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:21.410
In a modified radical mastectomy, the surgeon
removes the whole breast, and axillary lymph

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:26.860
nodes or sentinel node. For women who have
decided to have breast reconstruction, this

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.030
procedure can be done at the same time.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:36.440
Numerous randomized trials in Europe and America
have shown that patients who have breast-conserving

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.490
therapy have the same chance of being cured,
and the same local control rates as patients

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.900
who have a modified radical mastectomy.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.350
Not all patients are eligible for breast conservation
and radiation. Your doctor will advise you

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.130
what surgery for local control is best for
you.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.380
After surgery, both the tumor and lymph nodes
are sent to the pathologist who examines them,

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:10.460
and performs additional tests on the cancer
tissue. These tests help predict your prognosis,

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:15.200
or your chance of being cured, as well as
help to determine the kind of treatment that

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:19.800
will be most effective for your specific breast
cancer.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.960
These factors are constantly under study.
As research develops, certain factors fall

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.140
in and out of favor.
