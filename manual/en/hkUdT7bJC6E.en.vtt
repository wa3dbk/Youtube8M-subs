00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:09.500
AMA Waterways is this newer river cruise line in the industry.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:14.300
They debuted in 2002. A lot of people know them as Amadeus as well.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:18.400
They’re fantastic. They really are setting a standard now in the industry

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:24.100
for what is a luxury river cruise experience. So

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.300
they have beautiful cabins that are larger,

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.100
they have more Juliet balconies, floor to ceiling windows.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.000
It, it really adds a whole new dimension to your,

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.400
your experience in Russia or Europe or Portugal.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.200
You really kinda get to see these beautiful

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.400
areas of these countries and, and these rivers

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.300
in a whole different atmosphere. You cruise leisurely down them.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:56.400
You see towns that you would never have been able to stop or see.

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:01.800
You see castles up on the river banks all the time. It’s common.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.600
A lot of times onboard they have teaching seminars or 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.000
local historians and local dancers, I mean, things you would pay to go see.

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.500
Most of the excursions are included, you know, you get to have

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:19.300
hour to two hour city or town tours by local guides

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.300
who are absolutely experienced in the culture and history.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.900
I think they have to be trained for something like nine years

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.800
before they can even be a guide. They really try to gear to the area they are,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.900
so they have specific itineraries and they try to make sure they match

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:37.150
the cuisine and the gastronomy

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.300
to the area that you’re in as well as the regional wines.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.100
So the dining for sure is gourmet right down from the breakfast

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.700
to the snacks, to, you know, your dinner.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.300
Not only in the preparation of it but in the presentation.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:58.500
And really cameras are clicking all the time before you start eating.

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.000
You want to take a picture of your food. On the river cruise ships

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:06.200
there is usually a couple different types of cabin categories.

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.600
They’ve got of course their beautiful cabins that kind of you start out with

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.500
and, and some will have a window. The majority, 80 to 82%

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.100
I think have the floor to ceiling windows, many with Juliet balconies.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.700
With their junior suites they accommodate for larger room, 255 square feet.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.700
They’ve got a sofa, two chairs as well as the bedding.

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:29.700
Full bath like a, you know, a larger bathroom area.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:32.600
Many people who do river cruises do two weeks.

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:35.000
They go right from Amsterdam to Budapest.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.900
And when you take into consideration the Euro,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:41.800
what meals, the type of meals, the quality and standard,

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.500
the accommodations, the tours,

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.000
the end of the day it’s always, always worth every penny.
