00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.240
There’s a lot of ways to check the doneness
temperature of your barbecue.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:14.870
Thermo pen instant ready thermometers get
consitantly high marks when tested for reliability

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.010
for meat
thermometers… however they cost over 80

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.920
bucks and there will be many times you wont
have any sort of meat

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.960
thermometer handy… that’s OK as we’ve
discovered what we call our OK HANDY method

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.250
of checking for meat
doneness.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.230
Especially handy for steaks and thicker cuts
of beef.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.390
first off here are some temperature guidelines…

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.379
Rare 125 to 130°F
Medium-rare 130 to 135°F

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:43.480
Medium 135 to 145°F
Medium-well 145 to 150°F

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:48.780
Well-done 150 to 155°F or higher
Here’s how to know when to pull it off the

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.499
grill with the tools you always have with
you…your hands...First off loosen

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:54.469
up your hands make sure it’s fully relaxed
especially around the thumb.

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:55.609
Massage, stretch, and shake one hand loose
so that your thumb and it’s muscles are

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:56.640
fully relaxed.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.690
Touch the round base of your thumb on the
relaxed hand.

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.690
This soft resistance and feel is similar to
the texture of a

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:01.690
very medium rare steak.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:04.360
Now – make the “OK” sign (don’t pinch…
just close your thumb and forefinger together)

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.680
and again touch the base of
your thumb.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.940
This texture is more similar to a medium-rare
steak.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.340
Next, touch your thumb to your middle finger.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.140
This firmer resistance is similar to the texture
of a medium steak.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.520
Finally, touch your thumb to your pinky.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.910
The very firm (some would say tough) texture
at the base of your thumb is

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:24.830
close to a well-done steak.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.870
So you have
Rare… medium…

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.500
Well done…

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.800
And you willl run into problems with this
OKHandy method onpork RIBS so instead…

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.280
reach for a simple toothpick.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.430
Here the pitmaster is checking for doneness
of ribs not

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.750
only to the bones start to stick out when
things are just about done… but a toothpick

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.130
will
poked into the flesh of the ribs will push

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.030
in and pull out very easily when fully cooked.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.990
Again the best way to know is using an instant
read meat thermometer… but you

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.420
always have this method handy…

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.880
