00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.080
Here we are at Han's Deli one of our favorite
fusion restaurants in Korea.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.570
One of the interesting things is that it has
a do it yourself section where you just grab

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.570
your own utensils.

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.770
You can get whatever you want: Parmesan cheese.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.310
For Sam, he needs that for every meal.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:22.310
It's a must.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:25.920
We come to Han's Deli really often.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.060
It is kind of a western / Italian restaurant
with a Korean twist.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.309
You can get dishes like pasta and enchiladas
and pizzas and chicken fingers.

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:41.480
With a Korean flare.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.920
There comes our food.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.580
One for you and you.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:49.500
Love is very beautiful.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:57.340
We like it here.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.120
We take photos and videos sometimes.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.379
Oh, you want to take a picture?

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:06.410
Okay.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.470
Oh good!

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.530
Yes, perfect.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.750
So what do we have here in this little basket?

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.070
This is a mix of different potatoes.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:25.740
There is french fries, potato wedges and these
little things that you used to have in Middle

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:26.740
school.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.740
Mojoes?

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:35.509
Over here we have chicken tender with more
fries and garlic bread for our pasta.

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:37.890
We're going heavy on the carbs today.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.979
We've had a busy day.

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:40.979
Feast!

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.659
This is my last meal in Korea.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.970
My last dinner so we're going for our favorite
fusion.

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:48.400
It's very good.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.400
It's my favorite too.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.130
It's very delicious.

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:00.860
Here is the oven cheese spaghetti fresh out
of the oven - bubbling goodness!

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:05.619
Look at the sauce bubbles coming out from
the cheese.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.149
What are you having?

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:14.760
Just a chicken tender you know?

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:19.750
Being vegetarian.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:22.540
Chicken tender is oh so tender.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:23.670
It's delicious.

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.060
Down here is my cheese oven spaghetti.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.560
I almost get this every single time I come
here.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:37.140
It is my absolute favorite dish in Han's Deli.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:50.830
I highly recommend it by Sam himself.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.190
It's hot!

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.560
Too hot?

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.310
All of this food - this glorious feast that
we're having - came to less than 15 dollars

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.310
total.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.310
It was about 12 or 13 dollars.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.311
Cheers!
