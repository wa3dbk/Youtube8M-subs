00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:51.584
 

00:00:51.584 --> 00:00:58.620
Take this, and divide it among
yourselves: for I say unto

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.270
you, I will not drink of the
fruit of the vine, until the

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.520
kingdom of God shall come.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:40.741
 

00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:45.232
That thou doest, do quickly.

00:01:45.232 --> 00:02:17.670
 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:26.970
This is my body which is given
for you: this do in

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:28.220
remembrance of me.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:55.750
 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.330
This cup is the new testament
in my blood,

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.095
which is shed for you.

00:03:02.095 --> 00:03:16.480
 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.820
Little children, yet a little
while I am with you.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:28.870
A new commandment I give unto
you, That ye love one another;

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.890
as I have loved you, that ye
also love one another.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.780
By this shall all men know that
ye are my disciples, if

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.100
ye have love one to another.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:46.990
 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:53.940
Peace I leave with you, my peace
I give unto you: not as

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.190
the world giveth,
give I unto you.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:57.740
 

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.830
Let not your heart be troubled,

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:04.415
neither let it be afraid.

00:04:04.415 --> 00:04:08.840
 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.260
I came forth from the Father,
and am come into the world:

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:16.320
again, I leave the world,
and go to the Father.

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.910
 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:27.130
Behold, the hour cometh, yea,
and now is, that ye shall be

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:36.908
scattered, every man to his own,
and shall leave me alone:

00:04:36.908 --> 00:04:41.793
and yet I am not alone, because
the Father is with me.

00:04:41.793 --> 00:04:48.310
 

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.950
These things I have spoken unto
you, that in me ye might

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.200
have peace.

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.140
 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:05.130
In the world ye shall have
tribulation: but be of good

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:13.580
cheer; I have overcome
the world.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:06:01.953
