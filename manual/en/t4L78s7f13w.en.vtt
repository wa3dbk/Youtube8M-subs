Hello!

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:09.440
In the last video I showed how you can make a topiary of napkins

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:16.719

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:30.000
Posada this Topiary in a small pot

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.429
This mini Topiary I made a small ball of foam

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:42.150
Guess what I decorated the ball Topiary?

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.950

And stick on the ball Topiary

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.650

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:34.110
Do not make the materials for Topiary

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.220
It should be ready to paste buttons on the ball

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.800
And get a nice small tree

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:46.960

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.480
I papered ball beads on a string

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:19.809
Beads on a string, I bought 3 meters

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:28.719
And covered with this thread ball Topiary

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.150
Winding and I began to hang the ball at the top and a circle

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:39.260
I used a glue gun

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.740
Papered string of beads from small tree trunk

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:54.079

I used 3 meters beads on a string

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.960
This residue!

00:03:56.419 --> 00:04:00.419
This string is useful to me

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:07.100
The beads on the thread I bought 3 meters and a diameter of 3 millimeters

00:04:07.999 --> 00:04:14.579
They have a large size

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:22.309
Then I'll make a tree from the large beads of different color
