Hi everybody, Bohus here for FotodioxPro.com,
and in this video, as part of our introduction

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:17.200
of the B4 Magic Lens Adapter, I'm going to
show you how to back focus your B4 lens. Now

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.720
Now you may not have back focused a lens before.
It's not hard, it's just a little exacting,

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.710
you wanna set aside some time to do it and
do it correctly. These lenses were made to

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.920
mount on all sorts of cameras, so they made
the back-most lens movable, it's adjustable,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.640
and you want to make sure to align it just
right so that the image lands right on the

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.579
sensor and you have sharp focus throughout the
entire zoom range. So I'm going to show you

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:50.019
step by step how to do this. I've got my Fujinon
lens on my B4 Magic adapter, and then my Blackmagic

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.850
Pocket Cinema Camera in the back, and you
may notice I've got an external monitor because

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.059
the screen on the Blackmagic Pocket Cinema
Camera sucks on toast, as you know. So the

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.559
Aputure VS-3 is a little better display, makes
it a little easier to figure out focus, but

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.660
you can use any external display or you can
just live with the one that's in there, but

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.520
we have this luxury so let's use it. First
thing you do is visit this link right here

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.470
and print out the back focus chart. Just print
it out on a regular black and white printer

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.910
and then set it up about 70 feet away from
where you and your camera are. And you may

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.700
even want to throw a little light on the chart
itself to make life easier. So what we're

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.920
going to do is start from all the way back
here, set your lens to F/5.6 because our

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:38.300
adapter is optimized for F/5.6, and then what
you do is just zoom all the way in.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.940
Okay, so while you're zoomed in all the way, loosen
the little thumb screw and start manipulating

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.100
the back glass. And you want to get it to
look nice and sharp in your monitor.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:57.800
Now, you're going to notice there's a range in which it looks sharp. So try to find where

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.960
it's sharp, take your hands off and then zoom
out.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.600
 Now, it's very likely it's going to go

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.390
soft as you zoom out, and that means you gotta
wiggle it a little more, make a couple more

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.980
adjustments, try to get it back in focus.
Zoom all the way back in, is it still in focus?

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.250
Good, you're done. If not, a little more adjusting.
You're kind of zeroing in on what is the perfect

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.740
point for you to set your back glass so that
you're equally in focus whether you're zoomed

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:30.420
all the way in or all the way out. And don't
be surprised is this takes like five or six tries.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.400
It's the kind of thing that plagues
all of us who have used B4 lenses in the past.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.310
But you've got it, all you do is tighten that
thumb screw, and that means that this lens

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.620
is now set up for this camera and no matter
where you are along your zoom range, you're

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.940
going to be in sharp focus. Remember to keep
your lens' iris at an F/5.6 on up, because

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:58.820
focus is optimized at F/5.6 on B4 lenses,
and our adapter is also optimized for F/5.6 on up.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.480
