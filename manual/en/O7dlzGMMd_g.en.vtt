00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:09.340
[Dramatic music]

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:17.220
We were expecting 2013 to be an epic fire
season due drought, lack of precipitation

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:19.099
and volatile fuel conditions.

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:25.119
But, fire danger decreased due to some late
spring storms and a strong summer monsoon

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:26.890
in the Southwest.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.140
Going into fire season 2013, with the conditions
that we had been seeing over the previous

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.019
couple of years and the very rapid drying
conditions we saw at the beginning of the

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:38.750
year in the West.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.440
We expected to see a fairly significant fire
season, particularly across the West Coast

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.859
states.

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:48.940
Going up into December, we had pretty good
precipitation across the West.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:51.730
Good snowfall across the Sierras and in the
interior mountains.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.800
But something happened in January, where everything
just kind of shut off.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.540
Uh, we were seeing huge deficits that, uh, as
we headed into the spring months, uh, were

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.890
going to be very critical to the kind of fire
season that we were going to get.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.600
So areas like Colorado and Wyoming, where
they had a pretty good snowpack, it was gone

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:16.360
pretty quickly and so they were starting out
in a very warm and dry condition earlier in the spring.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.829
That’s when we started seeing fires developing
in the Front Range in Colorado.

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:25.950
The Black Forest Fire started on June 11, in
Black Forest, Colorado.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.740
It burned 14,280 acres, destroyed over 500
homes and resulted in two civilian fatalities.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.549
This was the most destructive wildfire in
Colorado’s history.

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.020
Moving into the summer months, June, July
and August, which is the core of the western

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:48.850
fire season, we were already starting with
some very dry conditions across most of the West.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.370
Uh, the global circulation pattern was fairly
neutral so we didn’t have a clear signal

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.759
of what kind of weather patterns we were going
to see throughout the summer.

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.359
What we ended up seeing, though, was a very
defined split between very warm and dry conditions

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.049
in the West and very cool and wet conditions
in the East.

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:12.970
As we continued to move into the summer, we
had some fires developing across the Southwest

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.070
that, uh, while they weren’t extremely large
fires, they were difficult fires to deal with,

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.700
because of the extremely dry fuel conditions
there.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:27.100
Meanwhile, up in Alaska, the same very warm
and dry conditions that were affecting, uh,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:31.720
the Western United States were also affecting,
uh, Alaska in very unusual ways.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:37.690
They were seeing, uh, near record temperatures
across a large portion of the of the state.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:43.440
That extended their fire season from its usual
July period all the way into August.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.451
Uh, but generally we didn’t have a lot of
widespread fire activity in June and July.

00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:54.950
On June 30, 19 firefighters were killed on
the Yarnell Hill Fire.

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:59.920
They were members of the Prescott Fire Department’s
Granite Mountain Hotshots.

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:07.760
This resulted in the highest wildland firefighter
death toll, since 1933.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:15.520
[Silence]

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.950
As we got into August, we were starting to
see a lot of fire across the northwestern

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:27.200
United States, that while they weren’t tremendously
big fires as we’d seen in previous years,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.430
uh, they were significant in that in some
cases they were threatening, um, communities,

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:39.450
um, producing a lot of smoke and and just
generally creating a significant fire problem

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.480
over a period of time.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.950
As we got into mid to late September, significant
amounts of rainfall had occurred across the

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:49.290
West and were quickly putting fire season
to an end.

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.690
There were some very dry conditions across
California that we had been monitoring all

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:58.810
year, but they never had any significant weather
events that would drive a lot of fire until

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.450
we got into September.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:06.960
The extremely dry conditions down around southern
parts of California led to the Rim Fire, uh,

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.750
which was the largest fire of the season.

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:14.990
The Rim Fire started August 17th, near Yosemite
National Park.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:22.610
This wildfire, California’s third largest,
burned almost 260,000 acres and was contained

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.830
on October 24th.

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.930
The end of the season we only had just over
40,000 fires across the US, which is about

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.520
two-thirds of our normal and burned just over
4 million acres, which is just a little bit

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:41.009
more than half of what we normally see in
a typical fire season.

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:44.750
A lot of this was largely due to the fact
that some of the interior fires, the Great

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.509
Basin fires, they’re often times very large
acre fires, didn’t materialize this year

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:51.949
for a couple of reasons.

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.970
The extended drought conditions across the
interior West, while producing very extreme

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.879
fire conditions, we did not have the fuel
loadings that typically carries a lot of fire there.

00:05:02.879 --> 00:05:08.810
Another factor was during the core of the
fire season, June, July and part of uh early

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:14.380
August, we didn’t have a lot of lightning
events in areas where we typically see a lot

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:15.969
of lightning starts.

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:20.570
We also didn’t see a lot of acreage and
fires in the Southeast, where we often get

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.850
a lot of fires, uh, but not a significant
amount of acres.

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:31.680
Although 2013 was a below average year in
terms of fires and acres burned, it is important

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:38.319
to note as we move into the 2014 season, that
a slow season can be just as hazardous as

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.620
a busy one.
