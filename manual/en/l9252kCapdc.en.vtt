00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:05.540
After you allow the first coat of polish to
dry, you're going to want to apply a second

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:11.469
coat. The first coat is just to cover up the
natural nail. The second coat is to actually

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:17.320
bring the true color and the richness of the
color out. Going to start with your same nail.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.300
If you get too much polish on the brush, make
sure you wipe it off. You don't want any dripping

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.679
down. The color that we're using on Joyce
today is 'I'm Not Really a Waitress Red" from

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:39.050
OPI. That is their most popular color. They
have so many, that sometimes it's hard to

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.980
choose from. But this color compliments her
skin tone.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.850
And again, you can go underneath the free
edge, just to give it a little extra protection.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.510
Try not to get it on the skin or the cuticle.
If you do, you can always go back and remove

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:17.070
it. But you want to make sure that you have
a nice second coat.

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:29.020
You can dry the polish under a light, or a
fan.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:46.020
The heat from the lamp or the coolness from
the fan will allow the lacquer to dry.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.229
Once you get done with the second hand, the
very last nail that you do. You're going to

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:57.289
again want to go around, just re-check every
nail. Make sure that you don't get any on

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:03.680
the skin. If you have, just re-dip your brush
in acetone. You don't want to get too much

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:10.570
on the brush, but you want to get just enough
to clean up the nail, right around the nail.

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.920
And that is how you apply a second coat of
polish to fingernails.
