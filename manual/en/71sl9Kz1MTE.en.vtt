00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:02.690
Do fitness models make good money?

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:05.210
Do most fashion models make good money?

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.900
Of course not.

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.580
There are a lot of wanna-be models, and very
few who hit it big.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:12.650
The same thing is true of fashion models.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.730
I’ve heard some of them make millions of
dollars in deals in endorsements.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:21.170
And millions of would be fashion models are
sales people for dietary supplements and sports

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.100
drinks hoping to earn enough to pay for their
own supplements and diet.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.690
There are fashion models who hit it big.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.200
Some of them are appealing because they have
a great back-story, with pictures of a 300

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.640
pound guy dropping to a 180 pound stud.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.360
Most are in the adds because they are both
fit and attractive.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.649
That’s the same thing.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.540
No, it isn’t.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.750
Most people won’t buy something from a fit
ugly dude unless it is a guy desperate to

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:48.820
look that buff.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.610
Some fashion models make good money.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:57.630
Most would make more money as fitness instructors,
bouncers, movers or even actors in the background.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.370
The smartest ones run a gym and make money
on memberships, while they are their own walking

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.890
billboards for the gym.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.399
Or advertise various fitness regimes.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:10.810
They might advertise a fitness program, but
the person who makes the most money from it

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.090
is the person who has the copyright on it.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.829
The guy who runs Zumba fitness makes more
than the instructors who are sweating to salsa.

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:20.369
You don’t think much of modeling in general.

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:25.329
How many people waste money on beauty contest
entry fees and lose thousands trying to win

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:29.539
one contest to justify their effort and self
esteem?

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:31.099
Fitness contests are similar.

00:01:31.099 --> 00:01:33.630
Except for the health benefits.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.789
You get that from the workout.

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:39.249
You can ruin your health taking drugs to try
to win the competition.

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:43.990
They’re already spending a lot of money
on supplements, a little more to win isn’t

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:44.990
unreasonable.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.029
How many guys getting buff to attract the
girls would take steroids if they knew they

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:51.819
risk being unable to act on the attraction?

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:56.380
And most of the guys in the gym are broke,
and they take any job to make money.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:57.999
Even fitness modeling.

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:01.799
I’ll put that down to desperation and pride.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.590
But they’d make more money throwing boxes
at FedEx.
