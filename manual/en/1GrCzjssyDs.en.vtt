00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.830
I didn't believe him at first. I mean, who
would?

00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.570
No one wants to believe their father is capable
of killing someone â€“ let alone your

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:18.760
best friend.
My best friend is David. You may have seen

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.860
him around. You'd know if you did. He's popular,
good at everything he does, and girls think

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:31.900
he's hot. Seriously. The guy never fails.
It's sort of sickening. Sheep watching? He's

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.010
the best.
Need someone to kill a wild animal with their

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:43.450
bare hands? David's your guy.
Harp player? Think Jimi Hendrix with vertical

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.160
strings.
Got a giant you need to kill? Not a problem.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.879
Yeah, David's good. He's really good.
So you'd think he'd be a real jerk or somethingâ€¦but

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:59.930
he's not. David's cool. He's the kind of friend
that seems more like a brother, you know?

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:11.040
Yeah â€“ he's my best friend.
My name is Jonathan. My dad is the King. King

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:21.130
Saul. Now, hate me because I'm the prince.
It isn't all it's cracked up to be.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:29.189
For one thing, my dad pays people to follow
me around. ALL THE TIME.

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:32.829
And it's hard to tell who your real friends
are. Yeah, there are always a lot of people

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:36.119
around, and they say they want to be my friend
 - but really, most of them want something.

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:45.980
It's hard to find real friends. I mean, no
one really knows me. No one except David anyway.

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:53.990
Maybe that's why it was so hard to believe
what David was saying.

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:05.729
It all started when Samuel the priest said
that God has chosen someone else to be king.

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.700
Then Samuel anoints David, saying he'll be
the next king of Israelâ€¦.then David

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.510
goes and kills Goliathâ€¦.so then my dad
makes him this military leader and he wins

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:22.590
every battleâ€¦so then everyone loves
David and says he should be king instead of

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.870
me. So yeah, my dad's pretty bent out of shape
about this.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.450
So I talked to my dad. I pointed out that
David hasn't actually done anything wrong.

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:44.410
And he seemed to get it. He told me he was
over it and things were cool â€“ that

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:52.129
there was nothing wring between him and David.
Look, I know what it looks like. I get it.

00:02:52.129 --> 00:03:02.931
But trust me, I would never hurt David. I
mean, we're friends. We're loyal, and that

00:03:02.931 --> 00:03:05.040
means something. There's no way I could let
anything bad happen to him.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.800
I told David he was getting worked up for
nothing. My dad always tells me everything,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:17.280
and he'd never mentioned that he wanted to
axe my friend.

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.800
David said my dad probably wouldn't tell me
a plan like thatâ€¦which made sense. Then

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:32.129
he told me dad had been acting crazy for awhile,
throwing spears at him for no reason.

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:41.019
I saw then that David was serious, and he
finally had my attention. I asked David how

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.390
I could help.
David reminded me that dad was throwing a

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.540
big party the next day. David said he wasn't
going to show up. He told me to check out

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.959
my dad's reaction. If it was no big deal,
then that would mean the coast was clear.

00:03:55.959 --> 00:04:01.040
But if dad got mad, then we would know there
were serious problems. David would hide out,

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:02.209
and once I knew either way, I would send a
signal to him.

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.650
The party started as planned. At first, my
dad didn't seem bothered that David wasn't

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:16.690
there. But after awhile, he asked me about
it. I told him David had to go to some family

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:28.810
thing and wasn't coming.
And dad lost it. He started screaming and

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:34.550
ordered me to go and get David so that he
could kill him.

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:42.940
I was crushed. I couldn't believe itâ€¦I
mean, this was my dad. He even threw his spear

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:52.250
at me. He tried to kill me. His own son. Suddenly
I realized -David had been right all along.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:05:07.710
I told David to go awayâ€¦to go somewhereâ€¦anywhereâ€¦
where my dad wouldn't find him. I knew I might

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:19.570
not see David again. But as we said goodbye,
David reminded me that real friends are loyal

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:22.220
to each other, no matter what and nothing
will change that.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:36.300
I won't lie. It was hard. It cost me a lot.
I lost my best friend. My dad has gone crazy.

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.650
I probably won't ever be king now. I might
even lose my life. But you know what? I'd

00:05:41.650 --> 00:06:04.530
do it again. I mean, David and
I â€“ we're friends. We're loyal. And

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:13.580
that means something.
Yeah, no doubt. I'd do it again.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:20.000
I'm Jonathan. And that's my story.
