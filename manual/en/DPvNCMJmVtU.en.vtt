Kate Stevenson: Currently, elementary level math tests, 
we take the student's entire body of knowledge in math

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.000
and we condense in into one exam, 
and we place them according to that one exam. 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.500
What Early Start affords the students is an opportunity 
to contest that placement in an authentic way.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.000
In a way that demonstrates
their knowledge through their work.

Kate Stevenson: We found that Early Start is the right thing
to do. Its the right thing to do for two reasons.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.000
One is because it works. Students do well.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
They pass up one level when they 
take the full three unit class 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
or if they take the one unit class, 
they are better prepared for their fall classes. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
But the other reason why I view it as the right thing to do 
is because it's the fair thing to do.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.860
Brandon Toigo: I came in here. I had to do the matriculation
test and I didn't do so well on the matriculation

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:58.000
so they offered me the Early Start.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.500
And I decided, like, I'm gonna do that just to learn math, 
refresh your memory about it.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.700
And at first I was a little skeptical. 
I was like I don't want to do this.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.000
It's gonna waste my summer just doing math but honestly 
it really did help me a lot. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.300
I definitely would have not been here today, 
doing what I can do in math if I did not take that. 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.789
So it's a very good process
and I'm definitely glad I took it.

00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:28.310
Amrita Bedi: In [Math] 92 I took an online course so
it was basically at just home and at the very end,

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.000
you have to come to CSUN and take your final test. 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So its definitely helpful taking it because it helps you
 get on track or like even go further 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
and achieve your goals faster 
because you can take other classes.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.859
Like if I hadn't taken that I wouldn't be in chem right now.

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:47.500
I'm just thankful to the Early Start because if I didn't take this, 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.000
I'd still be like falling behind in my classes because 
I would have to take classes I don't need.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Kate Stevenson: California State University 
has two semesters of remediation

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
for students who score below a certain level 
on the elementary level math test. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
It's a 34 at California State University, Northridge.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
So a student can come in requiring either one or two semesters 
of developmental math work. 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.000
So in the summer, we can get students through either one or two semesters depending on which flavor of Early Start they take.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.200
Even students who just did the required progress

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.230
out preformed the other students in their freshman classes.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.700
Giselle Reyes: The Cal State Northridge program helped me to improve those small mistakes that were core in math. 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.000
Because they are really basic knowledge that you 
need to know to build on math 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000
and being able to improve that helped
me realize such silly little mistakes that I made in the past

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
 but are now really important
to me moving on in my education. 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And now I'm in statistics and I have a GPA of 4.0.
