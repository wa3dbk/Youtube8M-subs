00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.430
&gt;&gt; IN THE UNITED
STATES AROUND 5,000

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.370
INFANTS UNDER THE AGE
OF 1 ARE INJURED IN AUTO

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.130
CRASHES EVERY YEAR,
SOME FATALLY.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.570
THAT'S THE BAD NEWS.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.230
NOW HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS:

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.370
RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT A
PROPERLY INSTALLED REAR-FACING

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.800
CAR SEAT CAN DRAMATICALLY
REDUCE THE RISK OF SERIOUS

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.000
INJURY FOR YOUR
BABY IN A CRASH.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
MICHAEL NANCE IS A DOCTOR
AT THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.530 position:56%
OF PHILADELPHIA WHO IS AN
EXPERT AT TREATING INJURED CHILDREN.

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.130
&gt;&gt; BECAUSE INFANTS' HEADS
ARE THE HEAVIEST PART

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.300
OF THEIR BODY, YOUNG BABIES
ARE NOT DEVELOPMENTALLY ABLE

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.130
OR STRONG ENOUGH TO WITHSTAND
THE SHOCK OF A CRASH WHEN

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.000
THEY ARE FORWARD-FACING.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.370
IN A HEAD-ON COLLISION,
THE REAR-FACING SEAT WILL

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.000
SUPPORT YOUR CHILD'S
HEAD, PROTECTING THE BRAIN,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.430
NECK AND SPINE AND HELP
TO SPREAD THE CRASH FORCES

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.900
ACROSS THE BACK.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.700
&gt;&gt; INFANTS AND CHILDREN
SHOULD ALWAYS BE SECURED

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.670 position:56%
IN THE BACK SEAT, ESPECIALLY
IF YOUR VEHICLE HAS FRONTAL AIRBAGS.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.900
THESE CAN INJURE
OR KILL A CHILD.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.530
THE BEST SEATING POSITION IS
ALWAYS THE ONE IN WHICH YOUR

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:16.330
SAFETY SEAT CAN GET
THE TIGHTEST FIT.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.670
IF POSSIBLE, USE THE CENTER
POSITION IN THE BACK SEAT.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.170
DURING THE FIRST YEAR, THERE
ARE THREE CAR SEAT CHOICES

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.830
TO SECURE BABIES;
REAR-FACING INFANT-ONLY

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:31.200
SEATS, INVERTIBLE CAR SEATS
AND IN CASES OF LOW-BIRTH

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.630
WEIGHT OR PREMATURE
INFANTS, A CAR BED.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.500
REAR-FACING INFANT-ONLY
SEATS LIKE THESE ARE MADE

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.230
FOR SMALLER INFANTS
AND SHOULD NEVER BE USED

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.870
IN THE FORWARD-FACING POSITION.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.230
YOU CAN NOW FIND INFANT
CARRIERS WITH A HIGHER

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.800
WEIGHT HARNESS
JUST LIKE THIS ONE.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.500
SOME EVEN HOLD
CHILDREN UP TO 35 POUNDS.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.330
SOME FAMILIES CHOOSE
CONVERTIBLE SEATS LIKE THESE

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.930
TO USE REAR-FACING AND THEN
TURN THE SEAT FORWARD-FACING

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.570
ONCE THE CHILD REACHES
THE MAXIMUM HEIGHT OR WEIGHT

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.370
FOR THE CHILD SEAT.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:04.870
SAFETY EXPERTS RECOMMEND
THAT INFANTS AND TODDLERS

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.530
STAY REAR-FACING UNTIL THEY
ARE 2 YEARS OLD OR UNTIL

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.270
THEY REACH THE HIGHEST
WEIGHT OR HEIGHT ALLOWED

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.800
BY THE MANUFACTURER
OF THE CHILD SAFETY SEAT.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.030
ALWAYS CHECK YOUR CAR SEAT
MANUAL FOR MAXIMUM WEIGHT

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.600
AND HEIGHT GUIDELINES.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.400
AT TIMES, CAR SEATS CAN BE
TRICKY TO INSTALL AND SIMPLE

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:35.730
MISTAKES CAN HAVE FATAL
CONSEQUENCES FOR KIDS.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.570
BE SURE TO ALWAYS CHECK
YOUR VEHICLE'S OWNER'S MANUAL

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:41.900
AND YOUR CAR SEAT INSTRUCTIONS
FOR SPECIFIC INFORMATION,

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.700
BUT HERE ARE SOME
GENERAL RULES TO FOLLOW:

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.330
FOR A GOOD, SNUG FIT, BE
SURE YOUR CHILD IS WEARING

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.300
LIGHT CLOTHING WHEN
YOU ADJUST THE HARNESS.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.570
WHEN TIGHTENED, THE HARNESS
SHOULD LIE IN A STRAIGHT

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.000
LINE WITH NO SLACK.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.030
THE HARNESS SHOULD BE
ADJUSTED EACH TIME YOU PLACE

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:00.630
YOUR BABY IN THE SEAT TO
MAKE SURE THE HARNESS IS TIGHT.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.100
HARNESS STRAPS SHOULD BE
THREADED THROUGH SLOTS AT

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:04.970
OR BELOW YOUR BABY'S SHOULDERS.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.300
IF YOU CAN PINCH A FOLD IN
THE HARNESS AT THE BABY'S

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.630
SHOULDERS, YOUR
STRAPS SHOULD BE TIGHTER.

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.330
LASTLY, A HARNESS RETAINER
CLIP KEEPS THE STRAPS OVER

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.270
THE BABY'S SHOULDERS.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.000
BUCKLE THE HARNESS
AND TIGHTEN THE STRAPS.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
POSITION THE CLIP
AT ARMPIT LEVEL.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.570
ONCE THE SEAT IS IN THE CAR,
IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.030
THE SEAT IS AT
THE CORRECT ANGLE.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.330
YOU DON'T WANT THE SEAT TO
BE TOO UPRIGHT OR TOO FLAT.

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:32.900
SOME SEATS HAVE ANGLE
INDICATORS TO SHOW YOU WHEN

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.500
THE SEAT IS
RECLINED CORRECTLY.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.770
MANY INFANT SEATS HAVE AN
ADJUSTABLE BASE TO HELP SET

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:42.070
THE ANGLE.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.900
IF YOUR SEAT DOESN'T
HAVE THIS FEATURE,

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.500
YOU MAY NEED TO
USE A ROLLED TOWEL,

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.330
BABY BLANKET OR A SWIMMING
POOL NOODLE UNDER THE FOOT

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.400
OF THE SAFETY SEAT TO
HELP SET THE ANGLE.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.770
NEXT, PULL THE
SEAT BELT OUT.

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:58.470
THEN, CAREFULLY THREAD IT
THROUGH THE REAR-FACING BELT

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.830
PATH OF YOUR
CHILD'S SAFETY SEAT.

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:04.270
CHECK YOUR CAR SEAT MANUAL
TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE USING THE

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.100
CORRECT BELT PATH FOR THE
REAR-FACING POSITION AND

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.430
CHECK YOUR CAR OWNER'S
MANUAL TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.530
LOCKED THE BELT CORRECTLY.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.670
SOME VEHICLES MANUFACTURED
BEFORE 1997 MAY REQUIRE

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.330
THE USE OF A LOCKING CLIP
TO SECURE THE SEAT BELT.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.430
YOUR VEHICLE OWNER'S MANUAL
WILL TELL YOU IF YOU NEED ONE.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.070
READ BOTH THE VEHICLE
OWNER'S MANUAL AND YOUR

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.600
CHILD'S SEAT MANUAL
TO LEARN HOW TO INSTALL

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.100
THE CLIP PROPERLY.

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.170
A LOOSELY INSTALLED SEAT
IS ONE OF THE MOST COMMON

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:39.330
AND DANGEROUS MISTAKES
PARENTS MAKE.

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.470
TO ENSURE A TIGHT FIT, USE
YOUR UPPER BODY WEIGHT TO

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.770
PRESS DOWN ON THE SEAT,
BUCKLE AND TIGHTEN AND LOCK

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.270
THE SEAT BELT.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.270
NOW, HOLD THE SAFETY SEAT
AT THE BELT PATH AND PULL IT

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.700
FIRMLY SIDE TO SIDE
AND TOWARD THE FRONT

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:55.170
VEHICLE SEAT.

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:58.200
A PROPERLY INSTALLED CHILD
SAFETY SEAT WILL NOT MOVE

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.630
MORE THAN AN INCH
IN ANY DIRECTION.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.670
AS YOU PUT YOUR
CHILD IN THE CAR SEAT,

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:04.500
GET IN THE HABIT OF
CHECKING BOTH THE SEAT

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:06.900
AND THE HARNESS
FOR A PROPER FIT.

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.830
AS BABIES GROW AND CLOTHES
CHANGE WITH THE SEASON,

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.870
IT IS IMPORTANT TO ADJUST
YOUR HARNESS EVERY TIME YOU

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.370
BUCKLE YOUR BABY.

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.170
AFTER YOU ARE SURE YOUR
CAR SEAT IS TIGHT IN THE CAR

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.570
AND BABY IS SAFELY
BUCKLED INTO THE HARNESS,

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.430
YOU'RE GOOD TO GO.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.100
CARS MADE SINCE 2002 HAVE
AN ATTACHMENT SYSTEM CALLED

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:27.830
LATCH WHICH MAKES IT
POSSIBLE TO INSTALL SAFETY

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:31.000
SEATS WITHOUT
USING THE SEAT BELT.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.900
FOR MORE GOOD
ADVICE ON KIDS AND CARS,

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:36.430
LOOK FOR A CERTIFIED CAR
SEAT TECHNICIAN IN YOUR AREA.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.070
YOU MAY FIND A FREE CHILD
SAFETY SEAT CHECKPOINT

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:42.270
OR CAR SEAT CHECK
AT A LOCAL HOSPITAL,

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:46.100
POLICE OR FIRE DEPARTMENT OR
STATE HIGHWAY SAFETY OFFICE.

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:49.100
AND REMEMBER,
CRASHES HAPPEN,

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:54.600
BUT WITH PROPER PRECAUTIONS,
SERIOUS INJURIES DON'T HAVE TO.
