00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:04.880
The book is

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.840
about two characters named Sydney and
Ridge and they

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.700
end up in a situation where they write
music together. Ridge is having writer's

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:13.170
block

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.490
for some songs he writes for his band
and Sydney discovers that she loves

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.550
to write lyrics.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.859
They can't really be honest with their
feelings, so they start to use their

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:24.220
lyrics as their way to communicate to each
other.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:31.220
When I first wrote SLAMMED, I included
some lyrics from my favorite band

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:36.450
and I didn't think anyone would really pay
attention to them.  But I got a lot of

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.940
really positive feedback from readers
who

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.480
would go and look up the music, 
so when I got the idea for Maybe Someday

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.780
I wanted to actually take it a step
further and

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.780
have the characters actually create the
lyrics instead of using

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.149
something from an
established artist already.

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.460
That's when I contacted Griffin and

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:00.730
asked if he'd be interested in helping
me with that and luckily

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.510
he was really excited about it.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.920
It's really exciting first of all to

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.590
think that songs that I was gonna
write

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.460
could be put together with the story and all 
 combined to give

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:20.000
someone who's reading it a better
experience.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.100
I think my favorite part about it is

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.130
just kind of the whole concept of how
the music is gonna fit into this and it's

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.060
almost like a

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.130
like a parallel the whole time or like a

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.340
giant analogy for the
characters because they're using these

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.049
songs

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.720
to communicate when they're writing them together, so the fact that they

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.619
can communicate and express emotions that they couldn't

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.229
face to face

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.350
through songs, I guess is probably my
favorite part about the whole concept.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.689
And then being able to be a part of that and

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:59.950
help those emotions get through

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:06.759
was the coolest thing for me.

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:10.580
So the lyrics have a lot of meaning, the
songs all have a lot of meaning to the

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:12.550
book and to their situation.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.989
And it's kind of an emotional book

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.510
but I always like happy ever afters so don't worry about that.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:26.510
 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.840
Maybe Someday the album

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.599
is coming out at the same time as the book,
and will be available on iTunes and Amazon.

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.219
The way that's going to work in the
book, if you get the ebook version,

00:02:46.219 --> 00:02:50.590
there will be links that you click and it will take you to
the song

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.790
That will be placed within the specific chapters
that coincide with it.

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.030
And in the paperback version there will be a
QR code

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.569
in the same spot that the link would be, and you just scan it with your phone

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.379
and it'll take you to the song page.

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:09.379
The book and the soundtrack both release on March
18

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:12.450
and the book will be available in
paperback and

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.189
most retail stores. You'll be able to find
it at Target and Barnes and Noble,

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.469
places like that. The ebook will be on all the standard sites like

00:03:20.469 --> 00:03:24.269
Amazon, iTunes, Kobo and Barnes &amp; Noble.

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:31.200
So we're both really excited about it. Don't forget. Write that date down. March 18th.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:45.400
