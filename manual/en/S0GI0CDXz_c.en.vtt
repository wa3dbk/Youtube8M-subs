00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.929
the most common engine related causes
for hard starting

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.120
when the engine is hot are vacuum leaks
or

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.330
improper connections faulty ignition
wires

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.420
fouled spark plugs a sticky EGR valve

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:19.619
clogged or dirty fuel filters a weak
battery or starter

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:23.400
engine overheating or improper ignition
timing

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.860
each of these areas should be thoroughly
checked and fixed if found not to be in

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:29.160
proper working order

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.440
if hard starting still occurs we
should now examine the carburetor itself

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.930
many of the same things that will cause
hard starting when cold

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.820
will also cause hard starting when hot
one of the main causes is

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.500
fuel percolation or boiling in the fuel
bowls if your air cleaner has a heat

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.610
riser valve make sure that its opening

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.910
adding an insulator flange gasket will
help limit heat transfer between the

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.129
engine and the carburetor

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.030
engine overheating can create a vapor
lock vapor lock is the interruption of

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.850
fuel delivery to the carburetor

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.969
caused by vaporization of fuel in the
fuel line or fuel pump

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.550
from extreme heat minor cases of vapor
lock

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.399
can be cured by insulating or routing
fuel lines away from exhaust manifolds

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.700
or

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.740
other hot engine parts replacing the weak
or defective fuel pump can sometimes

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:18.720
solve the problem

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.940
for chronic vapor lock symptoms
installing an electric fuel pump in

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.509
place at the mechanical unit is often
the only way to cure the problem

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.280
in addition check for a binding or
sticking choke

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.350
the choke should be fully closed when the
engine is cold

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.899
and not running and fully open after
it's warmed up

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:40.780
verify the choke is connected to a full
12 volts switched

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.880
ignition source engine or carburetor
flooding

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.740
as well as a lack of fuel can cause hard
starting verify the float levels are set

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:49.509
correctly

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.290
that fuel pressure is correct and that
the needle and seats are not sticking

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:58.250
check any fuel filters to make sure
they're not clogged or dirty

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.789
and lastly check the accelerator pump
system

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:05.119
a full stream of fuel should emit from
the pump nozzle

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.759
for more information on how to tune the
accelerator pump system

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.190
see the advanced tuning section at this
video and refer to the accelerator pump

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.910
