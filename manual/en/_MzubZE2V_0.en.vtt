Deleting your Emails from your Ipod, Ipad
or Iphone

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:05.590
In this video I am going to show you how you
can delete emails from your Ipod, Ipad or

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:11.660
Iphone. I've also myself been trying to
work out how to do this because I couldn't

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:17.289
delete emails from my Ipod.
Here is how it works at the moment on IOS

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.400
with the new update.
Take a look at the mail app on your ipod or

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.400
on your IOS devices. If you try and swipe
to delete an email, it comes up archive and

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:36.800
if you open your email and if it says archive
when you swipe to the right, you need to change

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.719
the settings for you to be able to delete
your email.

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:48.719
So in order to delete an email, simply go
down to settings and scroll down to Mail,

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.679
contacts, calendar.
My particular email account is a gmail account

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:08.679
so I wanna click gmail and then where it says
archive messages, clik off and now it will

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.790
change that on the mail application. If you
want to delete the actual account from your

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.600
Ipod, Ipad or Iphone, just click the delete
button.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.600
Go back to the mail application. If you swipe,
you will get a delete button, rather than

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:35.910
an archive button. Now this will delete emails
from your account like how it supposed to

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:42.910
work. I hope you find this video useful and
this is how you delete emails on your Ipod.

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.650
This took me a while to work out and now I'm
glad I have it sorted out because I don't

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.280
have to go to my computer to delete my emails
anymore.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.880
