00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:06.529
Today on this 2011 Toyota Sienna we are going
to show you a Thule Crossroad roof rack system.

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:11.510
The Thule Crossroad system is designed to
attach to vehicles with factory raised side

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:12.510
rails.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.180
It utilizes a steel band that is coated in
rubber that wraps around the side rails.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.890
Once you have the roof rack system assembled,
lay the first crossbar over the side rails.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.130
Once we have our crossbar in position, we
will make sure that the bar is overhanging

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.130
on either side evenly.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.300
Once we have made sure that the overhang is
even on both sides, we can go ahead and begin

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.480
tightening down our crossbar system.

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.079
Take the steel band, pull it underneath the
side rail and push it in to the crossroad

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.079
foot.

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.850
Take the cap with the built in Allen key and
begin to tighten the clamp.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.250
We will move back and forth from driver side
to passenger side to make sure we tighten

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.870
down the system evenly.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.379
As we tighten the Allen head bolt, not only
does it pull the steel band tight around the

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.670
side rails but it also locks the Crossroad
feet on to the crossbars.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.460
1:02
Once we have both sides of our crossbar tightened

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:10.409
down, we will go ahead and repeat the same
process for the second crossbar.

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.920
Once we have tightened down both crossbars,
our installation is complete.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.490
The maximum crossbar spread allowable for
this roof rack system is 38 inches from the

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.710
center of the front crossbar to the center
of the rear crossbar.

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.549
You can use this information when shopping
for rood mounted accessories to make sure

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.530
you find one that is compatible.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:32.670
Today we used 58 inch long crossbars.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.000
If you need longer bars, it is recommended
that you do not exceed the width of the vehicle

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
at the mirrors.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.609
The width of our 2011 Sienna is 89 inches
from mirror to mirror.

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:46.390
So we want to make sure that if we need bigger
bars, we do not exceed that measurement.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.369
With the Thule Crossroad feet, you can also
add lock cores to secure the feet and crossbars

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.700
to your vehicle.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.840
That does it for the Thule Crossroad roof
rack system on our 2011 Toyota Sienna.
