Hey, it's Mike from swisco.com

00:00:04.946 --> 00:00:07.674
and today I'm going to show you how 
 to install a sliding door track cover.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.645
In this exercise I'm going to show you how to 
 install both a large and small track cover

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:16.583
and I'll be using the Swisco 80-102 and 80-100 track covers as an example

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:19.786
which are both available online at swisco.com.

00:00:20.521 --> 00:00:22.923
for this exercise you will need a Philips head screwdriver

00:00:22.923 --> 00:00:24.126
a drill

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:26.401
a 7/64" drill bit

00:00:27.027 --> 00:00:27.694
a hammer

00:00:27.694 --> 00:00:29.048
wood block

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:30.209
file

00:00:30.209 --> 00:00:31.649
hacksaw

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:33.066
and safety glasses.

00:00:33.831 --> 00:00:37.404
First, take your tape measure and measure the length of your sliding door track

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:41.587
and then go ahead and mark down that length.

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:47.381
Secure the track cover into a vice, and then cut it with a hacksaw.

00:00:54.421 --> 00:00:59.490
Before you install your track cover, use a file 
 to smooth out any disfigurations in the track.

00:01:00.827 --> 00:01:04.298
For the larger track cover, we recommend install a 
 set screw at each end of the track

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:07.709
to ensure the track cover stays still when the door is operating.

00:01:09.436 --> 00:01:14.074
After your holes are drilled, fasten in your set screws.

00:01:15.108 --> 00:01:17.578
For the smaller track cover, after you finished cutting it to length

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:18.445
place it on the track

00:01:18.445 --> 00:01:24.051
and then use your wood block and hammer 
 to gently tap it onto the track.

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:41.440
As always thank you for watching this tutorial.

00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:44.580
