00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.600
If I look up to the shining stars

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.540
I always thought to admire them

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.360
While I dream the night

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.980
I seem to have tried to fall in love

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.640
Each people has their own happiness,

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.180
begging something didn't exist

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.240
Please tell me,

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.320
because I

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.280
really loved you...

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.920
Hey...

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:02.060
I am right now blessed in love,

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.600
so I wished to the first star

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:15.180
"Somehow I am always by your side"

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.460
For the first time,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.840
now I know how painful love is

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.420
Even so, love is still

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:37.500
something really warm

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:48.280
If I wish towards the the crescent moon

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.520
will it be granted?

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.160
It is sweet

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.420
and a bit bitter

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.660
Just like falling in love

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.440
If I

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.740
started hearing

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.440
your heartbeat

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.800
I want to be honest,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.780
"I love you"...

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.140
Hey...

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.740
You taught me

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.480
how to fly freely

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.100
The future I imagined

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:02.060
It was more beautiful than that

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.980
Everything normal

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:10.680
envied us

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.560
Now,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:18.160
I'll just open wide my wings

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.500
and soar up high

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.780
Now I'm burning in love,

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.400
and the first star laughed

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:40.800
"We must have been tied in fate"

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.260
Now I fly through the night sky

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.520
and become a hope

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.720
If I could reach and tightly grasp your heart

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:03.540
I will be in warm happiness

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:13.180
I am sure this is the thing

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.180
called "Love"
