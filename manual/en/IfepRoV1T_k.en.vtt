HobbyMom: Welcome to HobbyKidsTV.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.670
I'm HobbyMom and I have two HobbyKids with
me today.

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.769
We're going to review the Play-Doh Color Mixer.

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.130
Let's get this started.

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.140
HobbyKid 1: Hi.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.140
HobbyMom: Okay.

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:17.400
It does not come with batteries so you have
to have two double A batteries to make it

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.399
work which go on in the bottom.

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:20.619
There's an on/off switch.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:23.069
You could turn Elmo on and off of course.

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:25.880
It comes with what color Play-Doh guys?

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.300
HobbyKid 1: Blue, red, yellow.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.320
HobbyMom: That's right and now we're going
to make more colors with the Color Mixer.

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.770
Let's see how it works.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.059
Okay, so let's make out some colors so the
first one we're going to do is we're going

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:42.100
to get out some blue with our spoon.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.929
You guys want to open it up for me?

00:00:43.929 --> 00:00:45.160
HobbyKid 1: Yeah.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.879
HobbyMom: Push the little red button to open
it and we're going to put our first one on

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:52.339
the little red dot there.

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:54.109
See, there's a do there.

00:00:54.109 --> 00:00:56.570
Now, let's scoop out some yellow.

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:02.030
Then we'll put it on the second dot.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:07.320
Okay, close the lid.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.479
HobbyKid 1: Okay.

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:19.140
HobbyMom: It's done so we can open it up.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.670
What color did it make?

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.770
HobbyKid 2: Green and ...
HobbyMom: Green so where does the color green

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:28.770
go?

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.189
Do you see where we can put green?

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:31.600
That's right.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.430
What did it make?

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.250
It made an apple.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.700
Okay, so let's take this.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.810
We'll make an apple and where does our apple
go?

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.770
Do you see where on the map our apple should
go?

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.770
HobbyKid 1: Here.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.770
HobbyKid 2: Here.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:48.770
HobbyMom: That's right.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.539
A green apple grows on apple trees.

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:54.659
Good job, guys.

00:01:54.659 --> 00:03:01.290
If you turn this part, he will talk about
the color that's right in front of them.

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:09.830
Next we're going to do red and then scoop
out some blue.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:16.200
Okay, now we're going to mix red and blue
and see what color it makes.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:21.950
Okay, looks like it's not quite ready so let's
keep mixing.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.240
Okay.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.260
Let's open it up and see if it's ready.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:29.450
That's beautiful.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.790
What color is that, guys?

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.790
HobbyKid 1: Purple.

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:32.790
HobbyKid 2: Purple.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:36.220
HobbyMom: That's right, purple and what fruit
is the color purple?

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:37.980
DO you see it anywhere on here?

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.470
HobbyKid 1: Right there.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.870
HobbyMom: That's right, purple grapes.

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:49.870
The purple grape, very good.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:52.430
Now, where does the purple grape go on our
mat?

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:53.430
Do you see where it goes?

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:54.430
HobbyKid 1: In the tree.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.430
HobbyKid 2: The tree.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.560
HobbyMom: That's right.

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.840
Put it in there.

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.590
HobbyKid 1: We're missing something.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:06.960
HobbyMom: Yeah, missing another color.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.310
Let's see if we could try and make orange?

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.200
HobbyKid 1: I don't know.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.720
HobbyMom: Let's find out.

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.610
HobbyKid 2: I don't know.

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:22.539
HobbyMom: To make orange, we're going to do
a scoop of red and we're going to do a scoop

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:29.960
of yellow.

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.719
There's our beautiful orange.

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:34.660
Okay, so we made our orange.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:36.440
Where does the orange go on the mat?

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.440
Good job.

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.699
Ernie is holding a piece of orange.

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:43.530
HobbyKid 1: Is it because he's orange?

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.340
HobbyMom: Maybe.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.830
Now, we made a blue bird.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.500
Where does the blue bird go?

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.650
Do you see where the blue bird goes?

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.460
Very good Cookie Monster's holding the blue
bird because he's blue.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:00.250
Yup.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.450
That's blue.

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:07.949
I am very happy that you chose blue, blue
like me.

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:10.560
Now, where does the red tomato go?

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.469
Do you see where the red tomato goes.

00:05:12.469 --> 00:05:13.610
HobbyKid 1: Here.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:15.500
HobbyKid 2: Elmo has it.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.639
HobbyMom: That's right.

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:17.970
There's another red tomato.

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.000
HobbyKid 1: I'll put it right there.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.750
HobbyMom: Two red tomatoes.

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.449
How about a green apple?

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.740
Do you see where the green apple goes?

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:31.810
And another green apple.

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:35.199
HobbyKid 2: We need some more.

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.009
HobbyMom: We do.

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:38.110
How about the sun?

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.999
Where does the sun go?

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:42.379
Where does the yellow sun go?

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:44.280
HobbyKid 2: That's here.

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.710
HobbyMom: Good job.

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.330
Very good, excellent work.

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:51.530
Here's another green apple.

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:54.650
HobbyKid 2: Excellent.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.729
HobbyMom: Some purple grapes.

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.129
HobbyKid 1: Purple grapes.

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:00.930
HobbyMom: Very good.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:08.469
Now, we have all of our fruit and we have
everybody's happy eating.

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:10.130
What a nice play mat this is.

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:11.449
Thanks for watching everybody.

00:06:11.449 --> 00:06:12.680
We'll see you next time.

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:13.680
Bye.

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:14.680
HobbyKid 1: Bye.
