00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:09.200
Nike are going big into the small-sided game
for 2015 with the arrival of the all-new FootballX

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.809
series of shoes for indoor and astroturf.

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:20.220
After numerous re-brands such as T-5, Nike5
and FC247, Nike will be hoping it’s a case

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.730
of X Marks the Spot with their latest collection
of shoes for the small-sided game

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.119
Based off of the Nike Magista and Mercurial
Superfly, Nike will be hoping that the new

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:36.210
FootballX shoes bring along some of the hype
and incredible performance of their 11-a-side

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.140
counterparts.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.170
And that certainly seems to be the case, given
the immediately positive first impression

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.850
we get when taking a look at the new Nike
MercurialX out of the box.

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.580
The construction will largely be familiar
to anyone who’s done their homework on the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:59.239
Superfly IV or indeed the very, very similar
Elastico Superfly, but just in case, here’s

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:04.030
the way Nike’s Flyknit for football shoes
work.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:09.160
The base layer for the upper is Nike Flyknit,
a knitted yarn chosen for being able to fit

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.720
like a sock and bring the foot closer to the
ball.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.130
Not only fitting like a sock, Nike designed
it look like one too, culminating in the dynamic

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.580
fit collar that provides additional support
to the lower leg.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.250
On the inside of the shoe, you’ll find some
additional padding in the heel and a soft-touch

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:33.310
liner in the toe cap, but it’s on the outside
where things really start getting interesting.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.530
Brio cables add suspension bridge style support
by working with the lacing system to lock

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.420
the foot into the soleplate and heel.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.340
Layered on top of that is NikeSkin - a synthetic
material introduced on the Hypervenom Phantom

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.880
in 2013 that offers friction and feel on the
ball, whilst being flexible enough to let

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.250
the Flyknit do it’s thing.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:01.090
There’s a little confusion about the FootballX
shoes choice of materials, with some retailers

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.280
saying these shows have a premium leather
overlay - however, the manufacturing sticker

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:14.000
doesn’t say there is any on the MercurialX,
however there is the new MagistaX, which is

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.390
likely where the confusion has arisen.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.250
Sticking with that upper construction for
a second, Nike have largely kept the design

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.760
the same as the Elastico Superfly in terms
of the layout of the materials, however there

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:31.900
is a little bit of change in the design of
the heel, making it a little more forgiving

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.790
there.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.890
One entirely new addition is the inclusion
of Nike GRIND rubber in the forefoot.

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.260
This aggressive-feeling added texture around
the big toe and instep gives an added sense

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.660
of confidence on the ball, whilst also adding
another layer of abrasion resistance.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.300
A similar level of durability is promised
to the outsole, too, with Nike including a

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.340
non-marking rubber traction system for use
in indoor competition or on the street.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.880
This largely hexagonal design was introduced
last year, and seems to have garnered some

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.101
good feedback so far, so it’s inclusion
is definitely a plus point - however, this

00:03:13.101 --> 00:03:21.220
time out Nike have amped up the Phylon cushioning
for a more comfortable ride in the heel.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:26.590
Nike are launching FootballX under the banner
of Remix The Game, and the MercurialX certainly

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:53.920
feel like a new take on a familiar favourite.

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:58.560
Every bit the performance shoe that the Superfly
IV is, the Nike MercurialX is an uncompromising

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:02.960
bit of footwear for players who demand the
same from their off-field gear as they do

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:03.960
when they’re playing full-sized.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:11.260
