00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.100
"Chicken Out of UTIs"

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:06.759
When people think E. coli,
they think E. coli O157:H7,

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:13.639
or other diarrheagenic E. coli strains
in retail meats, particularly ground beef.

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.580
But have you ever heard of this E. coli?

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.970
You may not have heard of it,
but if you’re a woman, odds are,

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.529
you’ve felt it, or you will.

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.659
This is within the class of E. coli
that cause urinary tract infections.

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:31.689
Intestinal E. coli, like O157:H7, are bad,
but fewer than 100,000 Americans

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:34.739
are infected every year,
and fewer than 100 die.

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.540
But millions of women get
urinary tract infections—

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:42.399
extra-intestinal E. coli
infections every year—

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.219
with the potential to invade the
bloodstream and cause fatal sepsis,

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.109
or blood poisoning.

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:52.320
The strains of E. coli that cause
extra-intestinal infection are an

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.250
increasingly important endemic problem,
and under-appreciated killers.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.530
Billions of health care dollars,
millions of work days,

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.680
and hundreds of thousands
of lives are lost each year to

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:09.580
extra-intestinal infections,
due to E. coli.

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.430
We know where E. coli O157:H7
comes from—manure in the meat.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.009
But where do these other
E. coli come from?

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:19.780
They come from food, too.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.130
But which food?

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.880
Researchers went to supermarkets,

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.759
and tested 1,648
different types of food—

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:29.740
and, they found it.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.000
We now think that urinary tract infections
come from eating chickens.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.141
Half of retail poultry samples
were found contaminated with the

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:43.500
UTI-associated strains of E. coli.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.390
Scientists now suspect
that by eating chicken,

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.719
women infect their lower intestinal tract
with these meat-borne bacteria,

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:54.020
which can then creep up
into their bladder.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.350
In addition to the
traditional hygiene measures

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.780
aimed at preventing
urinary tract infections—

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.979
wiping from front to back;
urinating after intercourse—

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.240
women can now add avoiding poultry
as a way to help fend off UTIs.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.150
Now in chickens,
the disease is called colibacillosis,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.630
one of the most significant and
widespread infectious diseases

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.480
in the poultry industry.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.480
Why?

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.900
In part, because of the way
we treat these animals.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:29.110
Studies have shown infection risk
to be directly linked to overcrowding

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.540
on these so-called factory farms.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.849
In egg-laying hens confined in cages,
these so-called battery cages,

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:42.920
the most significant risk factor for
flock infection is hen density per cage.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.900
Researchers have calculated that
affording just a single liter of additional

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.590
living space to each hen would be
associated with a 33% decrease

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.410
in the risk of a disease outbreak now
linked to human urinary tract infections.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.120
That’s about equivalent
to just a four-inch cube of space.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.560
If each of these birds just got a tiny bit
more space, the risk drops by a third.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.459
Imagine if the birds could actually
walk around, spread their wings,

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:14.840
get some fresh air?

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:19.290
How we treat animals can have
significant public health implications.
