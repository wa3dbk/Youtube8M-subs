Hi, my name's Dave Andrews. Today I'm going
to show you how to create a simple budget

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:18.359
in Excel 2003. Let's open up Excel 2003. Clicking
on the start button, go to all programs. Microsoft

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:27.409
Office, let's open Excel 2003. Now what we're
going to so is begin by create some headers.

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:34.070
Let's say in A1 we're going to say item name,
that's going to be our budget item. Let's

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:46.150
expand that a little bit. B1 is going to be
budget amount. C will be amount spent. And

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:56.100
we're going to call D difference. So let's
make these bold. And we're going to put in

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:04.690
some items. Let's say mortgage, food and gas.
Now mortgage we know how much that's going

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:13.220
to be, let's say 1500 dollars. And for food,
oh let's give a budget of 600 dollars. For

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:22.409
gas let's say 700. Now on the amount spent
let's put in the amount that we spent this

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.020
month. In it you would create this at the
beginning of the month and kind of update

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:31.730
it as the month goes along. The mortgage we
know we're going to spend 1500 dollars. The

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:39.719
food let's say we actually spent 450. And
gas maybe we took a trip this month, let's

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:44.619
say we spent 850. Now we're going to have
Excel calculate the difference so we'll know

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:50.600
what we're over budget in and what we're under
budget in. To do so click in that first cell

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:59.409
type an equal sign, click on your budget amount
for that row type a minus and then click on

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.109
the amount spent. So it's going to subtract
the amount spent from your budget amount.

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:20.530
Say enter and you get your answer. Let's copy
that cell and past it into the other cells.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:25.750
As you can see it's been relative in that
it is actually totaling the row that goes

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.170
along with where we copied it. We can see
what we're under budget in and what we're

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:38.140
over budget in. It's that easy to create a
budget. My name is Dave Andrews and I've just

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.700
showed you how to create a simple budget using
Excel 2003.
