00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.060
So you recently did something
that's so impressive.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.181
It's a half Iron Man?

00:00:06.181 --> 00:00:06.680
Yes.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:07.555
Yes, a half Iron Man.

00:00:07.555 --> 00:00:11.040
So explain to everybody, if you
don't know, what that entails.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.980
It's 70.3 miles of competition.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.030
So you do a 1.2 mile swim, 56
mile bike, and a half marathon

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.930
run.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:23.420
So it's been something I've
been kind of building up to

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.990
and ironically enjoy the
training that goes with it.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.970
And I had a somewhat
event-free race.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:30.980
But there was kind
of one small snafu.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.434
Yes, tell everyone
what happened.

00:00:32.434 --> 00:00:34.100
Yeah, I kind of came
to an intersection.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.560
And you don't pre-ride
the 56-mile course.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.310
So I'm riding.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:38.630
And I come to an intersection.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.887
I ride through an
intersection full of cops,

00:00:40.887 --> 00:00:42.470
assuming that they
would tell me which

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.150
direction to turn if needed.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.717
They didn't.

00:00:44.717 --> 00:00:47.300
I proceeded up the road another
mile to the next intersection.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.640
There were no cops locking
down that intersection.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.807
I knew I made a wrong turn,
or didn't make the turn.

00:00:51.807 --> 00:00:53.431
So as I turned around
and looked back--

00:00:53.431 --> 00:00:54.720
this is kind of the sad part--

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:57.011
there was a line of people
that followed me and weren't

00:00:57.011 --> 00:00:58.410
starting to turn either.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.840
So my event was 72.3 miles
instead of 70.3 miles.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.389
And how many people
followed you?

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:05.180
There had to be 10.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.302
There was a long line.

00:01:06.302 --> 00:01:08.510
They must have been so mad
when you made that U-turn.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.470
They were mad.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.070
I did get a couple of frowns
as I passed them went on.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:12.600
Oh, no.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.555
You make a turn.

00:01:13.555 --> 00:01:14.680
And it was a left turn too.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.050
And I turn left for a living.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.410
That's kind of an ironic thing.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.510
That's hilarious.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.021
No, but that's
really impressive.

00:01:21.021 --> 00:01:22.020
We've talked about this.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.519
You have to be in really good
shape to be a race car driver.

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:25.837
But it's very intense.

00:01:25.837 --> 00:01:27.920
Yeah, the physical demands
are intense in the car.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.930
And then we have 39
races in 41 weeks.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.000
So it's just a continuous
kind of exercise going on.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.500
Yeah.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.770
Yeah.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.330
Well, I'm very
impressed by that.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.860
And your daughters are how old?

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.690
4 and 1/2 and almost two.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:42.110
And are they at all aware?

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.940
Did they comprehend
what you're doing?

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.650
My oldest gets it for sure.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.870
There's Lydia on the right
and Genevieve on the left.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:48.410
That's a new one.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.640
I had not seen
the brand new one.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.140
Yes, yes.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:50.870
She's adorable.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.720
She is so much fun and has this
crazy, curly hair right now,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.940
and is figuring
out kind of what's

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:57.230
going on and trying to talk.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.280
There's Lydia at the
race car in Daytona.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.360
It's so much fun.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.720
But my oldest kind of gets it.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.100
And there's my
oldest, Genevieve.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.016
This was last weekend.

00:02:05.016 --> 00:02:07.220
She's trying to put on
a little mini helmet.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:08.509
She is a big fan of Dad.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.960
But Danica Patrick really does
give me a run for my money.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:12.170
She's a big Danica fan.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.670
Wow.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.210
So do you think she might
be interested in doing that?

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:16.834
Well, that's about
as far as it's gone.

00:02:16.834 --> 00:02:19.364
She is hauling Dad around
on her little pink car.

00:02:19.364 --> 00:02:21.530
And she usually gets to the
end of the motorhome lot

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.196
and has enough, and then expects
me to carry it back or drive it

00:02:24.196 --> 00:02:25.730
back.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.380
But no, I don't know if the
oldest has a big interest.

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.200
She's definitely a girly girl.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.540
My younger one,
there's a chance.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.760
She calls my race
car a zoom zoom.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.140
She's all about the zoom zoom.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.650
Wow, well then, maybe she will.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:38.150
She might.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:43.250
Now, when you drive a regular
car, do you drive a minivan,

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.822
or do you drive a
fast sports car?

00:02:44.822 --> 00:02:45.780
I can't do the minivan.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.080
No?

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.610
No.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.850
No.

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.440
Now, I know they're very
practical and useful.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:49.580
But I just can't go there.

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.440
I have a Tahoe that I drive.

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.060
And I think I'm a
fantastic driver.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.000
But if you talk to my wife,
she has a different opinion.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.660
Meaning what?

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.770
Do you drive fast?

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.190
She just thinks I get
too close to other cars.

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.220
Well, that's rude.

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:02.500
I'm not very comfortable.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:03.291
And I change lanes.

00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:07.120
No, that's rude then.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.980
No, but I do think that
you would feel like you're

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.500
going so slowly, if you're
used to going so fast

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:14.900
and you do it so often.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.440
Going 60 or 70 would feel
like you're going 20.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.902
Immediately after
a race, for sure.

00:03:19.902 --> 00:03:21.860
But fortunately, they
are such different worlds

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.764
that it's not too bad.

00:03:23.764 --> 00:03:24.680
You don't get tempted.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.150
And you're not the
only race car driver

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.630
at your daughter's
school, right?

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:30.440
Yes.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.940
There's been a few
different drivers

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.380
over the years,
two or three of us

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.390
that our kids all go
to the same school.

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:37.804
But right now, Jeff Gordon,
his youngest and my oldest

00:03:37.804 --> 00:03:38.720
go to the same school.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.870
So it is very interesting,
sitting there in carpool line.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.120
And not only is
he a fellow racer,

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.620
we also drive for the same team.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.270
And then he also
owns my race car.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:49.310
So it's like, hey
boss, how are you?

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.540
We're all coffees and hats on,
trying to do the carpool thing.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.950
And do you try to compete
on who gets out first?

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:55.755
I get out first.

00:03:58.381 --> 00:03:58.880
All right.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:59.796
I have a gift for you.

00:03:59.796 --> 00:04:03.950
Because hopefully, you'll
do another half Iron Man

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:04.860
competition.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.720
So this is your shirt
that you'll wear.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:08.220
It is.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.490
Wow.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.165
Yeah, that's our foundation.

00:04:09.165 --> 00:04:09.770
Thank you.

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:10.270
Yep.

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.090
And then, you'll have
that on the back.

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:15.580
That will be useful.
