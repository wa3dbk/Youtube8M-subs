Hi, I'm Jen from Online Fabric Store.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.620
I'm going to show you how to make a little girl's tutu with very little sewing, making it fun and easy.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:21.180
So let's get started.

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:31.460
The materials you'll need are: a rotary cutter mat, a rotary cutter, Paris Pink Tulle, Aqua Tulle, Coral Tulle,

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:39.780
7/8 inch wide turquoise ribbon, 3/4 inch white woven non roll elastic, white thread,

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.000
white elastic thread, and a ruler.

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:52.160
Take an 18 inch strip of the white elastic and stitch the ends together, overlapping them a half an inch.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.180
Zigzag stitch them together with the elastic thread in the bobbin.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.820
Elastic thread allows the waistband to stretch without snapping.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.980
Threading the elastic on top can cause damage to your machine.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.760
Cut twenty 2 inch by 12 inch strips out of the 3 tulle fabrics.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.240
Once they're cut, pile them on top of each other.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:28.140
At the bottom, cut a 45 degree angle for a sharp finish.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:39.440
Cut strips out of the ribbon 24 inches long and cut the ends at a 45 degree angle.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:53.420
Take a strip of tulle, fold it in half, and place the loose ends under the elastic.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.660
Take the folded part of the tulle, loop it over the loose ends,

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.060
pull through, and push upwards into a knot.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.620
Alternate the different colors and add the ribbon after every 9 colors until the tutu is full.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:34.100
This tutu can be used for dance, costumes, or just all around fun.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.580
You can alternate different colors or keep it all one color.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.140
Thanks for watching this OFS project.
