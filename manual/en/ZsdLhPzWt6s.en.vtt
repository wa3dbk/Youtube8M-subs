00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.420
I've always been a big fan of X-Men Legends
II.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.680
When I first played that game, I was blown
away.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:39.140
Partially because it's such a solid RPG, partially
because it's a good X-Men game.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.810
I'm telling you, prior to that one, I don't
think I'd ever played a good X-Men game.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:44.050
And that's a shame.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.860
X-Men never got its Turtles In Time, you know?

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.910
Fortunately, it did get its Diablo.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.610
It's X-Men Legends, for the PlayStation 2.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:01:01.460
Actually, a Turtles Diablo would be nice,
too.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:17.430
But you know, the weird thing is...as much
as I like X-Men Legends II?

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.810
This was actually the first time I'd played
the first one.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.920
It was sent to us by our pal Mark from Ontario,
so a big thanks to him for sending it.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.780
He actually sent us the second one, too.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.140
I spent the whole day playing 'em both.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:34.200
And after doing so, I'll say this...if the
second game is Rogue, the first game is, like...it's

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.750
like Jean Grey, you know?

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.610
Definitely not as hot as Rogue, but...

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:39.510
Still, definitely, pretty hot.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:44.000
And although the story doesn't have the novelty
factor that the second one does, teaming up

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.370
good guys and bad guys...it's still pretty
good.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.530
The game starts off with the streets of New
York being torn apart by mutants, and as it

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:52.560
turns out...it's all over a girl.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.729
The Brotherhood is hunting her, and it's up
to the X-Men to save her.

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.070
Specifically Wolverine, at the beginning.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.700
But from there...the plot thickens, the roster
expands, the carnage increases...

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.640
And Rogue remains.

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.640
Incredibly hot.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.649
I'm telling you.

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:08.200
Forget you, Mystique.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.470
Little Miss Daddy Ignored Me.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:21.560
So if you've never played this one, or the
second one...X-Men Legends is a really simple

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.560
concept.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:28.930
Take a straightforward action RPG, like Diablo,
or Baldur's Gate, or add your favorite action

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.950
RPG here...and add the X-Men.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.310
There's nothing all that original about it,
but that's fine.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.190
It's something familiar, done with an X-Men
twist.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.850
And done really, really well, too.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.850
It's a game of bashing and slashing and leveling
up...mutants.

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:50.230
And that's awesome.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.880
Like the second game, you have a four-man
team to work with.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.450
And you can assemble your team however you
want.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.570
You can throw in more physical mutants...like
Wolverine, for example.

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:01.699
And then complement them with mutants who
work with ranged attacks.

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:04.010
Or at least, that's the way I like to approach
it.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.010
But that's the cool thing.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.329
You can experiment with lots of possible combinations,
and you can change it up at any checkpoint

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:10.520
you come across.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.730
And for me, messing around with those combinations
and seeing which characters work the best

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.459
together...that's one of the most fun things
about these games.

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:25.730
Of course, that's the same story as the second
game.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.330
And in fact, the two games are mostly identical.

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:30.790
Same gameplay, same dungeon-crawling design.

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:33.040
Where the two differ is in the polish.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.740
The second one is just slightly better, and
more refined.

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:39.360
You play this one, and you can tell it's the
first one, so to speak.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.530
But what I will say is...I did enjoy its environments
more.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.310
Less brown, less caves...it just feels a bit
more diverse, visually.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:56.190
Even the graphics aren't as good looking,
from a technical perspective.

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:10.680
You know, as addictive as these games are...they're
even more fun with a friend.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.900
This is an outstanding multiplayer game, and
you can play with up to four players.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.940
But again, even when you're playing alone,
it's just such an addictive game.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.630
Especially powering up your characters.

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.320
Because it's such a constant process, with
such clear and impressive results...it makes

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:27.620
you want to get that next level even more.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:31.030
So this is a hard game to put down, no matter
how many people are playing.

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:35.020
If I had to recommend one of these games,
I'd definitely go with the sequel.

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.470
It's just more polished and refined.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.220
And to be honest, I'm not a huge fan of the
mansion in this game.

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:45.130
It's like a base of operations, but...it's
mostly just empty space with some NPCs you

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:46.130
can talk to.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:49.050
Which means it's really just a walkable menu,
which annoys me.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.470
And I've never cared much for the sound, and
music in these games...but that's sort of

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:54.530
nitpicking, to be honest.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:57.070
On the whole, this is a solid action RPG.

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.560
It might be a little bit simple for hardcore
RPG fans, but especially for X-Men fans...this

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.120
is a game you can spend an entire day with
and not even realize it.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.460
This and its sequel are highly recommended.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:20.500
It's X-Men Legends, for the PlayStation 2.
