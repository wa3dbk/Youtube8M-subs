00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.290
Salutations celestial sight seers!

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:20.760
I'm David Fuller, welcome to Eyes on the Sky;
what's up this week?

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.730
Starting on Monday, let's get acquainted with
a larger feature: Mare Nubium is the dark

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.010
section in the southern section of the Moon
near the terminator.

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.300
Bullialdus is the prominent here this night;
this is a 59 kilometers across crater.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.350
Look for the central peaks, terraced walls,
and interesting radial pattern surrounding

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.220
the area outside the impact.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.910
From there, look a bit to the west; there's
the rather jagged looking walls of slightly

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.519
smaller Agatharchides, named for a Greek geographer
in the 2-nd century BC.

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:56.550
This is a crater that flooded with lava to
create a smoother looking floor, but left

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.750
some of the peaks around parts of the perimeter.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.660
Use high magnification and wait for periods
of clarity; see if you can spot the small

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.680
craterlet on the western wall.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:11.869
An evening later provides a nice view of Mare
Humorum, with the large Gassendi on the northern

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:17.130
rim, which is punctuated by the smaller crater
Gassendi A. On the southern side, things get

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.500
even more interesting.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.439
The brightest and easiest to see is perhaps
the 45 kilometers Vitello.

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:26.030
But it gets rather strange towards the west.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.340
The very flooded and seemingly half-erased
crater Lee is immediately adjacent to Vitello

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.939
-- this area almost appears as an extension
of Mare Humorum.

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:40.729
Then to the northwest is Doppelmayer; this
may appear as just part of a crescent -- the

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:43.850
full crater is clearly flooded over entirely.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.880
See how much of this you can spot on Tuesday.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.680
Wednesday has us looking south.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:54.499
While the enormous 227 kilometers walled plain
of Schickard dominates the terminator side

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:57.210
of the Moon, we'll look instead a bit inward.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.119
Notice that strange, oblong shape?

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.229
That would be Schiller, formed from an extremely
oblique impact, generating a depression some

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.830
180 kilometers long, but just 70 kilometers
wide -- definitely NOT you're typical "round"

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.830
crater!

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.940
And between Schiller and Mare Humorum is a
set of fascinating impacts: Look for Hainzel,

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:24.780
along with it's overlapping A and C craters
which make for an interesting region for perusal.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.510
Dark Sky Fact: The Moon is full for most of
us on the evening of July 12 in the more western

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:33.150
hemisphere, and the light it produces is about
0.1 lux of light.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.510
Find an area that is free of other lights,
and find out how well you can see with that

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:37.510
much illumination.

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.680
That ought to be the standard we use for streetlights,
rather than the 30 to 100x brighter light

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.930
levels they typically produce, which causes
glare and, due to light trespass, some sleep

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.510
disorders too.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.370
On Thursday, we get a nice treat as a walled
plain even larger than Schickard is in view

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.470
thanks to some helpful lunar libration.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.540
Look for the 303 kilometers diameter Bailly
at the edge of the Moon.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.540
That's 188 miles across!

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.700
By comparison, the state of Indiana in the
United States is only 140 miles across.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.010
There are multiple smaller craters within
this plain, and several of them are quite

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.380
large in and of themselves.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:17.060
Juxtapose them with the three similarly sized
craters to the north and east: Zucchius, Bettinus

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.440
and Kircher.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.879
Each of these are from 65 to 70 kilometers
in diameter.

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:27.939
Now let's wind a path of craters from Clavius
towards the Moon's southern pole.

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:33.709
Clavius is the large crater south of Tycho;
it got sprayed with ejecta from Tycho's impactor.

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.549
About an equal distance away more towards
the south is Moretus; it should be obvious

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:40.079
from the central peak in the middle.

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.459
Immediately adjacent to it is the crater Short,
and then south and just west of there are

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.810
Newton and Newton A -- yes, these are named
after the famous Isaac Newton.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.409
It might be easier to see a night later, but
try on Saturday if you can.

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:56.319
The crater Cabeus, located right about here,
is not on the southern pole, but is close

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:57.319
to it.

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.290
In September of 2009, the upper stage section
of the rocket that brought the LCROSS lunar

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:06.189
mission to the Moon was allowed to impact
into Cabeus.

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:11.280
The resulting plume was then to be sampled
by the LCROSS spacecraft before it impacted

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.620
itself.

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:16.610
The presence of water was indeed discovered,
due to the deep sections of Cabeus remaing

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.359
in perpetual shadow from the Sun's light.

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:22.500
Did you like this video?

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.320
Please consider sharing these with others
interested in the night sky so we can educate

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.610
about what can be seen, and how to reduce
light pollution.

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.440

Thanks for watching...

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.890
Keep your eyes on the sky and your outdoor
lights aimed down, so we can all see, what's

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:52.890
up.

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:55.730
I'm David Fuller, wishing you clear and dark
skies.
