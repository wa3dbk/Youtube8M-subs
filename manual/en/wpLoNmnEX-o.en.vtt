00:02:53.219 --> 00:02:54.409
technology

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.159
airflow

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.859
which

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:00.259

manufacturer

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:24.869
for phone

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:27.779
if the backpack is half full

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:29.359
then you can

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:32.269
so fasten him

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.009
and he

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:38.159
will take

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:41.619
much less space

00:03:41.619 --> 00:03:43.979
he weights

00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:49.409
almost a kilo
