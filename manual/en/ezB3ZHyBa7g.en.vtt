00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.919
i've got a couple interesting stories to
tell you about here is one that was

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:07.080
written about in scientific american
that says the age-old idea that men and

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.089
women

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:12.119
can just be friends assuming that
they're both heterosexual in this case

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:14.480
appears to be not true

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.849
this is fascinating they did it the
uh... the study

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.630
where they brought in eighty eight pairs
of undergraduate opposite sex friends

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.100
into a science lab

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.080
and they followed standard protocol as
far as

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.079
anonymity confidentiality and cetera but
also got people to agree verbally and in

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.829
front of each other that they've were
going to discuss the study they were

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:37.449
going to talk about what they said to
the researchers

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:40.710
amongst themselves after leaving the
testing facility

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.980
what they tested was presumably you were
just friends and they separated the the

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.200
op and then that the man in the woman

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.250
they said okay

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:52.340
tell me do you have any how attractive
you find your friend to be

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.520
how attractive do you think your friend
defines you to be how interested in

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.550
pursuing a relationship with your friend
are you

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.290
what you think they found

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.659
you you tell me ok the results show that
there is a huge gender difference

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:09.690
the women

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:13.580
did not find on the whole the meant to
be particularly attractive

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.619
and had absolutely no inkling that they
would ever have a romantic relationship

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.200
with them that however

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:19.179
the men

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:20.430
number one

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.530
down the women attractive number two

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.780
had a much higher

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:28.690
estimation of how attractive the women
found them to be and also indicated then

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.410
i would actually be into having a
romantic relationship uh... with this

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:33.020
woman

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.170
so the resulting really seemed to
indicate that

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.170
men have the harder time being just
friends whereas for women it really

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:44.830
appears to be much more straightforward
to be just friends but in my guest to it

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.900
would it be a

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:48.420
just from what i've observed

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.610
i've always thought this i've had
conversations with a number of different

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:53.070
uh... of women

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.060
where uh... they'll say opal
such-and-such is just a friend

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.170
and also i'm not denying that your
you're actually just friends but if

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.650
given the opportunity he would be
interested in a romantic relationship

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.770
with you and they say now no no no
absolutely not you have no idea what our

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:08.869
friendship is like a prejudice different

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.829
that he would never be interested in
that and the research more and more

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:16.149
seems to indicate yes he would it's just
that you wouldn't be interested

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:17.799
and he thinks that

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:18.700
she would be

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.180
right in new york both both uh...

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.620
parties are delusional buildings that we
both knew the women assume the net are

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.040
interested in them the medicine the
women deep down are interested in them

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.649
and they both seem to be completely
