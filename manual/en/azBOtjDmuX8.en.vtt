[♪techno music playing♪]

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
[gun firing]

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is the Army Today.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Michelle Michael reports from humanitarian mission African Lion 2009,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
where two soldiers provide a unique method of healing.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
He can move them?  &gt;&gt;Yes.  &gt;&gt;Okay.  Tell him to hold his head real still.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
To treat scratched cornea...

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
A branch from a tree scratched him in the eye.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
...there's a right way and a wrong way.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:35.000
To make friends, there's the Slaugh and Hill way. [laughter]

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Their kind of politics don't require a college degree;

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
just two pair of plastic shades and two soldiers who don't take themselves...

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Hill over here plays with the toys.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
...too seriously.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Cody Slaugh is a Specialist in the Utah National Guard.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
He's a kid at heart,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
winning hearts in Morocco.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
He's among some 600 U.S. troops in the country as part of African Lion 2009.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
It's a peacekeeping exercise that includes medical help 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
for hundreds of villagers in several areas.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Pediatrics is the perfect place for a man whose day job is day care.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:23.000
We've got some soccer balls and some other stuffed animals and things that we give out.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
He gives out more than toys and smiles.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
In a way, a piece of his heart leaves with every child who comes.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
They'll leave with a new outlook on life,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
one that's a little brighter than they're used to.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The glasses actually don't get worn outside of the pedatrics,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
even though we'd like to. [laughter]

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
They're pretty cool glasses.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Michelle Michael, Argana...

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Doing a little Elton John thing here.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
...Morocco. [laughter]

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
[♪techno music playing♪]

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
That's the Army Today, Washington.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
