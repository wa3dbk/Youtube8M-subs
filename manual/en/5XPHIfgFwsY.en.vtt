00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
I think everyone should be entitled to free speech

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
except "progressive" left-wing students.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
They should be denied a platform as part of their education,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
so that they know how it feels.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's called equality, and fairness.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Could it be any more "progressive"?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I say this because it seems like every week we hear about

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
somebody being banned or shouted down in one of those

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
"progressive" bubbles of righteous intolerance

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that we still have the nerve to call universities.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
In fact, a recent report revealed that free speech effectively no longer exists

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
in four out of five British universities

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
because "progressive" students are too intellectually delicate

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to exposed to ideas that make them uncomfortable

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
by challenging their prejudices and hurting their feelings.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
So they're demanding, and getting, what they call

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
the right to be comfortable,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
the right to a safe space for all students,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
meaning the right never to have any of their half-baked assumptions

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
called into question, and to be pampered in this

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
like little princes and princesses, cocooned in their artificial

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
world of "progressive" make-believe.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Inevitably, of course, this right to be comfortable

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
is very selective, and only extends to

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
those who hold the correct opinion.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Anyone else can expect to be made very uncomfortable indeed

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
by being silenced - either banned outright,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
or shouted down by militant "progressive" puritan bigots

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
who think in slogans, and who think it's more virtuous

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
to be "progressive" than to be factually accurate or morally just,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
or to have anything remotely resembling an open mind.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It's bad enough that this is happening in our society at all

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
in the 21st century, but it's happening in universities,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
the cutting edge of our entire civilisation,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and that makes it many times more damaging and dangerous.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Yet the authorities are simply allowing it to happen

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
for reasons best known to their common purpose (whatever that might be)

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and they are not doing their job.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Even somebody like me knows that the primary purpose

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
of an education is to teach a person to develop

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
an enquiring mind, to be willing to engage with new ideas

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and information, and to think for themselves.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
If it doesn't do that, it's not an education,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
however many letters you have after your name.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
It's merely a kind of valet parking of the mind.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And that appears to be what's on offer today in lieu of an education,

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
not just in Britain, but all over the western world,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
because today a university is the one place outside religion

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000
where you're guaranteed to find people with rigid, unexamined ideas,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
deaf to argument, and blind to evidence,

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.000
and who appear to have been hypnotised into seriously believing

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
that other people's rights and liberties are subordinate to their feelings.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
What does it say about a person's character

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000
when the only way that they can be comfortable

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
is by suppressing the rights of others?

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Not that it matters what it says, because they're not listening anyway.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
They haven't been taught how to listen, or now to think,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000
only to absorb "progressive" propaganda, and to conform,

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and to judge and condemn and censor and suppress

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
anyone who won't conform.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Arrogantly incurious and utterly certain

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
in the way that only truly stupid people are.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
Certain enough to demand editorial control over everyone's opinion,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
yet dishonest enough to call it a safe space

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
for all students. Yeah, right.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Except the ones you disagree with, right "progressive" bigots?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
There's no safe space for students who express opinions you don't like,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
who argue for, say, democracy in Europe,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.000
or who try to put a case for Israel (and yes, there is one,

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.000
not that you ignoramuses would know).

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
And there's no safe space for students who want to hear

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
other arguments, other points of view.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
You know, proper students who are there for the right reason,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000
to engage with ideas, to broaden their range of influences,

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000
to evaluate arguments, and to think for themselves.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000
There is no safe space for those people,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.000
and you intolerant militant puritan bigots are the reason why.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Are you afraid to hear the arguments

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000
in case you're convinced and have to change your mind?

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
It's not as painful as it sounds, I can assure you.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
But if you're not even open to the possibility

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
(and if you shout people down then clearly you are not)

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.000
then you are being miseducated.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.000
You've been shafted and brainwashed and cheated

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
as surely as any religious zealot.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
You're even too arrogant and stupid to see that

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000
every time you shut somebody up you indict yourselves personally.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000
You show your smallness and your fear,

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
and you generate contempt for yourself as an individual

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
that you will wear as a public stain on your character

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
for the rest of your life, because when you finally grow up

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
ten or twenty or thirty years from now

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000
and decide that you want to live down this despicable behaviour,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:50.000
you won't be allowed to. The crime is too great.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000
The betrayal is too fundamental.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000
We can all see now exactly who you are

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
and how low you are prepared to sink.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.000
And we can see that from your sheltered and privileged position

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
of closed-minded ignorance you're perfectly willing

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
to squander everyone's birthright,

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:11.000
the importance of which you clearly don't understand

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.000
because you've been taught not to understand.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000
You're attempting to undermine the foundation of our society,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000
the very principle that gives us all the freedom

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.000
to be who we are, and that gives you the freedom

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.000
to abuse the freedom to be the intolerant

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000
intellectual and moral vermin that you are.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
The joke is that you claim to operate from a moral position.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
In truth, you're on the same moral level as wartime collaborators.

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:40.000
You're doing real damage, and you will not be forgiven.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:43.000
In the very places where the enlightened leadership of tomorrow

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.000
is supposed to be germinating, you people are like a poison crop spray.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
You bring shame on the institutions of learning

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000
that you soil with your presence, and whose premises

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000
you occupy under false pretences.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
And that applies whether you're a student, lecturer,

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000
administrator, or professor. If you condone,

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000
facilitate or indulge the suppression of

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000
any opinion on a university campus,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
you are an imposter, and you are the problem.
