00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.225
Welcome to a lesson on Roman numerals.

00:00:04.225 --> 00:00:07.086
Roman numerals, the numeric
system in ancient Rome,

00:00:07.086 --> 00:00:10.183
uses combinations of letters
from the Latin alphabet

00:00:10.183 --> 00:00:11.770
to signify values.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.771
Here we have the Roman
numerals on the left

00:00:14.771 --> 00:00:17.854
and the Arabic numerals on the right.

00:00:19.142 --> 00:00:22.493
Many numbers are formed by
combining symbols together

00:00:22.493 --> 00:00:26.013
and placed from left to
right in order of value.

00:00:26.013 --> 00:00:29.581
Notice in this first example,
we have two capital Is,

00:00:29.581 --> 00:00:31.787
each of which are equal to one,

00:00:31.787 --> 00:00:35.537
so we add these one plus
one is equal to two.

00:00:36.863 --> 00:00:40.193
Here we have a V followed
by three capital Is,

00:00:40.193 --> 00:00:44.061
this would be five plus three,
which is equal to eight.

00:00:44.061 --> 00:00:45.819
Notice how we're adding these

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:49.836
and these are ordered from
greatest value to least value.

00:00:49.836 --> 00:00:54.622
Next we have two Xs, that
would be 10 plus 10 or 20,

00:00:54.622 --> 00:00:58.789
plus V followed by I, which
would be five plus one, or six.

00:00:59.732 --> 00:01:00.649
This is 26.

00:01:02.638 --> 00:01:06.019
Next, we have an L, which is equal to 50.

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:09.019
And X is 10, 50 plus 10 would be 60.

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:14.402
Plus the V, which is equal
to five, 60 plus five is 65.

00:01:16.757 --> 00:01:19.174
Next we have C, which is 100,

00:01:22.614 --> 00:01:25.290
and then we have L followed by X,

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.290
that would be 50 plus 10, that's 60,

00:01:29.284 --> 00:01:34.115
plus V followed by I, that
would be five plus one, or six.

00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:34.948
This 166.

00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:42.265
Next we have D, which is
500, followed by two Cs,

00:01:42.265 --> 00:01:45.932
that would be 500 plus
100 plus 100, or 700,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.317
plus V followed by I, which
is six, so this is 706.

00:01:53.676 --> 00:01:55.816
Here we have two capital Ms,

00:01:55.816 --> 00:02:00.003
that would be 1,000 plus 1,000, or 2,000,

00:02:00.003 --> 00:02:04.170
plus D followed by C, that's
going to be 500 plus 100,

00:02:05.042 --> 00:02:09.209
that's 600, plus X, which
is 10, plus two capital Is,

00:02:13.006 --> 00:02:15.673
that's two, this would be 2,612.

00:02:19.397 --> 00:02:22.311
Now, to avoid four repeated characters,

00:02:22.311 --> 00:02:25.411
if a smaller numeral comes
before a larger numeral,

00:02:25.411 --> 00:02:28.167
the smaller is subtracted from the larger.

00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:30.573
So, for example, here, notice how

00:02:30.573 --> 00:02:34.740
the I is smaller than the V,
because I is one and V is five.

00:02:36.071 --> 00:02:39.654
Therefore, this is five
minus one, or four.

00:02:40.666 --> 00:02:44.555
We represent four this way
instead of four capital Is,

00:02:44.555 --> 00:02:47.540
to avoid four repeated characters.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.844
Next, we have an I before an X,

00:02:49.844 --> 00:02:53.593
which is a one before a 10,
so this would be 10 minus one,

00:02:53.593 --> 00:02:54.426
or nine.

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.560
Next we have an X before an L,

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.670
where the X is 10 and the L is 50,

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.670
so this would be 50 minus 10, or 40.

00:03:07.746 --> 00:03:09.294
Here, we have an X before a C,

00:03:09.294 --> 00:03:12.046
where the X is 10 and the C is 100,

00:03:12.046 --> 00:03:16.213
so this is 100 minus 10, that'd
be 90, plus V followed by I.

00:03:18.738 --> 00:03:21.195
Notice how the smaller value's
to the right, so we add.

00:03:21.195 --> 00:03:23.447
This is five plus one, or six.

00:03:23.447 --> 00:03:24.697
So, this is 96.

00:03:26.176 --> 00:03:29.911
Next, we have a C before a D,
that would be 500 minus 100,

00:03:29.911 --> 00:03:34.078
or 400 plus an X before an
L, that would be 50 minus 10,

00:03:36.421 --> 00:03:40.588
or 40, plus an I before a
V, that's five minus one,

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:42.402
or four.

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:44.713
So, we have 444.

00:03:46.221 --> 00:03:49.804
Next, we have two
capital Ms, that's 2,000,

00:03:51.981 --> 00:03:56.817
plus, we have X before C,
that would be 100 minus 10,

00:03:56.817 --> 00:04:00.567
or 90, plus V, which is
five, would be 2,095.

00:04:04.212 --> 00:04:06.925
Then finally, we have a C before M,

00:04:06.925 --> 00:04:10.008
that would be 1,000 minus 100 or 900.

00:04:12.058 --> 00:04:16.225
Plus X before L, that would
be 50 minus 10, that's 40,

00:04:17.711 --> 00:04:22.417
plus an I before an X, that
would be 10 minus one, or nine.

00:04:22.417 --> 00:04:23.417
This is 949.

00:04:26.407 --> 00:04:29.508
Now, the subtraction principle
can be a little tricky

00:04:29.508 --> 00:04:32.560
because there are restrictions
on the subtractive principle

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.139
for Roman numerals.

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:37.292
You can only subtract
a power of 10 and only

00:04:37.292 --> 00:04:40.501
from the next higher
digits where the digits

00:04:40.501 --> 00:04:42.751
are I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

00:04:45.427 --> 00:04:49.489
That is, only I, X and C can be subtracted

00:04:49.489 --> 00:04:52.989
and I can be subtracted only from V and X,

00:04:54.636 --> 00:04:58.514
where X can only be
subtracted from L and C,

00:04:58.514 --> 00:05:02.710
and C can only be subtracted from D and M.

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:05.481
So, the subtracting principle
can get a little tricky.

00:05:05.481 --> 00:05:08.093
Let's take a look at
some examples of forming

00:05:08.093 --> 00:05:11.426
Roman numerals from the Arabic numerals.

00:05:13.352 --> 00:05:16.397
So, for 37, we'll start with a 30,

00:05:16.397 --> 00:05:19.980
that would be three
Xs, and then for seven,

00:05:20.903 --> 00:05:23.986
we would have a V followed by two Is.

00:05:26.875 --> 00:05:30.249
For 49, we will use the
subtraction principle,

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:32.549
but we can't use an I and an L.

00:05:32.549 --> 00:05:36.572
We'll start with the 40, by
putting an X before the L,

00:05:36.572 --> 00:05:38.534
that would be 50 minus 10.

00:05:38.534 --> 00:05:42.853
So, we'll use XL, that's
40, and then for nine,

00:05:42.853 --> 00:05:46.603
we'll use an I before
an X, for 10 minus one.

00:05:49.274 --> 00:05:51.120
So, here's 49.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.037
For 236, we'll start with
200, which is two Cs.

00:05:57.286 --> 00:06:01.423
For 30, we'll use three
Xs, and then for six,

00:06:01.423 --> 00:06:04.006
we'll use a V followed by an I.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:10.250
For 475, we'll start with
400, we'll have to use

00:06:11.415 --> 00:06:12.935
the subtraction principle.

00:06:12.935 --> 00:06:16.768
We'll put a C before the
D, for 500 minus 100.

00:06:18.281 --> 00:06:19.531
So there's 400.

00:06:20.408 --> 00:06:24.610
And then for 70, we'll
use 50 plus 10 plus 10

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:27.027
or LXX, for five, we use a V.

00:06:30.206 --> 00:06:34.206
Next, for 1,241, we M for
1,000, two Cs for 200,

00:06:38.145 --> 00:06:42.062
now for 40, we'll have
to use an X before an L.

00:06:43.021 --> 00:06:47.188
So there's 50 minus 10,
that's 40 and there's the one.

00:06:48.725 --> 00:06:52.142
And now for 989, we'll start with the 900

00:06:53.018 --> 00:06:57.185
by using a C before an M,
this would be 1,000 minus 100.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:04.390
For 80, we will use a 50
and three 10s, or LXXX,

00:07:08.747 --> 00:07:12.914
for nine, we'll an I before
an X for 10 minus one.

00:07:15.113 --> 00:07:18.696
Finally, for 3,993,
we'll use Ms for 3,000.

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:26.130
And now for 900, we'll use a C before an M

00:07:27.053 --> 00:07:28.720
for 1,000 minus 100.

00:07:31.248 --> 00:07:34.537
And then for 90, we'll use an X before a C

00:07:34.537 --> 00:07:35.954
for 100 minus 10.

00:07:38.328 --> 00:07:41.995
And then for three we
have three capital Is.

00:07:43.107 --> 00:07:46.223
Now, there's one more thing
to mention before we go.

00:07:46.223 --> 00:07:49.128
Roman numerals may be written
as lower case letters,

00:07:49.128 --> 00:07:51.936
but it is more common to
use upper case letters.

00:07:51.936 --> 00:07:55.072
But here are the Roman numerals
using lower case letters

00:07:55.072 --> 00:07:56.897
for reference.

00:07:56.897 --> 00:07:59.980
I hope you found this lesson helpful.
