00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.670
Concoction Rice is the traditional version
of Nigerian Jollof Rice.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:10.110
It got its name from the fact that all the
ingredients used in cooking this rice are

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.980
not what you would normally use to prepare
the classic Jollof Rice.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.110
If you want a very traditional Nigerian meal
in your life, then Concoction Rice is for

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.280
you!
To prepare this, we soak the stock fish and

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:30.280
the dry fish till they are soft enough to
be broken into pieces.

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.530
Grind the crayfish with the iru also known
as ogiri okpei or dawa dawa.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.450
Parboil the rice as you would when preparing
a Jollof Rice recipe.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:02.300
Cool it down with cold water and put in a
sieve to drain.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.409
We then put the pieces of fish in the pot
and add onions to that.

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:13.409
Then stock cubes ...
Add some water and cook till the stock fish

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:21.229
is very soft.
Then add the pepper ... crayfish ... and palm

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:29.299
oil.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:36.299
full list of the ingredients.
Cover and cook at medium to high heat for

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:54.909
about 7 minutes.
Add the parboiled rice.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:08.790
Stir very well making sure that the water
is at the same level as the rice.

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:15.790
If not, top it up.
Then add the smoked mackerel on top. Smoked

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:27.550
fish is very soft so it needs some tender
loving care.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:33.360
Cook at medium heat till the water dries up.
Once the rice is parboiled correctly, the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.970
rice should be done when the first level of
water dries up.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:43.960
Parboiling the rice is my no-fail method of
cooking any Jollof Rice meal.

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:48.850
The rice is not burnt, it is not soggy and
it is well cooked.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:53.460
Of course you have to use the long grain parboiled
rice which is the rice we use in preparing

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.310
Nigerian recipes
That's it!

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.310
I assure you, you can't mess this one up
because it is already a concoction! See you

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.240
soon!
