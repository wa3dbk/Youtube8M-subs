00:00:07.922 --> 00:00:11.001
the university in turkey this study on

00:00:11.001 --> 00:00:14.811
with on %uh fat man versus that man

00:00:14.811 --> 00:00:18.711
and collapse longest intact

00:00:18.711 --> 00:00:23.712
this was the study need for was that that
it but the friend of mine had been to this

00:00:23.712 --> 00:00:24.631
point

00:00:24.631 --> 00:00:25.871
up by of

00:00:25.871 --> 00:00:29.392
I had not seen the results of a study and
finding out what the laws okay

00:00:29.392 --> 00:00:33.281
I am going to go with it

00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:34.231
batman

00:00:34.231 --> 00:00:37.612
for the wind last longer and that according
to this

00:00:37.612 --> 00:00:42.352
the questionable studied and what have you
got a question we never incident how dare

00:00:42.352 --> 00:00:45.482
you question studies coming out of %uh

00:00:45.482 --> 00:00:50.091
well you know what Al based on what explanation
and it makes that okay

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:55.882
Sunday claimed that up overweight individuals
are overweight men have on it

00:00:55.882 --> 00:00:57.892
produce more the female hormone

00:00:57.892 --> 00:01:03.202
and because of that female hormone it causes
some keadilan away at then

00:01:03.202 --> 00:01:07.602
first of all the way through a lot but that
the nets what occurred at the end of the day

00:01:07.602 --> 00:01:13.622
I think that with the PLO go down and announcement
came down seven allen the hit me

00:01:13.622 --> 00:01:14.792
the minute here

00:01:14.792 --> 00:01:18.801
yeah

00:01:18.801 --> 00:01:19.422
yes

00:01:19.422 --> 00:01:23.322
with the televised that with it

00:01:23.322 --> 00:01:25.481
but the

00:01:25.481 --> 00:01:30.702
but otherwise I and the female hormone it
disrupts the chemical balance in your body

00:01:30.702 --> 00:01:33.642
because of that chemical at in balance

00:01:33.642 --> 00:01:34.581
good

00:01:34.581 --> 00:01:36.962
you are able to laugh line and that

00:01:36.962 --> 00:01:39.941
as opposed to a the helping to get my it

00:01:39.941 --> 00:01:43.272
I have a book that's that's right now the
business

00:01:43.272 --> 00:01:50.272
other means but I do it you're better the
rebels would why the what's in fact it

00:01:50.842 --> 00:01:54.652
if they think a lot of it is it a that

00:01:54.652 --> 00:01:58.852
I knew that physical of the that

00:01:58.852 --> 00:02:04.691
it's a questionable way I like the result
questionable the reason look acquitted the

00:02:04.691 --> 00:02:06.612
results of the study

00:02:06.612 --> 00:02:10.081
overweight men last seven point three minutes

00:02:10.081 --> 00:02:12.141
whereas men with a healthy pm Monday

00:02:12.141 --> 00:02:15.152
last one point eight-minute all

00:02:15.152 --> 00:02:17.052
our first law but latest

00:02:17.052 --> 00:02:17.612
okay

00:02:17.612 --> 00:02:23.532
his that men do is drop the that big old got
on everybody off of this about the top row

00:02:23.532 --> 00:02:26.031
the road last

00:02:26.031 --> 00:02:31.171
but you can we don't quit the point where
we're required to apply formula working surrounds

00:02:31.171 --> 00:02:35.171
the books the like that and other than that
it happened more to it

00:02:35.171 --> 00:02:40.071
local all that what all of their business

00:02:40.071 --> 00:02:41.331
%uh said

00:02:41.331 --> 00:02:43.381
and that's a terrible

00:02:43.381 --> 00:02:49.122
even some point treatment facilities that
I really that surprised some point and then

00:02:49.122 --> 00:02:54.271
no like compared to the the you don't want
it but it's been one of those who did not

00:02:54.271 --> 00:02:57.812
like that's one of the things that kind of
made me think that the studies

00:02:57.812 --> 00:02:58.321
incorrect

00:02:58.321 --> 00:02:59.841
I mean isn't there

00:02:59.841 --> 00:03:01.762
but that's the senate really

00:03:01.762 --> 00:03:03.791
one point eight minutes

00:03:03.791 --> 00:03:07.071
that's really that many a laugh a little longer
for you one thing

00:03:07.071 --> 00:03:11.332
I think that that really are other factors
I that that

00:03:11.332 --> 00:03:15.391
I mean I'm with seven point three you didn't
have thought about seventy three

00:03:15.391 --> 00:03:19.711
hopefully the but the to do it

00:03:19.711 --> 00:03:24.281
everybody's got cynical without that the Fed
may eleven dollars from stop with that that

00:03:24.281 --> 00:03:25.961
the well

00:03:25.961 --> 00:03:31.301
you like that and that it wasn't three minutes
of the evidence

00:03:31.301 --> 00:03:32.951
the that it

00:03:32.951 --> 00:03:34.201
I'm proud of my people

00:03:34.201 --> 00:03:37.061
I mean her wondered about that

00:03:37.061 --> 00:03:39.461
you go get 'em and hang in there

00:03:39.461 --> 00:03:41.071
you too

00:03:41.071 --> 00:03:46.321
and in a city where out wondering what university
did the study it happen

00:03:46.321 --> 00:03:47.761
energy tax

00:03:47.761 --> 00:03:49.312
print about

00:03:49.312 --> 00:03:52.812
well the idea I I haven't heard that you see
there as years or

00:03:52.812 --> 00:03:54.101
