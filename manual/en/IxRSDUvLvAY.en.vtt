00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.970 position:56%
You're watching Visiting Yellowstone

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.830 position:94%
One of the most amazing aspects of Yellowstone National Park

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:13.550 position:97%
is the sheer size of this place. The park consists of 2.2 million acres.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.850 position:75%
To reach the wildest sections of this ecosystem,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.470 position:98%
the National Park Service has developed a 1000 mile trail system.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:25.640 position:97%
Walking in to this American treasure comes with opportunities and dangers.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.360 position:86%
To highlights the rewards and to minimize those dangers

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.120 position:94%
visitors can take advantage of the many resources available.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.470 position:98%
This website is a good place to start, but maps, books and the Park Newspaper

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.370 position:98%
should also be used. When you arrive in the park, ask a ranger at a visitor

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:46.890 position:98%
center or ranger station for the latest updates on conditions and restrictions.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.270 position:98%
Permits are required to spend the night in Yellowstone’s backcountry.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.050 position:97%
Those permits must be obtained from a ranger station or visitor center

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.450 position:97%
in person and no sooner than 48 hours before your trip will begin.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:04.090 position:92%
There is not a fee associated with these backcountry sites.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.860 position:97%
There is a fee to reserve sites. Contact our backcountry office by mail.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.040 position:98%
That information can be found in this website’s Backcountry Trip Planner.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.270 position:98%
There are no permits needed to day hike in Yellowstone, but visitors need

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.110 position:98%
to take many of the same precautions that overnight campers take.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.550 position:97%
The entire park is wild and you may encounter wildlife along the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:29.010 position:66%
way and all wild animals can be dangerous.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:33.380 position:98%
Park regulations require humans to stay 100 yards from bears and wolves

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.820 position:58%
and 75 yards from all other wildlife.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.280 position:83%
Those distances are just guidelines and to be honest,

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.820 position:97%
a grizzly at 100 yards in the backcountry can seem way to close.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.940 position:95%
Be extra cautious and enjoy all wild animals from a distance.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.980 position:95%
If you cause them to alter their behavior, you are too close.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.740 position:91%
We recommend that hikers carry Bear Pepper Spray with them

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.930 position:94%
in the backcountry. You can learn more about pepper spray by

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.420 position:92%
watching the video on the Trip Planner page of our website.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.890 position:97%
It is the knowledge you carry with you that is most valuable in this wilderness.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.840 position:97%
Know what to do to avoid surprising a bear and how to react if you

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.420 position:89%
do have a sudden encounter. Hike in groups and make noise

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.670 position:98%
while you walk. Clap your hands and talk with your fellow hikers.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.790 position:94%
Hey bear, hey bear, is a good way to let the animal that may

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.610 position:67%
be over that rise know that you are coming.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:30.860 position:72%
The point is to avoid surprising wild animals.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.900 position:97%
Keeping clean camps and lunch spots are a couple more ways to avoid trouble.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.300 position:95%
Never leave food or packs unattended, even for brief periods.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.750 position:88%
Always hang your food and cooking items when not in use.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.040 position:98%
All odorous items and the clothes you cook-in should be hung as well.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:54.120 position:98%
If you do spot a bear, back away or reroute around so you don’t disturb it.

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.040 position:97%
If needed, turn around or wait until the bear leaves the area.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.850 position:80%
Never run from bears; it could cause them to chase.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:04.950 position:75%
Remember, all black bears and some grizzlies can

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.310 position:69%
climb trees so that is not always an option.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.590 position:83%
Your best choice is to avoid them in the first place.

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.560 position:89%
If you find yourself having a close and sudden encounter,

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.890 position:91%
and you can’t slowly back away, quietly stand your ground.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.690 position:97%
Avoid eye contact and quick movements. Bears sometimes bluff charge,

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.600 position:97%
but once they realize you are human they veer off. Again, don’t run.

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.580 position:91%
If a bear is about to make contact with you, lie face down

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:37.400 position:81%
with your hands covering your neck and remain still.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.110 position:81%
Avoid any movement until the bear has left the area.

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:45.840 position:95%
When it is safe to do so, leave the area and contact rangers.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.090 position:69%
Never approach carcasses in the backcountry.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.970 position:98%
If you find bear signs like scat, diggings or other markings in

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:56.430 position:69%
your designated campsite, change your plans.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.790 position:98%
Go to one of the nearby campsites or find a safe place to spend

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.160 position:97%
the night if needed. Report the bear activity as soon as possible.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.640 position:97%
Rangers need to know if a bear is frequenting a campsite or trail.

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.280 position:67%
The next hiker’s safety could depend on it.

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:17.140 position:98%
Another way to stay safe in the backcountry is to avoid cliffs and overhangs.

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.160 position:77%
Falls and slips injure more people than wildlife.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:24.610 position:94%
It’s best to stay on designated trails and make sure someone

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.810 position:89%
knows where you are hiking and when you expect to return.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.170 position:83%
All hikers should also be ready for changing weather.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.210 position:78%
Yellowstone is famous for afternoon thunderstorms.

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:38.140 position:88%
Ask rangers about any stream crossings you may encounter

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:42.800 position:97%
on the trail you choose to hike. Respect the water, both hot and cold.

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.050 position:98%
By entering this wilderness prepared, you may discover why this

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:50.210 position:94%
park is considered one of America’s most spectacular places.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:57.050 position:98%
You may find that the reward is in returning safely from a Yellowstone adventure.
