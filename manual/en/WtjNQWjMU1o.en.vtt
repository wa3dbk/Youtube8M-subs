"Suika"

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.780
"You need to explain something like that earlier"

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.150
"Ahaha, sorry"

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.810
"I'll buy you a drink when you get back"

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.280
"Can we call it even with that?"

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.610
"Jeez"

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.450
"And? Where am I supposed to go, and do what?"

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.650
"If it's about the vengeful spirits"

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.450
"Why don't you go ask the head of that big mansion over there?"

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.450
"She might know something"

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:32.980
"*sigh* how annoying"

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.980
"See you later, Yuugi~"

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.150
"Let's drink together another time~"

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.780
"Yeah! Can't wait"

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.480
"She really is a strange one"

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.950
"Who is?"

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.180
"Ohh?"

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.950
"Oh, it's you, Parsee"

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:52.610
"No, I'm talking about Suika"

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:54.980
"That talking orb?"

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:58.780
"Is she the weird oni Yuugi was talking about who left the Former Capital?"

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:00.650
"That's right"

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.650
"I thought maybe she wouldn't come back again"

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.310
"Huh, she really is strange"

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:08.310
"In the shape of an orb, and plus together with the shrine maiden"

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.280
*paru paru*
"In the shape of an orb, and plus together with the shrine maiden"

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.480
"Yeah"

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.780
"And"

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:14.910
"yes"

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.910
"I think she--"

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.210
fell in love

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.150
with a human

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.810
