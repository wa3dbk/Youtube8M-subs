00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:10.080
I'm going to show you how to rig a drop shot.
Basically I'm going to start out with 8 or

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.309
6-pound fluorocarbon line. Anything more than
8 pound line becomes extremely hard to  manage

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:21.340
on a spinning reel. So 6 or 8 pound line and
I use Seaguar InvizX and that works well for

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:28.340
me. For a rod I recommend anything from 6'10
to 7'. i personally like a little stiffer

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.090
rod when drop shooting. However, I know a
little softer rod is popular as well. You

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.090
just need to find out what works for you.
This is a IRod Air Series, 6'10 medium action.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.360
I'll just a take a size 1 or 1/0 Owner Mosquito
hook and I'm going to tie palomar knot. But

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:58.440
what you want to do is make sure you give
yourself plenty of tag space for your leader.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.490
Now it's important when tying the palomar
knot to make sure that the knot snitches down

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:17.580
properly. You don't want the lines to cross
one another; you want them to run parallel.

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:24.580
So that way the line won't cut into itself.
When it seats perfectly like that you're not

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:33.570
going to have an issue with it. Now take
that tag end of the line and stick it back

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:40.570
threw the eye of the hook from top to bottom.
What happens is when you pull that it's going

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.450
to make you hook stand out at a 90-degree
angle from the line and that's exactly what

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.830
you want.

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.830
Then take your drop shot weight, this is a
Picasso Tungsten Casting Drop Shot Weight,

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.810
and I always like to tie mine on otherwise
you're going to go threw way to many drop

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.810
shot weights. You're going to lose them in
the rocks or whatever cover you're fishing.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:20.730
You can tie a quick overhand knot, a quick
palomar knot, or whatever you want to do.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:30.830
So once that is done you want to rig your
bait. There's a few keys to rigging a bait

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.650
that is going to help you out. With this Yamamoto
Shad Shape or anything type of bait that you're

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:42.650
nose hooking what you don't want to do is
go from the bottom straight out the top like

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.790
that. What that is going to do is cause a
lot of line twist when you reel in the bait.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.440
Cast after cast it's going to cause problems
with you're equipment throughout the day.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.010
So what you want to do is take your hook point
threw the bottom of the worm and you want

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.040
to come straight out the nose just like that.
It may not seem like a big difference, but

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.930
it's not going to cause this bait to spin
as much, and it's not going to twist your

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:15.849
line up near as bad. Plus I feel like i get
better hook up percentages with this style

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:19.019
hooking method as well.

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:25.629
So basically there you have it. That's your
drop shot rig. To touch on a few other things

00:03:25.629 --> 00:03:29.260
that might help you out. Traditionally most
people nose hook these baits. But there are

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.760
a few other things you can do depending on
what type of cover you're fishing. If you're

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:38.260
fishing extremely thick cover whether it be
brush piles and your constantly getting snagged

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:44.760
up. Just go ahead and rig it Texas style to
keep it weedless. It's still going to get

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.760
bite, but you're going to be able to fish
it through the cover much easier. Another

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.099
presentation that I really like to do that
really shines in pressure situations is wacky

00:03:55.099 --> 00:04:01.879
rigging. Here's a 5' Yamamoto Thin Senko and
what I'll do is I'll just skin hook it right

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:06.810
in the middle of the body like so and you've
got both ends working for you. It seems like

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.810
whenever there's a pressured bite this technique
tends to shine. So try these out and I think

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:16.180
they'll help you catch more fish on the drop
shot.
