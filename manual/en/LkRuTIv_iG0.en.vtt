Hi guys, this is Eva from Bay Harbour Med
Spa.

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:17.150
Someone sent an email and asked me if I believe
that diet has something to do with our skin

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:24.230
or do I believe that our diet, what we eat,
has an affect on our skin.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:29.960
So first of all, I will tell you, Yes.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:39.870
I'm going to explain to you a little bit more
in detail why I think diet is so crucial in

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.620
the way our skin is.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:51.550
There's an old saying from where I come, you
are what you eat and it seems to be quite

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.230
true.

00:00:53.230 --> 00:01:02.569
Now note that there is a direct correlation
to let's say if you eat a cheap steak or you

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:04.989
drink a cheap glass of wine.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:07.790
No, that's not what I'm talking about.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:19.740
What I'm talking about is about the fact that
our insides are directly correlated to our

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:21.030
outsides.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:34.441
So when our body is overloaded with sugar
or our body is overloaded with red meat or

00:01:34.441 --> 00:01:44.470
our body is not able to eliminate properly
or our liver which is our biggest organ and

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:51.060
a part of our skin and our liver is coated
and overloaded and our gallbladder is overloaded

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:59.119
and we cannot, the organ, the liver cannot
filter properly cause it's overloaded with

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:10.790
yeast and with sugars, with so many bad things
that we put in our system that that effect,

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:20.550
actually, that happens in our organs inside
then actually reverses and makes changes in

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.660
our skin.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.730
So when we are congested inside, our skin
will be dull looking.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.360
When you are constipated and you don't go
to the bathroom, it has a lot to do with your

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.190
diet.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.580
Your skin will be ashy looking and dull, unhealthy.

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.860
There will not be life and color.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:50.150
So this is how food is so extremely important
what we eat and so yes.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:03:00.510
Food has a link and is effecting our skin.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:05.900
So what I would say , if I was asking, if
you guys would ask me, and say, "Eva, what

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.489
do you suggest my diet should consist of.

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:18.030
Okay, the first thing that I would say is
stay away from meat.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:19.220
Red meat.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:24.860
I am a big advocate against meat, so stay
away from red meat.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:32.530
If you have to have meat, have chicken.

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.860
Have turkey, have fish.

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:37.480
But don't eat red meat.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.709
Guys, I swear to you.

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:42.610
I categorically can tell you from my patients.

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:46.340
From my clients that I treat here in the clinic.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:54.079
People who excessively in the summer, whatever
it may be who start eating meat, their skin

00:03:54.079 --> 00:04:01.280
becomes so horrible, so ugly when you eat
so much it's like it becomes unhealthy and

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:02.319
becomes thick.

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.819
It's just an unhealthy skin.

00:04:05.819 --> 00:04:15.140
But if you eat a balanced diet and if you
eat a lot of raw vegetables, fruits, if you

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:26.940
eat legumes, if you eat seeds, if you eat
good fats, if you eat cashews, walnuts, almonds,

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.320
preferably raw.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.410
Sesame seeds.

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:42.880
If you eat healthy fats you get protein from
them and you take supplements then, and only

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.080
then will you benefit.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:52.419
You allow your skin to benefit from the food
that you eat.

00:04:52.419 --> 00:05:00.350
I would suggest...you don't have to but this
is something I...oh and another thing, gluten,

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:05.250
eat gluten-free, whatever you can buy gluten
free is great.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:06.710
Great for the skin too.

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:12.620
I would suggest that you read on the internet
or inquire.

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:21.220
I many, many years ago read a book, and I
reread it recently with my daughter, it makes

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.139
so much sense you know, "The Liver Cleansing
Diet".

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:35.840
It was written by Australian liver cleansing
specialist Doctor Sandra Carbot, I think it's

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:45.340
C-A-B-O-T and I think you can find it online
it's The Liver Doctor or Sandra Cabot if you

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:51.660
just put in... get her book, get "The Liver
Cleansing Diet" book because that will explain

00:05:51.660 --> 00:06:01.380
you everything you need to know about everything,
about the process...what happens to our body

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.960
from inside and then how it affects our outside.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:15.660
So yes, as a general rule and as a general
answer if food definitely diet affects the

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:24.800
end results of our skin and you can observe
it yourself that when you change your diet

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:31.770
it becomes much worse not immediately but
maybe three or four months later you start

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:34.950
seeing changes in your skin.

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:36.250
Why you see the changes?

00:06:36.250 --> 00:06:41.320
Not because of the food itself because of
the liver, because the liver cannot filter,

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:48.440
it cannot process, it's congested, your lymph
nodes are congested and then you pack it,

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:52.400
pack it, pack it and then it has to explode,
it has to come, somehow again.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.310
It comes out of your skin and pores.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:05.060
And it will change the texture of your skin
and at times, your diet can also stimulate

00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:13.190
or change certain hormones in your body and
those can be responsible for sugar, for your

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:18.610
pancreas, for diabetes, for excessive weight
and so forth.

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:23.470
So it is very complex, so in a simple answer.

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:31.349
Diet, health, what you eat, not losing weight
but diet, the food that you consume has a

00:07:31.349 --> 00:07:34.440
lot to do with your skin.

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:41.780
So as I said, I'm not being paid any commission
by this doctor, he just said, I bought the

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:46.630
book about twenty twenty-five years ago and
we recently reread it and, you know, sometimes

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:53.270
but then you reread it and you say "Oh my
God, yes, this makes sense.

00:07:53.270 --> 00:07:56.090
And it didn't necessarily make sense twenty-five
years ago.

00:07:56.090 --> 00:07:57.560
It makes sense now."

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:59.199
This is why I talk about it.

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:02.129
So guys, until next time, thank you.

00:08:02.129 --> 00:08:04.770
Keep on asking and I will keep on answering.
