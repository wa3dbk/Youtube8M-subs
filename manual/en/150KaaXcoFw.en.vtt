00:00:01.169 --> 00:00:07.579
I want to show you one of Mac OS X "Lion"'s
new features and why I don't think it's such a

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:09.199
good idea.

00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:11.329
I have

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:14.429
an SD card inserted into my iMac.

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.930
This card is from my video camera.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:22.890
Here is a video from the camera which
if I double-click on will open in

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.990
QuickTime.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.869
So, let's pretend we've watched the video.

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.120
Close the window there. And now I'm done with this
card so I want to eject it.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.480
So...

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.580
I eject the card.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.710
But it doesn't work. It says:

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.110
"One or more programs may be using it."

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.170
Well, I don't have anything running except
LaunchBar

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.930
and I don't think it could be LaunchBar
but we'll quit that - maybe?

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.060
No, that doesn't seem to have helped.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.400
Now at this point

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.640
You might reboot because you think, "Well
there's no applications running, something must have

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.260
gone wrong."

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.680
But I wanted to find out what was going
on.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:09.600
We can use a command-line tool called

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.390
"lsof", which stands for "LiSt Open Files".

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.060
And I know that the card is called "CAM" so we can
say "show me only open files that have

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:22.799
CAM in the name".

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.630
And here we can see

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.350
at the end of the list is my video
open by QuickTime.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.810
Well that's a little bit confusing isn't it
because

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:35.110
QuickTime's not running - don't see it on the
dock.

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.680
But we can check using the Activity Monitor.
This is a built-in utility that let's us check

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.200
to see exactly what's running on this machine.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.650
And...

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:49.870
There it is: Quicktime Player.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.390
So what you are seeing here is a new feature
of Lion where the icons on the dock don't

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.680
necessarily represent what's actually
running.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.610
Icons can be hidden

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.980
or in fact icons can show that
application is running even when it

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:08.329
isn't. It works both ways round.

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:12.369
I guess the reason that Apple have done this is because
they're trying to make it more like iOS.

00:02:12.369 --> 00:02:16.579
It's not important what applications are
running because the operating system

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.609
will manage things for you.

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:24.879
But in some circumstances it is important
because I can't

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:26.759
eject this disk now.

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:31.040
And I can't quit QuickTime, because QuickTime
isn't on the dock.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:38.040
If I actually force QuickTime to quit
like this,

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.919
and then tell it to try ejecting the disk
again,

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:46.650
it works perfectly.

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:49.799
So, clearly there's a problem here.

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.659
Obfuscating the status of the running
applications on your system

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.129
from the user

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:56.089
is not always a good thing.
