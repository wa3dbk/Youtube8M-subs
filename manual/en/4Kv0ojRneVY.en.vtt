00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.490
- Welcome to
Southwest Yard Garden.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:05.444
I'm John White.

00:00:05.444 --> 00:00:07.860
Today, we're going to be talking
about some tree problems.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.710
And as you see behind me,
we have an open trench

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.000
and some plant
material that has died.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.390
And one thing that we
run across occasionally--

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:18.240
and we get different
calls on it--

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.210
is gas leaks.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.920
And this is an example of a
very large natural gas leak that

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.860
happened in this landscape.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:27.840
And we were looking at why some
of the plant material died.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.100
And we started looking around
and could smell a little odor

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.760
and had the city come out
and make an inspection

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.080
and did find a gas leak.

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.780
So let's talk about
natural gas leaks

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.460
and what it does to
landscape material.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.084
So we'll go over and take a look
at some of the plant material.

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.550
Here we have a
Mexican elder tree

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.550
that has succumbed to
the natural gas that

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.320
was trapped
underneath the plastic

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.940
and moved through the soil.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.930
Depending on the type of
soil, its physical makeup,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.690
how well it's
compacted, all makes

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.370
a difference in how this gas
will move through the area.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.250
And of course, having
the plastic on it--

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.490
which we don't recommend
around landscape material--

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.260
it helped to trap the gas in it.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.500
So basically this plant has
suffered from lack of oxygen.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.080
And this is-- this tree is dead.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.590
So it's going to
have to be removed.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.770
But you can see it just fried
it with the leaves on the tree

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.230
so it was a very quick--

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.430
quick death in this instance.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.240
So again, we'll take a look
at some more plant material.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.100
Here's an Indian Hawthorne
that was damaged again

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.634
with the natural gas leak.

00:01:42.634 --> 00:01:44.800
You can see we've got quite
a bit of foliage burned.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:47.280
We do have some
live tissue here.

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.280
So now the problem's
been detected,

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.740
you know, we'll try and
get the soil aerated,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.800
get some air into it, get
the gas out of the soil.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.500
And we'll trim the bush
back-- any dead branches--

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.700
go ahead and take those off.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.710
And hopefully, we will
maybe get some regrowth.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.670
And maybe this bush
will go ahead and be OK.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.910
As we look down the line,
there are several plants

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.050
that are completely dead.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.600
Those are going to
have to be replaced.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.530
And when we're looking at how
to reclaim an area after it's

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.560
been damaged by natural gas,
we want to open the area up.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.670
You know, we're going to need
to take the rock and the plastic

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.970
and stuff like that off,
get the area opened up.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.630
We may need to till the ground
to really try and get the gas

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.780
smell out of the soil and
try and get a microorganism

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.900
population going again.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.490
And once we do that, then we
can go ahead and plant back

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:39.510
into it.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.570
But that gas smell
may be very shallow

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.810
or it could be very deep.

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.590
So it's going to require a
little bit extra work just

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.270
to make sure that's done there.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:53.910
So this is kind of what a
natural gas leak situation

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.290
kind of looks like.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:02:58.160
Best thing to do is to know
where your gas lines run.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:01.590
If you are having plant problems
near those gas line areas,

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.220
then you do want to call
the gas company out.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.834
They do come out, especially
if it's a leak type situation,

00:03:07.834 --> 00:03:09.000
they'll come out very quick.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.310
They have
sophisticated equipment

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.820
to detect whether
there is a leak in it.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.610
And if there is, then
they'll shut it off and take

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:18.730
care of the problem there.

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.630
So again, just odd situations
that we run across.
