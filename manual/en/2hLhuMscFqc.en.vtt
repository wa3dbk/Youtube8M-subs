00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:09.090
The Ogallala Aquifer is underneath eight states
in the central U.S. and it covers approximately

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.910
170,000 square miles.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.470
It's the water source for the bread basket
of the U.S.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.369
We've got a little over a million acres of
irrigated cropland, and a lot of these wells

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:27.670
are dropping off.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.211
We are starting to deplete the aquifer, you
know, it was hey we got water, this here will

00:00:32.211 --> 00:00:33.780
last forever.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.070
Well, no, it's not going to last forever.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.370
Water is the life blood of our area.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:53.270
Without the water that we have underneath
us, it would be like farming a desert.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:00.160
Our operation has grown since I first arrived
in Moore County in '79 to 8,500 acres.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.460
We're predominately all corn.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.670
I'm Harold Grall, I'm a farmer in Moore County,
in the north Texas panhandle.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.659
It has been a great life.

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:19.130
This is what I consider my calling in life,
being able to farm.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.090
Thing have changed dramatically over the years.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.460
When I first got here, we had abundant water.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.619
Then we got in the 90's and the weather started
changing.

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.720
And especially in the 2000's, it seemed like
the weather was a lot more volatile.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:41.700
But it hadn't been till since 2007 that we
seen commodity prices on the rise that farming

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.350
has proved to be very profitable for us.

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:53.950
As farming has become more profitable we're
seeing more developed all around us.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.720
So with all this new demand in our area the
water is dropping off a lot more quickly in

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.799
season.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.060
"Okay this is our source well."

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.290
So it's a huge challenge, here we are, we're
trying to leave water behind for the next

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:14.860
generation and at the same time maintain profitability
for our existing operation.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.950
There's a sense of urgency here.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.620
We can't be stopping and waiting two or three
years before we start acting.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:30.379
When we're coming out to work with these guys
usually they've contacted us and have a problem.

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.340
I'm Mike Caldwell, I'm the district conservationist
with the NRCS in the Lewis field office.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:42.400
The area that we cover is big.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.989
We have a drive a lot of miles to see these
guys and to be out in the field with them

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:54.170
to know what's going on, and I think there's
no substitute for being on the ground.

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.170
"How much water do y'all have here?"

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.290
"We have 2,400 gallons."

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:06.069
We probably spend 90% of our time assisting
producers with irrigation projects: replacing

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:11.549
pipelines, doing nozzle conversions where
we can lower those drops -- those sprinkler

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.900
drops -- down into the crop canopy.

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.051
And if you have this thing in spray mode you're
going to have water spraying up in the air,

00:03:19.051 --> 00:03:23.549
and between the sunshine and the wind blowing,
you're going to lose a lot of your water.

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:28.580
Harold's real innovative and he's open to
adopting new practices.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.560
He does a lot of no-till and strip till farming.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:37.780
NRCS plays a big part in this by giving us
a funding available to be able to expand like

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:43.439
our demonstration project.

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:47.459
What they're trying to do is show they can
grow somewhere in the neighborhood of 200

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.849
bushels of corn on 12 inches of water.

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:56.689
And Harold's field that's in this project
is in an area that's pretty low on water.

00:03:56.689 --> 00:04:00.450
And just looking at the field the last few
days the corn looks good.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.989
If they can get it to dry down and get it
harvested, it'll be interesting to see what

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:05.989
the yields are.

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:10.750
Looks like the yields are going to be a little
bit higher than last year.

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:17.489
These guys have done some things that they,
their practices, they've done them for years

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:19.729
and it's hard for them to change.

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.750
And I think that's, that goes with anything.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.360
But a lot of these guys, I think necessity
and, you know, just seeing their neighbor,

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.970
he's doing some good things, so they're, you
know, it's coming around.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.580
These producers know that the aquifer is depleted
and they know they need to use the water in

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.860
the most efficient manner that they can.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:51.251
Probably over the last six years we've started
growing quite a few acres of cotton, and it's

00:04:51.251 --> 00:04:56.620
a plant that's not using as much water and
they can rotate with other crops and include

00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.480
cotton in that rotation.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:03.960
Dave Ford is one of our more progressive farmers.

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:10.349
I'm David Ford, I'm a third generation farmer
in Moore and Hartley Counties.

00:05:10.349 --> 00:05:17.711
Cotton is a crop that will respond to a little
bit of water at the right time will make an

00:05:17.711 --> 00:05:19.889
awful lot of difference in what it will yield.

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:22.970
And it doesn't have to be a whole lot of water.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:29.330
We're having to learn that if we're going
to continue to farm in this area under irrigation

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:32.819
we've got to change the way we're doing things,
and we are.

00:05:32.819 --> 00:05:37.199
I've gone to using strip tillage.

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:41.590
We don't till the ground and rip it like we
used to.

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:47.080
We used to plow the ground so many times it
looked like a garden.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.789
With strip tillage we leave an awful lot of
organic matter on the ground which helps keep

00:05:51.789 --> 00:05:53.729
the water from running off.

00:05:53.729 --> 00:06:00.180
"Yeah there's still some moisture in it."

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.920
A week ago my grandson was going to church
with us and my wife asked him, "What do you

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:06.920
want to do when you grow up?"

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:10.960
He said, "Well, I want to farm"
And she said, "Well, what if you can't farm?"

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.970
He looked at her and kinda frowned like, "But
I want to farm."

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:20.910
You know, we got to be better stewards of
what God made and what we got because there's

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:22.639
not gonna be any more of it.

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.919
The Natural Resources Conservation Service
helped these guys improve their efficiency

00:06:27.919 --> 00:06:34.720
and they're doing everything that they can
to get the most use out of every drop.

00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:38.380
We talked about water conservation, and that's
a nice word, but when it comes right down

00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:44.190
to doing it and doing it at the extent that
we need to now, we can't do it by ourselves.

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:46.319
We gotta have that helping hand out there
to help us do it.
