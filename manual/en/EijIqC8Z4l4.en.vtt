Hey 
it's Shaunell from Pretty Hair is Fun, and

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.830
this week's Tuesday Tutorial is going to be
a Waterfall Twist Braid.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.000
We love waterfall braids, they are everywhere,
and I love this new version of the waterfall

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
braid, it's gorgeous.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.590
And so I think you'll like it too!

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.939
It's very simple, and we'd love to show you!

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.440
A couple of new things: We are going to have
a giveaway coming up soon,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.120
and also be watching for time stamps on our
videos!

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.700
You can look down below in the description
box and it will tell you when certain things

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:41.700
are happening in our videos.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.750
So if you want to rewatch a video, you forgot
something, and you don't have to watch the

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.070
whole video again, just look for that particular
sections timestamp.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.729
So look for those, we'll be putting them on
all our future videos, and we'll get started

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:58.670
on our Waterfall Twist Braid.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.900
You ready?

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:09.210
To begin this hairstyle, do a side part, and
then begin your twist waterfall braid on the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.760
big section.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:20.910
After you've combed it smooth, just take this
section of hair in front of her ear, and split

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:30.750
it in half, and then take a smaller third
section,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:40.890
cross it over, so it's in the middle, then
take your left side, cross it over,

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.340
take your right side, and twist it over.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:50.159
Then drop this section (left most), and hold
on to these two (right two).

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.490
Then continue on.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:03.270
When you bring this new hair in, I'm going
to take a small section of it and add it to

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:22.319
the left, before I cross it over, and then
twist.

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:31.190
Take the hair .....the reason I'm adding to
it, is so that this piece that I'm wrapping

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.440
around, so that it doesn't run out of hair
by the end.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:46.400
So just add a little bit to extend that out
a little, and twist.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:03:01.350
And 
just continue on around the head,

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:21.790
I'm just taking a little section and adding
it to it, to extend it out, and just continue

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.340
on.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:49.180
Now when you get up here to the front with
your waterfall braid, you can decide where

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:51.320
you want to end the braid.

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.910
I'm going to end it behind her ear, so I'm
going to pull this front section in as my

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.280
last section.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:21.220
And then, I'm going to braid this a little
bit like a regular braid.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:29.169
You can braid this down, and elastic it off,
and pull up this hair and tuck the braid under

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:32.479
and bobby pin it.

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:35.860
That's one way to end the braid if you like
that.

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:58.400
I'm actually going to elastic it off here,
as a second option, using a clear elastic.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:08.900
This is a waterfall twist braid.

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.820
She has a few layers, poking out a little
bit.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:14.499
Those are easily hid.

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:19.039
Just go through and readjust all of your sections.

00:05:19.039 --> 00:05:25.430
You can use bobby pins to pin these.

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:32.309
We've curled her hair a little, to show off
the effect (of the braid).

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:37.830
That is a Waterfall Twist Braid.

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:41.389
Beautiful!

00:05:41.389 --> 00:05:52.090
