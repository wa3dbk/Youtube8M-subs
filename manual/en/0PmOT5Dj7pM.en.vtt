00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.990
My name is Keri Blair,
and I'm a senior artist

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:07.160
with MAC Cosmetics.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.190
For me, makeup is an
expression of creativity.

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.110
And it's kind of
like an accessory

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:14.962
that you get to change up
every single day depending

00:00:14.962 --> 00:00:17.420
on how you're feeling and what
your personality is that day

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.080
and who you want to become.

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.360
I travel a lot.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:22.730
And also by the time
I leave my house,

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.250
I really don't have any other
time to mess with my makeup

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:26.790
during the day.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.840
So for me, using products that
have a lot of wearability,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:31.640
like our Pro
Longwear Collection,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.540
tend to really be a lifestyle.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.010
We have this beautiful sort
of dusty mauve Pro Longwear

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.670
Shadow.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.020
And I'm just pressing
this on with a flat brush

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:43.160
just onto my eyelid.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:44.960
And I've prepped my
canvas a little bit.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.830
I think that's really
the key to Pro Longwear

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:50.300
or to anything being
longer wearing is prepping

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.380
your canvas a little bit.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.680
So I used one of our Paint
Pots and a soft beige tone

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:55.940
and applied that first.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.493
And now I'm using
the same brush.

00:00:57.493 --> 00:00:58.910
And I'm just going
over my eyelids

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.000
with this beautiful
dusty mauve shade.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.447
I think after you to work
for a brand for 16 years,

00:01:04.447 --> 00:01:07.030
you learn how to trust it, and
you learn how the products work

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.680
and how they read on your skin.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.860
And for me, the quality of the
pigment, they're jet-milled,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.270
they're soft, they're
easy to apply,

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.200
and I find them very easy to
work with and great to layer

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:25.230
on top of things.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:28.710
So for me, when
you're an artist,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.530
it's all about your
tools of the trade.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.560
And these shadows are
tried and true for me.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.870
Generally, I find that I get
six to eight hours of wear.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.720
So if I'm leaving my house
at 9:00 in the morning

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.300
to get to work or get to a
photo shoot or what have you,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.467
I don't really have to think
about my makeup anymore

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:48.130
until I get home to take it off.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.297
And I think that speaks
volumes for the wearability

00:01:53.297 --> 00:01:54.880
and the flexibility
of these products,

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.990
because the face moves.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.590
We smile, we wink, we blink, we
talk, and everything's moving.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.570
And the products not
only have to be durable,

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:03.960
but they also do flexible.

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.300
You know, a girl can't live
without black eyeliner,

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:07.260
just saying.

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.479
So I have to do a
little bit of black just

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.687
around the bottom of my eyes.

00:02:11.687 --> 00:02:13.020
I tend to be a little bit drier.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.510
And maybe it's from the
traveling or from where I live,

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.760
but I like to add a little
bit of Moisture Infusion

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.090
into my foundation just to
give it a little extra umph.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.680
And it gives it a really
nice creamy texture as well.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.070
So I'm just going to mix this
up on the back of my hand.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.028
It's actually a product
that you would normally

00:02:28.028 --> 00:02:30.270
use before your moisturizer.

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.130
But for me, I like to add
it into my foundations.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:35.910
And I don't really
ever put anything

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.080
on my face just straight.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.510
I always mix a little
something or layer things.

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.715
It's just the method to
my madness, if you will.

00:02:42.715 --> 00:02:44.340
And again, I'm going
to use the sponge.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.100
And I'm just going to start
in the center of my face

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.540
and work the product out.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.640
And what I love about
it is that it gives you

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.720
this really hydrated look, but
you still get that longwear.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.940
My fingers and I have
an understanding.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.780
Going right back into
this awesome pink

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.170
I can't seem to get enough of,
I just let the shape of my eyes

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.460
and the bone structure dictate
where the makeup's going to go.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:15.550
And I'm just creating
this round hollowy eye.

00:03:15.550 --> 00:03:17.450
It's soft.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.940
It has sort of a
dusty quality to it.

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:23.140
But the hues of them are
just so wearable for anyone.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.140
Someone as fair as I am can
wear this sort of ochery color.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.770
And yet, someone with a deeper
skin tone can also wear it.

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.300
And I love that versatility.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.340
I love the flexibility of
pigments and of textures

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:40.540
that MAC has to
offer to everyone.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.530
So for me, mascara's like
the magic wand of makeup.

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.480
And I am really digging on
that Opulash Mascara right now.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.310
As you can see, I can
keep layering it on,

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:53.185
and my lashes don't get
clumpy, and they just

00:03:53.185 --> 00:03:55.468
get longer and bigger.

00:03:55.468 --> 00:03:57.010
So what's really
cool about these Pro

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.770
Longwear products is that
we now have them in blush.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.710
As a girl who's a bit fairer,
it can be really challenging

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.640
sometimes to find blushes
that don't look too bright

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.350
or are too pink.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:11.020
And this one is
the perfect peach.

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:13.270
I'm going to use it with
round brush and sort of start

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.420
high on my cheek bone
and work into my hairline

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.390
and then down onto my face to
create a really beautiful shear

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.560
wash.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.380
What's great about having
a Pro Longwear product

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:28.637
is that it really slims
down your makeup bag.

00:04:28.637 --> 00:04:30.220
You don't have to
carry so much stuff.

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.012
And I can tell you
living in New York, that

00:04:32.012 --> 00:04:33.833
is a really big deal.

00:04:33.833 --> 00:04:35.750
Not everybody has a car
to keep everything in.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.317
So it's nice to
have fewer products.

00:04:37.317 --> 00:04:38.650
You don't have touch up as much.

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.150
For a girl on the go,
it's the perfect solution.

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.410
So we finally came out with
these great Pro Longwear

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:48.660
Lipglasses that are
saturated with color,

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:53.620
that are really comfortable to
wear, and that last for hours.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:54.930
These Glasses are really nice.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.763
They just give you the
right amount of shine

00:04:56.763 --> 00:04:58.200
and creaminess and the texture.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.130
Then in eight hours,
I will look just

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.720
as finished as I do right now.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.220
Bye.

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:09.270
