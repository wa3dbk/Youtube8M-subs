Hi. On behalf of Expert Village, I'm Reno
at Reno's Music Shop in Camp Verde, Arizona,

00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:10.810
and I'm going to tell you about flatpicking
guitar. Let's do a little bit of Beaumont

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:18.650
Rag. It's in the key of C, but it starts on
a G chord. I'll play some chords through so

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:48.090
you can get the timing of it. Maybe I'll hum
the melody. That's the chords, one time through.

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:53.239
Typically, the guitar player will play it
twice through. The mandolin player will play

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.079
it twice through. Back to the guitar maybe
or over to the fiddle. It doesn't matter however

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:21.479
you set things up. We just roll with the flow.
Now the melody is starting in G, G-7. So,

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:36.920
we go. That was one time through. Now the
B part, which is also the same as the A part

00:01:36.920 --> 00:02:11.050
in this particular song, is. Notice those
mistakes? I kept on going. Here's an ending

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:48.760
I like to use for that song. There are just
three diminished chords to a G. Work on that,

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.510
there's all kinds of variations. Don't just
play what I did because some of that was not

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.670
very good.
