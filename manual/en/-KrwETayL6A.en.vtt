00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.840
I'm Fraser Cain, the publisher of Universe
Today.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:09.580
Everyone knows that the Moon goes through
phases, but let's talk about why it does.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:15.170
It comes down to illumination, which in this
case, all originates from our nearby star.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.770
Our Moon orbits around our planet, and this
Earth-Moon system orbits around the Sun.

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.000
Even though we only see light on part of the
Moon, from the perspective of the Sun, half

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.720
of it is always illuminated.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:35.300
Stuck here on Earth, we see the Moon in various
phases of illumination as it completes a 28-day

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.050
orbit around the Earth.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.930
As The Moon travels around us we see it pass
through its phases.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.980
It goes from New Moon, to Full Moon and back
to new Moon again.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.230
Crescent Moons are when it's less than half
illuminated, and gibbous when it's more than

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.230
half.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.059
"Waxing" means that the Moon becomes more
illuminated night-by-night, and the term "waning"

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.309
means that it's getting less illuminated each
night.

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:05.320
If you ever get the chance to travel to the
other hemisphere, you'll immediately notice

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.890
how unfamiliar the Moon behaves - it's upside
down.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.909
If you live in the Northern Hemisphere, after
a New Moon the crescent begins on the right-side.

00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:20.470
But if you're in the Southern Hemisphere,
it's reversed, with the illumination starting

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.870
on the left side.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.590
Weird.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:31.490
The alignment of the Sun, Earth and Moon can
lead to some fantastic astronomical events.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.530
One event occurs when the Moon is full, and
it passes through the Earth's shadow.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:41.600
Or as you probably know it, a lunar eclipse.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.880
This causes the Moon to grow dark and then
turn an eerie red color.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.170
When the Moon is new, it can pass in between
the Earth and the Sun, casting its shadow

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.000
down on our planet.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.340
As you know, a solar eclipse.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.979
You'd think we would see a solar and lunar
eclipse every month, but we don't because

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.420
the Moon's orbit is inclined relative to the
Sun.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.009
Most months, the Moon is either above or below
the Sun in the sky, so they just don't line

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.910
up perfectly.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.730
One more thing, you might not know that Venus
also goes through phases.

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.420
When the planet is on the other side of the
Sun from us, we see it as a nearly complete

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.630
disk.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.610
But when Venus is on our side, just about
to pass into the glow of the Sun, it's a thin

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:31.980
crescent, just like how we see the Moon.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.769
I hope this gives you a better understanding
of why the Moon goes through its phases every

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:42.640
month, and the interesting relationship between
the Earth, the Sun, and the Moon.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:57.730
Thanks 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:09.360
for watching.
