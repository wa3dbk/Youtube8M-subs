00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:07.040
hey what's up guys this is Doug from Carson Optical and
today we're going to check out an

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.600
innovative new adapter for the samsung
galaxy s4 that turns your onboard camera

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.060
into a powerful LED microscope. most
high-powered microscopes need to be

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.220
plugged into an outlet and are too bulky
to carry around. the micromax plus is

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:23.570
battery operated,

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.720
light enough to travel with you wherever
you go and has a sixty to a hundred

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:28.460
times magnification

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.810
this particular model is designed to fit
the samsung galaxy s4.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.250
 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.960
this device is not only fun but
educational as well. who wouldn't want

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.370
the ability to take microscopic images
and video of virtually any object?

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:46.370
it's even great to see fine details and
simple household items

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.860
just clip the adapter onto the back of
your phone then attach the included

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.280
MicroMax right onto the adapter.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.090
once you've decided what it is you want
to magnify place the MicroMax directly

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.170
over the object then use the included
zoom and focus knobs to achieve the

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.400
desired magnification then tap the
screen to get the sharpest view possible.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.970
 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.460
you can even use the micromax by itself
without any need for an adapter or phone.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.990
the whole reason behind designing the
MicroMax Plus it's because we wanted to

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.909
give people a high-powered microscope

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.840
that's sleek and portable enough to
bring with you anywhere. we're constantly

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.009
getting calls and reviews from people
who love using the MicroMax Plus. we have

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.600
farmers call and say they were using it
to inspect bugs on crops, teachers using

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.300
it on their students to check for lice

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.240
and also people just calling and saying
they were using it while hanging out

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.440
with their friends. there are really no
limits to the MicroMax Plus and the best

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.860
part is you can document it all on a digital
photo album.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.300
you can also look at translucent slides
and semi opaque objects.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.140
 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.000
I love the onboard LED light feature
with an ultra-bright LED bulb placed next

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.380
to the objective lens,

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.190
you never really have to compensate for
any poor lighting. the special placement

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.360
of the bulb allows for a completely lit
surface and crisp bright images.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.640
you'd be surprised how simple objects
can really come to life underneath a

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.720
microscope. with the MicroMax Plus you
can make new discoveries every day and

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.459
share them with your family and friends

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.560
I'm Doug from Carson and i'll see you next
time

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.560
