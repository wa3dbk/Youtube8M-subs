00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:21.779
hi everyone! A lot of you have been commenting on my
recent Instagram post saying that you

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:23.510
liked my manicure

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.150
thank you so much but if he didn't know
I actually do my own

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.619
DIY gel manicures at home the first
time I bought all the stuff it seemed a

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:32.689
little expensive

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.420
but in the long run you actually say save
a lot of money because every time you

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.829
go to the nail salon a gel manicure
is like 50 to

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.780
a 100 bucks in Korea at least I don't
know about where you're from but usually

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.129
it's kind of pricey

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.780
so buying the light and all the different
colors of gel

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.780
is pricey the first time you do it but
actually in the long run it's like

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.629
hundreds of thousands a manicures you
could be doing and you can save tons of

00:00:56.629 --> 00:00:57.079
money

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:01.649
plus you get to watch whatever
indulgent trashy TV you wanna watch

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.939
drink a tea or glass a wine and do your
nails

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.490
in your pajamas and you don't have to
leave the house and you save money

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.360
are you ready lets get started

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.340
let's do it lets go these are the most
basic items you need to do a gel manicure

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.310
the key item you'll need is a lamp
to cure the gel

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.080
I prefer LED versus UV because it's
faster and seems to be safer for your

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:28.759
hands

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:32.549
lamps can range in price between 20 and
100 dollars so shop around for the one

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.909
that's right for you

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.829
the essentials are special base gel and top coat

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.500
the other thing you need is a gel
cleanser but don't use expensive ones

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.799
just use rubbing alcohol it's exactly the same thing

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.729
for the manicure I am doing today I've added a few more

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:47.380
items to the basic kit

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.039
this is totally optional but if you want to
keep your manicure longer you can use a

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:52.869
dehydrator or gel primer

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.320
I'm cheating here in using the base coat
made from natural water-based nail

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.610
polish. I find it works just as good

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.840
I'm using a different color gel polish
for each of my nails

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.670
you can simply just use one. just find
the color that complements your nail

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.360
stickers

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.340
f.y.i if you want to remove your gel nails
so this is what you need

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.760
I start by cutting up some cotton pads
and then filing the top of my top coat

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.549
so that the remover can sink in

00:02:16.549 --> 00:02:20.440
cover each nail in the remover soaked pad and
wrap in aluminum foil

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.690
leave on for about 10 to 15 minutes
time to watch the TV

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.099
once time is up the gel should be soft and
you can scrape it off

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.220
file your nails into whatever shape you
like push back your cuticles

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.010
then lightly but the shine off your
nails this will help the gel stick

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.769
properly

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:41.549
with the rubbing alcohol use a lint-free
pad, I'm just using a strong paper towel

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.010
wipe the dust and oils after nails

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.970
again this is an optional step brush on the
dehydrator and let air dry

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.200
start with your base gel and apply a thin
coat on only four fingers

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.670
we're going to do the thumbs later cure in the lamp for about 45 seconds

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.569
or however long your gel instructs

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:03.350
this is your chance to have a drink. now
the fun begins!

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.109
apply different color to each nail
remember to always use thin coats

00:03:08.109 --> 00:03:12.829
otherwise your nails will end up messy and
uneven as well as get hot in the lamp

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:16.930
cure again here for 45 seconds

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.819
apply the second coat and repeat

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:24.829
cleanup any uneven or spilled polished before
you cure because it'll be hard as a rock after

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.280
to finish your basic gel manicure apply
your top coat

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.980
and cure

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.050
with your alcohol or cleanser wipe off
the sticky residue left behind

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.940
so that's it that's your basic gel
manicure minus the thumbs

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.480
but we're gonna take it one step further
with nail stickers

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.780
find the ones that complement your
manicure colors and carefully peel them off

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.000
and stick them on I always recommend to
have them facing down

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.290
upside down to you but facing out for
everyone else the to see

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.460
seal everything in with a final top coat

00:03:57.460 --> 00:04:01.580
and then of course wipe off the
residue

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.310
now that done all you have to do is
repeat the same steps on your other hand

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.100
I recommend changing up the orders of your nail colors and using different

00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:12.340
nail stickers to give each and every nail a unique look

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:16.360
think of them as mini
canvases for your art

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:19.890
finally we can get to our poor neglected thumbs

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.740
use whatever color you missed from
the other fingers and repeat the same steps

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:29.280
with the thumbs you can cure both at the
same time

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:30.340
finish up with the cuticle oil or hand cream and your done

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:34.040
mine are not perfect but
I'm getting better every time

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.260
and they're so much cheaper
than going to a salon

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.420
if you try it please take a photo and tag
me I would love to see your mini art

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:45.900
so that's it I hope you like this
