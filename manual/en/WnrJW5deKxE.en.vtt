Waterloo? Everyone fits in here -- no matter what you're looking for.

00:00:10.707 --> 00:00:13.590
I love that the city has such a student vibe.

00:00:14.516 --> 00:00:17.414
I love the small-town feel of Uptown Waterloo.

00:00:17.414 --> 00:00:22.249
There are so many unique shops and places to explore.

00:00:22.571 --> 00:00:28.368
I can take the iXpress bus or walk to 
 Uptown Waterloo in less than 20 minutes.

00:00:32.302 --> 00:00:37.682
For me, it's the coffee shops-- especially during exams.

00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:42.139
Death Valley's Little Brother has the best coffee in town

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:45.307
There's nightlife too. Hands down, Beta is my favourite nightclub.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.707
They bring DJs from all over the world. It's amazing!

00:00:49.707 --> 00:00:53.956
Plus there's all sorts of bands and music festivals throughout the year.

00:00:53.956 --> 00:00:56.718
One of my favourite things about Waterloo is the farmer's market.

00:00:56.718 --> 00:01:00.303
Yeah, definitely the farmer's market! People come from all over to shop here.

00:01:01.836 --> 00:01:07.684
The food is straight from the farmers so you know 
 it's fresh! And it's great for a student budget.

00:01:07.684 --> 00:01:11.537
Every fall Waterloo is home to North America's largest Oktoberfest.

00:01:11.537 --> 00:01:19.833
It's a week and a half of German culture, and you can go 
 to any fest hall eat, drink, dance and have a great time.

00:01:19.833 --> 00:01:24.148
Waterloo Park is a nice place to relax. My friends and I 
 like to come here and throw a Frisbee around.

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:29.778
Plus there's nice trails, a skateboard park, and a mini zoo.

00:01:30.532 --> 00:01:37.251
After a day of classes, I like to grab my bike 
 and hit the trails. They're great for biking or jogging

00:01:37.251 --> 00:01:42.210
With nearly 50,000 university students, Waterloo has one of the youngest populations in Canada.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.570
There are more than a thousand technology companies here -- 
 and start-ups being created all the time

00:01:49.214 --> 00:01:54.188
It's a great place to launch your career. It's a great place to live.

00:01:54.188 --> 00:02:01.260
It's my home, my home, my home, my home, 
 my home, my home, Waterloo-it's my home.
