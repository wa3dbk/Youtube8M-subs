Dorothy Braids

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.400
Hi guys! It's Bailey from Cute Girls Hairstyles, and it's October time! Hallelujah!

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.220
Which means I get to pull out all of my pumpkin spice stuff, 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.940
like my pumpkin spice candles, and my pumpkin ice cream, and my pumpkin chocolate chip cookies,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.680
Hallelujah, I get to make those! And also it means it's time for the hashtag #CGHSpooktorials!

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.700
The Spooktorial I'm going to show you guys how to do today are the Dorothy Braids,

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.840
that Dorothy wears in "The Wizard Of Oz". And I remember dressing up as a little kid

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.040
wearing the Dorothy outfit, and even the sparkly shoes, and wearing braids very similar to these.

00:00:58.048 --> 00:01:02.428
And as you can tell from my outfit, I'm kind of, like, flashing back to when I was wearing that outfit,

00:01:02.428 --> 00:01:04.368
and I'm wearing the Dorothy outfit all over again. 

00:01:04.368 --> 00:01:07.480
So, I'm really exited to show you guys the braids, and let's get started!

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:11.600
To begin this tutorial, I just curled my hair, and then parted it in the middle, 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.320
and then I pulled one side out of the way, so we could work on the other half.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.800
So, to start off, I'm going to take the very top of my half, and begin twisting it very tightly,

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.240
and you're just going to want to add in all of your hair.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.753
 It's going to look very tight at the very beginning,

00:01:25.753 --> 00:01:29.306
but after we do this, we will be loosening it up a little bit, so it's ok.

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:36.120
So continue to twist it all the way down. Get all of your hair inside one twist.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.360
Make sure that it's very tight, and then once you get to the bottom, you can go back and pull it, 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.580
and loosen it up a little bit, so it doesn't look so tight and flat against your head.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:56.840
And, then, you can also pull the hair behind the twist as well, so it looks a little bit looser and softer.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.700
Once you finish loosening up your twist, umm, split your twist into three parts,

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.520
and you have to be very careful on this part, because your twist can come out very easily

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.220
if you don't hold it right. If this is difficult for you, you can always just rubber band it, 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.900
and then braid it, and cut the rubber band out with some scissors.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.040
So I'm going to split my twist into three sections...

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.480
and then I'm going to begin braiding.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.140
When you're braiding, only braid down to about where your collarbone is, 

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.060
because that's where she wears it in the movie, 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.660
and then once you get down to the collar bone, take your rubber band, and rubber band your braid.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.740
Once you finish rubber banding your braid, you can always go back and pin your twist if it feels loose,

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.540
or if you see any spots you dislike, and you can also pancake your braid a little bit, 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.620
to make it a little bit looser and softer.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.900
Once you finish your braid, for the last touch of Dorothy, were going to tie a ribbon at the end of our braid.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:28.220
In the movie, Dorothy wears blue ribbons, but because we thought the red matched my outfit a little bit better,

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:30.180
I'm going to be using red ribbons.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.080
And, now, I'm going to go ahead and do the other side.

00:03:51.901 --> 00:03:54.301
And now it's time for the final spin!

00:03:58.073 --> 00:04:01.333
Don't you guys love these braids? I absolutely love them! 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:04.640
