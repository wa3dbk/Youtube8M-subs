00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.421
Okay, before we get into specifics, let's
just do a quick review of all the cymbals

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:08.080
that are kind of out there, the ones that
I may not have here today, but they are an

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.620
option for you to use. The ones that I do
have, let's start with those. What I'm holding

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:20.901
here is a crash cymbal, and this is a crash
cymbal as well, and this is a ride, and this

00:00:20.901 --> 00:00:26.030
is used much like the high hat, it's used
for keeping time, and the crashes are used

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:32.469
for accents, just hit them, make a great noise,
very loud, which I like. And this, of course,

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:39.149
is your high hat, we had a segment about that
right before this. And basically we'll go

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:45.600
into components of this particular crash cymbal.
So with most cymbals, not all of them, but

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.440
most of them, are much like the high hat because
it looks like the high hat, just a lot bigger.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.389
And this whole outside part is called the
apron. It makes a much different sound than

00:00:55.389 --> 00:01:00.989
the inside, which of course is called the
bell, just like the high hat. And this crash

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.979
is a different brand, a different style than
this, but the same components. They both have

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:10.810
an apron, they both have the bell, they both
make a distinct noise. This, the ride cymbal,

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.350
same thing, you've got your apron, you've
got your bell, but rides generally are a lot

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.609
bigger, wider, and they're a little more dense.
So you don't have a wide crash sound as you

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:29.200
have more of a pingy, a really bright pingy
sound that will stand out from crashes, and

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.229
it's used, again, for keeping time. So, like
I was saying earlier, when you buy a cymbal

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.719
it's a pretty good investment because they're
not cheap, if you get a pretty expensive one.

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:43.369
I tend to like the brand Zildjian, because
I've been using it all my life, they rarely

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.679
break and if they do, you usually get a refund
because Zildjian, they stand by their products,

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:53.510
it's a really nice company. So one thing you
want to do is keep your cymbals clean, mine

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.240
are average, they could be cleaner. But some
people that have had cymbals for years tend

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.319
to not clean them, they like them dirty, for
some reason it gives, it's like a really warm

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:07.420
tone, so it's really, it's whatever you want,
because it's your cymbal, you do as you want

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:13.950
with it. So I'm going to put this on the stand,
take off the wing nut, and usually your cymbal

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:21.069
is going to be sandwiched in between two cushions
and on the actual metal itself you've got

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.140
a plastic protector so the top of your cymbal
doesn't split, so always make sure you have

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.930
one of those on your stand. It's very important
because your cymbal will vibrate and it will

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.709
crack, and it's very bad. So then you put
that on, put your top cushion on, and then

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.689
cinch down the wing nut, and then now the
amount of space that you let your cymbal move

00:02:41.689 --> 00:02:48.629
is all up to you. I like mine to move pretty
freely because then the sustain is longer,

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:51.769
the sound doesn't get cut off as much, so
that's about where I like them. But make sure

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:55.440
the wing nut doesn't vibrate off during the
show so make sure it's nice and tight. And

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:01.930
this is about the same, and once you have
your cymbals set up, then we can move on to

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:02.440
actual playing.
