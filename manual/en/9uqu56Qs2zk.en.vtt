Kid President: I'm gonna talk to Uncle Joey
from Full House!

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:13.389
I hope I don't mess it up!
Sometimes I say things but I don't know why!

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:18.939
Like a few weeks ago I got invited to a conference.
There were 13,000 people there.

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:24.910
I was on stage and what did I ask those guys?
Tripp: Is there anything you'd like to ask

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.840
us?
Kid President: Yes.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.779
Tripp: Oh you do?
Kid President: Do you toot?

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.070
Tripp: Tyler?
Tyler: Tripp does!

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:41.070
Kid President: Do you toot? What's my deal?
So today I'm going to play it cool.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.309
Phone, connect me to Dave Coulier from Full
House!

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:57.000
Dave Coulier: Hi! Hi Kid President.
Kid President: What's up?

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Dave: Oh, I'm supposed to talk in here.
Kid President: Yay!

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.080
What was it like to be in Full House?
Dave: Oh I loved being on Full House. In fact

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.260
all those people I was on Full House with,
all my fellow actors we're all still really

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.010
great friends!
Kid President: What ever happened to predictability?

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:21.010
The milkman, paperboy all that stuff.
Dave: They all ended up in the Full House titles.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.850
They're all in there. They're all trapped
in that song forever.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.080
Kid President: I think it's cool when you
do funny voices. Can you do one now?

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:35.500
Dave: Sure let's see! We had an election this
year and I think we should have just appointed

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.520
Chris Rock like in that movie Head of State.
I like to do a

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.000
[in Chris Rock's voice] Chris Rock impression.
The way you do a Chris Rock impression is

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
you never ever touch your lips together!
Kid President: [laughs] That was one funny

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
voice!
[imitates Dave]

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.040
[thunder]
That sound? It means it's time for the lightning

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:05.960
round!
Cupcakes, aren't they great?

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.030
Dave: Best food on the planet.
Kid President: Is this Internet thing here

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.560
to stay?
Dave: I think it's going to be around for

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.610
at least a couple more weeks.
Kid President: Jeans, are they too skinny?

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.240
Dave: Way too skinny on people who are way
too large.

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:24.760
Kid President: Okay, this is really important
to me. Let's say there was a coupon and you

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.760
really want to get it. What would you do?
Dave: I'd snip it out with some scissors.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:40.600
Kid President: No, let's say there was gum
and it's really stuck in your hair, how would

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.720
you get it out?
Dave: Hey wait a second there are you trying

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.560
to get me to say "cut it out"?
Kid President: Maybe...

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:51.080
Dave: You mean like this like,
Cut

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.230
It
Out?

00:02:53.230 --> 00:03:00.230
[cheering and applause]
Kid President: He said "cut it out"!

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.500
Just went nuts people, just went nuts!
I lost my questions!

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.950
Can't find it!
Where is it?

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.460
Kid President don't do it.
Dave Coulier don't do it.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Don't ask it!
Don't ask it!

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Do you toot?
Dave: What's that?

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.610
Kid President: Do you toot?
Dave: Do I toot?

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:35.000
Excuse me for just a second Kid President.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.270
[toot sound]

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.800
Kid President: Of course you do!
Dave: I had to go fix something over there.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:53.410
Kid President: I think I learned a valuable
lesson! At first I thought I should never

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:59.000
ask that question, but now I know you do toot!
You're human, just like me!

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Dave Coulier you're the best! Let's dance!

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:19.000
[music]

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:27.250
I love Full House, I watch it every night!
Dave: Thank you buddy!

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:31.800
Kid President: Wasn't this great? Today's
challenge, sometimes you have to cut it out!

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:38.690
What do you need to cut out? Maybe it's asking
weird questions. This guy. The new year approaches

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:44.740
what will you cut out? Share your responses
below. I especially love video responses from

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:51.320
you guys! Be nice down there okay? My mission
is to help people change the world! Kids and

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:55.000
especially grown-ups! We can do it! When you're
lost out there and you're all alone,

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:03.000
there's a light waiting to carry you home everywhere
you look. Shibbitty-bop boo-wow.
