00:00:01.492 --> 00:00:04.249
- [Voiceover] Hi, this is
Paul Solt from iPhone Dev TV.

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:06.287
I'm going to show you how
get started with Xcode,

00:00:06.287 --> 00:00:08.212
which is the application
that we'll be using

00:00:08.212 --> 00:00:13.150
on Mac to create our
iPhone apps or Mac apps.

00:00:13.667 --> 00:00:14.945
Now the first thing that
you're going to need to do

00:00:14.945 --> 00:00:17.104
is download Xcode if you haven't already.

00:00:17.104 --> 00:00:21.055
So let's go ahead and go to the app store.

00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:22.586
What you can do here
is you can just search

00:00:22.586 --> 00:00:24.451
for Xcode in the top
right, so let me highlight

00:00:24.451 --> 00:00:27.341
the mouse here, and if
you just type in Xcode

00:00:27.341 --> 00:00:29.931
you'll find Xcode along
with some other development

00:00:29.931 --> 00:00:34.604
tools that work on development type stuff.

00:00:34.604 --> 00:00:35.709
We're not going to get into that.

00:00:35.709 --> 00:00:37.074
We're just going to look at Xcode.

00:00:37.074 --> 00:00:40.258
So I currently have Xcode
installed right now.

00:00:40.258 --> 00:00:43.956
It's a 2.18 gigabyte
download, and all you have

00:00:43.956 --> 00:00:46.025
to do is click this button
and it will install it.

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:49.525
So this is free to
install, and it will take

00:00:49.525 --> 00:00:50.885
a little bit of time to download depending

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:52.312
on your internet connection.

00:00:52.312 --> 00:00:55.209
Now right now this is
Xcode five, so you can see

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:56.464
the version number here.

00:00:56.464 --> 00:00:59.066
This is going to change
when IOS eight is out.

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:00.879
It's going to be Xcode six.

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:02.288
So let me show you right
now how you can get started

00:01:02.288 --> 00:01:07.181
with Xcode six, which will allow you to do

00:01:07.181 --> 00:01:10.154
Swift development for IOS eight.

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:11.878
All right, so what I'm
going to do here is I'm

00:01:11.878 --> 00:01:16.360
just going to search for
Swift, and then Xcode.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.333
If I do something like
this, you're going to see

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:20.274
this first result, which is Swift Overview

00:01:20.274 --> 00:01:21.831
from Apple Developer.

00:01:21.831 --> 00:01:23.557
You click on this.

00:01:23.557 --> 00:01:25.166
This is the development blog

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:26.296
and introduction to Swift.

00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:29.059
So here you can see an
overview, on this tab right

00:01:29.059 --> 00:01:32.941
here they have a blog that
goes over different topics,

00:01:32.941 --> 00:01:34.368
and then you have the resources section.

00:01:34.368 --> 00:01:36.846
So this is where you can get Xcode six.

00:01:36.846 --> 00:01:40.960
Now this is going to be
updated, so when it is

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.485
released you'll get the latest version,

00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:44.205
you can read the release notes here.

00:01:44.205 --> 00:01:46.731
It is in beta right now,
so that means it's not

00:01:46.731 --> 00:01:48.824
100% working all the time.

00:01:48.824 --> 00:01:51.112
There's certain issues that
are still being ironed out,

00:01:51.112 --> 00:01:53.944
but once it's out of beta
with IOS eight's release,

00:01:53.944 --> 00:01:57.387
this will be a very good thing to download

00:01:57.387 --> 00:01:58.900
and to start making your apps with.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.815
So let's go ahead and hit download.

00:02:00.815 --> 00:02:02.655
When we do this, it's
going to ask you to log in.

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:03.766
Now I've already logged in,

00:02:03.766 --> 00:02:05.540
so I don't need to do that again.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.952
You may need to create a Apple account,

00:02:07.952 --> 00:02:09.547
and then it's going to
start downloading this.

00:02:09.547 --> 00:02:12.019
So it looks like if we
look at the download size,

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.005
this is 2.46 gigabytes
that it's downloading.

00:02:15.005 --> 00:02:19.130
Now I'm on a very fast
academic internet connection,

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.130
so this is going at nine
megabytes per second.

00:02:25.497 --> 00:02:26.764
So you're probably not
going to get this type

00:02:26.764 --> 00:02:28.495
of download, so for me it's really quick,

00:02:28.495 --> 00:02:30.329
for you it's probably going
to take an hour or two

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:32.273
to download depending on your internet.

00:02:32.273 --> 00:02:35.633
So I'm going to stop
that right now, and we're

00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:38.603
just going to jump over to
Xcode in the next video.

00:02:38.603 --> 00:02:42.679
So this is the place
to start your learning

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:44.907
how to get set up with Xcode.

00:02:44.907 --> 00:02:46.640
All we're going to do is download this.

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:49.969
Once you download it then
you're going to open it up.

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:51.804
It's going to take a little
bit of time to open up,

00:02:51.804 --> 00:02:54.365
so you might need to get a cup of coffee,

00:02:54.365 --> 00:02:56.463
and then when it's ready to go, come back

00:02:56.463 --> 00:02:59.196
and let's start with the next video.

00:02:59.196 --> 00:03:01.897
So thanks for watching,
let me know if there's

00:03:01.897 --> 00:03:03.576
anything I can do to help you make

00:03:03.576 --> 00:03:06.162
your first iPhone app.
