00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:06.450
A new trend right now is wedding programs.
That people are using a program so that your

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.710
guests know what will be going on in the ceremony.
A program like this is very easy to find.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:18.620
Either on-line by buying software or making
it yourself. And you also can order programs

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.670
through an invitation company, as well. If
you do not have the time to do it. The first

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:29.500
thing you really want to make sure is. Do
you have everything you need in your program?

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.129
The first thing is the readings, the music.
And make sure that you have everything typed

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:40.101
out in it. Exactly the way it's supposed to
be spelled. Run a spell check and make sure

00:00:40.101 --> 00:00:46.739
certain things like Handel or Mendelssohn
or certain names of songs are spelled correctly.

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.139
Because that really could put a damper on
it, if people notice that it's spelled wrong.

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:56.210
The next thing is, have your order done the
way you want it done. Certain things like

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.589
the prelude of music, what music will be played.
What the song is for the processional. A reading

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.970
that might be read. A song that you want the
entire congregation to song. And then the

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:12.189
list of everything that will be going on.
Especially, if you're going to use something

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:16.210
like the Lord's Prayer. And it's a different
version, you might want to spell that out

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.500
for people as well. On the back, you want
to include your attendance. Everybody involved

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.899
in the wedding. From the minister or ministers,
the mother of the bride and groom. The fathers,

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:33.950
the grandparents. The escort of the bride,
if it is not a parent. The matrons or maids

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.729
of honor. The Best man, the groom's men, the
usher. And just remember, also include your

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:45.700
musicians names, especially. Because they're
part of your ceremony. And then a little message

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.289
to your guests. For a thank you for attending
and possibly even where the reception will

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:56.799
be. With directions, is also a very handy
thing to do. These are very easy to make and

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.509
low costs. Especially if you do it right.
And just make sure, you take all the steps

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.649
ahead of time to get it correct. And don't
change your order once you have it set and

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:05.859
printed.
