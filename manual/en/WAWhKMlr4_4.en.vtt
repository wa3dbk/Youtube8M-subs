Hi there this is Tamara Leah Orras founder
flirt with me coaching services

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.639
I went to take a few minutes to talk to
you about dating after a divorce

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.240
you know de mi in and of itself can be a
daunting

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.000
thing I work with claims from all
spectrum's %uh relationship

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.160
you know coming out of relationships
coming out of divorces never been in

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.400
relationships and it seems like it

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:25.560
don t across the whole specter of things
but specifically

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.800
dating after a divorce can be very very
interesting so there's a few things that

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.929
I wanted to just

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.559
fifty US as pieces of advice and I think
collapse

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.070
absolutely support where you are right
now so the first is

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.030
I'm you want to check in with your
emotional state how are you feeling

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.770
great now we are are you

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.539
in the you know separation divorce you
moving along with thing is getting back

00:00:49.539 --> 00:00:50.780
into the flow in

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.550
really finding yourself again we're in
that spectrum on

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.469
you know there's a lot of emotional
reactions that come from

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.090
divorces after very bassy know it you
hope for

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.430
everybody's good you guys stay friends
but she leaves in the other category of

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.860
the not so fast rate

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.540
and you could have hurt me anger you can
feel betrayed quite possibly dating after a divorce

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.170
or mebbe you feel hurt that you with
that rare rate so there could be a lot

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.869
different emotions going on around it

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.950
so first just wanna check into your
emotional state

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.170
and see where you are because of you may
think that you're ready to get back on

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.310
the saddle and start this up again

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.540
once you get to know that he may decide
absolutely no hi

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.040
not for you you're not reading you need
some more time okay

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:43.970
so what best things to do in this
instance is actually have a friend with

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:44.310
you

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.740
have a friend that's committed to you
that can support you dating after a divorce

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:52.590
in in this particular and over because
you me think that you're ready and they

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:53.259
would say no

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.049
absolutely no they know you a little bit
better on you may think you're

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.439
absolutely not ready and they know you
better

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.420
and face a 0 yeah you can get back up
there not be a little bit in touch

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.610
rate so how to best friend how to best
buy that can support you

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.800
and really be able to and see where it
is that you want to go

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:16.870
and and really nice you in the direction
you know the gentle nudges that we owe

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:17.459
me

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.830
and here's the next think so and you me
feel hake dating after a divorce

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.379
you who've left out on the love of your
life or that was your Sony and this is

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:27.540
never gonna happen again

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.250
right well here's the good news: %ah so
needs to invest 0

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.280
hey if you look at the world if only
don't invest in actually kinda makes

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.650
that

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.849
their seven billion people on this
planet and I don't think we would set us

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:44.720
ourselves up to have that one person
that were supposed to find

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.700
in this lifetime on who speaks our
language inlets on our content dating after a divorce

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.099
you know that just doesn't seem workable

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:56.640
and if in area so you can take the case
that there's no so it's with that allows

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.430
for you to do

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:00.700
is you could look back at your past
relationship beyond

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.900
was it your so many so there's not a
whole

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.489
le more baggage a lot more hurt that
comes with it right

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:11.730
and there's no pressure that now you can
be DD after 24 social pressure

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.159
that now you're looking for a solo me

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.920
so many sony's s so now once you

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.920
can get to that place where you know
your you look at your emotional state

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.510
maybe you've given yourself some time
some time to heal the past sometimes if

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:29.790
you're hurt feelings dating after a divorce

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.310
then you won't be able to give yourself
permission give yourself permission

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:34.190
actually

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.590
get back on the worst and start dating
again okay

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.860
so you may need to forgive yourself for
the things that you did in that

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.049
relationship then

00:03:42.049 --> 00:03:45.530
and move on but its okay it's okay to
move on its okay to give yourself

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:46.250
permission

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.440
to start dating after a divorce so now I
wanna talk to you about what

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:54.290
what dating after divorce actually
provides you so providing NCO

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.909
with practice okay if he had been years
for decades since the last time you went

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:59.510
on a date

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:03.439
so you've gotta start somewhere you
probably don't have a whole lot of

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:06.459
and brain patterns for this

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:10.049
if it has been so long so you have to
create new friend patterns

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:13.379
so much you give yourself the room to
practice

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:17.220
right to just go on a couple days maybe
it's lunch you get coffee dating after a divorce

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.560
me it's happy hour and give yourself the
room

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.229
to float K I'm going to anticipate that
it's not going to be perfect the first

00:04:25.229 --> 00:04:25.770
go-around

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.110
and because it happens a lot but ass

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:32.169
sir practicing as you do this more often

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.639
you can get comfortable meeting new
people and not actually

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.550
X search experience answer to navigate
the flow of dating after a divorce

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.699
yes there's a floaty and you'll start to
experience it along the way

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:47.949
and thing that I think

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:51.880
dating after divorce can really provide
you with it can provide you with a lot

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:57.280
cleary okay so you may not know what it
is that you want in a partner what you

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:58.300
like in Upper

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:01.789
or maybe you're very clear about it and
so once you start in you'll be able to

00:05:01.789 --> 00:05:02.840
see it or not yet

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.690
but I'm not assert that you know if you
were married a long time dating after a divorce

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.009
that you may not actually know our
viewers particularly exactly what it is

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:12.610
