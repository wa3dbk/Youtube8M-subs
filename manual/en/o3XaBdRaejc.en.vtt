00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:07.910
I'm going to show you how to use a chocolate
mold.

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:10.349
You could choose any
mold that you like; they sell the plastic

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.700
ones in a lot of stores.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.500
This is
a nice heavy mold, and you can see it's really

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.730
beautiful, a nice shape to
it.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.360
I'm using little hearts, just because why
not use hearts?

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.390
If you want to have a little fun with your
homemade truffles, I'm using a

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.860
little bit of gold dust, a little luster dust,
and I'm just going to gently

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.190
tap right into my mold with a little bit of
luster.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.600
This way when I go to
take out my truffles, they're going to have

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.149
a nice shiny, golden touch to
them.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:42.750
They're going to look really beautiful.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.659
I'm just going to do that on
some of them, maybe about half, and the other

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:48.960
half I'm just going to leave
plain.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.350
Make sure when you use your chocolate molds,
they're really nice and

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.350
clean.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.379
Take a nice soft towel and really rub them.

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:57.969
Make sure there's no
little bits of anything stuck in there that'll

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:02.579
keep your chocolates from
coming out nice and cleanly.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.579
That is that.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:05.680
I'm going to take a little bit of tempered
dark chocolate.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.760
Tempering means
that I've melted down my chocolate, and then

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.060
brought down the temperature
so it's nice and cool to the touch.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:17.670
All I'm going to do is pour it right
into my mold.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.850
Just make sure you get all of the indents.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:23.909
It's okay to have
extra.

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.610
If you get any lumps, like I just got, just
make sure you take that

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:29.610
out.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:38.610
You want to really fill it up, more than you
think.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.610
Beautiful.

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.020
I got a little lump of chocolate there.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:43.369
I'm just going to take that out of
it.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.460
All I'm going to do is rap it with the side
of my hand.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.539
You're going to
see it's going to totally coat all of my little

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.329
crevices, all of my
indents, and I'm also shaking out any air

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:56.079
bubbles that got to the bottom.

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.619
Now for the messy part; tip it over right
back into your bowl, all of that

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.909
extra.

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.820
Make sure if you go on one side you switch
at some point and do the

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:07.820
other.

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.460
Give it a little tap if you have to.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.930
Any extra chocolate comes right
out.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.361
Then all I'm going to do is take my bench
scraper, and all of that edge, we

00:02:20.361 --> 00:02:22.300
don't want any of those edges in there.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.371
Make sure you get all of your molds
covered, and then with my bench scraper, just

00:02:27.371 --> 00:02:28.680
scrape the top.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.700
You could see
it's nice and clean.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:33.700
That is it.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.900
We have our chocolate molds Part 1.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.030
When
what I'm going to do is, I'm going to let

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.220
this chill so the chocolate I put
in gets nice and firm.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:43.290
I'm going to fill it, and then we're going
to top it

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.040
off with one more layer of chocolate.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.710
I'm just going to pop these in the
fridge for about 5, 10 minutes until I can

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:50.710
touch them and they're nice and
firm to the touch.
