00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.900
The time has come                                                        (DEVIL MAY CRY)

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.020
...And so have I

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:19.980
I'll laugh last cause you came to die

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.100
I'll laugh last cause you came to die                                   (Over there!)

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.320
The damage done, the pain subsides...

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.700
And I can see the fear clear when I look in your eye!

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.360
I never kneel and I'll never rest

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.280
You can tear the heart from my chest                              (My chest)

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.480
I'll make you see what I do best

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.120
I'll suceed as you breath your very last breath

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.080
Now I know how the angel fell

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:57.152
I know the tale and I know it too well

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.500
I'll make you wish you had a soul to sell

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.150
When I strike you down

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:04.310
And send you STRAIGHT TO HELL

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.750
My army comes from deep within!

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:10.650
Beneath my soul, beneath my skin!

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.190
As you're ending I'm about to begin!

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.810
My strenght is pain, and I'll never give in!

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.670
I'll tell you now I'm the ONE to survive!

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.150
You never break my faith or my stride

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.030
I'll have you choke on your own demise

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.590
I MAKE THE ANGEL SCREAM

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.110
