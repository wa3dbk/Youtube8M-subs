Star Wars Battlefront: Blast - New Team Deathmatch
Mode

00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:03.750
Introducing Blast, a new Team Deathmatch mode
in Star Wars Battlefront.

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.650
Hey guys, what’s up, Eian or CyberAce here
and today we’ll be taking a first look this

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:09.760
new game mode.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.300
Now, before I get started with this video
I’d like to ask that if you support the

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.700
Battlefront community you consider hitting
that like button and subscribing to stay up

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.050
to date on everything Star Wars gaming.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:25.750
Today, July 30th, 2015, EA has officially
announced Blast, a close-quarters Team Deathmatch

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.820
based game mode. Now, if you watched my video
yesterday, I predicted the mode to be exactly

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.489
this and now we’ve got the full details
for you on this exciting game mode.

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.319
EA had the following to say about Blast on
the Battlefront website:

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:43.210
When you’re hungry for a classic, challenging
game mode within the Star Wars™ universe,

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.670
there is one obvious choice: Blast.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.730
Star Wars™ Battlefront’s™ Team Deathmatch
mode, Blast, pits the Rebel and Imperial factions

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.300
against each other with intense 10 versus
10 battles. If your team reaches 100 kills,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.350
or are ahead when the 10-minute round is over,
you’ve won. Immediate, addictive, and exciting

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.409
until the very last kill; that is our ambition
with Blast.

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.990
Blast offers a lot of variety both in terms
of gameplay and the unpredictable nature of

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.869
the opposing team. Actual levels within the
mode also happen to hold great variation as

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:13.869
well.

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.180
Battlefront’s Lead Level Designer Dennis
Brännvall also had a few things to say about

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.180
the new game mode:

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.990
“One battle you’ll be fighting within
interior levels on Endor or Sullust. In the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.520
next battle, you might find yourselves among
Tatooine’s dusty canyons, or inside the

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.890
undeniably cool Ice Caves on Hoth. My favorite
is the verticality of Tatooine, fighting by

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.439
the Sandcrawler.”
To keep the action dense in this close-quarters

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:39.430
mode, the Blast maps are not as vast as in
other game modes. You should know that they

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.079
are all specifically designed for the specific
game mode in mind; in other words, these aren’t

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:48.710
just smaller versions of maps used elsewhere.
Brännvall notes that this variation is crucial

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:50.700
and something that can be noticed in other
ways too:

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.810
“Say you've just played Walker Assault mode
on Hoth and then switched to Blast, still

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.259
on Hoth. Thanks to variations in lighting
and time of day, you'll definitely see a difference.”

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.090
As in other Star Wars Battlefront game modes,
the key to success is choosing a hand with

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.390
a weapon layout that suits you and the battle
conditions. Also, you'll find weapon pickups

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.280
strewn across the map, and since there are
no vehicles or Heroes &amp; Villains joining the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.700
fight, the strategic value of these pickups
is quite high.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.770
“Whether you pick up a Droid™ scanning
for nearby enemies or a turret that’ll control

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.970
a zone for you, the pickups can really turn
the tide of a Blast match,” says Brännvall.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.040
“They are not around every corner though,
so keep your eyes peeled.”

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:33.210
EA closes off the article by saying: If you’re
a fan of deadly matches between two teams,

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.380
or if you want to enjoy the core of the game’s
multiplayer mode, jump into Blast when Star

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.640
Wars Battlefront releases across the galaxy
November 17th.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.780
Now, if you saw above, Brannvall stated that
the maps will mostly be interior maps on Hoth,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.800
Sullist, or Endor. With that being said, and
judging by the gear being worn by the rebels,

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.750
I’m going to say that the screenshot we
saw yesterday was likely that of an imperial

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.380
bunker on Endor, but I could be wrong.
What do you guys think? Are you excited for

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.980
the new game mode? Do you think it’s too
generic for a shooter game? Could I be right

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.750
about my map predictions? I honestly think
Blast looks like a really fun mode and I look

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.280
forward to trying it out. Let me know what
you think in the comments below, I read them

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.150
all!
