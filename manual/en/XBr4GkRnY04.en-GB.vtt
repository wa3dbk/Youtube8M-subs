00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.110
- There was a time when the universe was expanding
so rapidly that parts of it were moving apart

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:18.820
from each other faster than the speed of light.
That time is right now. A lot of people make

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.189
a big deal out of the fact that during inflation,
right after our universe burst into existence,

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.480
the whole universe was expanding faster than
light. Now, while that is true, it kind of

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:34.370
implies that the universe doesn't normally
do that, and it does. I mean, if you pick

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:40.079
two points far enough apart in our universe,
you can always find ones that are moving apart

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.750
from each other faster than light. That is
simply due to all of the expanding space in

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.329
between. So our universe is now and has always
been expanding faster than the speed of light.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.680
But doesn't this violate Einstein's special
theory of relativity that says nothing should

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.989
be able to move faster than light? Actually,
no. Relativity says nothing can move through

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.670
space faster than light, but that doesn't
stop space itself from expanding however it

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.360
likes. Now, it was Hubble in the late 1920s
who made the observations of the night sky,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:21.430
which led us to see that our universe is expanding.
The further out in space he looked, the faster

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:29.399
the objects were moving away from us. So imagine
a point so far out there that the average

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:34.860
recession velocity is the speed of light.
I mean, if you think about it, it's going

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.240
to be the same distance in every direction.
So that would form a sphere which we call

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.360
the Hubble Sphere. Everything beyond that
sphere is moving away from us faster than

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:52.180
the speed of light. So common sense would
say we would never be able to see the light

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:57.770
from those objects because of how fast they're
moving away from us. But in fact, this is

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:04.759
not true. We can see those objects. To understand
how this could work, picture a galaxy beyond

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:10.039
our Hubble Sphere. It's receding faster than
light, it's in a super luminal region of space

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.190
from our perspective. So any light that emits
in our direction, will actually be moving

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:24.230
away from us as time goes on. Well that doesn't
sound very promising. But due to the accelerating

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:31.319
expansion of space, our Hubble Sphere is actually
getting bigger. And if it gets bigger faster

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:35.250
than that light can get away, then at some
point that light is going to travel from a

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:40.860
super luminal region of space into a subluminal
region of space, and so it can start making

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:46.700
progress towards us. So we can detect it,
so we can see that distant galaxy, which is

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:53.099
of course now even further beyond our Hubble
Sphere, but we can see its light. We can detect

00:02:53.099 --> 00:03:00.470
that it's there. This is remarkable. In fact,
all of the photons we now receive from the

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.989
first 5 billion years of the universe, they
were all emitted in regions of space that

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:12.940
were traveling, at the time, faster than the
speed of light relative to us. The objects

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:19.250
that emitted them were, are, and always have
been moving away from us faster than the speed

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.390
of light. But their light has entered our
Hubble Sphere and had enough time to reach

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:32.060
us, and so we can see them. So the observable
universe is larger than our Hubble Sphere.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:36.780
It's actually limited by what's called the
particle horizon. That is based on the amount

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:42.740
of time light has had to travel towards us
since the beginning of time, that is 13.8

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:47.580
billion years ago as far as we can tell. Now
because the universe has been expanding and

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.680
that expansion has been accelerating, things
are much further out than 13.8 billion light

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.519
years away. I mean, the observable universe
has a radius of over 46 billion light years.

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:08.401
The diameter is about 93 billion light years.
That is a huge volume of things that we can

00:04:08.401 --> 00:04:14.659
see. And 13.8 billion years ago, everything
in that volume and everything beyond it that

00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:20.510
we can't see would have been compressed into
a tiny infinitesimally small point that we

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:28.610
call the singularity. Actually, no. I mean,
that would be true if the universe is finite.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:36.700
But if the universe is infinite, and it kind
of looks like it is, then it was always infinite.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:42.940
So the big bang would have happened literally
everywhere. But if the universe has always

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:49.130
been infinite, then what is it expanding into?
Well, it doesn't have to expand into anything.

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:56.050
I mean, it can expand into itself. That's
the thing about infinity. You never run out

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:06.580
of it. This episode of Veritasium was supported
by audible.com, a leading provider of audiobooks

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:12.510
with over 150,000 titles in all areas of literature,
including fiction, non-fiction, and periodicals.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.550
This week I wanted to recommend the book Hitchhiker's
Guide To The Galaxy. It's one of my favorites

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.890
and it's a classic of the science genre. You
know, people often ask me, why is the number

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.750
42 on the Veritasium logo? And that's because
it's the answer to the ultimate question of

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:29.350
life, the universe, and everything. So if
you haven't read this book yet, you should

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:33.110
definitely check it out, and in fact, you
can download it for free by going to audible.com/veritasium,

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:37.860
or you can pick any other book of your choosing
for a one month free trial. So I want to thank

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:40.400
