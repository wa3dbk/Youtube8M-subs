00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.309
In this video we are going to describe how
to measure a trailer steel wheel.

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:13.810
I have two examples here one is a 14 X 5-1/2,
5 on 4-1/2 bolt pattern steel wheel.

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:21.970
This other one is a 16 X 6, 6 lug on 5 steel
wheel, and the way to measure to know what

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.690
size it is, on the diameter of the wheel,
in other words what size tire will fit on

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:36.659
this wheel is you want to measure from the
inside to the inside where the bead seats

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:38.899
and protrudes 60 inches.

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:44.289
In other words thats the bead seat to the
bead seat.

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:50.530
You do not want to measure over all length
from edge to edge, okay and to measure the

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.530
width of the wheel.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:57.940
Again you will not want to measure, do not
measure overall because it will show 7 inches

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:58.940
incorrect.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:05.330
You will measure bead seat to bead seat again,
which is 6 inches.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.010
And then on the bolt pattern, there are 6
lugs, so when there is an even amount of lugs,

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.150
you will measure from the center of one lug
directly across to the center of the other

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.150
lug.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:24.160
In this case if we put a ruler on it, it would
measure 5-1/2 inches, so its 6 lugs on 5-1/2

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.390
inches.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.990
The next measurement you would want to do
is the pilot diameter, which is where the

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:33.170
hub from the trailer would stick through.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:43.701
In this case it would measure 4-1/8 inches,
and the reason that is critical is because

00:01:43.701 --> 00:01:54.490
on some trailers they would have a hub with
lug holes that a lug bolt 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:12.129
would 

00:02:12.129 --> 00:05:12.630
screw into.
