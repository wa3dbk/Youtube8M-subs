00:00:03.227 --> 00:00:05.695
&gt;&gt; The President:
For nearly two years, the
Assad regime has waged a

00:00:05.695 --> 00:00:09.094
brutal war against the Syrian
people-murdering innocent men,

00:00:09.094 --> 00:00:11.761
women and children, in
their homes, in bread lines,

00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:13.861
and at universities.

00:00:13.861 --> 00:00:16.361
In the face of this barbarism,
the United States has joined

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:19.161
with nations around the world in
calling for an end to the Assad

00:00:19.161 --> 00:00:23.194
regime and a transition that
leads to a peaceful, inclusive

00:00:23.194 --> 00:00:25.661
and democratic Syria,
where the rights of all

00:00:25.661 --> 00:00:27.628
Syrians are protected.

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:31.227
We've worked to isolate Assad
and his regime; impose sanctions

00:00:31.227 --> 00:00:35.294
that starve the regime of funds;
recognize the Syrian Opposition

00:00:35.294 --> 00:00:37.994
Coalition as the legitimate
representative of the Syrian

00:00:37.994 --> 00:00:42.428
people; call for accountability
for perpetrators of atrocities;

00:00:42.428 --> 00:00:46.394
and provide humanitarian
relief to Syrians in need.

00:00:46.394 --> 00:00:49.795
The relief we send doesn't say
"Made in America," but make no

00:00:49.795 --> 00:00:52.394
mistake-our aid reflects
the commitment of the

00:00:52.394 --> 00:00:53.928
American people.

00:00:53.928 --> 00:00:56.561
American aid means food
and clean water for

00:00:56.561 --> 00:00:58.461
millions of Syrians.

00:00:58.461 --> 00:01:01.328
American aid means medicine
and treatment for hundreds of

00:01:01.328 --> 00:01:05.861
thousands of patients in
Damascus, Dar'a and Homs.

00:01:05.861 --> 00:01:09.394
It means immunizations for
one million Syrian children.

00:01:09.394 --> 00:01:11.861
American aid means winter
supplies for more than half

00:01:11.861 --> 00:01:15.895
a million people in Aleppo,
Homs and Dayr az Zawr.

00:01:15.895 --> 00:01:18.828
And we're working with allies
and partners so that this aid

00:01:18.828 --> 00:01:21.094
reaches those in need.

00:01:21.094 --> 00:01:23.194
Today, we're taking
another step.

00:01:23.194 --> 00:01:27.961
I've approved an additional $155
million in humanitarian aid for

00:01:27.961 --> 00:01:31.094
people in Syria and refugees
fleeing the violence.

00:01:31.094 --> 00:01:35.394
Here, I want to speak directly
to the people of Syria.

00:01:35.394 --> 00:01:38.294
This new aid will mean more
warm clothing for children and

00:01:38.294 --> 00:01:42.294
medicine for the elderly; flour
and wheat for your families and

00:01:42.294 --> 00:01:44.994
blankets, boots and
stoves for those huddled

00:01:44.994 --> 00:01:46.795
in damaged buildings.

00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:49.695
It will mean health care for
victims of sexual violence and

00:01:49.695 --> 00:01:52.294
field hospitals for the wounded.

00:01:52.294 --> 00:01:55.461
Even as we work to end
the violence against you,

00:01:55.461 --> 00:01:58.261
this aid will help address
some of the immediate needs

00:01:58.261 --> 00:02:00.561
you face each day.

00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:03.428
This new commitment will bring
America's total humanitarian aid

00:02:03.428 --> 00:02:08.928
to Syria to $365 million-making
us the largest single donor of

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:12.227
humanitarian assistance
to the Syrian people.

00:02:12.227 --> 00:02:14.828
Today, I also call on the
international community to do

00:02:14.828 --> 00:02:19.328
more to help these Syrians in
need, and to contribute to the

00:02:19.328 --> 00:02:22.161
latest UN humanitarian appeal.

00:02:22.161 --> 00:02:23.928
We're under no illusions.

00:02:23.928 --> 00:02:26.094
The days ahead will continue
to be very difficult.

00:02:26.094 --> 00:02:29.528
But what's clear is that the
regime continues to weaken

00:02:29.528 --> 00:02:31.895
and lose control of territory.

00:02:31.895 --> 00:02:34.628
The opposition continues
to grow stronger.

00:02:34.628 --> 00:02:37.594
More Syrians are standing
up for their dignity.

00:02:37.594 --> 00:02:40.561
The Assad regime
will come to an end.

00:02:40.561 --> 00:02:43.328
The Syrian people will have
their chance to forge their

00:02:43.328 --> 00:02:44.328
own future.

00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:46.761
And they will continue
to find a partner in the

00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:48.761
United States of America.
