hello namaste

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.790
salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session with your VahChef at

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:17.820
Vahrehvah.com. Today we're going to
make a simple tortilla using white flour

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.260
we're going to use whole wheat flour and
all-purpose flour so this is the kind of

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:27.119
tortilla that is widely used for making
burritos, chimichangas or any other

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.850
preparations so far this preparation
we're going to take one cup of whole

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:38.640
wheat flour that is the flour what we
make roti and chapati with, in this add two

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.170
cups of all-purpose flour now you know
mix both this whole wheat flour and

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.100
all-purpose flour that is maida, in this add baking powder and add salt just mix

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.870
it and in this you can add any shortening or even some people add oil but

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.820
i'm going to use what i like to use
melted butter just had melted butter

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.589
and in this add hot water you know to
make this dough we're going to add hot water

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:08.640
I'm going to tell you why and then make
this into a nice dough just the way we

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.200
make our chapati dough if i use the
regular cold water instead of using hot

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.049
water you know while rolling the dough

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.850
it won't roll easily and it'll stretch back
because we're using a lot of maida but

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.799
you know using hot water will make this
rolling this dough very easy. Mix the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:29.700
dough till it is nice and soft; divide them into the portions you like

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.100
you know usually I make my tortilla
slightly bigger and to make tortillas

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.030
is very easy any Indian they always make
some kind of bread at home so take help

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.680
of flour and then roll them into thin rotis, after rolling it thin just

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.079
cook it on both sides till you get a
nice coloring and you know you can make

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.149
a lot of these tortillas and keep it and
you can make them into nice burritos

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:01.350
you know one thing I don't understand, when I was in US i used to hate to eat burritos

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.990
in the stores because the breads used to
always be stale you know there is

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.500
nothing like making you tortillas at home the way I showed, this way your tortillas will

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.410
smell nice and you'll have fresh
tortillas and then for a good burrito

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.300
it is a must to have good fresh
tortillas; so dear friends whenever

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.940
you're making burritos just make a fresh
dough and make tortillas in no time

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.800
