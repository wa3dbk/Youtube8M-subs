00:00:01.821 --> 00:00:09.122
5500 - 2200 B. C. Neolithicum

00:00:09.122 --> 00:00:13.318
The Neolithic people can move about safely within their settlement.

00:00:13.318 --> 00:00:18.862
Having settled, they no longer live as nomads (an important step for mankind).

00:00:18.862 --> 00:00:24.835
They care for their life-stock, and process animal products and crops.

00:00:24.835 --> 00:00:30.438
This is a pre-monetary era. Instead, people are trading goods.

00:00:30.473 --> 00:00:35.542
The Hill serves as a place for shelter, and a cult place for religious ceremonies.

00:00:35.542 --> 00:00:41.851
When being threatened, i.e. by another tribe or clan, people are fleeing to the nearby hill,

00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:45.836
and take shelter in a sort of refuge fort, which is their ritual place at the same time.

00:00:45.836 --> 00:00:51.384
Secret small trails throughout the forest hide the refugees, and serve as additional shelter.

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:55.832
Neolithic people have knowledge of nature and the seasons.

00:00:55.832 --> 00:01:02.071
In the palisades surrounding the ritual place you can see two exits directing East and West.

00:01:02.071 --> 00:01:05.006
People watch the courses of sun, moon, and stars.

00:01:05.006 --> 00:01:08.675
In the valley, people are living with their life-stock

00:01:08.675 --> 00:01:13.484
in so-called naves, sheltered by wooden palisade trenches.

00:01:13.484 --> 00:01:18.020
Already, they have a sort of agriculture.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:24.161
People are no longer mere hunters and gatherers.

00:01:24.161 --> 00:01:26.680
Some are fishermen, some gather berries and edible roots.

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.395
To 98%, the community is self-sufficient.

00:01:30.395 --> 00:01:36.376
A dugout canoe is being built from a single log.

00:01:36.376 --> 00:01:39.083
Children are carrying firewood.

00:01:39.083 --> 00:01:42.961
The contact to the outside world results from trading transactions.

00:01:42.961 --> 00:01:46.402
Surplus goods, meaning goods not needed for self-sufficiency, are being traded.

00:01:46.402 --> 00:01:50.075
Metals or jewellery beads are being bartered for furs,

00:01:50.075 --> 00:01:52.555
whereby, "street"-traders are no outcasts.

00:01:52.555 --> 00:01:56.549
There are larger trading routes all across Europe, already.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.555
A stone cist grave yard next to the settlement bears witness of a burial culture.

00:02:02.555 --> 00:02:07.106
The landscape blends into the river without artificial barriers.

00:02:07.106 --> 00:02:09.896
The river is being utilized to catch food,

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:12.676
for fresh water supply, and for washing.

00:02:12.676 --> 00:02:15.853
A community member is being banned from the village,

00:02:15.853 --> 00:02:19.439
and sent across the furt of the river into the virgin forest.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:23.468
He has offended against group interests. Therefore, he's being outcast,

00:02:23.468 --> 00:02:26.197
rendering him to the mercy of his own

00:02:26.197 --> 00:02:28.932
fate without any shelter and protection.

00:02:28.932 --> 00:02:31.636
In this era, the community was of vital importance -

00:02:31.636 --> 00:02:35.143
with a high probability, he's being sent into certain death.

00:02:35.143 --> 00:02:37.269
The virgin forest is a jungle.

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:41.348
It is considered to be hostile and impervious.

00:02:41.348 --> 00:02:46.525
It means danger from wild beasts, i.e. bears, or even the swamp.

00:02:46.525 --> 00:02:49.145
The forest is a natural threshold.
