00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.970
recently job i did was talking about
violent video games he was talking to

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.599
you and evangelical organization and
they were talking about violence in

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:11.780
video games and whether or not it would
be possible for the federal government

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:17.100
to pass some sort of law that with tax
city ok strike now george identify even

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.499
proposing that they do so but

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:21.550
well answering that question he said

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.460
after laws that would stop us from doing
it andy i would definitely want to see

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.289
some scientific evidence indicating that
these violent video games impact society

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:31.210
a negative way

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.300
uh... but

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.800
there's really no world block to uh...
taxing back video games

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.470
so of course understandably people have
been very very upset about this because

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.020
even now along has not been proposed

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.420
video games are protected under the
constitution there was a supreme court

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.389
case

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:51.769
uh... where the ruling indicated that
video games are protected under the

00:00:51.769 --> 00:00:56.590
first amendment of the constitution
they're considered speech uh... and sell

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:57.650
i think that

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:02.450
you know job i've been saying that isn't
dangerous i think that you know

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.000
there could be arguments made as to
whether or not you could talk to you is

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.140
because he's not saying we could ban
them right right you cannot meet you

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.840
can't ban and there is that would be
able to hear that push everything again

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.140
to uh... quick before we get you in here

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.470
uh... tried to soapbox issues one is you
have to adopt dogs are not by the minute

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.609
that story behind just killing another
dog

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:25.180
and two is this the reason i grew up
playing video games

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.100
after college i worked in electron
extant eternally sold videogames and i

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.630
know that video games do not cause i
don't have anything you play video games

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.080
and exercise that violence asking you
you should some monsters instead of

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.900
shooting real people if videogames
affected what you do idvd mushrooms and

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.770
jumping onto riddles all day long but i
had that did not do that is not one that

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:47.490
makes seven backs you art violent

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.640
television series pilot murai t where
you could live exactly i mean i'd grew

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.649
up watching the violent television shows
in the violent movies annie i can't wait

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.450
to go home every night after work to
watch an episode of breaking bad that

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.369
doesn't make you wanted to mess and that
doesn't make me wanna like turn into a

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.870
method dealer or chemist to make math

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:06.060
he's even saying self

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.220
look it's important to have actual
scientific data to back this outbreak

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.680
because anecdotal evidence is one thing
scientific data is another

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.950
and i know they can barter has actually
pay very close attention to that type of

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:17.640
data

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.079
so tell me what you think

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.170
well there isn't really data to suggest
that

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.829
violent video games with cause violence
in

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:30.099
kids but it seems like this is the
scapegoat topic or form of media that

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.849
they're planning at you could just as
easily as you said play movies or signs

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:36.110
or tv shows

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.730
in the past enacted that haynes code
because they thought movies where

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.060
correcting areas and the comics of
thirty code which make dot com export

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.859
making kids you know

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:51.069
do bad things anxious it's silly i mean
even before they fear was i after in the

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:53.799
wake of sandy hook people were

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.779
wanting to burn video games i can give
burning books which college turned out

00:02:57.779 --> 00:02:59.419
well aside from that

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:01.979
the fumes that come at a burning plastic

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:03.650
but i wanna ask

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.859
what does he think uh...

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:09.369
an extra tax and i think that you gave
his word it let me know when the update

00:03:09.369 --> 00:03:12.629
at the hands of children now people who
are going to buy these games are still

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:13.870
gonna buy these games

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.569
or pyrite them and that hurts the
industry it when hercules and love you

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:19.440
brought up the pirating wait because

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.540
and hiring is already an issue when it
comes to the video game industry that

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.170
you're going to make it even more
difficult for people to get video games

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.509
you know it's it's kind of like what
happens with the drug policy right

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:33.799
you make something for bitten people
wanted more so i i don't see that tax

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.789
acting as a deterrent if anything it's
going to emphasize america's love for

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:42.539
the video game yeah him don't you think
that it's sort of way it's just their

00:03:42.539 --> 00:03:46.279
way of lee means young people because
young people don't care

00:03:46.279 --> 00:03:50.359
that's what they think even those jumpy
actually it's now shown that many people

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:51.880
of all ages play video games

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.290
but the idea is well it's a lot of
people that we may be organs and their

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:57.359
violent it back

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.920
actually covered this a lot on and
they're like

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:01.579
it seems like

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.349
in this is not a medium that's one of
the state by many politicians and

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.529
parents they think like how this must be
the solution to our problems

00:04:07.529 --> 00:04:11.519
another thing i want to think about is
senator dianne feinstein recently uh...

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:15.789
changed forces so to say yeah by
deciding that buyer video games where

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:20.620
the problem after the senate assault
bans special weapons and fell through

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.050
i feel like these politicians just wanna
get their name on some kind of

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:29.580
and that's you know on the books with
maybe the word sandy hook in it

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.419
just so that's there it regardless of
kuwait helps or if it helps at all or if

00:04:33.419 --> 00:04:34.669
it does anything

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:38.419
antonella as i'm looking at this stage
of the intensify and getting tended to

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:42.870
do exactly what happening right now
inevitably animated right

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.220
his nose subways under control because
your go ahead

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.460
and even cramped up dot i remember
playing grand theft auto with my brother

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.510
like on the computer uh... and here's a
dollar years ago and that didn't make me

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.060
wanna don't do any contacted o the

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:03.169
honorable and and we're

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:08.000
yes it's just so rediculous we are
giving dated all day with my lineage is

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.820
sort of get one thing

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:13.860
that you think is the cause of all this
or that you contracted to disappear

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.389
is just insane look at that is a device
there's so many there's so many other

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:22.320
issues that you can focus on if you
genuinely concerned about the mental

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:25.300
health of americans right

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.970
that i got everyone stopped doing work
on one side that my god that's what he

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:30.330
did it is bloody

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:37.330
but you might come back right why don't
you

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.619
k

00:05:41.619 --> 00:05:46.199
uh... block-grant who are brown

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.989
that this may be the finances

00:05:48.989 --> 00:05:50.590
thanks guys

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.639
the just very quickly add as i was
saying and i feel like if you generally

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:57.219
do care about the mental health of
americans right

00:05:57.219 --> 00:06:00.130
stopped the funding programs that uh...
offer

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:05.360
therapy to people who need it but can't
afford it you don't stop coddling

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.100
with the income inequality that's
another perfectly people are overworked

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:12.919
they're stressed out there's no uh...
you know regulated maternity leave or

00:06:12.919 --> 00:06:17.810
paternity leave i mean these are like
problems that actually do contribute to

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:18.870
the stress

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:22.840
uh... of of americans and that's the
kind of stuff that you actually focus on

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.050
as opposed to rediculous scapegoats like
this i think about a better society
