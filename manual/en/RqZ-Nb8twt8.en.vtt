00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.900
My Cool School project is all about monsters!

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.040
A lot of people think monsters are scary,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.360
but most of them aren't.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.100
Unless you include my little brother when he doesn't brush his teeth and he breathes on you...

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:11.940
Eeew!

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.220
But I think most monsters are pretty cool!

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.620
First of all, what do monsters look like?

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.900
Some are tall.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.800
Some are short.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.580
Some monsters are super cute.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.260
Some are less cute.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.540
Some look furry.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.680
Some look fuzzy.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.840
And some monsters just look funny.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.320
Monsters can come in super handy.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:30.820
Like when you need a tissue.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:31.760
Achoo!

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:32.800
Gesundheit!

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.960
Thanks!

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.840
Or when you have a bug problem

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.200
Or if you just need a cool sidekick.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:42.520
[roars]

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.080
Thanks!

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.620
And when you get tired,

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.060
they're like giant stuffed animals!

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.140
You might think that monsters like to hide under beds and in closets and scare people.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:51.340
Not true!

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.240
Monsters actually live in trashcans,

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.100
castles,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.400
lakes,

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.700
and snowy mountains.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.340
Sometimes they live in your pocket, like Pokemon!

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.240
Yeah! In Japan, we're called Pocket Monsters!

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.320
Hey! You're only supposed to say your name!

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.980
Oops, I mean...

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:07.880
Pika pika!

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.880
Monsters like to go to school,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.160
eat dessert,

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.620
Mmm, cookie

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:13.580
cuddle,

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:14.940
and sing.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.160
Some monsters just like to watch TV.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.320
Oh! And they love to dance.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.600
They even have their own dance called the Monster Mash!

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.680
The most important thing to know about monsters,

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.660
is that you should never be afraid of them!

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.660
But just in case you're ever kind of scared,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.920
just remember you can totally defeat the monster!

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:34.220
Here are a few ways!

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:35.140
Number 1:

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.400
turn on your night light!

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:37.620
Ah!

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.440
Monsters HATE night lights!

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.760
Number 2:

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.260
yell boo!

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.000
Ah!!

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:43.620
That works every time.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.680
Number 3:

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.940
throw snowballs!

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.180
Ah!

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.800
And number 4:

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.020
just replace their cookies with yucky stuff.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.780
Mmm, cookie.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.440
Ah! Mushroom!

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.760
So basically, monsters are super cool,

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.280
and awesome, and fun, and not scary at all!

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.360
And if I got to have my very own monster,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.100
I would name her Prankenstein.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.160
And we would play hilarious pranks on my brother, like, all the time!

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.760
Eeew!

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:10.880
That'd be so sweet!

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.860
So, what's your favorite monster?

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.060
And if you had your own monster, what would you name it?

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.380
Tell me in the comments!

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.460
Don't go anywhere!

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.540
More Kids' Wikis are on the way!

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.100
My Cool School project is all about dinosaurs!

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.240
Dinosaurs lived millions and millions and millions and MILLIONS of years ago!

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.020
That's a lot of years ago!

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.660
The word "dinosaur" means "terrible lizard."

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.880
But I don't think they're terrible at all!

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:38.080
I think they're cool.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.500
Okay, maybe THAT dino is kind of terrible...

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.460
Leave some cake for the rest of us, Rex!

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.540
Sorry!

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.060
Some dinosaurs are small like the Mussaurus.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.960
That name means "mouse lizard"!

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.960
I wonder if the Mussaurus likes cheese...

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.980
Some are big like the Apatosaurus

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.280
Hey, I was born this way!!

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.580
Some are really, really, REALLY big like the Titanosaurus!

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.940
The Titanosaurus was SO big that scientists say she might've been as long as

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:07.900
2 mack trucks and weighed as much as

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.200
14 elephants!

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:12.220
Ok! I'll go on a diet!

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.820
That reminds me of a joke.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.600
What time is it when a Titanosaurus sits on your fence?

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.620
Time to get a new fence!

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.400
The Tyrannosaurus Rex, or T-Rex,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.160
is one of the most famously-ferocious dinosaurs.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:26.760
But his arms are so tiny!

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.000
It was probably hard for him to tie his shoes...

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:32.600
Did you know that there's another dino called the P-Rex?

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.500
The "P" stands for Pinocchio!

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:36.320
That's because he told so many fibs.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.280
Of course I ate all my peas! Now, what's for dessert??

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.800
This dinosaur is called Pinocchio Rex because this dinosaur had a long nose,

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:44.840
just like Pinocchio!

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:48.740
Plus, he probably didn't eat any peas at all because the P-Rex was a carnivore!

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:50.360
Carnivores eat meat.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.160
Other dinosaurs are leaf-eaters.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.400
They eat, well, leaves.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.140
And some dinosaurs eat anything, like Yoshi!

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.640
You might call him and omnomnomivore!

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:04.220
Whenever Yoshi eats something, he lays an egg!

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.700
Dinosaur eggs are REALLY colorful!

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.380
A stegosaurus has spikes on his back.

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:12.100
But what if there was a LEGOsaurus?

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:13.960
He would be really colorful too!

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.200
Some dinosaurs can fly,

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.520
like the Pegasaurus!

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.900
Juuust kidding. I made that one up!

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:21.660
But the pterodactyl can fly!

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.360
Even though dinosaurs lived a long time ago,

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.260
we still find parts of them today.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:27.540
These are called fossils.

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.560
There are even fossil Pokemon, like Mega Aerodactyl.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.720
Scientists can learn a LOT about dinosaurs from fossils,

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.740
like how big the dino was, how long ago it lived, and even how smart it was!

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.260
They say the Troodon was the smartest dinosaur.

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:42.320
Hey Troodon, what's 2+2?

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.300
Uh... two two?

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.800
Okay, not THAT smart...

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:48.320
But pretty good at ballet!

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.400
Some dinosaurs were really fast,

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.140
and some were really sloooow.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.760
To sum it all up,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.940
dinosaurs lived a super-long time ago,

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.260
and they were totally awesome!

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:59.840
And they couldn't tie their shoes.

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:03.560
If I could name my own dinosaur, I'd name it Super-Awesomesaurus.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.880
Or maybe just Calvin.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.600
And I'd ride around on him all day, and I'd let my friends ride on him too!

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.220
Everybody gets a dino ride!

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:14.640
My project is all about dragons!

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:17.380
Dragons come in all different shapes and sizes,

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.760
but all of them are AWESOME.

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:22.440
They have wings, so they can fly through the air.

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:24.020
They can even do tricks.

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:26.180
Some dragons are really cute,

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.240
like Toothless from How to Train Your Dragon.

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:30.960
Aw... he doesn't have any teeth!

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:33.200
On the other hand, in Sleeping Beauty,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:36.700
Maleficent turns into a dragon with a whole BUNCH of teeth!

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:39.320
... It's probably tougher to use a toothbrush...

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:41.660
Some dragons breathe FIRE.

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.160
They do this to protect their gold.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.540
Or because they just ate a bunch of spicy chicken wings.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:48.400
Why does he even NEED all that gold?

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:50.680
To buy more spicy chicken wings??

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:52.540
Other dragons breathe ice

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.800
That's handy for when your ice cream is starting to melt!

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.140
Thanks!

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.220
Some dragons just have bad breath!

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:03.240
That's the SCARIEST breath of all!

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.640
Maybe he needs to brush his teeth too...

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:08.960
There are dragons that are big enough for you to ride on!

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:12.960
And then, there are dragons that are small enough to ride on YOU!

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.620
Most kids LOVE dragons.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:18.580
My older sister even likes some called Imagine Dragons!

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.320
They don't look like regular dragons...

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:22.320
I think they're radioactive or something...

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:23.620
Like Godzilla,

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:25.380
he likes to step on buildings.

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.280
He's not REALLY a dragon, though.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.620
More of a dinosaur.

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.060
We'll talk about dinosaurs later.

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:32.320
For now, back to dragons!

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.840
Dragons are used as symbols for a lot of things.

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.160
Knights used to have dragons on their shields.

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:40.100
During the Chinese New Year, you can see a dragon dance.

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:44.480
No... not THAT kind of dragon dance!

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.200
THAT'S better.

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.660
Some dragons are magic.

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:51.460
But some are not

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.980
This list is starting to drag-on...

00:06:54.980 --> 00:06:56.320
So, in conclusion,

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.980
Dragons live in castles and lighthouses,

00:06:59.220 --> 00:07:01.220
up on mountains and down in caves.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:02.760
They can be cuter than a kitten

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:03.940
and friendlier than a dog.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.480
Dragons can fly you to school, so you don't have to take the bus!

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.880
And that's why you should have a dragon as a pet!

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:13.820
So, what's your favorite dragon?

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:17.260
Is it from a movie? A book? A video game?

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.520
