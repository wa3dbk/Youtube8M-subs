00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:06.331
The soft elements in connective tissue are called 'fascia'.

00:00:06.565 --> 00:00:09.800
Tendons and ligaments are also fascial structures.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.160
These fascial structures run through our bodies

00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:14.300
like a white, fibrous web.

00:00:16.405 --> 00:00:18.400
Fascia has a multitude of tasks to fulfill.

00:00:19.565 --> 00:00:21.560
It help us maintain our upright stance,

00:00:21.725 --> 00:00:23.601
it holds our organs in their proper positions,

00:00:23.805 --> 00:00:26.270
it transmits mechanical traction forces

00:00:26.435 --> 00:00:30.470
and provides a gel-like matrix within which

00:00:30.631 --> 00:00:34.070
muscles and organs can slide past each other freely.

00:00:39.005 --> 00:00:41.005
Fascia is not really anything new.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.805
Primarily among the complementary medical procedures

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.840
like acupuncture, osteopathy or

00:00:46.001 --> 00:00:47.960
other non-medical healing arts,

00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:50.055
fascia has been known for a very long time.

00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:52.205
Standard medicine however

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:54.375
had neglected fascia - with good reason.

00:00:54.581 --> 00:00:58.440
So far there was no means of exact measurement.

00:01:01.001 --> 00:01:03.000
The architectonic makeup of muscle tissue

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.941
resembles that of an orange.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.475
The entire muscle is ensheathed in a firm casing.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.666
Similar to the pulp in an orange,

00:01:10.835 --> 00:01:13.510
the individual fibre bundles are themselves

00:01:13.675 --> 00:01:16.110
held together by their individual membranes.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:20.045
Fascia can be viewed as a sensory organ.

00:01:20.245 --> 00:01:22.245
One could even say that, from the point of view of

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.350
our bodies' self-perception,

00:01:24.515 --> 00:01:26.811
it is the most important sensory organ.

00:01:26.981 --> 00:01:28.980
It is especially important for coordination.

00:01:29.285 --> 00:01:32.411
When I can't see my arm moving,

00:01:32.575 --> 00:01:34.496
I can still sense if I have room left,

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.615
before coming to the end of a movement.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:38.780
It will tell me how far my right arm

00:01:38.946 --> 00:01:40.880
is positioned front of me or behind me.

00:01:41.081 --> 00:01:43.080
This perception is primarily transmitted

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.246
by the fascial stretch receptors.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.650
The fascia contains some important cellular structures.

00:01:56.965 --> 00:01:58.960
They are responsible for allowing the fascia

00:01:59.125 --> 00:02:01.116
to adapt to different situations.

00:02:01.356 --> 00:02:03.816
They will, when required, trigger the production of gel-like material,

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.725
this being a sometimes very fast process,

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.051
or they will ask for the production of more fibrous material.

00:02:10.215 --> 00:02:12.790
Recent research suggest that techniques like

00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:16.155
manipulative therapies or yoga

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.455
can trigger the production of gel-like material within minutes.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.955
In situations of prolonged physical inactivity

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.025
or postural misalignments

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.790
the fascia ceases to produce the lubricating gel.

00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:35.356
As a consequence it can stiffen and different layers

00:02:35.525 --> 00:02:37.090
can start adhering to each other.

00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:39.205
Since they are all connected through this web-like structure,

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:41.325
this can cause problems and be responsible for pain

00:02:41.486 --> 00:02:43.425
throughout the entire movement system.
