Lead me to battle...

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.500
*Manic Laughter*

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.200
HatPerson: Starting out with number five got
your Tristana Rocket Jump, Buster Shot...

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.490

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.779
Saintvicious: Yah he really wanted to die...

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.279
HatPerson: He really wanted to die

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.980
Number four we got Shaco here in the bush

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.649
The Jack in the Box doing some work on its
own

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:32.980
Lux wants to help but very nice going stealth
getting that positional advantage that he needs

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.180
and Lux is going in! Shaco is low!

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.089
Shaco is very low! I'm not sure if he should
still be sticking around but hey..

00:00:38.089 --> 00:00:40.010
Saintvicious: He sees a kill he's going for
it

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:42.050
HatPerson: He's got that kill he wants it

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.430
Saintvicious: Red team is on farm status right now

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.559
HatPerson: He is yah and he's going around
he's not backing

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.920
There is another Jack in the Box

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.079
Sion, the shield doesn't help and those jukes.
Wow!

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.929
Saintvicious: I don't know if cuz the Red
team is so bad or Shaco's so good ...

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:57.100
but I'll take either one

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.890
HatPerson: Number two, Lulu trying to get
some damage on the turret

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.770
is going to be popping the Ult with the entire
enemy team in pursuit

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:35.970
We got two, we gotta keep counting them

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.250
You got bandages ... four people coming...
five... everyone

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.920
Saintvicious: Don't mind the base in the bottom
we don't need those towers

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.890
HatPerson: Yah those towers .. yah who cares

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.970
But look the chase happens so long Lulu's
got her Ult back

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.000
My God.. you couldn't capitalize... he couldn't
get that kill

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.129
Saintvicious: Look at the attack speed .. it's
a killing machine right there

00:01:56.129 --> 00:01:56.970
Killing, kiting machine

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:58.890
HatPerson: Gotta buy those items, I need that
build

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.890
And for number one this Bot Lane Graves and
Taric

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.890
Nocturne tries to get in on the Ult with the
fear

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:11.239
Ashe's arrow is going to keep the Taric still

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.300
but this is it.. this is a commitment here..
four men ganking a tower

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.830
Saintvicious: This is solo queue is what this
is...

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.489
this one play defines all solo queue... one
play

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.940
HatPerson: The tower just going to town on
everybody

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.770
Why are you not getting these kills? What's
happening?

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:29.640
And Lux, the stun, there you go Quadra

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:36.640
