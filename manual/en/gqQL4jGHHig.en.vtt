00:00:07.126 --> 00:00:08.676
Well, we're at Morton Arboretum.

00:00:08.676 --> 00:00:11.026
This is tree biomechanics
research.

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:13.846
Trees are moving
constantly in the wind,

00:00:13.986 --> 00:00:15.406
and the whole objective is

00:00:15.406 --> 00:00:18.326
to understand really
when trees are safe.

00:00:19.026 --> 00:00:22.266
My friend, Mark Hoenigman who's
been doing tree work for me

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.326
for years, he'd talk about some

00:00:24.326 --> 00:00:26.286
of the difficulties they
were having in trying

00:00:26.286 --> 00:00:28.106
to make measurements,

00:00:28.106 --> 00:00:29.606
displacement measurements,
on trees.

00:00:29.926 --> 00:00:32.606
And I said, hey, if you give me
a can of white paint and a can

00:00:32.606 --> 00:00:34.806
of black paint, I can come out
and I can show you how to do it.

00:00:34.806 --> 00:00:37.476
We can measure the deformation
of the whole tree all at once.

00:00:38.086 --> 00:00:41.396
We put a black and white
stucco pattern on these trees,

00:00:41.456 --> 00:00:43.446
and that stucco pattern
gets tracked

00:00:43.526 --> 00:00:45.496
by sets of stereo cameras.

00:00:45.646 --> 00:00:48.566
The fancy term is,
stereo photogrammetry

00:00:49.096 --> 00:00:53.786
that means we're using 3D images
of things to, in this case,

00:00:53.836 --> 00:00:58.206
trees, to track the movement
of that tree as it responds

00:00:58.296 --> 00:01:01.286
to forces of wind, or in
this case, our simulated wind

00:01:01.286 --> 00:01:03.646
by cabling the tree and
pulling on the cable.

00:01:03.916 --> 00:01:06.586
Those cameras look at the
same point of interest,

00:01:06.586 --> 00:01:08.816
and in this case, we're
looking at trees and roots.

00:01:09.466 --> 00:01:12.116
In looking at those things from
two different points of view,

00:01:12.916 --> 00:01:15.616
we're able to do
software calculations

00:01:15.756 --> 00:01:17.696
of the actual deformation
that's going on,

00:01:17.696 --> 00:01:21.936
and from that we can calculate
stress and strain that the trees

00:01:21.936 --> 00:01:22.976
or the roots are undergoing.

00:01:23.306 --> 00:01:26.476
We're employing some technology
on trees for the first time.

00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.816
And this technology has been
used in a lot of other things,

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:31.436
specifically it was
developed with NASA

00:01:31.436 --> 00:01:34.256
for the Space Shuttle Program,
to look at the deformation

00:01:34.256 --> 00:01:36.626
of the surfaces of the
space shuttle if it gets hit

00:01:36.716 --> 00:01:39.586
by an object, which did cause
a serious problem for it.

00:01:39.896 --> 00:01:43.446
Obviously, this experiment
is destructive of trees but,

00:01:43.446 --> 00:01:46.286
we were able to choose
ash trees for this study,

00:01:46.286 --> 00:01:48.306
and they're going to
be gone soon anyway,

00:01:48.376 --> 00:01:50.696
so we're really not
harming good, useful trees.

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:52.856
What's really interesting
is the fact

00:01:52.856 --> 00:01:54.646
that this has never been
done on trees before.

00:01:54.646 --> 00:01:56.716
I mean, it's groundbreaking
research in the fact that,

00:01:56.996 --> 00:01:58.686
you know, nobody really
understands how the,

00:01:58.686 --> 00:02:01.626
the full tree deforms
under this kind of loading.

00:02:02.166 --> 00:02:04.146
They want to understand
how trees fail.

00:02:04.146 --> 00:02:05.226
What makes them fail?

00:02:05.706 --> 00:02:07.946
And what we can do to
make them stronger.

00:02:08.136 --> 00:02:11.566
This is part of helping to
understand when trees are,

00:02:11.746 --> 00:02:15.016
are safe and sound, and when
trees may, may be a hazard,

00:02:15.016 --> 00:02:16.946
and need to be either
removed or,

00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:19.286
in some cases, braced
or reinforced.
