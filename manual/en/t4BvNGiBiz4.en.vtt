00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:03.770
ON A WINTER DAY IN AUSTIN

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.106
MARSHALL WRIGHT FIXES
SOME FOOD FOR HIS FAMILY.

00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:12.811
The ducks, I only want to do them 
to about medium rare.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.483
Onion, green bell pepper and celery,

00:00:17.523 --> 00:00:19.416
what they call the holy trinity.

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:21.785
MARSHALL HAS BEEN COOKING
ALL HIS LIFE

00:00:21.825 --> 00:00:24.023
BUT THIS MEAL IS 
DIFFERENT FROM MOST.

00:00:24.063 --> 00:00:25.638
Iím gonna make gumbo.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.860
THE PREPARATION FOR IT
REALLY BEGAN

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.830
IN A HUNTER EDUCATION CLASS
6 MONTHS EARLIER.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.671
Which oneís got the most control 
over the firearm muzzle?

00:00:33.713 --> 00:00:35.068
The one in the middle, absolutely.

00:00:35.108 --> 00:00:37.870
MARSHALL'S INTEREST IN
HEALTHY LOCAL FOOD

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.806
HAS LED HIM TO EXPLORE 
HUNTING FOR THE FIRST TIME.

00:00:40.846 --> 00:00:44.505
Not to stereotype but I donít maybe 
necessarily look like a hunter.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.246
BUT MARSHALL DOES REPRESENT
A NEW TREND

00:00:47.286 --> 00:00:49.845
AMONG CITY DWELLERS WHO
WANT TO KNOW MORE

00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:52.483
ABOUT WHERE THEIR FOOD
COMES FROM.

00:00:52.523 --> 00:00:53.986
That looks good.

00:00:54.026 --> 00:00:56.475
Weíre at the downtown 
Austin Farmersí Market.

00:00:56.515 --> 00:00:57.543
I guess Iíll have to try them.

00:00:57.583 --> 00:00:59.458
I like the smaller ones as well.

00:00:59.498 --> 00:01:01.728
Shopping at farmersí markets 
in general

00:01:01.768 --> 00:01:03.926
has started to gain 
a lot of popularity.

00:01:03.966 --> 00:01:06.466
[Vendor] The smaller ones are $3 
and the biggest ones are $5.

00:01:06.506 --> 00:01:09.468
You can come to the market and 
get food straight from the source.

00:01:09.508 --> 00:01:11.405
Itís going to be better 
for you to eat.

00:01:11.445 --> 00:01:13.740
And itís better for the local economy.

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.843
[vendor] 
Enjoy brother.

00:01:16.883 --> 00:01:19.445
Because of the rise of 
obesity in America,

00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:22.015
because of the Food, Inc. movies,

00:01:22.055 --> 00:01:24.416
because of the Michael Pollan books,

00:01:24.456 --> 00:01:30.090
itís hard now to ignore 
where your food comes from.

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:33.650
I hate to say itís trendy
because I think it's

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.795
people are finally realizing 
we need to get back

00:01:35.835 --> 00:01:38.731
to how we shop and how we eat.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:43.636
AND MARSHALL BRINGS BACK
MORE THAN FOOD

00:01:43.676 --> 00:01:45.445
FROM HIS TRIPS TO
THE FARMERS MARKET.

00:01:45.486 --> 00:01:49.075
Iím actually in the process 
of shooting a cookbook.

00:01:49.115 --> 00:01:52.078
FOOD PHOTOGRAPHY IS AS MUCH
HIS PASSION

00:01:52.118 --> 00:01:54.643
AS COOKING AND EATING.

00:01:56.015 --> 00:02:00.453
So much food photography is focused 
on that finished dish.

00:02:00.493 --> 00:02:03.690
I like the process of cooking the food
or preparing the food

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.058
as much as I do the 
eating of the food,

00:02:06.128 --> 00:02:09.028
and then to capture that 
with photography.

00:02:09.395 --> 00:02:12.865
WHEN MARSHALL IS NOT AT
THE COMPUTER FOR HIS PHOTOGRAPHY

00:02:12.905 --> 00:02:14.735
OR HIS JOB IN SOCIAL MEDIA,

00:02:14.775 --> 00:02:16.766
HE ALSO KEEPS A BLOG ABOUT

00:02:16.808 --> 00:02:18.303
YOU GUESSED IT - FOOD.

00:02:18.365 --> 00:02:20.640
My blog is very heavy on photography

00:02:20.686 --> 00:02:25.411
but I definitely got into it 
as a means of exploring

00:02:25.451 --> 00:02:26.980
my passion for food.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.283
For the most part 
I just like to eat.

00:02:29.323 --> 00:02:32.150
THIS FOCUS ON FOOD HAS LED
TO MARSHALL'S INTEREST

00:02:32.191 --> 00:02:34.808
IN GETTING SOME THE
TRADITIONAL WAY.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.758
This shotgun here came from 
my father-in-law.

00:02:39.798 --> 00:02:43.130
There is a primal, back-to-basics 
element of it

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.033
that I think is very prominent 
in food culture right now.

00:02:47.073 --> 00:02:49.968
What can we do and how can 
we find ways to eat

00:02:50.043 --> 00:02:51.603
that we know what weíre eating?

00:02:51.643 --> 00:02:54.840
And so hunting seemed to be 
obviously a logical step to that.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:55.775
Marshall Wright

00:02:55.815 --> 00:02:57.910
SO WHAT NOW THAT MARSHALL
HAS LEARNED

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.680
THE RULES OF HUNTER SAFETY?

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.546
-You got a 92, congratulations.
-Yeah, now what?

00:03:01.586 --> 00:03:03.715
Probably ought to learn how to shoot 
a gun. That'd be a good start.

00:03:03.755 --> 00:03:07.688
Our goal today is just essentially 
familiarization with a shotgun.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.655
TO GET SOME HAND'S-ON EXPERIENCE

00:03:09.695 --> 00:03:13.593
MARSHALL ALSO ENROLLS IN A 
HUNTER EDUCATION FIELD COURSE.

00:03:13.633 --> 00:03:17.230
So today weíre going after these 
birds called skeet.

00:03:18.631 --> 00:03:20.500
Okay, now itís loaded, ready to go.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.198
Keep your finger outside the trigger 
guard until weíre ready to fire.

00:03:23.241 --> 00:03:24.106
Pull.

00:03:24.146 --> 00:03:26.138
Itís still a little bit intimidating.
[gun shot]

00:03:26.471 --> 00:03:29.641
You have to move the muzzle 
to the bird. Okay?

00:03:29.681 --> 00:03:30.610
Pull.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.345
There's more to think about
than I thought.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.480
[instructor] Okay, nice.

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:36.945
What you had problems doing 
is finding the bird quicker.

00:03:36.986 --> 00:03:39.718
&gt;&gt;Iíve shot a shotgun once.

00:03:39.758 --> 00:03:41.955
This is the first time.
[instructor] Oh, just below it.

00:03:41.996 --> 00:03:42.955
&gt;&gt;Pull.

00:03:44.523 --> 00:03:47.220
I hit 0. I want to bird hunt.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.563
Itís going to take some more practice
but Iíll definitely get it.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:53.366
[instructor] You just scratched 
the left edge of it.

00:03:53.406 --> 00:03:55.068
&gt;&gt; I at least got a little 
piece of one.

00:03:55.108 --> 00:03:56.798
[instructor] What is this part called?

00:03:56.838 --> 00:03:58.571
&gt;&gt; That's the butt.

00:03:58.611 --> 00:04:00.240
Stock, there you go.

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.538
AS MARSHALL FINDS OUT,
IF YOU DON'T GROW UP HUNTING,

00:04:02.581 --> 00:04:05.388
LEARNING THE ROPES CAN TAKE
SOME EFFORT.

00:04:05.428 --> 00:04:08.515
WHILE INTEREST AND DETERMINATION
GO A LONG WAY,

00:04:08.555 --> 00:04:10.883
GETTING STARTED MAY MEAN
FINDING FRIENDS

00:04:10.923 --> 00:04:13.720
WHO ALREADY HUNT OR
HIRING A GUIDE.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.323
Alright, roll that over on the bolt 
handle if you would please.

00:04:16.363 --> 00:04:18.158
Downrange but in the same positionÖ

00:04:18.198 --> 00:04:20.673
FORTUNATELY THROUGH A 
CONTACT FROM THIS CLASS,

00:04:20.713 --> 00:04:23.081
MARSHALL IS INVITED
ON HIS FIRST HUNT.

00:04:23.135 --> 00:04:24.730
13, 14, 15. Thatís something.

00:04:24.818 --> 00:04:27.866
ALL THE PREPARATION MAY
SOON PAY OFF.

00:04:29.508 --> 00:04:31.538
Alright, nailed it!

00:04:31.578 --> 00:04:35.041
You know, itís not ëgrab a gun, 
and go sit out in the woods

00:04:35.081 --> 00:04:36.275
and shoot something.í

00:04:36.315 --> 00:04:39.478
Thereís a lot thatís involved in 
getting to this point.

00:04:39.518 --> 00:04:41.333
I do hope itís successful.

00:04:41.375 --> 00:04:43.916
Either way I get to be outside
and we get to be

00:04:43.956 --> 00:04:45.785
in nature and do something fun.

00:04:45.825 --> 00:04:48.555
Yes maíam. I need to get 
a hunting license please.

00:04:48.595 --> 00:04:50.056
Okay, and what are you going 
to be hunting for?

00:04:50.096 --> 00:04:51.255
Uh, for duck.

00:04:51.295 --> 00:04:52.958
And then I had to go buy 
a hunting license,

00:04:52.998 --> 00:04:54.963
which I went and did this morning.

00:04:55.005 --> 00:04:57.163
So Iím licensed now officiallyÖ

00:04:57.203 --> 00:04:58.698
Thank you so much.

00:04:58.738 --> 00:05:01.063
and Iím going to get some 
ammo for the hunt and

00:05:01.103 --> 00:05:04.503
yeah, then weíll be ready 
to go early,

00:05:04.543 --> 00:05:06.271
5:30 in the morning tomorrow.

00:05:08.675 --> 00:05:11.576
[duck calls]

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:15.448
[guide] Alright, letís go ahead and 
sit down and get ready.

00:05:18.805 --> 00:05:21.590
It was pretty slow. 
This property typically

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:25.791
will have 5-12 flights of birds.

00:05:25.831 --> 00:05:30.396
Get it. Shoot. Shoot!
[gunshots]

00:05:30.436 --> 00:05:33.595
-Far off one? 
-No bird.

00:05:33.673 --> 00:05:36.870
[guide] We saw 4 groups 
of birds work.

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.971
But thatís part of hunting.

00:05:40.886 --> 00:05:42.908
[duck calls]

00:05:43.928 --> 00:05:45.745
[duck calls]

00:05:46.086 --> 00:05:49.381
[Marshall] Just sitting there waiting
and the anticipation of

00:05:49.421 --> 00:05:52.251
when the birds are going to come 
and if theyíre going to come

00:05:52.291 --> 00:05:54.053
and what do you do when 
they come, and you know,

00:05:54.093 --> 00:05:57.656
you have to go through all the stuff 
that you learned in hunter education

00:05:57.696 --> 00:05:59.696
and thinking about your firearm,

00:05:59.736 --> 00:06:02.828
and just everything about it 
runs through you in a split second.

00:06:02.868 --> 00:06:04.496
It was exciting!

00:06:04.536 --> 00:06:07.033
There are some birds up top. 
Take ëem!

00:06:07.106 --> 00:06:08.801
[gunshots]
Good shot!

00:06:08.841 --> 00:06:10.136
Dixie!

00:06:10.176 --> 00:06:11.671
[splash]

00:06:11.711 --> 00:06:13.040
Nice shot, Marshall.

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.911
Thank you.

00:06:14.473 --> 00:06:17.343
Marshall did great. 
You know, Iím impressed.

00:06:17.383 --> 00:06:18.778
Good girl!

00:06:18.818 --> 00:06:22.981
&gt;&gt;I happened to be lucky 
and got a couple.

00:06:23.308 --> 00:06:26.920
-Nice. -Good shooting!
-Thanks.

00:06:32.688 --> 00:06:34.245
[cows moo]

00:06:35.328 --> 00:06:38.898
You know, we could go purchase 
a cow for about $600

00:06:38.938 --> 00:06:40.635
if you really want to 
go home with some meat.

00:06:40.676 --> 00:06:43.135
These are free range, organicÖ.

00:06:43.208 --> 00:06:48.073
[music]

00:06:48.113 --> 00:06:49.408
We didnít see a lot of birds

00:06:49.448 --> 00:06:52.378
but we saw enough 
that it was successful.

00:06:57.483 --> 00:07:01.091
It was fun. Iím absolutely 
going to do it again.

00:07:03.223 --> 00:07:05.091
Okay, letís eat.

00:07:05.131 --> 00:07:07.260
Being able to go do a hunt, 
and then come back

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.628
and be able to share it with 
other people, I think thatís,

00:07:09.668 --> 00:07:12.898
seems to be a nice trend that 
people are trying to get back to.

00:07:12.938 --> 00:07:14.801
Good duck in there.

00:07:15.995 --> 00:07:17.003
That tastes nice.

00:07:17.043 --> 00:07:19.235
Daddy, I like your gumbo.

00:07:19.278 --> 00:07:21.503
Thank you, Maggie.

00:07:21.546 --> 00:07:23.543
Is my face messy?

00:07:23.583 --> 00:07:25.311
[laughs]
