00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:03.320
I experimented with quite a few different
ones before I got to this one.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.362
At a couple points, I thought I’d found
the right one, but then it turned out to be

00:00:07.362 --> 00:00:08.860
quite the opposite.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.080
I probably wasted too much money along the
way, but I didn’t know any better.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.780
But when I got to this one, it only took a
day before I knew this was the one for me,

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.780
for good.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.790
In this video, I’ll be telling you about
how I met my fiancee- er, wait, no, this is

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:33.870
my FocusRite Scarlett 2i2 Review.

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:42.800
[Intro]
[Ad]

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.710
Relationship jokes aside, the FocusRite Scarlett
2i2 USB audio interface has been a godsend

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:47.710
for my studio.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:54.340
This interface takes two XLR or Line In inputs
and, well, outputs them to either separate

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.989
(left and right) channels via USB and Line
Out or two separate mono tracks via USB.

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.979
It requires no external power other than that
USB A to B cable, yet can still deliver 48v

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:12.649
Phantom Power and a strong output to a pair
of monitoring headphones.

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:15.380
Did I mention it’s really small, too?

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.939
48v can be turned on or off with the push
of a button, you have volume control knobs

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:25.200
for monitoring microphone input and audio
playback via the USB ASIO driver, and you

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:34.569
can even turn off direct 
microphone monitoring.

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:43.049
The Scarlett 2i2 is built quite nicely with
a lovely red, or Scarlet metal made to look

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:48.090
like brushed aluminum, nice rubber no-slip
feet, and even has a kensington lock spot

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.509
for locations where security is key.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.090
[bad pun reaction of some sort]

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.950
Don’t let me forget the audio quality itself
- the interface provides a super clean and

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:07.239
great-quality signal to your recording software.

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:20.920
It’s flexible in allowing either dual mono
streams or left and right track stereo recording.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:27.850
This is perfect in my studio where we have
co-op recording but need the ability to balance

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.690
and process the individual microphone inputs
separately.

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:39.060
We have a Rode Procaster dynamic broadcast
microphone and a Behringer C-1 condenser microphone

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.060
hooked up to the interface.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:45.790
It has no trouble providing Phantom Power
just to the condenser mic and not affecting

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:46.960
the Dynamic.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.850
Best of all, when I need to do solo recordings,
I can just turn off the Phantom Power and

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:59.560
record in mono without having to worry about
any noise coming from the other microphone.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.470
The secondary output - the line out - is also
pretty clean, and very loud.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:05.240
We have this running to our second pc rig,
and we’re able to do so and record with

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:07.160
it as if it was the main machine!

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:26.720
This is not something we’ve been able to
do with any of our previous mixers or interfaces

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:53.209
without many ground loop isolators to remove
electrical interference 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:57.230
and quite a hefty amount of noise removal.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.500
So what’s not to love?

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:29.490
Well, to be honest - not a whole lot.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:38.319
Depending on the 1/4" to 3.5mm adapter I use,
the headphone jack can feel a little loose

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:45.300
and wobbly sometimes, though I’ve not noticed
this to cause any sort of audio feedback or

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.300
glitches.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:54.639
The headphone monitoring for microphone input
is very very quiet.

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:03.379
My dynamic microphone requires my Gain to
be set pretty high (around 80% or so rotation),

00:05:03.379 --> 00:05:13.750
but even with the dynamic mic and Condenser
mic active and us talking loud into them,

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.279
it’s very hard to hear the monitor loopback.

00:05:17.279 --> 00:05:26.150
I literally have the knob turned up 
to 100%.

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:37.999
Audio playback from the computer over USB
is incredibly loud, however.

00:05:37.999 --> 00:05:45.000
Also, the Scarlett 2i2 uses a very specific
driver, which isn’t compatible with all

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.000
software.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:51.689
I’ve not ran into any deal-breaking issues
yet, but to record and monitor efficiently,

00:05:51.689 --> 00:06:00.740
I need to have Adobe Audition set to ASIO
mode for the FocusRite Scarlett driver, which

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:08.139
records from the interface and plays audio
back to it.

00:06:08.139 --> 00:06:14.279
This is great and convenient when I am strictly
recording and editing audio - for voiceover

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:19.719
sessions or commentary, but when I’m editing
audio while also editing video and doing other

00:06:19.719 --> 00:06:22.270
things, switching headsets around can be quite
frustrating.

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:26.900
Overall, the FocusRite Scarlett 2i2 is an
amazing audio interface.

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:33.759
I had all but given up on getting clean audio
from my setup, but I threw a few dollars at

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:38.529
this product and gave it a try, and it has
been nothing but amazing to me.

00:06:38.529 --> 00:06:43.110
Plus, I can actually set it out of the way
on my desk, unlike the giant, table-sized

00:06:43.110 --> 00:06:45.930
Behringer mixer board I was using before.

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.009
[black &amp; white footage from unboxing of that]

00:06:48.009 --> 00:06:52.619
When considering if this interface is for
you, make sure you know how many inputs you’ll

00:06:52.619 --> 00:06:53.619
be needing.

00:06:53.619 --> 00:07:05.129
This is absolutely perfect and ideal for any
2 microphone or 2-input (even instruments,

00:07:05.129 --> 00:07:08.759
it works great with Pro Tools!) setups.

00:07:08.759 --> 00:07:14.339
However if you’re only ever using 1 input
(or 1 big, XLR/Line In input and a secondary

00:07:14.339 --> 00:07:24.340
3.5mm input) you could save some money by
just getting FocusRite’s iTrack Solo audio

00:07:24.340 --> 00:07:25.340
interface instead.

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:31.279
*Review on that coming soon, so be sure to
subscribe so you don’t miss it!* The iTrack

00:07:31.279 --> 00:07:37.690
Solo is the same concept, but for 1 primary
input and with iPad support.

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:39.340
Thanks so much for watching this review.
