00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:07.140
Today we are going to be installing hitch
part number 90186 from Hidden Hitch on a 2000

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.250
Kia Sportage.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.730
This installation will also apply to Draw-Tite
part number 36266.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.130
We are underneath the vehicle now, and we
are going to go ahead and point out the attaching

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:17.130
points for the hitch.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.790
Looking at the passengers side frame rail,
you can see there is a hole here on the inboard

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.940
side of the frame.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.590
That is going to provide the forwardmost attaching
point.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.000
And then, on this tow hook here, we are actually
going to drill a hole and make that the second

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
attaching point.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.100
The first thing we want to do is we want to
take this handle nut assembly, and we are

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.250
actually going to feed this through the other
hole on the outboard side of the frame so

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.160
that it aligns inside the frame, like so.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.170
And then we are going to put the hitch up.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:49.320
And we are going to use the fastener to thread
directly into it.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.089
Once we get that in place, we will swing the
hitch up into position, mark our hole for

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:59.999
drilling, and then drill our holes out.

00:00:59.999 --> 00:01:04.350
The easiest way to get the handle nut aligned
is to just get it inside the frame and just

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:09.070
take a long-bladed screwdriver, get it inside
the opening in the handle nut, and just kind

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.549
of pry it into position.

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:19.200
And we want to make that setup for both sides
of 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.009
the vehicle.

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:39.929
And then we can 
go ahead 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.340
and put the hitch up into place.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:02:18.010
It is probably going 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:41.390
to take another set of hands somebody is going
to need to hold 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:03:07.910
the handle nut into position, and another
person will need to put the hitch up 

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:20.210
and thread it in.
