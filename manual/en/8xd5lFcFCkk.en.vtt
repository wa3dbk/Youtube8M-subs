What's up guys!

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.450
Thank you so much for watching the EXODUS
Tribute video.

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.560
A mash-up of every song on the album in three
minutes.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.970
I did a similar video for this for the RISE
album of Taeyang and you guys kept asking

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.530
for an EXODUS one as well.

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:42.530
So here it is.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:47.410
Sorry it made you wait a little bit, but yeah,
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:52.690
Please give it a thumbs up and share it with
your friends if you really did enjoy it and

00:03:52.690 --> 00:04:02.250
thank you again and thank you YG for selecting
me as a runner-up for the BIG BANG Made Cover

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:03.880
event contest.

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:10.849
If you didn't know, I am a runner-up, which
is insane to me.

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:16.840
To be on the official Big Bang page, whatever.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.670
Super crazy, super excited about that, so
thank you so much.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.200
And I will see you guys with the next video.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.540
I'm not sure what it's gonna be, actually.

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:33.090
I cleared a lot of stuff out of the way, so
I start working on something new.

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:39.250

new tributes, new covers, let me know in the

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.250
