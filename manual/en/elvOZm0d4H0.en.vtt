00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.680
JAMES GRIME: We're going
to break a rule.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.920
We're break one of the
rules of Numberphile.

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.410
We're talking about something
that isn't a number.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.910
We're going to talk
about infinity.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.050
So infinity.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.070
Now like I said, infinity
is not a number.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.290
It's a idea.

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:18.270
It's a concept.

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.110
It's the idea of being endless,
of going on forever.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:23.860
I think everyone's familiar
with the idea of

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:25.320
infinity, even kids.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.580
You start counting
1, 2, 3, 4, 5--

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.180
you might be five years old, but
already you're thinking,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.230
what's the biggest number
I can think of.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.310
And you go, oooh, it's 20.

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.880
You get a bit older, and you
go, maybe it's a million.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:42.430
It never ends, does it? 'Cause
you can keep adding 1.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.600
So that's the idea
of infinity.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.170
The numbers go on forever.

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.530
But I'm going to tell you one
of the more surprising facts

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:51.490
about infinity.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:54.180
There are different
kinds of infinity.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.960
Some infinities are bigger
than others.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.620
Let's have a look.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.590
The first type of infinity
is called countable.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.610
And I don't like the
name countable.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.940
And Brady gave me a little
bit of a hmm, just then.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.270
Because if you're talking about
infinity, you can't

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.880
count infinity, can you?

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.660
Because it goes on forever.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:15.030
I think it's a terrible name.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.200
I prefer to call it listable.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.310
Can we list these numbers?

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.610
All right.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.980
Let's do these simple
numbers, 1, 2, 3--

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.340
BRADY HARAN: You're not gonna do
all of them, are you James?

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.660
JAMES GRIME: 4.

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.110
How long have we got?

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:28.020
BRADY HARAN: (LAUGHING)
10 minutes.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:28.902
JAMES GRIME: Right.

00:01:28.902 --> 00:01:31.190
5, 6--

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:33.580
so you can list the
whole numbers.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.220
So this is called countable.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.200
Listable, I prefer.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.310
What about the integers?

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:40.100
All the integers.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.920
That's all the negative
numbers as well.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:42.450
So there's 0.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.900
Let's have that.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.140
But there's 1 and minus 1,
there's 2 and minus 2, there's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.190
3, and minus 3.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.380
Now, that is an infinity
as well.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.720
And in some sense, it's twice as
big, because there seems to

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:00.680
be twice as many numbers.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.290
But it is infinity as well.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.220
They're both infinity,
and they're both the

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.590
same type of infinity.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.139
They both can be listed.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.949
Perhaps more surprisingly,
the fractions can

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:12.160
be listed as well.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.740
But you have to be a bit
clever about this.

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:15.520
Let's try and list
the fractions.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.670
I'm going to write
out a rectangle.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.065
1 divided by 1.

00:02:19.065 --> 00:02:19.770
That's a fraction.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.580
[INAUDIBLE].

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:26.480
Let's have 1 divided by
2, 1/3, 1/4, 1/7--

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.120
OK, that goes on.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.610
Let's do the next row and
have two at the top.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:34.480
2/1, 2/2, 2/3, 2/4.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:35.800
Let's do the next one.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.250
3/1, 3/2.

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.770
4/6, 4/7.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.510
That goes on and we
can keep going.

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:46.010
So here, I've made some sort of
an infinite rectangle array

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:46.710
of fractions.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:52.440
Now if I want to make it a list
like this, though, If I

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.990
went row by row, you're going
to have a problem.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.260
If you go row by
row, I'll go--

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.895
there's 1, 1/2, 1/3,
1/5, 1/6, 1/7-- and

00:03:00.895 --> 00:03:02.640
I'll keep going forever.

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.870
And I'm never going to
reach the second row.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:05.630
I can't list them.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:06.230
Not that way.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.380
You can't list them that way.

00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.930
You'll never reach
the second row.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:09.920
This is how you list them.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.340
Slightly more clever
than that.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.590
You take the diagonal lines.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.530
Now, I can guarantee that every
fraction will appear on

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:23.080
one of those diagonal lines.

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.730
And you list them diagonal
by diagonal.

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.480
So that's the first diagonal.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.470
Then you list the second
diagonal-- there it is.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:31.480
Then you list the third
diagonal, then you take the

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.340
fourth diagonal,
and the fifth.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.010
So eventually, you are going
to do this every fraction.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.210
Every faction appears on
a diagonal, and you're

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.850
going to list them.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.540
Now, if you take all
the numbers, right?

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.860
That's the whole number line.

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.325
Let's try that.

00:03:43.325 --> 00:03:44.800
Look, I'm going to draw it.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.750
It's a continuous
line of numbers.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.390
These are all your decimals.

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:50.360
You've got 0 there in the
middle, and you'll

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.130
go 1 and 2 and 3.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.900
But it has a 1/3.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:57.190
It will contain pi,
and e, and all the

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:59.240
irrational numbers as well.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.360
Can you list them?

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:01.130
How do you list them?

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.315
0 to start with, and then 1?

00:04:03.315 --> 00:04:04.120
But hang on.

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.500
We've missed a half.

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.690
So we put in the half.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:07.910
Hang on, we've missed
the quarter.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.700
We put in the quarter.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.440
But we've missed 0.237--

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:15.050
so how do you list
the real numbers?

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.329
It turns out you can't.

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.670
In fact, rather remarkably, I
can show you that we can't

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.240
list them, even though were
talking about something so

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.650
complicated as infinity.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:26.620
BRADY HARAN: Do it, man!

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:27.645
JAMES GRIME: We need paper.

00:04:27.645 --> 00:04:28.885
BRADY HARAN: We need an
infinite amount of

00:04:28.885 --> 00:04:30.810
paper here, I think.

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:31.950
JAMES GRIME: (LAUGHING)
It's a big topic.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.610
Imagine we could list all
the decimals, right?

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:37.450
We can't, actually.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.830
But pretend we can.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.470
What sort of--

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:41.970
what would it look like?

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.440
We'll start with all the
0-point decimals.

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:45.530
Let's pick some decimals.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.525
0.121--

00:04:47.525 --> 00:04:48.840
dot dot dot dot dot.

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:49.930
Let's pick the next one.

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.010
Let's say the next
one is 0.221--.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:05:00.230
Next one, let's do
0.31111129--.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.740
And let's take another
one, here.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:06.250
0.00176--.

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:09.420
Now I'm going to
make a number.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.020
This is the number I'm
going to make.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.780
I'm going to take the
diagonals here.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:16.810
I'm going to take this number
and this number and this

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.340
number and this number
and this number.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:24.160
And I am going to
write that down.

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.420
So what's that number
I've made?

00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.750
It's 0.12101--

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.690
something, something,
something.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.280
Now this is my rule.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.680
I'm going to make a whole new
number from that one.

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.840
This is the number I'm
going to make.

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.890
If it has a 1, I'm going
to change it to a 2.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:52.340
And if it has a 2 or anything
else, I will change it to a 1.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.792
So let's try that.

00:05:53.792 --> 00:05:55.970
So I'm going to turn
this into--

00:05:55.970 --> 00:05:56.160
0-point.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.390
So if it has a 1, I'm going
to turn it into a 2.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.980
If it's anything else, I'm going
to turn it into a 1.

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.370
So that will be a 1.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:06.130
I'm going to change
1 here into a 2.

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:07.830
I'm going to change
that one into a 1.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:10.960
I'm going to change that one
into a 2-- that was my rule.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.950
And I'll make something new.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:15.240
That does not appear
on the list.

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:18.210
That number is completely
different from anything else

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:22.150
on the list, because it's not
the first number, because it's

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.170
different in the first place.

00:06:24.170 --> 00:06:26.680
It's not the second number,
because it's different in

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.990
second place.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.460
It's not the third number,
because it's different in the

00:06:30.460 --> 00:06:31.560
third place.

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.670
It's not the fourth number
because it's different in the

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:35.060
fourth place.

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.120
It's not the fifth number,
because it's different in the

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.080
fifth place.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:40.340
You've made a number that's
not on that list.

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:45.570
And so you can't list all the
decimals, in which case it is

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.560
uncountable.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.820
It is unlistable.

00:06:47.820 --> 00:06:51.280
And that means it's a whole
new type of infinity.

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:54.150
A bigger type of infinity.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:54.770
BRADY HARAN: Surely we could,
James, because all we've got

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:58.260
to do is keep doing your game
and making them and adding

00:06:58.260 --> 00:06:58.950
them to the list.

00:06:58.950 --> 00:07:01.660
And if we keep doing that, won't
we get there eventually?

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:03.460
JAMES GRIME: But you could then
create another number

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:04.580
that won't be on that list.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:06.960
And so the guy who came up with
is a German mathematician

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:08.330
called Cantor.

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:11.480
Cantor lived 'round about the
turn of the 20th century.

00:07:11.480 --> 00:07:14.390
He was ridiculed for this.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:17.900
For this idea that there were
different types of infinity,

00:07:17.900 --> 00:07:19.910
he was called a charlatan.

00:07:19.910 --> 00:07:22.840
And he was called-- it was
nonsense, it was called.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:27.590
And poor old Cantor was treated
really badly by his

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:32.810
contemporaries, and he spent a
lot of his later life in and

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:37.900
out of mental institutions,
where he died, in the end.

00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:39.860
Near the end of his life,
it was recognized.

00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:40.600
It was true.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.600
It was recognized.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.190
And he had all the recognition
that he deserved.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.390
BRADY HARAN: And now he's
on Numberphile.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:47.750
JAMES GRIME: And now he's on
Numberphile, the greatest

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:49.340
accolade of all.

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:50.590
Georg Cantor.
