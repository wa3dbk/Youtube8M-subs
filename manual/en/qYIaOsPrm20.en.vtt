Hi, my name is Melanie

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.040
I am 17 years old. I go to Western International High School

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.060
I live in Detroit, Michigan.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:16.070
and I am finally a senior, and I just can't wait till I graduate.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.080
This is my room. I pretty much don't have any of my posters and stuff up because we're moving.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.090
So, I kind of took almost everything down. I was

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.100
in the Greece play, and this is my "Pink Ladies" jacket.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.140
I was one of the main people in it. 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.170
I am a Nintendo freak, and I love swimming.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.210
We are 4th in state right now. So, we're

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.250
doing pretty good. The most thing that's hard for me

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.280
is pretty much doing homework.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.310
and reading. I have a ... 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.340
it's called lead poisoning and I was

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.380
born with it. So, school work

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.410
and papers and stuff like that, that holds me back

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.440
because it's like, one, I am a really slow reader.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.470
Two, I can't really comprehend most things.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.500
And three, I have a speech disability. So,

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.540
I have an individual education plan.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.580
And what it is, is everything I am going through, everything

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.620
You know I need, or what I don't need, what helps me, what doesn't

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.650
help me. 
 When I was younger, in 5th

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.690
I think that the 4th grade, I used to get teased a lot because

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.720
I was in special ed. Then when I hit 6th and 7th and 8th grade

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.750
I used to get teased even more. I used to hate telling people

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.790
I am going to Miss Harper's class. Because everyone knew Miss Harper was the

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.820
special ed teacher. So I used to always keep it really really quiet.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.830
And then when kids started finding out, they were like, "Oh, she's special

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.840
ed, Oh you're special". When I hit 10th and

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.850
11th grade this year, I was like I don't know if

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:08.860
I still want to finish school, because

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.890
all my friends were still saying I was special ed.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.920
Sports and computers just help me get through it. When I am on the computer

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.940
it's like, I don't have to worry about speeding it up

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.960
or hear someone say "now you're going to slow", or "now you're doing this wrong"

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.980
or "you're doing that wrong" 
 There has been times where I just wanted to

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.990
quit school. There has been times I did not want to be in school anymore.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:37.010
The making fun of, the teachers not

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.020
understanding, the people nagging

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.040
at me all the time. "Oh you can't read" all this.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.050
All of that. There has been times I told my Mom and Dad I can't

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.060
do it. I don't want to do it.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:57.070
This disability thing is going to be with me all of my life.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.090
My biggest worry is if this

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:05.100
follows me, is it going to

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.110
affect where I try to work

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:13.130
or where I want to be, or 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.140
even if I were to got out of state or

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.160
if I were to keep on working with computers and stuff?

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.170
would that affect me? That's the thing I am really worried about.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:28.420
Is if my disability still going to affect me.
