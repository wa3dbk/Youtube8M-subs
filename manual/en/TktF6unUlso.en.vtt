00:00:01.707 --> 00:00:02.966
- (Voiceover) Most people have faced times

00:00:02.966 --> 00:00:04.433
in their lives when they simply cannot

00:00:04.433 --> 00:00:06.833
carry out all the
obligations of the status.

00:00:06.833 --> 00:00:09.633
And the tension between
roles in one status,

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:12.186
is called role strain.

00:00:12.186 --> 00:00:13.800
Role strain causes an individual

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.333
to be pulled in many directions

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:18.400
by the many responsibilities
of one single status.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.433
So, an example would be a student.

00:00:20.433 --> 00:00:22.766
Let's say this student has to write

00:00:22.766 --> 00:00:25.633
two papers, finish five
reading assignments,

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:27.733
for separate classes, give a speech,

00:00:27.733 --> 00:00:29.366
study for a midterm exam,

00:00:29.366 --> 00:00:31.866
and do two lab reports in one week.

00:00:31.866 --> 00:00:33.567
So they're being pulled
in many different ways

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:36.666
by this one status; the
status of being a student.

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:39.166
On the other hand, there's
what's called role conflict.

00:00:39.166 --> 00:00:41.267
This is talking about the conflict between

00:00:41.267 --> 00:00:43.800
the roles of two, or
more, social statuses.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.300
So I want to be clear when I say

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.000
between statuses, this is not

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.200
an individual status, like before.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.833
So, let's take a look
at this guy, right here,

00:00:51.833 --> 00:00:53.333
and look at a few different scenarios

00:00:53.333 --> 00:00:55.533
to understand role conflict.

00:00:55.533 --> 00:00:57.633
So this man has many different statuses.

00:00:57.633 --> 00:01:00.066
He's a student, he's a husband,

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:04.271
he's a friend, he's a worker,
and he's also a parent.

00:01:04.271 --> 00:01:07.300
These different statuses
can compete for his time.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.533
So, let's say he gets a
call from one of his buddies

00:01:09.533 --> 00:01:12.056
and they're very excited for their

00:01:12.056 --> 00:01:13.533
monthly get together.

00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:16.519
They usually go golfing once a month.

00:01:16.519 --> 00:01:18.167
He just gets a reminder on his phone

00:01:18.167 --> 00:01:21.000
that says hey, tomorrow
is your anniversary.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.833
So, his status as a husband,

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:25.800
should be more important
than his status as a friend,

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.624
if he's smart in this case.

00:01:28.624 --> 00:01:30.966
So, let's take a look at
another scenario, here.

00:01:30.966 --> 00:01:32.700
Let's say a week later,
that he has a paper

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.266
to do for school, but he finds out that

00:01:34.266 --> 00:01:37.733
his son was injured and he may
need to go to the hospital.

00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:39.600
So, in this case, his status as a parent

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.400
my take precedence over
his status as a student,

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.300
cause he's concerned
for his child's health.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.800
So in a final example, let's say that he

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.400
had a big meeting Monday,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.000
but his wife wanted him
to clean the garage.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.667
So, in this instance,
his status as a husband

00:01:54.667 --> 00:01:56.733
and as a worker come into conflict.

00:01:56.733 --> 00:01:58.966
If his job depends on his performance

00:01:58.966 --> 00:02:00.333
in the meeting, he will probably

00:02:00.333 --> 00:02:01.733
choose to focus more energy

00:02:01.733 --> 00:02:03.666
on his job and his presentation,

00:02:03.666 --> 00:02:05.771
then in this case on being a husband

00:02:05.771 --> 00:02:07.266
and cleaning out the garage.

00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:08.833
So role strain is tension between

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:13.071
the roles of one single
status, like student,

00:02:13.071 --> 00:02:15.500
and role conflict involves the conflict

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.903
between roles of two or more statuses.
