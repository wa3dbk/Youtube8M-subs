00:00:53.212 --> 00:00:54.909
- Hey, what's up my best friend?
- Hey Ron!

00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:55.845
Who's this guy?

00:00:55.846 --> 00:00:58.786
I don't know, he was here when I got here,
he's asleep and I think he's homeless.

00:01:00.323 --> 00:01:01.236
Gross.

00:01:02.711 --> 00:01:04.915
We kinda got separated at
the train station and...

00:01:04.916 --> 00:01:06.359
you forgot this.

00:01:06.854 --> 00:01:09.622
You know man, everyone in the
wizarding world loves my scar.

00:01:09.959 --> 00:01:11.419
Why don't you keep it?

00:01:13.621 --> 00:01:14.860
Really?

00:01:16.014 --> 00:01:17.125
Wow!

00:01:20.685 --> 00:01:22.331
- Looks good, man.
- Thanks.

00:01:25.026 --> 00:01:27.782
- Damn it, now I wanna give you something...
- No, it's okay...

00:01:30.137 --> 00:01:31.041
D'you wanna rat?

00:01:31.885 --> 00:01:34.531
- It's... it's my rat.
- Oh, your rat! Hi!

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.409
His name's Scabbers

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.389
and he's been in my family for like...

00:01:40.591 --> 00:01:41.882
a hundred years.

00:01:41.883 --> 00:01:45.644
In fact I think my parents found
him the same night your parents died.

00:01:45.668 --> 00:01:47.502
- Weird!
- I know, weird.

00:01:48.343 --> 00:01:51.124
- Hey, d'you wanna a Berty Bott's everyflavoured candy bean?
- Sure!

00:01:51.462 --> 00:01:53.255
They have every flavour
in the entire world.

00:01:53.256 --> 00:01:55.136
They even have a poopy flavoured one,

00:01:55.137 --> 00:01:59.002
but it's so rare you'll never
be lucky enough to get it.

00:01:59.217 --> 00:02:01.849
- What'd you get?
- Broken computer?

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:04.583
That's gross.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.611
I can't even remember the last
time I got a candy flavoured one.

00:02:09.506 --> 00:02:11.758
- What have you got?
- Defeat.

00:02:17.897 --> 00:02:19.447
Well, I give up on these...

00:02:20.988 --> 00:02:25.039
Hey! What if we wash these beans down with
some of the greatest snacks in the entire world?

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:26.666
Red Vines!

00:02:28.408 --> 00:02:30.185
And I got them right here in my bag...

00:02:34.784 --> 00:02:37.799
Crookshanks! Oh! Bad Crookie!

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:43.057
Sorry! Sometimes he just crawls
into the darndest places...

00:02:43.999 --> 00:02:45.748
It's okay. But just next time why d...

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:47.381
Oh my god! Night Troll!!!

00:02:50.607 --> 00:02:53.526
I'm not a Night Troll!
I'm a little girl!

00:02:53.941 --> 00:02:55.757
My name's Hermione Granger.

00:02:57.862 --> 00:02:59.497
Jimminy Crickets!

00:02:59.498 --> 00:03:01.146
You're Harry Potter!

00:03:01.465 --> 00:03:03.416
Oh, yeah! Weird, right?

00:03:04.156 --> 00:03:05.621
Oh! I'm such a big fan!

00:03:05.622 --> 00:03:07.833
Say, would you sign my petition?

00:03:08.206 --> 00:03:09.827
- Sure...
- No! No, he doesn't want to!

00:03:13.362 --> 00:03:16.154
I'm collecting signatures
for house elf sufferage.

00:03:16.198 --> 00:03:21.134
You see, I just think it's awful that some creatures
in the wizarding world aren't treated equally,

00:03:21.135 --> 00:03:25.543
just because they were born as ugly sickly
little creatures with big dump noses.

00:03:25.544 --> 00:03:26.958
And I think that we -

00:03:27.188 --> 00:03:28.739
I mean the elfs -

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:30.659
are just as good as anybody.

00:03:30.882 --> 00:03:33.643
Not to mention the world just
isn't made for those little guys.

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:37.778
Did you know over sixhundred house elfes
die in toilet-related incidents every year?

00:03:39.094 --> 00:03:40.389
Stop talking.

00:03:40.922 --> 00:03:43.556
- I'll sign it, just don't send me an e-mail.
- Oh no, I won't!

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:45.627
- Thanks, Harry!
- There you go...

00:03:45.628 --> 00:03:48.386
Hey, are we the first people you've asked?
There's only one other name on here...

00:03:48.438 --> 00:03:49.822
That is my name.

00:03:49.823 --> 00:03:52.296
Oh! Well then, there you go...

00:03:53.188 --> 00:03:55.076
Her-my-ONE...

00:03:57.346 --> 00:03:58.732
Wow!

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:00.696
So Harry Potter,

00:04:00.845 --> 00:04:02.406
did you really grow
up in the muggle world?

00:04:02.407 --> 00:04:04.931
Yeah. Found out that I was a
wizard like two minutes ago.

00:04:06.453 --> 00:04:08.521
Yeah. I grew up in the muggle world too.

00:04:08.522 --> 00:04:10.944
My parents are Muggles.
Muggle-dentists.

00:04:10.945 --> 00:04:13.350
Candy from the trolley?

00:04:13.991 --> 00:04:17.101
I'm ever so excited to
finally go to Hogwarts!

00:04:17.102 --> 00:04:19.720
Yeah, it's cos Hogwarts is the
best place in the entire world...

00:04:19.721 --> 00:04:24.215
Well, yeah. And to be tought by so many great
witches and wizards like Albus Dumbledore.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.028
Who's... who the hell
is Albus Dumbledore?

00:04:26.491 --> 00:04:28.920
He's only the bestest, most bravest...

00:04:28.921 --> 00:04:30.303
Most wisest, most talented...

00:04:30.304 --> 00:04:33.502
- ...beautiful...
- most beautiful wizard that ever lived.

00:04:33.503 --> 00:04:35.760
Candy from the trolley?

00:04:36.128 --> 00:04:39.993
And my dream of dreams is to
some day graduate top of my class.

00:04:40.038 --> 00:04:43.071
Candy from the trolley...!

00:04:50.502 --> 00:04:52.226
Candy from the trolley?

00:04:53.754 --> 00:04:55.043
Yes!

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:56.795
At last!

00:04:56.819 --> 00:04:58.548
My parents say that
candy's bad for your teeth.

00:04:58.549 --> 00:05:00.068
Avada...

00:05:00.069 --> 00:05:01.639
Expelliarmus!

00:05:09.213 --> 00:05:11.246
Take that, you bastard-ass!

00:05:15.586 --> 00:05:16.954
Oh God, damn it!

00:05:17.904 --> 00:05:19.381
At least I still have a...

00:05:19.382 --> 00:05:21.862
Oh! No... what? Where did it go?

00:05:24.927 --> 00:05:26.120
Shit!

00:05:28.209 --> 00:05:29.575
No, that's piss.

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:32.061
Wait, was I drinking piss?

00:05:33.098 --> 00:05:34.948
You must be Harry Potter!

00:05:37.475 --> 00:05:39.643
You just... why did
you kill the candy lady?

00:05:40.218 --> 00:05:41.999
No, kids!...Kids! Stop it!

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.475
Kids! Don't be afraid of me!

00:05:45.215 --> 00:05:49.102
I'm not dangerous and
I'm not homeless anymore.

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:52.775
My name is Remus Lupin.

00:05:52.776 --> 00:05:54.757
I'm your new Defense
Against the Dark Arts teacher

00:05:54.758 --> 00:05:57.209
and that so called candy
lady was a Deatheater.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.989
She was about two seconds
away from killing you,

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:01.048
your little friend and
his pet Night Troll.

00:06:02.856 --> 00:06:04.273
What's a deatheater? What is that?

00:06:04.274 --> 00:06:06.003
It's a servant
of You-Know-Who!

00:06:06.004 --> 00:06:07.496
I figured a few might
show off when they learned

00:06:07.497 --> 00:06:09.740
that Harry Potter was
was headed to Hogwarts.

00:06:09.741 --> 00:06:12.015
They can be real hardass dickheads!

00:06:14.079 --> 00:06:15.565
What's the matter with you, guys?

00:06:15.684 --> 00:06:17.203
Oh, shit!

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:18.875
You guys are kids!

00:06:18.994 --> 00:06:21.329
Better watch my damn mouth
around you little bastards.

00:06:21.776 --> 00:06:23.424
I'm... I'm sorry.

00:06:23.998 --> 00:06:25.238
Shoot.

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:27.567
I gotta watch my damn mouth
around you little guys.

00:06:30.124 --> 00:06:32.156
Hey! Looks like the train stopped.

00:06:32.773 --> 00:06:34.613
- We're here!
- That's sudden.

00:06:38.435 --> 00:06:39.946
Harry. Come here.

00:06:39.947 --> 00:06:41.137
Listen, this year...

00:06:41.138 --> 00:06:45.046
I don't want you to be worried about
deatheaters or that Sirius Black or...

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.329
or werewolfs or anything else
that could kill you right now.

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:51.285
Alright? Because as long as
you're at Hogwarts with me

00:06:51.286 --> 00:06:54.676
and headmaster Dumbledore there to
protect you, you're perfectly safe.

00:06:54.721 --> 00:06:57.488
Trust me, Harry. No one
at Hogwarts hates you.

00:06:57.489 --> 00:07:00.090
What the devil is going on here?
