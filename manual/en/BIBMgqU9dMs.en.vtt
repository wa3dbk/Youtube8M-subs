00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.440
Websites in HTML 5

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.340
Every user of the Internet knows what HTML
is. But not all of them know that HTML5 is

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.720
not just a new version of a web-language -- it
is a new era in web development.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.539
Additional features of HTML 5 are intended
for creating of web applications and interactive

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.000
websites, forms interaction, connection to
websites with multimedia content, works with

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.340
programming interfaces and structuring of
documents.

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.510
Where to apply HTML5
Structural features of HTML5 make the structure

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.019
of a web document simpler and a code cleaner.
New semantic elements: header, nav, section,

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.070
article, aside, and footer can be used instead
of container div, now applied in HTML4.0.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.210
HTML5 multimedia capabilities make the use
of Adobe Flash and many other additional programs

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.470
unnecessary. Music and video can be played
directly in browser. It is more comfortable

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.260
to publicate photos and images without any
additional programs that are required for

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.210
the same action in HTML 4.0.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.460
Entering data into HTML5 becomes easier and
safer. The correctness of data fed is controlled

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:01.260
in real time directly during the input. The
error checking and reporting thereon in HTML4

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.640
occurs only after the sending of a document,
it can provide some problems to a user.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.970
Appearance. A text and an image become one
unit. Display capabilities of images and text

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.920
are completely changed on the websites. With
HTML5, developers have new opportunities for

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.950
webdesign that allow you to make them no less
beautiful than the glossy magazines are.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.210
Graphics and animation. A new function Canvas
allows you to place animations, graphics with

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.530
changing content and small games directly
on websites. When using HTML4 it requires

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.210
additional software, for example, Adobe Flash.
There is a possibility of creating user interfaces

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.930
and games of completely new level via Canvas.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.070
But even in HTML5 there is an exception

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.970
The vulnerability of HTML5 in data protection.
Such vulnerability is created by a larger

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.710
volume of data that is stored on user's hard
drive for a long time. This fact makes it

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:37.500
possible to gather the information about the
user quietly.

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.970
Multimedia and games. Many developers complain
about the poor performance the content created

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.260
with HTML5, limitations of platforms in use,
increasing costs in terms of resources and

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.880
time, etc.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.760
Browsers. Until recently, not all browsers
supported HTML5. But today, it is perceived

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.229
even by conservative IE. Other browsers have
made it since long ago. But a leader in this

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.550
area is Google. The new 18th version of a
browser Chrome has been recently released,

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.670
it added a new module Canvas 2D, which uses
the brightest feature of HTML5 -- a tag canvas,

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.990
which allows to replace Flash technologies
on the Internet.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:13.450
But in spite of all the drawbacks of a test
version HTML5 the "Internet giants" begin

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.209
to use this version very actively. Such as
Google, YouTube, etc.

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:17.930
HTML5 specification

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.430
The beginning of a hard way of HTML5 standardization
project was initiated in 2007 and continues

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.190
still this moment. According to W3C schedule,
it was assumed that HTML5 will receive the

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.280
status of "recommended" from W3C at the end
of 2010, but for this project it was necessary

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.810
to obtain the approval of Last Call and Candidate
Recommendation. HTML5 received the Last Call

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.750
support in October 2009. The question of Candidate
Recommendation is much more complicated, but

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.270
the editor of this specification Ian Hickson
assures that the approval will be obtained

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:49.069
in 2012 or later.

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.709
Examples of implementation

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.599
1. Google Inc. did its best for the new standard
of language on the Internet appeared. The

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.720
front page of Google website is often used
as its advertising. Here's how it looks like

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.900
when this page uses HTML5, it is intended
to congratulate Hong Kong residents.Visit

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.069
http://www.google.com.hk/intl/zh-CN/landing/shuixia/
and scroll down just below the water level.

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.090
You will get a lot of fun. Throughout the
rest - it's a completely normal Google home

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:16.650
page. This is not the only example of such
kind, on Stanislaw Lem's birthday Google home

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.410
page was a cute arcade game based on Cyberiada.

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:25.250
2. The best way to learn is playing. Here
is an example of a wonderful website http://html5game.ru/.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:29.980
I like especially the top of the site. When
the cursor hovers over it, it breaks up into

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.580
a couple of balls, and then it goes back.
Online games represented there (which are

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.950
regularly renewed) basically repeat well-known
flash games, although the loading is noticeably

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:42.220
faster. As for me, the best way to learn a
new language is trying to produce a new game

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.470
on it.

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:44.650
3. Interactive graphic editor at http://www.picozu.com/editor.
By possibilities it is slightly larger than

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.150
the standard Paint, but the possibility of
drawing impresses itself, using tools of HTML5.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.330
What we saw, leads to certain thoughts

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:59.110
1. Visually it looks like the most used feature
is a tag HTML5 canvas. It allows to create

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:03.970
such spectacular graphics.
2. The download time of such websites is still

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.930
imposing. Considerably less than for a flash,
but nevertheless...

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.959
3. The PC characteristics should be better.
4. This splendor is still at the experimental

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:18.239
stage so far and this is weird.
5. Not spectacular things such as effects

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.249
of new tags for website optimisation are still
invisible.
