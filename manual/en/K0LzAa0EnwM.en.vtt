Hi, it’s Jenny, from the Missouri Star Quilt
Company, and I’ve got a couple of fun projects

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:17.750
for you today. We have this new Jelly Roll
from Westminster Lifestyle Products. It’s

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.320
actually called a Design Roll, and it’s
the Christmas Snow Flower collection, and

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.750
it is darling!

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:29.519
As you can see in these quilts that I’ve
done, I’ve put them together in a couple

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.530
of easy projects and I’d like to show you
how to do those right now. You’re going

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.180
to unwrap your Jelly Roll and lay them out,
because it’s mostly red, and green, and

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:45.420
white, you are going to put your strips together.
Red and greens opposing, and stitch ¼”

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.420
along all the side.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.660
Now, remember when you’re sewing long strips
if you sew this one going this

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.370
way, the next set you want to sew going the
opposite way. So, if you’ll go with me over

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.412
to the sewing machine we’ll sew these together.
Here we are at the sewing machine and we’re

00:00:58.412 --> 00:01:06.770
going to sew ¼” seam and sew these two
together. The fun part about these strips

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:12.240
is that you sew two together, then you sew
four together, and then you sew eight together,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.299
and your pieces get bigger really fast. So,
let’s finish up this strip.

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:23.460
Now, were going to iron it, and what we’ll
do remember, we press it down and then fold

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.740
the dark side up, and in these there’s not
a lot of darks and lights. So, you just have

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.210
to decide which side you want your seam to
go to.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.060
So, we’ll iron that and then we’ll attach
a couple more rows together and you’ll see

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.329
that piece get bigger and bigger really quick.
So, now we have this whole strip set sewn

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.619
together. That’s the miracles of modern
filming! The

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.860
strip set is sewn together and what we’re
going to do is we’re going to even up one

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.100
end so that we have an end to start with.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:55.079
So, we’ll take our ruler, and we’re going
to put it over here. Now remember I’m left-handed,

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.070
so this is going to come at a different direction
for some of you. You may want to start on

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:09.479
the other side, and I’m going to take a
healthy chunk off, so that I can make sure

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:14.340
that I get all these little salvage edges
off.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.260
So I have a straight line. So, the first thing
we’re going to make with this strip set,

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:29.650
oh, excuse me, my blade must not be very sharp.
That’s alright, those things happen in the

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:36.840
quilt shop. Here we go, so, now we have a
nice straight edge, and we’re going to start

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.890
with this table runner first. Now, I’m probably
reinventing the wheel, and I’m sure there’s

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:49.459
a pattern for this, but I tend to be one of
those that thinks off the cuff.

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.409
So, I’ll see a little thing and I’ll think,
“Oh, I can do a little table runner out

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:59.200
of that!” So, what I did was, I decided
how wide my table, I wanted my table runner

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:07.019
to be, and this is approximately 12” wide,
so I took and cut a 12” chunk. Then I took

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:16.099
a 2 ½” strip of white and framed it, took
a 4 ½” strip of a corresponding, matching

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:22.239
color, and did the border around it, and then
I quilted it, and then I did the little scalloped

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.900
edge on it. You can see the scalloped edge
here on the end, and it just came out really

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:26.900
darling.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:36.530
So, let’s go ahead and cut that strip. One,
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:46.980
nine, ten, eleven, twelve. Hillary will you
come put your finger up underneath on the

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:52.680
end there? There we go it always helps to
have somebody help you. Here we go, we’re

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.800
going to cut this 12” strip. Let me run
that by there again. There we go, and then

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:05.030
we’re going to slide that apart, and you
can see the beginning of a really darling

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:10.029
table runner that showcases the entire line
of fabrics.
