00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.533
- A few weeks ago,

00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:03.666
we surprised a viewer
named Sandra Smith

00:00:03.666 --> 00:00:04.900
and her three best friends

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.500
with a trip to Napa Valley
thanks to Airbnb.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.866
Over 30 million travelers
have used Airbnb

00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:12.300
because it's a great way
to plan your perfect getaway.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.666
They offer more
than 1 million properties

00:00:14.666 --> 00:00:18.100
in more than 34,000 cities
in 190 countries.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.866
We wanted to make sure
Sandra and her friends

00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:21.033
had everything
they needed,

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:23.066
so we sent one person
who was available.

00:00:23.066 --> 00:00:25.600
The only person who
was available was Ari, our PA.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.200
Sorry about that.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:28.533
Here's what happened.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.566
- Is makeup
coming by later?

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:40.200
That's a big car.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.466
all: Hi!

00:00:41.466 --> 00:00:42.633
[women cheer]

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:44.700
- [speaking indistinctly]

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.000
- Well, guys, welcome
to the Airbnb house.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.533
- All right!
- Whoo!

00:00:48.533 --> 00:00:50.533
- It's, you know,
nice architecture and stuff.

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:52.766
[all talking at once]

00:00:52.766 --> 00:00:54.300
- Oh, you guys
are loud.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.733
You guys go in.
I'll get your luggage for you.

00:00:56.733 --> 00:00:58.433
'Cause Ellen's
basically having me--

00:00:58.433 --> 00:00:59.966
- She said that you were
working for us.

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.333
- Right, I work
for you guys.

00:01:03.033 --> 00:01:04.033
- [gasps]

00:01:04.033 --> 00:01:05.733
- Oh, my goodness.

00:01:05.733 --> 00:01:09.766
- Oh, my goodness.
- That's what I'm talking about.

00:01:09.766 --> 00:01:11.100
- Holy [bleep].

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.000
They all packed lightly.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.066
- Uh-oh,
uh-oh, uh-oh!

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.666
[all talking at once]

00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:20.633
- I'm coming.

00:01:20.633 --> 00:01:23.233
- The view
is just outstanding.

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:24.666
- It's awesome.

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.166
- [grunts]

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.000
I'll get you guys
some snacks.

00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:33.266
Sorry.

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:39.833
You guys like mild salsa roja
or hot salsa roja?

00:01:39.833 --> 00:01:42.900
- Oh, goodness.
- Whoo!

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.733
- God, it's warmer
than I thought.

00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:48.600
Actually, this is kind of fun.
- Oh, that's cute.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.966
- Your feet smell good.

00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:52.466
- Ari.
- Yeah.

00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:55.800
- I think
that's too much.

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.900
- This is what the Greeks
used to do.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.766
- Yeah?
- I think so.

00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:01.400
I don't like
being massaged.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.633
- No?
- No.

00:02:02.633 --> 00:02:04.466
- Oh, I love massages.
- I don't like massages.

00:02:04.466 --> 00:02:06.033
I don't like oil.

00:02:06.033 --> 00:02:07.700
I'm very ticklish,

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:09.500
you know,
and I'm easily frightened.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.200
- You're very fair,
and I don't want you to burn.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.866
Close your eyes.
- Oh, my God!

00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:16.566
Oh, my God.

00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:17.866
- Come on, now.
I'm doing my best.

00:02:17.866 --> 00:02:19.033
- Is there
tanning elements?

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:20.233
I feel like it's like--

00:02:20.233 --> 00:02:22.100
- You're gonna be my color
in a minute.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.666
[laughter]

00:02:24.666 --> 00:02:27.233
- If you get me drunk
and then play, like, EDM music,

00:02:27.233 --> 00:02:28.900
I'm--that's it;
I'm gone.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.100
It's like Rosh Hashanah
all over again.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:33.966
So this wine was made
around the corner?

00:02:33.966 --> 00:02:35.300
- Right here.
Right here.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.533
- A small sip
or a large gulp?

00:02:37.533 --> 00:02:38.666
- Little sip.

00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:39.900
- Well, that's good.
All right.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.333
What do we got next?

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.000
Oh, it's getting better.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.100
Just to let
you guys know,

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.566
I have not poured it
in the bucket yet.

00:02:48.566 --> 00:02:50.333
- Oh, we know this.
I noticed that.

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:52.400
- I have a high capacity
for bubbly wine

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.000
because I drink
a lot of seltzer.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.466
- Oh.

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:56.766
- Drop it
like it's hot!

00:02:56.766 --> 00:02:59.533
[all cheer]

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:02.766
- I guess whoever knocks it over
has to drink their shot.

00:03:02.766 --> 00:03:04.433
- [laughs]

00:03:04.433 --> 00:03:06.100
[all cheer]

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.800
- Jenga!

00:03:11.233 --> 00:03:12.433
[laughter]

00:03:12.433 --> 00:03:15.033
- Oh, my God,
people drink that for fun?

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:17.066
- Tip-toeing.
- Tip-toeing.

00:03:17.066 --> 00:03:19.933
- Balancing.
Tip-toe.

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:22.933
- Bad feet, bad feet.
- Pass!

00:03:24.966 --> 00:03:26.300
- [laughs]

00:03:28.133 --> 00:03:29.633
- Oh!

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.333
[all talking at once]

00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:38.333
- It went down quickly.
It's carbonated.

00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:42.666
- Take each day
as it comes.

00:03:42.666 --> 00:03:45.500
Don't try
and create havoc.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.400
- Should I do something
different with my hair?

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.833
- Thank you, Ellen.
We had an amazing time.

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:56.433
And Ari
took great care of us.

00:03:56.433 --> 00:03:58.033
- We love Ari.

00:03:58.033 --> 00:04:01.466
- And thanks to Airbnb,
I made four great new friends.

00:04:01.466 --> 00:04:03.033
all: Thank you, Ellen!

00:04:03.033 --> 00:04:04.566
- Thank you, Ellen.

00:04:04.566 --> 00:04:07.566
[cheers and applause]

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:12.266
- That's nice.

00:04:12.266 --> 00:04:13.500
And since you were
good sports,

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:15.166
our friends at Airbnb
want to give you each

00:04:15.166 --> 00:04:18.700
a $350 gift card
to plan your next vacation,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.700
and...

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.466
- Thank you, Ellen.
We love you!

00:04:22.466 --> 00:04:24.000
[cheers]

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
[cheers and applause]

00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:31.200
- All right, there's one
for each of you,

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.833
so take--

00:04:32.833 --> 00:04:34.900
- No matter where you go,
Airbnb provides

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:36.533
a truly unique
local experience,

00:04:36.533 --> 00:04:37.866
creating a sense
of belonging,

00:04:37.866 --> 00:04:39.966
and one more thing,
Airbnb wants to give

00:04:39.966 --> 00:04:43.633
everyone in the audience
a $350 gift card.

00:04:43.633 --> 00:04:46.633
[cheers and applause]
