00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:06.390
Hi, my name is Kenny Saylors. I'm here on
Expert Village.com to teach you how to understand

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:13.080
the great game of American football. The next
way to advance the football down the field

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:22.240
to make a first down or a touchdown is passing.
This means throwing the ball to a teammate

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:29.010
who's already down the field. This means the
quarterback throws the ball in a forward motion

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.989
over the shoulder in front of him. As we talked
about with rushing, you can pitch it behind

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.539
you, but if you pitch it in front of you,
that's called a forward lateral and that's

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:48.429
illegal. You can't do that. If you're going
to throw it forward you

00:00:48.429 --> 00:01:00.039
have to throw a forward pass over the shoulder.
On passing plays the offense can only throw

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:09.050
the ball once per play and only from behind
the line of scrimmage. The line of scrimmage

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:18.790
is where the ball is going to be snapped from.
As long as they are behind the line of scrimmage,

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.960
the quarterback can throw the ball. He can
even pitch it to the running back and the

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:28.670
running back can stop and throw the ball himself.
The ball can be thrown, pitched, handed off,

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.210
tossed sideways or backwards at any time,
as long as the ball is behind the line of

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:45.690
scrimmage. In pass plays, you have your wide
receivers and your tight ends available to

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.370
do pass plays. The quarterback comes back,
he sets back up, tight ends and receivers

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:55.920
can run patterns. Passing plays are how you
really make some yardage down the field. A

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.979
lot of times you can run out and do short
patterns and throw people off. It's really

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.590
done because you can make long passes. Some
people even make 80 yard plays and touchdowns

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:11.510
off of passes. The quarterback has to throw
the ball forward, not backwards.
