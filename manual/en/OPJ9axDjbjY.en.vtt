00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.750
Hello, DisneyCarToys here, and today I'm going
to show you how to braid Rapunzel's hair to

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.750
look like Elsa.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:06.750
Yay!

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.510
Elsa hair!

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:14.230
Let's take a look at this Elsa doll just so
we know how to do her hair.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.390
You can see all of her hair is slicked back
and there's a little rubber band on top.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.860
We'll do that.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:26.130
And the rest of the hair is French braided
down, and it curves slightly to her left.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.510
Now the rubber bands I'm using actually come
right off the Barbie dolls.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.630
All of the packages have rubber bands that
hold them in and hold on their shoes.

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:37.510
I'm just going to use these rubber bands on
Rapunzel's feet.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.510
Okay, let the hair styling begin.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:47.610
What we're going to do is just grab the front
part of her hair, just all the way around,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.280
and grab the hair that's at the front of her
face, and we're going to pull this back with

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.579
a little rubber band.

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:57.539
Almost like a half pony tail.

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.140
And you want it to poof a little bit, so it
will look nice and thick like Elsa's hair.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.539
And I'll wrap the rubber band around it.

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:10.999
This step is key, because a lot of people
think that Elsa's hair is just a French braid,

00:01:10.999 --> 00:01:14.139
but no, you have to do this little poof on
top first.

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:19.969
Now that I have her hair pulled back in the
half ponytail, I'll start the French braid.

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:23.620
And to do the French braid, you just want
to grab the hair, little by little, you see

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.700
how I just grabbed a small piece from the
one side.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.310
Now I'll grab a small piece from the other.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.209
You don't want to grab all of the hair at
once, because that's just a normal braid.

00:01:34.209 --> 00:01:38.711
There's a small piece, and for the middle
section of the braid, I'll just grab the section

00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:42.810
from the half ponytail I made, and a little
section and a little bit of hair from underneath

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.689
that ponytail.

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.899
Now that I have my three sections of hair,
I can finally start braiding.

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:53.649
Just put the side pieces over the middle piece.

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:59.829
After you do one section, just grab a little
more hair from the side.

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.489
I'm going to put it on the end piece here.

00:02:03.489 --> 00:02:05.819
See that's just a small section.

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:12.250
And then do the same thing on the other side,
grab a little bit of hair.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.519
Add it to your section, and we'll do another
braid.

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:20.019
The hair does get a little tangled.

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:21.049
Get it?

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:22.180
Rapunzel, tangled.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.489
Anyway, but it's not too bad.

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:30.299
Just continue working down, grabbing a little
piece from each side, to make the French braid.

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:35.670
And when doing the French braid, make sure
to hold the hair pretty tight, just so you

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.330
don't have any loose hairs.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.860
Now as we get closer to the bottom of her
scalp, we'll stop doing a French braid, and

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:44.860
start doing a normal one.

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:50.739
See, I'm grabbing all the hair that's left,
and now all the hair that's on Rapunzel is

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:53.790
in the three pieces that I'm braiding.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:58.140
Now I'll just do a normal braid.

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:14.040
(background music)
And 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.440
once we get to the bottom here, we can tie
it off.

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.219
Just use a little rubber band.

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:29.510
And voila, Rapunzel now has Disney Frozen
Elsa hair.

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.840
I love the French braid in your hair.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:33.510
It looks so clean and fresh.

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.239
You can see on this side, the little pieces
taken one by one.

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:45.450
And on top: the little rubber band on top,
this turned out really nicely.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.909
And for true Elsa hair, you do want the braid
to sit over her left shoulder.

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:54.730
Now Elsa's hair does curl a little bit at
the bottom of the braid, but I have no way

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.599
of curling Rapunzel's hair, so we'll just
leave it straight.

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.209
But if you did this on your own hair, you
could probably just use a curling iron to

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.560
curl it.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.950
I always thought Elsa looked a little bit
like Rapunzel, but now they really look alike!

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:13.319
What do you think, do Elsa and Rapunzel look
like sister now?
