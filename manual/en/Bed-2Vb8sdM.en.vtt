00:00:00.165 --> 00:00:03.708
My name is Corey Martinez
and I am a professional BMX rider.

00:00:03.910 --> 00:00:07.861
I'm bringing my friends on this trip
to go film and ride motorcycles,

00:00:07.861 --> 00:00:11.428
go camping and
just enjoy the open air.

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:16.432
[Red Bull Ride &amp; Seek]

00:00:29.372 --> 00:00:32.324
Atlanta is like one of the
dopest cities I've ever been to ride,

00:00:32.324 --> 00:00:34.330
it's got a lot of untouched spots.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:36.938
Happened to come by a school
that I had been to a few years ago.

00:00:36.938 --> 00:00:39.297
I know we were here 
a few hours last fall here

00:00:39.297 --> 00:00:42.247
so try to check it out 
and see what we find.

00:00:59.956 --> 00:01:01.538
Watch your head.

00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:13.571
[inaudible] super sick grind, switch 180,
[inaudible] like planning their thing

00:01:13.571 --> 00:01:16.630
off this crazy curb rail hop.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.273
He did the 180 super [inaudible]
a couple times, like almost like past 180,

00:01:21.273 --> 00:01:23.272
and there was a wall right after it.

00:01:23.272 --> 00:01:24.735
I hate my life.

00:01:24.735 --> 00:01:27.309
Finally like... did it, he got by the wall.

00:01:27.309 --> 00:01:30.586
And he landed right away 
and he gets to chill.

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:39.905
We actually got a hotel
because we want to stay in the city

00:01:39.905 --> 00:01:42.318
and then out of nowhere
Van Homan shows up.

00:01:42.318 --> 00:01:44.398
This trip just got ten times better.

00:01:44.398 --> 00:01:48.940
It's really cool going on the trip with
Corey now because he's grown a lot.

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.655
from when I first met him.

00:01:50.655 --> 00:01:53.906
You know, Van and I talk about
somehow we're still in this together.

00:01:53.906 --> 00:01:57.371
We're still riding and doing
what we love after 10+ years.

00:01:57.371 --> 00:01:59.217
This is a good setup.

00:01:59.217 --> 00:02:01.520
Van seemed real interested in trying
to learn how to ride a motorcycle.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.294
He's never done it.

00:02:03.294 --> 00:02:07.070
I had my first motorcycle experience
in the parking lot this weekend.

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:09.289
My first lap around the
parking lot went fairly well

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.820
so I got a little cocky
and hit the throttle a little hard

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.925
and I tried to run into a parked car
but I think I saved it pretty good.

00:02:18.106 --> 00:02:20.309
Watch it! Watch it!

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:22.015
[laughter]

00:02:22.277 --> 00:02:25.299
Glad the bike was alright, 'cause 
I was kinda like, mid-point of the trip,

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.243
if you ruin the bike
it would suck.

00:02:27.243 --> 00:02:29.536
How did I end up on a motorcycle trip?

00:02:29.536 --> 00:02:32.650
[laughter]

00:02:32.651 --> 00:02:34.673
[motorcycle revving]

00:02:38.691 --> 00:02:40.726
As soon as we arrived
in the gap to rail session,

00:02:40.726 --> 00:02:43.428
like within minutes
Brian pulls in and it's like,

00:02:43.428 --> 00:02:45.216
man, this is like a dream trip.

00:02:45.216 --> 00:02:48.789
I'm Brian Kachinsky, I'm 31 years old,
and I'm from Chicago, Illinois.

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:52.905
I was probably 12, 13 years old,
got that BMX bike, and that was

00:02:52.905 --> 00:02:56.073
like my ticket to explore
beyond my comfort zone,

00:02:56.073 --> 00:03:00.323
explore beyond my original confines,
you know, of whatever I could walk to.

00:03:00.323 --> 00:03:03.152
So now I had this new vehicle
where I could essentially just go

00:03:03.152 --> 00:03:05.401
discover new things and do it with friends.

00:03:05.401 --> 00:03:07.824
My Ride &amp; Seek adventure
started out in Atlanta.

00:03:07.824 --> 00:03:09.820
It's funny just starting
the trip at the Gap to Rail,

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.656
you know, literally walking up the steps,
shaking everyone's hand,

00:03:12.656 --> 00:03:14.825
hugging everyone,
then just putting my bike together

00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:17.999
and right away just getting it in.

00:03:19.565 --> 00:03:21.874
Woahhhhhh!

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:31.567
I've never really done a
gap rail like this big I guess.

00:03:31.567 --> 00:03:35.513
Like it's not like big, it's long,
so usually it's kind of like

00:03:35.513 --> 00:03:40.043
steep dive into rails,
so it should be interesting.

00:03:43.292 --> 00:03:46.637
Really dope to see Fudger do a gap to rail,
I know Fudger's good at riding,

00:03:46.637 --> 00:03:48.715
I always see footage of him,
but it's like really rare that

00:03:48.715 --> 00:03:51.117
I get to actually watch him ride.

00:03:53.404 --> 00:03:57.160
Fudger just warmed up the rail for me,
let's see if I can get his back.

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:09.120
Corey is a perfectionist, so you know,
like he got to the rail, like gap iced it

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.312
three or four times
just to like, you know,

00:04:11.312 --> 00:04:13.259
make sure he had the distance right.

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:15.952
And then he got to
over iced it very first try,

00:04:15.952 --> 00:04:18.489
but I think he just wasn't happy
with how much of the rail he got.

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.963
I like seeing how gap over switch ice,
he got a good part of it and just

00:04:22.963 --> 00:04:25.542
leaned into it, it was so perfect.

00:04:26.657 --> 00:04:27.977
How much did I get?

00:04:27.977 --> 00:04:29.109
Hey!

00:04:29.109 --> 00:04:30.944
Should I slow it down?

00:04:30.944 --> 00:04:31.990
How much did I get?

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.096
Everything!

00:04:33.096 --> 00:04:36.583
All of it, all that you needed.
That was sick as fuck!

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.662
[motorcycle noises]

00:04:52.453 --> 00:04:55.457
As soon as we got to these blue rails,
Van just laid down the first line,

00:04:55.457 --> 00:04:58.257
and I think that just 
got everybody hyped.

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.344
Wooo!!

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.624
Wassup?

00:05:03.624 --> 00:05:05.624
That was awesome!

00:05:05.624 --> 00:05:07.669
I don't know if this is good for it
to build the strength back up--

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:08.708
Yeah.

00:05:08.708 --> 00:05:11.672
--or hurting it, cause it doesn't hurt
enough to where I'm like, aw can't ride.

00:05:35.498 --> 00:05:37.584
Kachinsky... he's going to go hard.

00:05:37.584 --> 00:05:39.636
He always does, and I think that's why
he's one of my favorites to watch.

00:05:39.636 --> 00:05:41.751
He's going to be crazy,
he's going to be moving fast,

00:05:41.751 --> 00:05:44.216
he's going to be scary tricks.

00:05:54.805 --> 00:05:59.746
[ON THE NEXT
RIDE AND SEEK]

00:05:59.746 --> 00:06:02.880
We got to a big four block
and there was a big grass hill.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.748
As soon as I saw that,
you had to start jumping down it.

00:06:05.748 --> 00:06:08.038
After we passed through Atlanta,
I think we were all ready for like

00:06:08.038 --> 00:06:09.928
a little break at
a water hole at some point.
