Hi, I'm Laura from Youngwritersworkshops.com,
and I'm going to talk about how to submit

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:13.629
a children's book to Random House Publishing.
Unfortunately, Random House Publishing and

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:21.760
actually there are some other large publishers
that do not accept unsolicited manuscripts,

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:29.940
so you really cannot submit a manuscript to
that particular publisher because they expressly

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:38.010
request that you do not submit manuscripts.
They solicit manuscripts from well known authors.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:44.260
They have a list of - or they have their own
group of authors who have worked with them

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:51.160
over time. The publishing industry is very
competitive and actually that's a trend more

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.330
and more with the larger publishing houses
that they are not accepting unsolicited manuscripts.

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:02.860
The good news is there are small publishers
out there who are looking for children's manuscripts

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.810
and I highly recommend doing a lot of research
to find out who they are, find one that fits

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:16.211
your particular style of writing and what
your manuscript, where it might fit in. One

00:01:16.211 --> 00:01:20.490
good way to do that is to join the Society
of Children's Book Writers and Illustrators,

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.880
this is a national group that has local chapters,
so you could join your local group and also

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:30.750
be part of the national group, and attend
workshops, meetings and seminars. You also

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:37.120
receive some - a monthly publication from
SCBWI, or Society for Children's Book Writers

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:42.260
and Illustrators. It will give you a lot of
resources about the children's publishing

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.890
business that will help you to find the right
publisher. There's also a book called the

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.860
Children's Writers Market and it includes
resources about all the publishers who are

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:58.270
looking for manuscripts, how to contact them,
what the guidelines are to submit your work.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:05.151
Interviews with successful authors and publishers
and illustrators in this big book, the Children's

00:02:05.151 --> 00:02:11.720
Writers Market, so don't be discouraged and
you know, if that one publisher is crossed

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.720
off your list there's other publishers - there
are other publishers out there and there are

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.310
other opportunities, so I recommend doing
your research and finding a publisher that's

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:21.760
right for you.
