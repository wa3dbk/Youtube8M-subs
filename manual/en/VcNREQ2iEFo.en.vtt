Hi, I'm David Clemen on behalf of Expert Village
and today we're going to learn the basics

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.599
of drawing. In continuing with the gesture
drawings, we're just learning that, for me

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:21.270
as an example, the body twists and turns.
If I take this bottle here of ink, it is what

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.140
it is. It doesn't do anything. You have a
sphere here and a sphere here and that's all

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.420
the information you really need to draw this,
but the human figure, it moves and bends and

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:41.690
shapes and that's why we're using this wooden
model to get used to how the figure moves.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:49.319
So I'm going to change the position just to
kind of get a feel for a different position

00:00:49.319 --> 00:00:54.399
and I just want to try and capture what the
body's doing. You can see the head is here,

00:00:54.399 --> 00:01:00.399
the chest and the rear, the spine is arched
there, the thigh comes out to the back, and

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:07.280
the calf and the lower leg is extended. It's
almost like this person is running. I'm always

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.110
going to start at the head, that's me personally,
not everyone does it, but I believe it's just

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.680
a good starting point. So the head is tilted
back. You can see how the chest, it arches

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:25.030
there. So I can just indicate the neck here,
the chest comes out, we have the midsection,

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:32.350
and then you see the hips are almost thrown
back to the right so I'm going to swing this

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:41.000
back here and I want to catch this leg here.
Just indicate, you can draw the ball that

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.270
connects the thigh, and this is actually,
see how this starts small here and gets bigger

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.820
and comes back in. I just want to kind of
feel that with my pencil. You have to look

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:59.100
at what you're drawing, and then indicate
the knee and the calf comes down here and

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:07.750
then the foot is down touching the ground.
This is the upper arm, this is the bicep,

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:17.650
this is your shoulder here so I'm just going
to indicate that and I'm just getting used

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:23.920
to how the body is built and that's really
what we're trying to learn right now. From

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.850
my angle, I can barely see that other arm,
but I know it's there because if I move I

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:36.490
can see it. So I just want to kind of indicate
the upper arm here, got the elbow, this is

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:40.959
extended, and draw the hand. Now I've got
the rear leg which I can't see all of it,

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:49.470
but I know it's there. So I just want to catch
the thigh here, indicate the knee and send

00:02:49.470 --> 00:03:00.850
that calf and lower leg back, draw the ankle,
and indicate the foot and that's another example

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:01.650
of the gesture drawing.
