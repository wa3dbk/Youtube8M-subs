Hi I'm Brad Sander with Expert RV Park Models and Expert Home

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.390
this is the 2014 Edmonton Home and
Garden Show

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.840
and these are our 14-foot wide Fairmont
park models

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.849
let's check it out. so what do you do when you go to the lake?

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.400
do you entertain? do you like to cook? do you spend most of you time outside like most people?

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.410
in the summertime

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.380
for our short summertime well in a
14-foot wide

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:27.660
Fairmont Park Model with 9 foot walls

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.700
half inch drywall, you've got quality

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.410
we got one and two bedrooms, this is our
one bedroom Aurora

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.170
and it's by far one of the best built park models that's

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.200
four season on the market. park model
homes

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.690
and cottages

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.750
exactly what you want to expect, is comfy and cozy

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.800
well in a Fairmont 14 wide, 4 season 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.150
park model home you can expect just that.
with luxuries of fireplaces

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.420
entertainment centers and large kitchens with plenty of storage

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.369
let's check out the rest of this park model. now in the typical park model

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.369
you're probably grown to expect pretty tiny showers and

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:12.640
pretty tiny baths, well in a Fairmont 14

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.650
foot wide, 4 season park model 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:18.810
obviously width and size is not an issue

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.950
and on top of all this large shower talk

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.110
we even have enough storage leftover for a linen closet

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.210
so this is what a 14 foot wide master
bedroom in

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.110
a Fairmont 4 season park model home feels like

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.450
well, I hope you enjoyed that tour, that was our Farimont one bedroom

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.890
fourteen foot wide 4 season park model
home. we have more to show you at our

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.700

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.480
see you out

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.670
 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:53.619
