00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.020
So, Mr. Cooper, you're
looking for a job.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.040
A menial job.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.330
Like yours.

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.610
Why, thank you for noticing.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:15.400
I'm "Menial Employee
of the Month."

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.480
Do you have
a particular field in mind?

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.509
I do.

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:23.939
For thousands of years,

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.079
the lowest classes
of the human race

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.029
have spent their lives laboring
to erect monuments

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.519
under the lash of their betters,

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:31.319
until finally,

00:00:31.319 --> 00:00:32.529
they dropped down

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:36.610
and became one with the dust
through which they trudged.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.160
Do you have anything like that?
No.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.280
Shouldn't you check
your database?

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:52.190
No.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.390
You didn't really type?

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.870
I didn't really have to.
So, how about

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.000
construction?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.690
Oh, that would be good!
Sawing, hammering,

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.120
eating out of a lunch pail
as my working-class

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.350
fellows and I
sit perched precariously

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.490
on a girder
high above the metropolis.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:15.350
No, no. This is
putting up sheetrock

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.430
at a housing project
in Rosemead.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:19.860
I could do that.
Good.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.140
One question.
Yes?

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.060
What's sheetrock?
Moving on.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:29.350
How about
doing deliveries for a florist?

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.610
That seems acceptable.
Do you have your own car?

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.510
I don't drive.
Of course you don't.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.430
Mr. Cooper, let me
just ask you a question.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:42.810
What was your last job?
Senior theoretical

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.970
particle physicist at CalTech,
focusing on M theory, or, in

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.950
layman's terms, string theory.
I see.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:57.800
Just give me a second.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.000
Security!
