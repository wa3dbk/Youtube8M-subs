00:00:10.046 --> 00:00:12.406
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jeffery Orringer: [Background music]
Initially when a patient arrives in the CDLC,

00:00:12.506 --> 00:00:18.496
we'll have a consultation visit where we
take the time to sit down with patients

00:00:18.496 --> 00:00:21.526
and really hear about each and
every one of their concerns,

00:00:21.526 --> 00:00:24.166
whether it's just one item
or sometimes a whole list.

00:00:24.706 --> 00:00:29.656
And because we have so many
devices and lasers available here,

00:00:29.656 --> 00:00:35.016
we're able to then create a very
tailored treatment plan for them,

00:00:35.016 --> 00:00:39.946
and layout a menu of options that will
best address their very specific concerns.

00:00:40.586 --> 00:00:45.026
&gt;&gt; Dr. Dana Sacks: As a prospective patient you
should have the ability to ask the physician

00:00:45.086 --> 00:00:47.716
about how many cases he or she has done.

00:00:47.786 --> 00:00:53.136
Specifically, how many times has
this physician resurfaced a patient,

00:00:53.556 --> 00:00:59.216
what is the complication rate, how comfortable
is the physician with new technologies?

00:00:59.406 --> 00:01:05.266
&gt;&gt; Dr. Jeffery Orringer: Many patients have not
had laser procedures performed on them before,

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:06.936
and they have lots of questions about safety.

00:01:06.936 --> 00:01:08.246
I think that's very reasonable.

00:01:08.756 --> 00:01:13.536
I've served as the Laser Safety officer for
the University of Michigan Health System,

00:01:13.636 --> 00:01:18.736
and the Chairman of the Laser Safety committee
here for many, many years, so I can assure you

00:01:18.736 --> 00:01:21.946
that patient safety is really
at the top of our priority list.

00:01:22.846 --> 00:01:28.886
Well I've had many, many patients over the
years who've come in at times of transitions

00:01:28.886 --> 00:01:36.756
in their life, new careers, a change of
marital status where perhaps this was a source

00:01:36.756 --> 00:01:39.236
of stress or even sadness at times.

00:01:39.716 --> 00:01:46.896
And when we're able to do a few aesthetically
orientated procedures in a very noninvasive way,

00:01:47.306 --> 00:01:52.526
it's very clear with the smiles that they
come back how much better it makes them feel

00:01:52.526 --> 00:01:53.306
on the inside.

00:01:54.086 --> 00:01:58.346
&gt;&gt; Dr. Dana Sacks: It's really gratifying when
a patient comes in and they've been so worried

00:01:58.346 --> 00:02:03.586
about a particular problem, and I'm able to
look at it and say, "You know what we can fix

00:02:03.636 --> 00:02:08.506
that in one or two treatments, and yes I
can really tell you this is going to work."

00:02:08.506 --> 00:02:11.676
And to see the look of relief on their face

00:02:11.676 --> 00:02:13.926
when maybe they've been carrying
this worry around for many years.
