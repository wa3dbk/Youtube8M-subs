00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:12.000
Hello my friends and welcome
to another Tuesday of tutorial!

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.419
I am Leonardo Pereznieto and I am
very glad to see you again.

00:00:16.419 --> 00:00:22.000
Today we will draw some
3D lollipop hearts for Saint Valentine!

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.400
We begin sketching with pencil
what will be a rectangular surface.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
The top, the sides, and the bottom.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.000
And we give it this thickness,
about this much.

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:40.940
On a second thought I am
actually going to change it,

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.500
I´ll do it horizontal.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.100
I think, it would look better for this.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.000
Like that.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.000
We go over the lines, which
by the way you can do them

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
with a ruler if you want them
totally straight.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.720
And we draw a shadow
on the bottom part, which

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.000
we can then, smudge with the chamois.

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:04.939
This makes it looks smoother.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.860
With the eraser we clean up
anything that would have gone

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.860
to the top area, and then with the pencil,
we reinforce the shadow. Specially where

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.000
the base touches the surface.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.000
Now we draw the sticks.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.500
Up here, will be the hearts.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.000
We give them the shape
we want.

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.570
Good!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.270
I´ll change the direction
of the sticks, slightly,

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.270
not so tilted. That´s better!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.200
With a red marker we go
around the borders and then,

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.000
we fill them in.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.800
Except for some reflections
on the top left of each one.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.300
And with a light brown marker,
we tone the wood.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.020
With a violet color pencil
we start making some texture,

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.600
to the candy.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.000
The section where they overlap
is a little bit darker.

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.260
With a violet blue, we can do
the borders, and the parts

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.500
that we want to be more contrasting.

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.860
It has some sort of imperfections
on the surface and with some reflections

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:25.000
that change tone.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.000
We do the light tones with amber
and with orange.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:35.140
The shadows and the perspective
of the base will make the

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.100
heart stick out in 3D.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:43.800
We smudge and give it some color
… very good!

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.000
We do a little bit more detail.

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.610
We work a little bit more
on the texture, and with

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:54.700
the white pencil, we do some highlights.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.490
I like how these hearts are looking.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.000
We are almost there.

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:05.700
I wide in the shadow,
as it should be bigger.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.100
And now, it´s ready!

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.000
