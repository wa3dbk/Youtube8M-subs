00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.420
-Hello I'm Tim, this here's Gendo.
-Oh hello, Welcome to Kit here on COPA90.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.837
Yeah, don't forget to subscribe to the channel if you want all the very latest and greatest football videos direct to the top of your feed.

00:00:17.837 --> 00:00:22.812
-So Tim what exactly are we going to test out today?
-Well I thought we would test these.

00:00:22.812 --> 00:00:25.431
I didn't notice them.

00:00:34.699 --> 00:00:38.514
Tim, are you sure this is how goalkeepers test out gloves?

00:00:38.514 --> 00:00:42.948
Yeah absolutely, besides it says it all on the press release anyway.

00:00:42.948 --> 00:00:47.364
-Have you got the press release down there?
-Yeah here it is.

00:00:49.614 --> 00:00:57.113
The Reusch Keon Deluxe G2 glove has an ergonomic support system that supports a natural catching position. 

00:00:57.113 --> 00:01:02.565
Not to mention it's got a larger catching area and a tighter optimised fit.

00:01:02.565 --> 00:01:07.031
Basically it means you can catch balls a lot better.

00:01:07.031 --> 00:01:10.965
Ball number one here we go.

00:01:11.744 --> 00:01:14.793
Ball number two.

00:01:16.214 --> 00:01:19.680
-It's like it sucks in the ball.
-Really?

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.081
Amazing, give me another ball.

00:01:22.081 --> 00:01:28.914
-I haven't really got any other balls.
-What have you got? Just give me anything, I'm on fire.

00:01:30.098 --> 00:01:33.147
-Come on.
-Look after these eggs.

00:01:33.148 --> 00:01:35.597
-What?
-Well I have only got my shopping.

00:01:35.597 --> 00:01:39.047
Bring it on man, it's not like I'm going to drop anything with these babies on.

00:01:39.047 --> 00:01:42.347
-Saves me bringing it down doesn't it.
-Exactly.

00:01:42.982 --> 00:01:46.565
-OH! It didn't even break.
-Here we go then dude.

00:01:46.565 --> 00:01:49.247
Here is the eggs.

00:01:50.505 --> 00:01:53.300
-Come on. 
-Yes.

00:01:55.607 --> 00:01:59.019
-Here's some chicken stock.
-What’s that?

00:02:00.052 --> 00:02:03.369
Can you look after my eggs quickly.

00:02:03.401 --> 00:02:09.488
-Listen I am doing a butternut squash curry tonight don't drop this one. 
-Butternut Squash, hold on they are quite big aren't they?

00:02:09.488 --> 00:02:13.156
-Wait there, wait.
-What's he doing?

00:02:13.156 --> 00:02:16.212
Safety first man, ready.

00:02:18.212 --> 00:02:21.114
Some flour, okay? 

00:02:23.145 --> 00:02:26.305
-You idiot.
-I dropped it.

00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:31.975
-Well I think the gloves are pretty good with object's that are round, so take the tomatoes. 
-Not all at once. 

00:02:31.975 --> 00:02:34.588
Good one, caught one.

00:02:34.588 --> 00:02:42.655
-Don't drop my low fat yoghurt, whatever you do. 
-I caught it.

00:02:42.655 --> 00:02:45.006
-Here's a watermelon.
-Okay.

00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:48.052
-It's just like a football.
-Okay, I've got it; it's a bit slippy.

00:02:48.052 --> 00:02:51.502
-Here it comes.
-No. 

00:02:52.635 --> 00:02:56.634
-Woah, look out.
-What's that?

00:02:56.634 --> 00:02:59.351
It's cream. 

00:02:59.351 --> 00:03:04.483
-Some grapes. 
-Got them, I got a few.

00:03:04.483 --> 00:03:11.251
I think the gloves did pretty well there in that test, I mean he only dropped probably ten percent of the things.

00:03:11.251 --> 00:03:14.001
I think he did a pretty good job.

00:03:14.001 --> 00:03:19.451
-I saw you spilt a little bit though, so here is some toilet roll to clean up, yeah.
-Yeah.

00:03:19.451 --> 00:03:23.491
-Right I will come down. 
-Am I sorting this out yeah?

00:03:23.491 --> 00:03:26.724
I mean that's probably fine.

00:03:26.724 --> 00:03:36.864
Look at the state of my hands, I think the flour must have popped just as it left the top; it's gone absolutely everywhere.

00:03:36.864 --> 00:03:41.649
-Go on then what do you make of the gloves?
-Are you sure this is how they test goalie gloves? I have never seen Júlio César do that.

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:44.250
Yeah I'm pretty sure, that's exactly how they do it. 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:51.083
Well they did work pretty well with the balls, not so well with single cream, organic low fat yoghurt, quite good with grapes though.

00:03:51.083 --> 00:03:53.932
-Oh well there you go, every cloud.
-That's science.

00:03:53.932 --> 00:03:59.233
There you go, so if you want to see more football gear being road tested by me and Gendo here, make sure you subscribe to COPA90.

00:03:59.233 --> 00:04:01.786
