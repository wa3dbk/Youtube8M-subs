&gt;&gt; [Music]

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.400
&gt;&gt; Lou Reed: You know like sometimes, you’ve got to be in a place.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.000
You’re just another guy. You can just blend in.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.960
I live out in the wilds of nowhere, out in Jersey.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.999
Even there, there’s sometimes problems.

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:25.210
College students like journey out there and
show up at 11 o’clock at night,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.150
on my porch, looking into the door not saying anything.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.550
My wife and I are sitting there; it’s really
creepy.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.840
&gt;&gt; Joe Smith: Are you …?
&gt;&gt; Lou Reed: I got out with my shotgun.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.240
This is hunting country out there. You better run.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:43.840
&gt;&gt; [Music]

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.120
&gt;&gt; Joe Smith: Do you ever regret that you
were never totally in the mainstream,

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.559
that you were out there left wing most of
the time in your career?

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.239
&gt;&gt; Lou Reed: No, I started out with that in
mind.

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.560
People didn’t know certain things about
me, which…

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.960
I was out of creative writing class in school,
Syracuse University; had a B.A. in English

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.200
and wanted to write the great American novel
but I also loved rock and roll.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.000
I was in bar bands all through college, playing fraternities and have to know all the songs in the top 10.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.310
That kind of thing.

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.150
&gt;&gt; [Music]

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.680
&gt;&gt; Joe Smith: What are your recollections of that Velvet Underground time?

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:21.320
You guys were avant garde, cutting edge, new stuff.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.800
When this record came out; all of a sudden, there’s this kind of recognition?

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.750
&gt;&gt; Lou Reed: Well there wasn’t any recognition.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:31.780
What there was, was a lot of bad press.
I got a little puzzled at how savage the reaction

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:36.300
against us was, when we got it,
especially when we performed live and left New York. 

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.080
Like you know, “how savage and decadent”, da da da da;

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.680
“look at what these songs are about; ‘Venus in Furs’ is about all of this.”

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.440
They didn’t even know “Venus in Furs” was a book; I didn’t write it.

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.480
I just said it would be interesting to take this book

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.060
and put it in a song.
I just wanted to cram everything into a record

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.380
that these people had ignored, which left
you everything.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.040
&gt;&gt; [Music: The Velvet Underground “Venus
in Furs”]

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.359
&gt;&gt; Lou Reed: The other thing that killed me was stuff like this had been in novels so long

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:06.000
it was like nothing. I write a song called “Heroin”, 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.100
you would have thought that I murdered the Pope or something. It should have been, 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.120
 “now we can get a lot of people who have talent for writing and everything into rock and roll.”

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.599
“We’ll all write about really adult stuff.”
That was what I wanted to do,

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:22.779
is write rock and roll that you could listen
to as you got older,

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.420
 and it wouldn’t lose anything; it would be timeless, in the subject matter

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.900
and the literacy of the lyrics.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.900
&gt;&gt; [Music: The Velvet Underground “Heroin”]

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.040
&gt;&gt; Lou Reed: We didn’t expect to sell records.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:38.360
That’s not what we were doing.
It would have been great. It would have been great. 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.680
It would have taken a lot of financial pressure off us. It’s not like we had money. 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.400
What we had was ambition and a goal. That’s the thing you can do when you’re really young.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.980
&gt;&gt; Joe Smith: What was the ambition and the goal?

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.020
&gt;&gt; Lou Reed: Oh. To elevate the rock and roll song

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:58.180
and take it where it hadn’t been taken
before.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.099
I’m saying like from my point of view and
I know this sounds pretentious

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:08.220
but I just thought the other stuff couldn’t
even come up to our ankles; not up to my kneecap,

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.610
not up to my ankles, the level that we were
on, compared to everybody else.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.090
They were just painfully stupid and pretentious.
When they did try to get in quotes: “arty”,

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.800
it was worse than stupid rock and roll.
What I mean by stupid, I mean like The Doors.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.220
&gt;&gt; Joe Smith: You never felt Lennon and the Beatles… 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.760
did you feel that they were in a league at all?

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:34.880
&gt;&gt; Lou Reed: No. No. I never liked the Beatles. I thought they were garbage.

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.879
If you said, “who did you like?” I liked nobody.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.539
&gt;&gt; [Music]

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.500
&gt;&gt; Lou Reed: In the old days, the Velvet Underground,

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.310
we had engineers who would walk out on us.
They would say, “It’s too loud"

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:49.390
"This is terrible. You know I’m going to turn
the tape machine on,"

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.150
you guys call me when you’re finished.”
I’ve spent a lot of years since then,

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.880
trying to figure out a way to be able to do what I did then, without going deaf.

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.909
I actually went and had my ears tested just
to make sure.

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.760
The guy who was testing me was a fan, which
was nice, so he took the test a little further

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:06.480
just to assuage any doubts I might have. 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.820
 He said, “no, you have the average high end loss for a New Yorker.”

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:16.680
&gt;&gt; Lou Reed: Right; for a New Yorker. It was very funny.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:26.920
&gt;&gt; [Music: Lou Reed “Perfect Day”]

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:31.000
&gt;&gt; Lou Reed: I had a lot of problems in the
studio because of my background with engineer, see.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.380
A lot of my records sound like they were recorded completely dry and no one did anything,

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.540
and that in fact was what it was

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:39.370
because they would go to touch a button and I’d go, “what are you doing, man?”

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:42.710
I have faith in my own vision, and didn’t
want them to tamper with it.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.470
I thought my thing coming out badly recorded this way, is better than 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.840
if these people take my voice and try to make me sound like a 14-year-old. They thin it out. 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:54.410
I would tell them it’s like you tell a photographer, “don’t retouch this too much.”

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.500
These lines, they mean something, I’m an
adult, man.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.410
Don’t thin my voice out and make it like
that high shit.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:03.130
This is the way I sound. You’ve got to get
people to understand that

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.700
because they take the nuance and character
out that makes the lyric believable.

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.240
It’s an important thing.
