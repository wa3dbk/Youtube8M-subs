00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I live in this block, on the 5th floor, second unit.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.000
Do you want to see the apartment I live in?

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:52.000
Yes? You can see, come up and I invite you to see it.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.649
My block has an elevator.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.540
This is the door.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.000
There's a very nice matt on the floor, isn't there?

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.510
When you get into the house, you'll find the entrance hall first.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.290
There's a mirror here

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.140
one flower

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.840
a small painting

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.440
and an intercom.

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:33.940
And on the right, there's the living room.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.940
If you follow the hall, you find the kitchen on the left

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:50.510
and at the end is my parents' bedroom.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.000
If you turn right, you can see three doors.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.480
The door on the left is of the washroom,

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:03.340
the middle one is my older brother's room

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.350
and the one on the right is my room.

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.350
Do you want to see some more?

00:02:14.799 --> 00:02:20.159
This is my room.

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:21.859
There is a window.

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:25.999

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:35.800
and a wardrobe.

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:43.739
On the shelves, I have books,

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:50.649
picture cards and dolls

00:02:50.649 --> 00:02:55.899
and music CDs.

00:02:55.899 --> 00:03:02.109
I can't show you my brother's room, 
because he's sleeping now.

00:03:02.109 --> 00:03:05.000
The biggest bedroom is my parents'.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.839
They have a small TV on the wall to watch it from the bed.

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:17.809
Below the window, there's a radiator.

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:24.809
There is a double bed with
 a few bedside lamps on each side,

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:32.569
and two pictures over the bed.

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:37.389
There is a small lamp on each nightstand.

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:38.869
My father has a clock radio

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:41.249
 

00:03:41.249 --> 00:03:45.019
and my mother has the remote control of the TV

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:50.629
and a book.

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:57.089
She likes reading before sleeping.

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:59.959
In front of the window, there's a big wardrobe,

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:06.159
of four doors with mirrors.

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.289
And finally,

00:04:07.289 --> 00:04:09.229
here is the living room.

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:13.339
There are three white sofas and a glass table.

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:17.309
There are cushions on the sofas.

00:04:17.309 --> 00:04:22.189
Beside the armchairs is the door of the balcony.

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:26.770
In front of the sofas, there is a cabinet shelves.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:28.789

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:34.909
and a wall clock.

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:37.229
Do you want to have something?

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:39.769
Come, sit on the sofa and I bring you something to drink.

00:04:40.229 --> 00:04:47.769
