00:00:00.374 --> 00:00:01.494
I hate climbing.

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:02.820
I hate it so much.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.120
Ladders, rock walls, ropes

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.276
Those motherfuckin' little swirly staircases they have in old buildings

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:10.295
Yeah, fuck those.

00:00:10.295 --> 00:00:11.550
I didn't use to hate it

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.820
I was just like every other little kid who's climbing everything they could get a good grip on.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.069
But things changed.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:21.120
I had a very unfortunate time in one year of high school P.E.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.954
In the many biographies that are going to be written about my life, this chapter of it will be called

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.400
The Vomiting Phase

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.674
For reasons that will shortly become evident.

00:00:29.674 --> 00:00:31.554
I was doing the Adventure Ed option

00:00:31.554 --> 00:00:36.997
which was, of course, all about the rock walls and the caterpillar ladders and the crazy trust falls 

00:00:36.997 --> 00:00:38.435
and all of that terrible stuff

00:00:38.435 --> 00:00:41.853
I voluntarily signed up for this by the way. I did this to myself.

00:00:41.853 --> 00:00:45.260
I just thought that climbing walls would just be so cool.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:46.800
I was young.

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.560
And so naive.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:51.515
Spoiler alert: I threw up a lot in that class.

00:00:51.515 --> 00:00:53.335
It didn't happen every class

00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:57.895
but it was frequent enough that at one point, people stopped being surprised about it.

00:00:57.895 --> 00:01:03.326
And of course I never realized that it was about to happen when I had two feet firmly on the ground.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:07.200
No. I always realized it when I was scaling a wall.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.880
Or halfway up a gigantic rope.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.069
That's not the best place to be when you're trying to plan a hot and fast exit strategy.

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:18.929
Turns out that it actually takes some precious time to get someone down from that height.

00:01:18.929 --> 00:01:23.434
Especially with a climbing team of a bunch of high school students who are pretty new at it

00:01:23.434 --> 00:01:28.874
Now, I understand that a lot of it had to do with this really rough antibiotic that I was taking that year

00:01:28.874 --> 00:01:32.917
But climbing was always the catalyst for the actual vomiting

00:01:32.917 --> 00:01:36.334
But like, this was my gym class, and I had to climb to get a grade

00:01:36.334 --> 00:01:40.076
So each class became this sort of sick guessing game I played with myself

00:01:40.076 --> 00:01:46.216
to see how far I can get up this time before I had to tell my climbing team to bring me the fuck down.

00:01:46.216 --> 00:01:48.854
By the end of the semester they actually got really efficient.

00:01:48.854 --> 00:01:52.155
I could just shoot them all a look and they would be like

00:01:52.155 --> 00:01:53.494
"All right, bring her down."

00:01:53.494 --> 00:01:59.735
And as humiliating as this sounds, the really remarkable part was that I didn't really care very much.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:01.760
I was a senior, and by then

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.875
High school popularity and positive recognition from my peers

00:02:05.875 --> 00:02:09.295
felt like a currency that I wasn't gonna be able to use anymore

00:02:09.295 --> 00:02:11.711
because in a couple of months, after I graduated

00:02:11.711 --> 00:02:14.934
I would never have to see any of these people again

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:15.900
Never ever

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.780
Never.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:17.360
Ever.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.920
Ugh.

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.000
Okay, fast-forward a half a decade

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.895
In the years since that terrible time in my life

00:02:23.895 --> 00:02:25.674
I have graduated from high school

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.740
I have moved out. I have gone to, count them:

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.880
not one, not two, but three different colleges

00:02:32.935 --> 00:02:34.775
And I have moved to a new city

00:02:34.775 --> 00:02:38.954
One would think that that would be enough distance so that I would never have to think about this again.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.280
Guess who that oh-so-familiar face in my new history class turned out to be.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.835
If you guessed a member of the very climbing team that I nearly projectile vomited on

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.936
on several occasions in high school

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.960
Hey! You would be right.

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.615
When I first saw her I couldn't place her

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.980
But then I started talking to her and she... she reminded me.

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.459
She remembered. She remembers every little bit.

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:07.589
Like, of all the people from my adolescence who could have possible come back to haunt me now

00:03:07.589 --> 00:03:12.595
It's gonna be a girl that I nearly threw up on in the 12th grade. That's fantastic.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.520
Some day I'm sure that we will all, eventually, fully escape high school

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:19.147
Might take a while though.

00:03:19.147 --> 00:03:20.656
I'll talk to you guys later.
