00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:06.259
The next two exercises I'm going to show you
are primarily for the lower back, which compromises

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.990
the core. It's very important to strengthen
those lower back muscles. It should not be

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.699
forgotten. The first exercise I'm going to
show you is pretty basic and simple. It's

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:25.151
called the alternating arm/leg extension.
You're going to be on your knees and your

00:00:25.151 --> 00:00:36.739
hands, abdominal muscles are tight. From here
I want you to start with just your basic extension

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:45.719
of a leg. Especially if your balance is off,
or if you're new to this, just warm up with

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.339
straightening that leg, tightening your glute.
Then what you are going to do is add your

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:59.190
upper body. Your opposite arm and leg should
be coming forward. So you're going to extend

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.789
your arm while extending the opposite leg.
I want you to think of elongating your spine,

00:01:06.789 --> 00:01:14.140
tightening your glute, reaching forward, keeping
your head down, there is no reason you should

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:22.810
be looking up, holding for about two second
count, lowering back down to the ground and

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:31.759
then switching sides. It looks like a fairly
simple exercise, which it is, but it will

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:45.469
improve the strength of your lower back and
glutes, which is very, very important to a

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:50.950
well-rounded core routine. I really recommend
this exercise if you have a job where you

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.950
are seated all day long, if you don't get
a lot of movement during the day. People who

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:05.450
are seated generally, usually have lower back
issues. A lot of my clients do. I recommend

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.540
this exercise. I would start with about 15
repetitions, work up to 20 repetitions. If

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.579
it doesn't feel right, if it hurts your lower
back, do not do it.
