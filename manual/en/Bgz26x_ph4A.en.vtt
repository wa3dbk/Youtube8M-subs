00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.990
In today's tutorial i'm going to show you
how to install Magic Zoom Plus in WebPlus

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.420
x5.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.110
You can also use this video to install Magic
Zoom, Magic Thumb, Magic Magnify Plus and

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.590
Magic Magnify as the process is the same.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:22.970
If we go to the Magic Zoom Plus page you'll
see we can zoom the image as well as enlarge

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:23.970
it.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.450
To start the installation we need to download
the demo file and save it to our computer.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.340
Extract the files.

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.750
The files we'll be using are in the magiczoomplus
folder.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:42.730
There's the JavaScript file and the CSS file.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.170
In the Graphics folder we'll use the buttons1
image.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.870
The Hint gif and also the Loader gif.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.900
Before we add these files to Web Plus we need
to edit the CSS file.

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:59.920
At the moment all the images are referenced
under the graphics folder which we need to

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.629
delete because we'll be adding these images
directly to the root in Web Plus.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.490
So go through the whole file and delete the
Graphics folder reference.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.119
Once that's done, save your changes.

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.740
First thing we need to do in Web Plus is add
the Head code.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:23.420
To do this, right click on your page and select
Attach HTML.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:28.600
We'll be pasting the Head code here over Master
Page Head.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.329
Next go to the Magic Zoom Plus Integration
page and copy the Head code under Point three

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:37.159
of the Installation section.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:44.060
And then paste the code over the Master Page
Head text.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.889
We need to delete the magiczoomplus reference
because we'll be adding the CSS and JavaScript

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:52.150
files directly to the root.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.229
When you've finished, close the Editor.

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.899
Next go to Insert, Web Object, HTML and Draw
a HTML box.

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:08.300
We're going to insert our next bit of code
over the Body text.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.440
Go back to the integration page.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.580
This time we'll copy the Body code.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.470
And paste it over the Body text in WebPlus.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.540
The big reference is for your large image
which will act as the zoom and enlarge effects.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.010
The small reference is for the image which
will appear on your website.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.640
We also need to attach the large and small
images we've just referenced to the HTML box.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:38.470
I'll just reposition the box.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:43.030
Next we'll attach the files we need to the
root by clicking Site Manager and make sure

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.550
you're in the File section.

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:52.510
You can see the small and larges images we've
just attached to our HTML are showing.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:58.510
Next I'll add the button one, hint and loader
graphics.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.330
The CSS file.

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.360
And the JavaScript file.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.400
Now if we preview our page, you can see Magic
Zoom Plus is working.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:15.980
We have the zoom and the enlarge effect.

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.520
Now Magic Zoom Plus is installed i'm going
to make a couple of changes.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.930
First i'll change the zoom size.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.960
And then change the background colour for
my enlarged image.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.200
Go back to the Integration page, and scroll
down to Number two â€“ Zoom Size. and copy

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.440
the rel attribute zoom width zoom height.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:46.450
Then if we go back into the HTML box, I'll
paste it after the Class code in my HTML.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.550
I'm using four hundred pixels for each size
but you can use any size you want.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:57.600
Next, go back to the Integration page and
select Number fifteen - Background from the

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.510
list of anchor links.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:08.550
As we've just added a rel attribute, i'm just
going to copy the code starting from background.

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:13.380
I'll enter a semi colon after four hundred
pixels and paste my background code after

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:16.640
it.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.479
And change the colour reference to red.

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.319
You can use any color you want.

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:26.249
Now when I preview my page you'll see the
zoom area is larger.

00:04:26.249 --> 00:04:31.680
And my enlarged background is now red.

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:37.020
For ideas on how to display your images, go
to our Examples page.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.919
All the HTML code you'll need is on the Integration
page.

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:45.969
There's so many customizations you can make,
try them all and see what suits your website.

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:51.520

a contact us link.
