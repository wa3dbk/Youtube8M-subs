00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:07.129
 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.910
hi I'm Kelsey mays for cars.com
infiniti's new naming scheme has all of

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.480
its cars starting with Q now all of its
SUVs beginning with QX the qx56 had a

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.580
five point six litre v8 it now becomes
the qx80 doesn't get an eighth leader

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.750
b12 or anything

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.010
sticks with the v8 we're going to cover
capability will cover some of its luxury

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:35.480
features and finally we'll take you
through value if big equals luxury to

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:39.079
you then the three-row qx80 gives you a
texas-sized portion of it

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.100
about two hundred and eight inches long
bumper to bumper about 80 inches tall

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.109
it's about a foot longer than the JX
turned qx60 which also has three rows of

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:48.589
seats

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.329
the largest vehicle by a significant
margin in nissan's luxury division line

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:54.319
up here in the US

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:57.769
also the drew pious looking vehicle the
headlights the taillights

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:00.949
they kind of meander down on the car
they said about six or eight inches

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:02.690
lower than you think they should sit

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.500
it's like infinity took this car and put
it in a microwave before producing it a

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.680
really really big microwave qx80 is a
big SUV but it also has a big engine 5.6

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:17.930
litre v8 400 horsepower 413 pound-feet
of torque and plenty of passing in just

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.820
about all situations editors agreed

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.750
one thing we disagreed on was the
seven-speed automatic transmission some

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.859
editors found it

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:28.399
plenty response of others said it hunted
for gears too much took too long to kick

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:29.420
down

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.890
editor's did agree on steering a nice
combination of feedback and power assist

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.770
to make the qx80 very maneuverable at
low speed

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.740
not quite the same story at higher
speeds though we're on the highway the

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.920
qx80 is a little twitchy hard to
maintain kind of going in a straight

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.380
line it doesn't settle in all that well

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.909
ride quality is generically soft it can
get a little bit clumsy over stretches

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.999
of broken pavement where the qx80
reveals its truck-based body-on-frame

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.840
route

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.740
otherwise though not a ton of complaints
on that front for an SUV that starts

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.539
over 62,000 dollars

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:03.469
the qx80 better have a lot of luxury um
it does a pretty good job of it can

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.630
materials are pretty handsome over all
you've got

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.069
ornamentation like stitching here down
the sides of the of the center controls

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.360
you've got soft padded stuff all the way
down here to foot level um a couple of

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.680
cheap areas here along the center
console and the all-wheel drive knob

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.040
I don't really feel up to snuff but
generally everything else

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.540
does seating is for seven or eight
people depending how you configure the

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.659
second row there's plenty of room in
both the first and the second Rose plus

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:31.870
a nice upright tall seating position
that gives you a commanding view of the

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.709
road

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:37.299
it would be nice to see a sliding second
row in the qx80 with some sort of walk

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:38.650
and feature to the third row

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.220
unfortunately these are fixed in their
tracks but they do tumble forward pretty

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:43.060
easily

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.879
check this out just pull that lever wait
for it to stop moving and then you go

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:54.459
here we are in the third row a little
tight for adults especially in terms of

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.730
leg room that's where a sliding second
row would be nice to negotiate a little

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.159
more room out of the second row people
bedroom

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:04.629
not really great it's okay um overall
the seat does it really low to the

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.019
ground though not a real comfortable
spot if you're looking for more third

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.519
row room SUVs like the mercedes GL Class
the lincoln navigator have more generous

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:13.840
confines back here

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.250
there's not a ton of cargo room less
than 17 cubic feet behind the third row

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.159
which is basically in qx60 territory

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:24.790
there's about 50 cubic feet with the
third row folded and maximum volume

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.169
deems things with about 95 cubic feet
overall you get there through a power

00:03:29.169 --> 00:03:34.060
folding third row seat and a tumbling
second row large families who want

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.530
luxury and passenger room will find a
lot to like about the qx80 so anyone who

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.970
needs to talk is this thing tops out at
8,500 pounds now you will need to weigh

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.079
that against limited Carter room behind
the third row as well as pricing

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:51.129
now we can see where the ad comes from
the qx80 starts north of sixty-two

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.790
thousand dollars but our test car your
tops out very very close to eighty

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.329
thousand dollars so keep an eye on that
bottom line because those options they

00:03:58.329 --> 00:04:01.329
do add up

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:07.890
I

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.209
yeah
