00:00:05.766 --> 00:00:16.332
Jude Trapani: We’re on the Yankee Fork of the Salmon River looking at a side channel habitat improvement project that was completed last fall 

00:00:16.333 --> 00:00:23.633
in 2012. And we’re observing adult steelhead returning from the ocean.

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:33.633
And they’re constructing their nests which we call redds and they’re going to lay their eggs in there and cover them over.  

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:42.633
Later on this summer they are going to hatch out as little babies, as fry, and they’re going to rear in the stream for one to three years 

00:00:42.633 --> 00:00:45.866
and do the whole thing over again…

00:00:45.866 --> 00:00:50.299
Camera Operator:  That’s a big fish!

00:00:50.300 --> 00:01:00.466
Jude Trapani: It shows exactly the idea of a well thought out process that puts the habitat in that we know that fish like… 

00:01:00.466 --> 00:01:09.732
To build it, and then the following spring to have adult steelhead to come in and use it is very satisfying for all the partners. 

00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:19.066
All the partners were hoping to do this together, so the next generation of the effort, where it didn’t work in the past, it’s working now.

00:01:19.066 --> 00:01:20.932

00:01:20.933 --> 00:01:34.066
The Yankee Fork of the Salmon River has had a lot of impacts to it, mostly from dredge mining earlier 50 to 60 years ago. 

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:44.566
And it disrupted the fish habitat quite a bit. And many of the partners, including the Shoshone-Bannock tribes have been trying to do some 

00:01:44.566 --> 00:01:57.099
rehabilitation work in there for the past 25 years. And we finally got a significant project done last fall to start that process.  

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.666
We’re hoping to do another series of projects to improve habitat in there.

00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:11.932
So this first project we just finished is exciting because it’s a first step and the fish are already using it. We’re expecting the future projects in 

00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:21.833
the next 5 years to be even bigger and to be used even more by steelhead and Chinook salmon adults to spawn in.
