00:00:05.299 --> 00:00:06.299
Male 1: Good grief.

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.080
You two are back at the bar again.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.080
Male 2: Couldn't get enough.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:10.440
Gillian: We're going to get you.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.240
Male 1: You've come back to get me, have you?

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:15.840
I've got a perfect bet
for you.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.199
Fantastic bet.

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:19.980
Did you study science as a child,
Gillian?

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.980
Gillian: A little bit.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.699
Male 1: A little bit?

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.179
You know '=MC2 squared and stuff like that?

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:27.179
Gillian: Sure.

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:30.249
Male 1: And the Pythagoracy theorem and triangles,
and things?

00:00:30.249 --> 00:00:31.249
Gillian: Pythagoras, yeah.

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:36.430
Male 1: You know that a paperclip is unlikely
to float on water?

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.640
Gillian: Right.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:45.859
Male 1: However, my little frisky friend who's
here to take me for

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:48.460
money, and that's going to happen.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:49.739
Male 2: It will.

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.589
Male 1: It's more likely I'm going to take
your woman, by the way.

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:55.160
You
do know that?

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.390
Have you realized over . . .

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.390
Gillian: Boys, boys, boys.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.640
Male 1: . . . the course of these events how
she's falling

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.640
Gillian: Go back to the paperclip.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.690
Male 1: . . . so madly in love with me?

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.690
Male 2: I'm drawing the line here.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.720
Male 1: She's falling madly in love with me,
again, dreaming, and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.650
going, "Oh, crikey."

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.160
Back to the paperclip.

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:21.680
I'm going to bet you
a drink, of course, that I can make a paperclip

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.850
float on the
surface of that water.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.540
Do you want to try one yourself?

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.110
If that
floats, I'll buy you a drink.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.020
Gillian: You want to do it, or something?

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:33.210
Male 2: I don't know.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.210
Maybe it has . . .

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.640
Male 1: No, no, It has to be exactly as it
is.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.640
Male 2: Okay.

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.710
Male 1: You can't be fiddling and . . .

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.040
Gillian: It's got to be a trick.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.040
Male 2: Yeah.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.490
It's got to be something.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:43.590
It's kind of floating right
now.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.770
Male 1: Yeah, but you're still holding onto
. . .

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:46.770
Male 2: It floated for a second.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.280
Male 1: It was so close.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.400
Male 2: It floated for 1 second, so that's
right.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.400
Gillian: All right.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.400
Go ahead.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.400
Make a paperclip float.

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.170
Male 1: She's very demanding, isn't she?

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.560
Male 2: To business.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.610
Male 1: Okay.

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.360
Here's the deal.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.360
You'll do this on all of your friends
tomorrow.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.090
You take 2 paperclips to make one float.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.340
What you do
is you take one paperclip and you bend it

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.770
into a little shape
like that.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.770
Male 2: Okay.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.800
Male 1: Remember, I said the paperclip had
to be intact, that floats.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.170
This is all about the surface tension of the
water.

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.230
Then you
take another paperclip . . . this is a little

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.610
Bill Nye science
experiment guy thing.

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:38.930
You balance it on the little T-shape
there.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.430
You just plunk it into the water.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:42.650
Male 2: Wow.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.650
Gillian: Wow.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.030
Male 1: The paperclip floats.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.760
The little bit of the paperclip won't
break the surface tension, your fingertips

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.450
will, every time.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:54.480
Male 2: Wow.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.319
Male 1: That, my friends, is how you float
a paperclip on a bit of

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.319
water.

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:02.370
Male 2: And beat science.

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.260
Male 1: And beat you out of another drink.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.140
Male 2: Again.
