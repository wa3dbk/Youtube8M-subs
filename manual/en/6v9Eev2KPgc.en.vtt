00:00:08.486 --> 00:00:10.186
&gt;&gt;Jay: Let's get started.

00:00:10.186 --> 00:00:13.626
So we're gonna start with our
simulated bush meat today.

00:00:13.986 --> 00:00:15.526
And we have three samples.

00:00:16.146 --> 00:00:17.756
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Something
big is happening

00:00:17.756 --> 00:00:19.356
in this eleventh grade biology class.

00:00:19.546 --> 00:00:23.136
&gt;&gt;We're trying to actually kinda
change the world a little bit.

00:00:23.466 --> 00:00:25.706
&gt;&gt;Jay: We thought up a lesson
that would incorporate aspects

00:00:25.706 --> 00:00:28.446
in molecular biology,
bioinformatics, evolution,

00:00:28.446 --> 00:00:30.986
ecology, zoology, biochemistry.

00:00:30.986 --> 00:00:33.886
And so we created a way to
teach all those things together.

00:00:34.316 --> 00:00:37.606
&gt;&gt;You wanna check it out, describe,
write down some observations,

00:00:37.606 --> 00:00:39.306
what it smells like,
what it looks like.

00:00:39.866 --> 00:00:41.926
&gt;&gt;Narrator : Jay Vavra's
students are learning

00:00:41.926 --> 00:00:44.486
to identify meat using DNA barcoding.

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:49.236
The ultimate goal of the project
is to develop forensic techniques

00:00:49.286 --> 00:00:52.336
that can be used by African
law enforcement officials

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:55.856
to combat poaching, by
identifying the meat and fur

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:57.536
of illegally hunted wildlife.

00:00:57.946 --> 00:01:00.456
&gt;&gt;Jay: These are photos that
I got last week from one

00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:02.186
of our collaborators in Nairobi.

00:01:02.486 --> 00:01:03.336
This is an eland.

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:06.206
&gt;&gt;Elizabeth: I think it's
interesting because it's relative

00:01:06.206 --> 00:01:08.566
to something that's going on in
real life, and not only that,

00:01:08.736 --> 00:01:11.036
but it's like a crisis,
it's like an issue.

00:01:11.726 --> 00:01:14.946
&gt;&gt;Jay: I really believe in original
research to discover something

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:17.196
and the students know what
they're doing has an application.

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:20.646
It's not just going to the
teacher's grade book and such.

00:01:20.996 --> 00:01:23.586
&gt;&gt;Point one which is that line
and point five, so you're like--

00:01:23.646 --> 00:01:26.546
&gt;&gt;Mari: You always hear about
this kind of science being used

00:01:26.646 --> 00:01:29.386
in the real world to fight crime and
all that, but here we actually get

00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:31.346
to partake in that,
which is really great.

00:01:31.346 --> 00:01:32.086
&gt;&gt;Is it enough?

00:01:32.316 --> 00:01:32.966
&gt;&gt;No, it's not enough.

00:01:33.706 --> 00:01:37.156
&gt;&gt;Narrator : Like many high tech
teachers, Dr. Vavra brings a wealth

00:01:37.156 --> 00:01:39.876
of experience and passion
into the classroom

00:01:39.876 --> 00:01:41.876
from his previous professional life.

00:01:42.176 --> 00:01:45.846
&gt;&gt;Jay: I love all aspects of biology
and worked in the biotech industry.

00:01:46.346 --> 00:01:47.796
I worked in archeology.

00:01:48.266 --> 00:01:51.716
I've also done research in
Antarctica and northern California

00:01:51.716 --> 00:01:54.076
and different areas in
biological sciences,

00:01:54.256 --> 00:01:56.496
and then try to bring
that into my classroom.

00:01:56.496 --> 00:01:59.806
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Instead of grades on high
stakes tests at the end of the year,

00:02:00.336 --> 00:02:02.446
students are assessed
on their contribution

00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:03.936
to a final class product.

00:02:04.976 --> 00:02:07.886
In this case, it's the creation
of the forensics workshop

00:02:07.966 --> 00:02:10.006
that will be given in Africa.

00:02:10.746 --> 00:02:13.876
&gt;&gt;Jay: We started a project last year
and took nine students to east Africa

00:02:13.876 --> 00:02:17.266
and met with collaborators there.

00:02:17.406 --> 00:02:19.726
Found that there was a great
need for this in Sudan,

00:02:19.726 --> 00:02:21.206
Uganda, Tanzania and Kenya.

00:02:21.686 --> 00:02:24.176
And we talked about going back
and setting up the workshop.

00:02:24.176 --> 00:02:29.886
&gt;&gt;Openye: So without DNA, I don't
see us succeeding in prosecution

00:02:29.886 --> 00:02:32.546
of wildlife cases in east Africa.

00:02:33.046 --> 00:02:33.736
&gt;&gt;Kit: This isn't Honors
what we're doing.

00:02:33.736 --> 00:02:35.746
This is just a regular biology class.

00:02:35.746 --> 00:02:37.676
Everything we're learning
is completely relevant.

00:02:38.266 --> 00:02:40.206
Now you put it in there and
we'll take it back over there.

00:02:40.846 --> 00:02:43.496
&gt;&gt;Jay: I know they're engaged and
they believe in what they're doing.

00:02:43.686 --> 00:02:46.146
They're going to teach
others at conferences,

00:02:46.286 --> 00:02:48.586
and so they know there's
a next step to this.

00:02:48.676 --> 00:02:50.046
&gt;&gt;Mari: I know everyone's
really serious about it,

00:02:50.096 --> 00:02:52.696
'cause it's a serious issue, but
this is really a lot more fun

00:02:52.696 --> 00:02:55.176
than you'd be able to do in any other
classroom, because you're actually--

00:02:55.176 --> 00:02:57.486
it's gives you kind of
a sense of importance.

00:02:59.196 --> 00:03:01.156
