A lot of people are worried about using a
plasma TV for gaming, because we've drilled

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.140
into your heads over the last several years
that plasmas had burn-in issues, there was

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.480
glare on the screen, and they weren't so great
for gaming because of these things.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:16.670
Those are the old plasmas.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.039
Those are the first three, four, five, six
generations of plasmas.

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:22.980
They have fixed all that stuff.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.180
I know people that have plasmas that have
had their XBOX menus up on the screen and

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.090
fallen asleep for hours, and they wake up
and the same image is on the screen as when

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:33.090
they went to sleep.

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.090
And you know what?

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:35.160
No burn-in.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.850
You actually have to work hard to burn your
screen in.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:44.770
You'd have to leave the exact same image on
your screen probably 24 to 48 hours, although,

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.290
we've never successfully done it.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.290
We won't do that.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.520
We don't have time to do that.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.550
And, it's just silly.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.310
I mean you really have to try hard to burn
it in.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:55.760
So, take that whole burn-in issue and throw
it in the trash.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.210
That's what we've done.

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.200
So burn-in not a problem.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:00.620
Glare also not a problem.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:04.750
For your better plasmas, there's usually an
anti-glare coating, or something on the screen

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.950
to make glare a non-issue.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.010
And so you don't really need to worry about
that.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.250
And the contrast ratio of a plasma, and just
the warmth and the color - they're beautiful

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.250
for gaming.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.939
So really don't worry about it.

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.510
Now, there's plenty of you out there going:
What about LCDs?

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.510
I like LCDs.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.920
Well, there's nothing wrong with an LCD either.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.570
The LCDs...somebody on one of our comments,
they even said, "So LCDs seem to be the way

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.350
of the future" and it does kind of seem like
that.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:32.470
LCD TVs are thinner than ever.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:35.299
I mean, they're almost as thin as this clipboard
now.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:36.299
It's ridiculous.

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.670
And they look cool.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:46.000
They've got their fast refresh rates, their
incredibly bright pictures, brighter than

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.460
ever before.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.509
And they actually, if you look at the best
LCDs, they look like some of the better plasmas

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.509
now.

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:57.260
In fact the lines are kind of blurring about
which one's better for gaming: LCD or plasma.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.020
So really you can't go wrong.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.680
The better TV you get, the happier you will
be.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.500
Get the best one you can afford, seriously.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.021
I know it sounds like a salesman telling you
to buy the best one you can afford, but, you

00:02:07.021 --> 00:02:10.439
know what, it's really the best thing you
can do.

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:14.819
If you're that into gaming and you want the
best image, go for the best TV you can afford.

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:15.819
And take a look at some.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.930
You know, plasmas might be your thing, LCDs
might be your thing, and you're not wrong

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.829
either way.

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:25.120
So, we have advisors here that can help you
figure out which one is the right TV for you

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.829

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.500

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.669
