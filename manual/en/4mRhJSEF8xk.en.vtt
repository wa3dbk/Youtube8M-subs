00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
oh and  we love to sing

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Wake up holy it's time for you to tell us a story

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.000
I have already thought about the story that I'm going to tell you today but

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
like always you have to answer one question at the end

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:15.000
sure we will long long ago Jesus crossed the Sea of Galilee and reach the coast of Caesarea Philippi

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
there he told a lot of people about the Word of God and also warned them against Pharisees and Sadducees

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
the Pharisees and the Sadducees would often try to destroy people's faith in Jesus

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Jesus once raised question among his followers he asked who do people think I am

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
after thinking for a while they said some people think that you're one of the many prophets

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
some think you're John the Baptist some also think you're Elijah or Jeremiah

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
hearing these answers from his followers Jesus turned to Simon Peter and asked him

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
who do you think I am Simon Peter immediately answered

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000
you are Christ the Son of God the Messiah Jesus was extremely pleased

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that Simon Peter believed in him so Jesus blessed him saying

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
that from that day onwards he would be called Peter which meant rock

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
the next day Jesus told his followers not to tell anyone that he was the promised Messiah

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000
he said that he would go to Jerusalem and suffer a lot

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and later he would die but then again on the third day after his death

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
he would rise to life again hearing this Peter was really worried

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
he took Jesus to one side and said to him

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Lord you must not do that Jesus understood the worry and surprise in Peter's voice

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
he explained to him that peter must not try and stop him from fulfilling his mission

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
only in his death would he do what he wants to achieve

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000
wow peter realy loved jesus  didn't he yes he did

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I hope you all liked the story ofcourse we did

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.000

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
