Hello and welcome to part two of Epic Tutorials
Best Filmmaking apps for the iPhone and iPad

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:19.420
in 2013 where we look at the very best apps
for production including videos cameras, filed

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:25.230
recorders, teleprompters and more! We have
tested just about every filmmaking app we

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.030
could find and spent hundreds of dollars and
hours so you don't have to and these are our

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.600
top five apps for filming your movie on the
iPhone and iPad.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:46.940
Remember app links are in the description
and if this helps you please Thumbs up and

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:48.820
subscribe. Let's kick things off.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:54.149
Now when it comes to filming your movie, forget
the default camera app that comes on your

00:00:54.149 --> 00:01:01.760
iPhone or iPad, if you want professional results
with a data rate higher than a 5Dmk iii, yes

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.290
you heard right people, then get Filmic Pro
for iPhone and iPad.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.030
This incredible app allows you to control
the focus, exposure and white balance manually

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.539
and independently of each other and lock them
to avoid exposure or focus changes whilst

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:23.779
filming. It supports multiple filmmrates including
24, 25 and 30 progressive frames per second

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:29.540
and best of all this app offers audio monitoring,
accepts compatible microphones or audio interfaces

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:35.719
via Apples Camera Connection kit as well as
letting you film at an incredible 50MB/s!

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:40.639
If you only get one app for filmmaking make
sure this is it as it totally blows every

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:43.719
other video camera app out of the water.

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:54.279
If you want wireless control over Filmic Pro
then the Filmic RMT is an essential app and

00:01:54.279 --> 00:01:57.920
perfect for controlling multi cam shoots from
either an iPhone or iPad. Just make sure all

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.099
devices are connected to the same wi-fi network.
Filmic RMT will display the signal strength

00:02:03.099 --> 00:02:07.249
and you have the option to use either a colour
or black and white preview depending on the

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:09.410
playback quality you want.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.020
This app gives you full control over all Filmic
Pro's settings including focus, exposure and

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:20.480
white balance as well as frame rate and data
rate and also allows you to copy clips from

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.050
one device to another wirelessly making this
ideal for controlling multiple cameras or

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.810
just hitting record yourself as you, like
me, don't have any friends.

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:39.220
If you want to transform your iOS device into
a professional field monitor get RODE Rec

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:46.000
which was previously available on the App
Store under the name FiRe 2 Field Recorder.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.280
This will recognise external microphones plugged
into either the headphone jack or lightning

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:58.150
or 30pin connector and allow you to record
in 48khz for film audio or 44.1 for music

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:04.600
productions and exports in a range of lossless
formats like AIFF and WAV. It features live

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.240
monitoring and a wide selection of iZotope
powered effects to help you capture pro audio

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.070
on your iPhone and iPad and export them via
soundcloud, Dropbox, and iTunes file sharing

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.620
for inclusion in your film and audio projects.
You can also apply a huge amount of metadata

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:27.920
including location info making this a must
have for any serious filmmaker and field recordist.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.040
Check our Youtube Channel for our in-depth
guide to recording pro audio on an iOS device

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.040
with microphone comparisons.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.120
If you want to add a retro feel to your footage
then don't go past 8mm for the iPhone and

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:46.270
iPad, the app used to film parts of the award
winning documentary Searching for Sugarman.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:51.110
You can change the lens and film stock simply
by swiping through them for a variety of different

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.780
looks. You can also add frame jitter by tapping
the button in the lower right for some pretty

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.960
awesome results - making this perfect for
music videos or emulatating classics like

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:02.300
Nosferatu.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:06.110
If you have previously shot footage using
another camera or app, you can import it from

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:10.270
your iOS devices camera roll and apply effects
in real time as it plays back after hitting

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:11.330
record.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:18.430
The only downsize is that this apps only supports
720p resolution but with any luck the developers

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.530
will address this in a future update.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:26.870
Unless you have a touch of Rain Man about
you, you probably struggle with memorising

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.880
pages of dialogue which is why you probably
want to check out the incredible Elite Promoter

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:35.919
by iKan Internationl.

00:04:35.919 --> 00:04:40.060
Now whilst this apps lets you type a script
right within the app or copy and paste text

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:46.139
from another app, Elite Prompters killer feature
is that it supports final draft script import

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:50.999
from your Dropbox account. It will recognise
scene headings allowing you to either import

00:04:50.999 --> 00:04:56.789
the entire script or a particular scene and
another incredible feature is the dialogue

00:04:56.789 --> 00:05:02.300
only import option which removes all action
leaving you just with your dialogue.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.380
You have complete control over playback including
text size, playback speed and the ability

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.310
to add cue points that can be skipped to easily
during playback and much much more.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:17.580
You can control playback with a Bluetooth
keyboard making this the ultimate TelePrompter

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.990
app for mobile filmmakers especially when
used with an iPad tripod mount like the Makayama

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.990
Movie Mount.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:27.770
