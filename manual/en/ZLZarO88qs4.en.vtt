00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:06.473
Lyrics based on a Poem by Tania Stankova

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:10.252
Young, pretty lady with a violin
is walking down the street

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.152
to play in the park at Sunset.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.552
Some whistling from a bench -  
a barely developed poet.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.800
But Miss Music doesn't pay 
any attention at all.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.000
Let him mind his own whistle -
she is not walking alone!

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.633
Tight to her lovely breast she is
caring her precious violin and

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.194
She is going steadily her own way!

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:43.300
Dear "Admirers" - a piece of advice:

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.600
Do not disturb ladies engaged 
to a musical instrument!

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.196
Dear "Admirers" - a practical advice:

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.196
Do not whistle at ladies 
devoted to a quartet!!!

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.196
Young lady with a violin
is walking down the street

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.152
to play in the concert hall 
early in the morning.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.552
Again a whistling from a bench:  
a barely bearable student.

00:01:29.559 --> 00:01:33.352
Dear "Admirers" - a pragmatic advice:

00:01:33.559 --> 00:01:38.352
Do not disturb the ladies engaged 
to a musical instrument!

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.552
Dear "Admirers" - a direct advice:

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.152
Do not whistle up at ladies 
devoted to a quartet!!!

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.552
Even more to a quintet with a conductor!
