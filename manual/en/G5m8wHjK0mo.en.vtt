00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:16.380
Open your racket

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.069
a little bit more.

00:00:18.069 --> 00:00:21.299
No you don't have to open 
your racket too much.

00:00:21.299 --> 00:00:22.330
Right now

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.049
before you do this one, 
don't hit the ball too hard.

00:00:26.049 --> 00:00:29.699
Try to keep the ball on 
the table first. Okay?

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:33.130
I'm going to show you. 
You're going to serve short.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:37.050
So make a higher arc first. 
How can we make it?

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.270
Too high huh?

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:44.560
Still too high.

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.830
How about this one?

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.170
Oh even worse.

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.070
See over the net no problem

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.550
now you're going to make a lower arc.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:54.870
How can you make it?

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:56.730
Change your racket angle.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:01.310
Faced to forward. Good.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:06.120
Looks good

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.760
but quality is still not enough.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.650
Now you can feel you 
can lift the ball here

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:15.940
then

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.680
try to face... change your racket angle
faced like this. Now you're going to add

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.830
a little bit

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:22.760
of brush there

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:27.360
because you need the ball over 
the net right? Okay let's go.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.250
Brush the ball

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.450
like this.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.290
Okay now you say "oh I'm getting better, 
how about the next one, closed?"

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:44.280
No, not yet. Stay there.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.280
Now you can brush and use your wrist
to add a little bit more power.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:49.280
Like this

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.299
See that? A little bit more power

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:00.299
and brush

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:45.819
So just a little bit more.

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:51.299
But first thing you have to lift the ball, 
you have to know how to lift the ball.

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.539
Okay? I showed you earlier

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:55.369
how you can do it.

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:57.639
Open your racket. 

00:02:58.369 --> 00:03:00.039
Easy. Right?

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:03.359
Then change your racket angle

00:03:03.359 --> 00:03:05.569
more, more like this.

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:07.329
Then you stay here

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.769
stay here and practice

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:12.000
a little bit longer time

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.879
you automatic, this is your 
automatic racket angle here.

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:20.169
Then I think you won't 
have too much trouble

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.769
on your flip.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.000
Okay you can try it.
Thank you very much.
