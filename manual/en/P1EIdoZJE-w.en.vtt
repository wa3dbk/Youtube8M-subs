00:00:00.001 --> 00:00:01.190
Hi, I'm Nanette Gale, 

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.170
I'm the river manager on the Ashley National Forest

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.150
for the portion of the Green River that's just below the Flaming Gorge dam.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.050
The Green River starts in southwest Wyoming,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:14.120
runs through the Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area in Utah,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.060
to Dinosaur National Monument,

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.030
and continues through some of Utah's most rugged and remote landscape.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:23.240
Popular for its beautiful scenery, crystal clear water,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:25.040
and world class fishing, 

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.190
the Green River attracts people from all over the country.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.230
The "A" section of the Green River 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.280
begins just below the Flaming Gorge Dam

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:36.220
and proceeds seven miles through a narrow, breathtaking canyon 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.140
to the Little Hole take out.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.160
The towering red canyon cliffs,

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:43.000
ponderosa pine, glassy clear water,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.280
and abundant trout are what makes

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.060
section "A" of the Green River world famous.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.130
The Little Hole National Recreation trail   

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.220
allows foot access to all seven miles of this stretch of river. 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.010
Section "B" runs from Little Hole to Browns Park.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.110
It is a little more remote, but that means there are

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.140
a lot less people if that's the experience you're looking for.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.070
Limited access in this section allows for

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:10.130
healthy brown trout populations to thrive.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.210
There are seventeen river camps in section "B" that can be 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.130
accessed only by hiking or floating in. 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.070
Remember to reserve your site on the camp registration board at Little Hole

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.290
before heading down river, or reserve one in advance online through recreation.gov.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.090
Section "C" is the longest of the three sections.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:32.200
It meanders through the high desert valley at Browns Park

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.190
to the Colorado state line.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.140
With wide open features and a lot of flat water.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.090
It's considered the best place to catch 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.120
a football sized trout on a dry fly

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.050
but it is also said to be the most challenging for fishing.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.090
There are several sections of the Green River

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.230
that can be rafted, kayaked, or canoed.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.290
But some areas require a permit

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:53.120
from the National Park Service

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.180
including Gates of Leodore, Whirl Pool Canyon, and Split Mountain.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.030
The Green River offers year round access

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.050
for recreation and fishing.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:05.060
But the primary season is from early April through October

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.250
with higher flows generally during late May and early June.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.290
Whether you rent a raft, use a river guide,

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.050
or bring your own boat,

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:15.120
there are a few things you need to remember.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.270
Always wear your life jacket when on the river.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.240
Bring plenty of food and drinking water with you.

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.270
Plan for changing weather conditions.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.250
Wear sunblock and layered clothing to protect yourself from the elements.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.080
Leave no trace, please pack out all of your garbage.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.080
You should always have fun 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:37.230
but remember to be safe while you enjoy the beautiful Green River.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:49.000
