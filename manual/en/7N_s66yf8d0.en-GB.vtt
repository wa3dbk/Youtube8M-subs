00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:16.970
00:13
COMM: The brainchild of Michael Vetter, this

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:23.890
the ETV, or Extra Terrestrial Vehicle. Born
in Naples and raised in Germany, Michael owns

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.250
The Car Factory in Micco, Florida. and he's
been turning out six to eight custom cars

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.000
a year for the last fifteen years.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.559
00:35
COMM: After he became a father, Michael tried

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:46.680
to design a sports car with a backseat. The
futuristic looking result is the ETV car.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:52.379
The first ETV car began with a Chevrolet Aveo
at it's base. but now Michael uses whatever

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:58.460
donor car customers supply him with. And these
have included Porches, Renaults and Toyotas.

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.239
01:01
COMM: The first step is to extend the chassis

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.310
to create a longer wheelbase. A new body frame
of tubular steel is added and then clad in

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:15.720
a custom fibreglass skin. Along with a whole
range of specially made parts.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.100
01:19
COMM: All of the vehicles are capable of highway

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.080
speeds, with many being comfortable at 100mph.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:34.050
01:31
COMM: Prices start at $75,000 with an average

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:40.250
custom build costing around 95,000. However
some of Michael's unique concept cars have

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.880
sold for over $250,000.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.900
01:45
COMM: Each car takes a minimum of six months

00:01:47.900 --> 00:02:06.489
to create. With one off concept builds taking
at least 

00:02:06.489 --> 00:02:07.020
a year.
