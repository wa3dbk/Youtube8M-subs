00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:03.860
How to apply decals for the Burning Man
festival:

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:12.620
The Burning Man festival does not allow
any trucks with corporate logos to enter

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:13.309
the festival.

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.920
Use these steps and the authorized decal rolls to cover all logos on your U-Haul

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:30.840
equipment.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.079
Covering the logo's with any other
material can cause damage to the truck

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.570
can result in additional fees.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.460
Identify what areas on the vehicle need
to be covered.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.530
This includes all areas with U-Haul,

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.070
Ford and GM logos and trademarks.

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.570
Use the tape measure to determine the
appropriate size needed for decals.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:58.199
Cut the appropriate size decal to
cover the logo.

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:11.720
The kit will work for all equipment.

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.980
You may have leftover material depending
on the size of your equipment.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:21.460
Save in case it's needed at the festival.
Peel the back of the decals,

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.480
press firmly on the decals and smooth
over with your hand.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.740
To apply the decal, careful not to cover
the equipment number on the truck as

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.080
this must stay visible.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.180
Repeat until all logos are covered,
including the grill,

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:47.160
if applicable.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.090
Before returning the truck, remove decals
and clean

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:54.120
properly.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.730
