Hi! I’m Debbie with Expert Village.com and
I am here to talk about some more crafts you

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:11.000
can do with your young child. If you don’t
want to mess with finding things at your house

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.219
you could go to a crafts store and find a
wide variety of things that you could do with

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:22.289
your child fairly inexpensive. They are really,
really good fine motor eye-hand coordination

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.430
type activities that produce something precious
that your child is really proud of and fairly

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.180
low maintenance for you. Some ideas, just
some really quick little things from a crafts

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.670
store; get a little Halloween mummy, comes
with all the pieces, all you need is glue

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:49.110
to put it together, a cute activity. Here
are some fun shapes; little beads, little

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.190
tubular beads to make a design on these little
grids. Really, really excellent fine motor

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.290
skills. It takes a lot of control to be able
to put those little beads on there and you

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:08.110
will find your child is very determined to
get that finished. Here are some of your basic

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:14.660
pipe cleaners, and puffball art, little activities.
This one happens to be funky fish. There are

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:24.140
others to make insects, really cute, and all
you need is some glue, some creativity. We

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:31.390
have some really neat little painting activities.
They give you the little plastic shape and

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.520
give you paints, and you paint fill in the
blanks, and you have a pretty little sun catcher

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:43.340
to put in your window. What I like about this
is basically everything you need is in the

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.990
package. Here is another little sun catcher
activity, little frogs. You sprinkle a little

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:57.750
crystals in and then you bake it for a while.
This one would require some grownup supervision,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.420
but still really fun, cute to hang in the
windows. And here is more little fun, very

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.921
inexpensive, $2, little stringing necklaces
with the foam, the strings in there, the foam

00:02:09.921 --> 00:02:15.019
shapes are there, some fun things to do, low
maintenance, and cute.
