English lyrics by: LittleJaynayCakes

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.660
The seasons die out one by one, their lives fade to gray.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:48.340
Their cries of death, become the wind, and then blow away,

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.480
A man much too sober to, enjoy the city's view,

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:00.540
He wastes away, so pointlessly, looking at the moon.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.980
This life that's slowed down to a stop - a stick in the mud,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.700
With rain that's tainted with a taste of pure alcohol,

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:18.660
With apathy these eyes; they glow in the city lights

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:24.900
I know I haven't done a thing but I still feel guilty ...

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.620
It's as though, I'm alone, just living life as a bare shadow,

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:36.420
And by now, I can't be sure, if I'm 'me' anymore.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.180
If I sing out to the rain, will the sun come out again?

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.920
I'm nothing but a dried-up life, in this busy summer full of light,

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.060
Dear, my most hated Past,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.560
I'm ready at last - to leave you behind,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.980
Even if these steps I make - 
Lead to the last breath I'll take,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.540
A path paved with nightmares and horrible days
the trail I've left behind me,

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.560
Someday these flowers will bloom,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:19.140
and they'll float down to you - wiping this life anew,

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.680
Even through my suffering, even through my endless grief,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:33.280
With no sunlight breaking through the clouds above,
The song in my heart, plays on!

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.460
Tired eyes and heavy feet, dragged along the hot concrete,

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:52.960
I'm frowning at the sun's red rays, glaring through the sunset's haze

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.000
I'm not sure if I should go - Should I return to what I know?

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.480
Then I find I'm turning back, 
to face my pain-filled awful past,

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.460
That's right! I know that I've got to fight!

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:14.160
I must try my best to live,
even if there's no purpose,

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.000
After all we've been spared,
saved and picked from despair,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:25.660
We'll leave these fractured memories 
scattered far behind ...

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.920
Dear my broken down past ...

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.340
I'm feeling now at last the nostalgia you've left,

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:43.620
Just like those god-awful days and nightmares that never fade,

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.700
As close to me as I thought they would always stay,

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:53.000
I realize they're behind me ...
