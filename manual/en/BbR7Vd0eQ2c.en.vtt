00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:08.910
Hello and welcome to another video of ours
in which we are showing Lion Steel knives.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.080
This time we have a Daghetta aluminum foldable
knife.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.910
It was made in Maniago in Italy;

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.240
very famous city in Italy, where the knife
making

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.519
is the core business.

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.519
This particular knife is made by Lion Steel
and was designed by MAX; Massimo Salice Sanna

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.040
designer.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:43.030
The knife comes with a

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:48.170
English instruction, a manual,

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:53.969
this also carries all the warranty information,

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.840
it is also quality certificate.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:01.649
It gives explanation about Maniago quality,
because there is

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:08.630
a special quality of all the knives, which
comes from Maniago.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.630
It also carries some information about materials
used for this knife.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:17.370
As you can see, the knife is foldable.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:21.570
It offers thumb-stud for one-hand opening.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.700
It is a little bit harder,

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.120
you have to get used of it.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:37.120
As you can see, it has a spear-point blade,
almost symmetrical.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.140
It has an axis lock,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.670
Lion Steel calls it T.O.L.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.430
Tactical Operational Lock-system.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:56.430
That means, you have to squeeze in, to unlock
it,

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.680
like this, now it is unlocked.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:06.530
Basically this is an advanced locking system,

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.860
but also highly functional.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:15.860
The knife is 19.0 cm long, it has a blade
of 8.0 cm and the blade thickness of approximately

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.090
3.0 mm.

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.390
It weight 120 grams,

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.610
it is really light,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:33.130
and you can see the main feature is also the
nice design.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:39.650
The design is really something special.

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.420
The handle is made of aluminum,

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:48.420
but it also can be made of G10 or carbon fiber.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.110
The material used for the blade is tool steel
D2,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.970
you can see it is written here.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.280
You can also see here MAX design.

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.670
This tool steel is

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:07.960
care-free; you are care free about maintenance
and care, and it is high quality steel for

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.370
blades.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:18.260
The handle is like we said made of aluminum
and has a nice 3-dimensional shape.

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:20.980
It also has a

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.460
belt-clip,

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.900
which can be either on this side, or on the
other side.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.430
And it also has a sling hole at the end.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:37.319
If we make a short summary;

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:43.680
this is really nice knife with a folding blade

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:50.590
and I think if will special suitable for all
of those who are looking a nicely designed

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:51.290
knife,

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.670
which are different than many others on the
market.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:03.170
And you also, even by looking it or feeling
it, see the high quality of finish, and that

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:08.540
there was a really a lot of effort invested
in production of this knife;

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.540
since everything is well done and on high
quality level.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:17.560
