00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.421
Okay so our next step for our kitchen painting
project is to conclude our surface preparation.

00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:09.290
So, we're going to come right over to our
woodfill repair and we're just going to add

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.420
a second coat of that. We've allowed it to
dry for a couple hours. It's dried nice and

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:21.999
hard. And, I'm just going to put a little
bit more. So, that we can then sand it down

00:00:21.999 --> 00:00:32.149
lightly and it's going to be nice even finish.
Just a little bit of excess and then we're

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:38.860
going to sand it down. And, I'll show you
how to finish that up. Excellent. Looking

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:44.190
great. We're just going to let that dry for
a little bit. Ok. So, we're back and we've

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.340
allowed our repairs to dry. The next and final
part of our surface preparation is we're going

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.310
to give it a light sand and then we're going
to seal it up with primer. And, that's going

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:58.800
to completely repair it for paint. You grab
a little piece of sandpaper. You're just going

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.929
to kind of take it down. Just smooth it out
a little bit, taking the sandpaper and following

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:16.670
the direction of whatever surface you have.
Ok. So, what we did is we built it up with

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.450
a couple layers and then we sanded it down
smooth. So, now we've repaired our trim. Now,

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:34.689
I'm going to do the flat area. I'm going to
use our sanding block. I'm going to lightly

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:43.619
feather it out, kind of taking down any bumps
or any tool marks that we made from applying

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:50.109
the plaster. And, we're down to focusing on
the edge where it meets the rest of the wall

00:01:50.109 --> 00:02:03.289
so that you won't see that. There we go. Looks
good. Now, we want to clear up the dust that

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.990
we just made. I'm just going to give it a
quick little brushing with my dust brush.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:29.881
And, I'm going to catch the rest with this
vacuum. Ok. One other helpful item that we

00:02:29.881 --> 00:02:36.130
have for removing the dust is this tack cloth.
It comes in a little plastic package and you

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.630
just want to open it up and kind of leave
it in the plastic. It's waxy surface that

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:52.460
you rub over the surface and it picks up all
the excess dust. So, that the paint will stick

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.790
nicely. There, so we've picked up the dust
and now our surface is dust free and ready

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:00.790
for coating. And, finally we're going to seal
the repairs that we've made with this primer.

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:07.100
That will be the final step in getting our
surface ready for paint. So, normally I work

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.560
out of a cup. But, in this case since it's
just a small area I'm going to work directly

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.620
out of the can. This will assure that the
paint will adhere properly to the surface.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:23.020
Especially, since we used joint compound or
certain spackles. They're water soluble. Meaning,

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:28.370
once they get wet again it reanimates them.
So, if you were to rub a sponge over the spackles

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.940
that we just did it would actually re-wet
it and re-soften it. So, this primer is the

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.590
only way that we can kind of seal it in and
it makes it as hard as concrete and ready

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:47.740
to paint. One sign of amateur repair work
is where you can totally see, it's total obvious

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:58.840
repairs. And, that's when it wasn't properly
sanded out or primed. Ok. We're going to let

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.170
that dry in and then our surfaces are ready
to paint.
