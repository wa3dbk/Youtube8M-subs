l'm offering you my services...
free of charge.

00:00:12.391 --> 00:00:14.361
What do you say ?

00:00:14.426 --> 00:00:16.263
Ah...

00:00:16.328 --> 00:00:19.467
l think l'd be
a little afraid.

00:00:19.531 --> 00:00:21.701
Of what ?

00:00:21.766 --> 00:00:26.041
Afraid of making
a mistake.

00:00:26.105 --> 00:00:30.446
No mistakes in the tango,
not like life.

00:00:30.508 --> 00:00:33.114
lt's simple. That's what makes
the tango so great.

00:00:33.178 --> 00:00:38.021
lf you make a mistake,
get all tangled up, just tango on.

00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:41.623

00:00:51.698 --> 00:00:54.369

00:01:01.408 --> 00:01:03.879
Your arm.

00:01:05.679 --> 00:01:08.317
Charlie,

00:01:08.382 --> 00:01:10.920
l'm gonna need some
coordinates here, son.

00:01:10.985 --> 00:01:13.990
The floor's
about 20 by 30,

00:01:14.054 --> 00:01:17.027
And you're at
the long end.

00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:21.098
There's tables on the outside.
The band's on the right.
