00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.792
Have you ever felt
as if you're overwhelmed by problems?

00:00:14.625 --> 00:00:20.959
Well, if you feel like you're surrounded
by negativity and frustration,

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:25.796
and you have knots in your stomach,
and you have a weight on your shoulders,

00:00:25.797 --> 00:00:28.266
like I'm feeling right now,

00:00:28.267 --> 00:00:30.846
sometimes, you might feel
like you're trapped,

00:00:30.847 --> 00:00:32.776
or like you're facing a wall.

00:00:32.777 --> 00:00:35.256
It's a very physical experience,

00:00:35.257 --> 00:00:40.696
and the problems
that I attempt to conquer are just that,

00:00:40.697 --> 00:00:42.396
very physical.

00:00:42.397 --> 00:00:45.772
What do you think
when you hear rock-climber?

00:00:45.773 --> 00:00:47.932
Probably someone like this,

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:52.292
a strong man who's muscular
with shaggy hair?

00:00:52.293 --> 00:00:54.012
(Laughter)

00:00:54.013 --> 00:00:57.682
And when people find out
that I climb, they're surprised,

00:00:57.683 --> 00:00:59.412
because I'm so small.

00:00:59.413 --> 00:01:02.589
And they think, "You climb?"

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.709
To answer that, it's "Yes. I do climb."

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.969
And I've been doing it
for a little while now,

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:12.129
about 7 years,
so more than half of my life.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:13.719
(Laughter)

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.090
Well, this all began in the heart
of New York City, Central Park.

00:01:18.091 --> 00:01:22.792
This guy name Yuki, he just told me
all the basics of climbing.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.800
He told me that all you needed

00:01:24.801 --> 00:01:28.599
was a pair of climbing shoes
and a chalk bag to have fun.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.159
He also told me that the pathway to get
on top of the boulder is called a problem,

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.821
and there's also
a grading system in climbing.

00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:41.626
So there's a V on the left side
and a number on the right side,

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.168
it's pretty simple.

00:01:43.169 --> 00:01:46.338
And if the number is lower, it's easier,

00:01:46.339 --> 00:01:50.618
so for example,
V0 is almost like a ladder,

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:54.070
while a V16 is nearly impossible.

00:01:54.071 --> 00:01:59.600
One of my favourite parts about climbing
is that no matter what your size,

00:01:59.601 --> 00:02:04.059
if you're small, big, light, or heavy

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.469
the problem is never going to change,

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.469
but you can approach
the problem differently.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.718
Well, back then, I was smaller
than any of the other climbers around,

00:02:13.719 --> 00:02:19.610
so I had to master the skill
of hand and foot placement.

00:02:19.611 --> 00:02:24.750
And I like to think of it as a puzzle,
and I love solving puzzles.

00:02:24.751 --> 00:02:27.170
(Laughs)

00:02:27.171 --> 00:02:29.791
What began as a hobby,

00:02:30.671 --> 00:02:33.670
soon, allowed me
to travel around the world.

00:02:33.671 --> 00:02:38.050
Well, do you know where this is?
Any guesses?

00:02:38.051 --> 00:02:39.360
No? OK.

00:02:39.361 --> 00:02:41.321
Well, this is New York actually.

00:02:42.921 --> 00:02:44.940
I was pretty small back then.

00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:46.381
(Laughter)

00:02:47.918 --> 00:02:50.627
I've also traveled to places like Spain.

00:02:51.731 --> 00:02:55.342
But my most recent trip
was to South Africa.

00:02:55.343 --> 00:03:00.229
And my goal there
was to raise the level of female climbing

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.680
by climbing the difficulty of grade V14.

00:03:05.813 --> 00:03:08.293
(Cheers) (Applause)

00:03:12.363 --> 00:03:17.743
And only one other woman
had accomplished this grade,

00:03:17.744 --> 00:03:20.164
and only a handful of men.

00:03:21.072 --> 00:03:24.221
On the first day I tried this problem,
Golden Shadow,

00:03:24.222 --> 00:03:27.081
I decided to break it into pieces,

00:03:27.082 --> 00:03:31.482
and by breaking it into sections,
I would be able to test myself,

00:03:31.484 --> 00:03:34.636
and see if this is possible for me.

00:03:34.637 --> 00:03:39.827
And even though I surprised myself
by being able to climb all the sections,

00:03:40.556 --> 00:03:43.203
I was left with the impossible task

00:03:43.204 --> 00:03:46.194
of piecing it all together,
and doing it in one go.

00:03:47.153 --> 00:03:52.572
Well, during the next few days,
I climbed from sun up till sundown.

00:03:52.573 --> 00:03:56.206
Or even afterwards, with a headlamp!

00:03:57.256 --> 00:04:02.959
And I climbed until my hands were bloody,
and my eyes were full of tears.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.973
I was really desperate for this.
And stubborn.

00:04:08.383 --> 00:04:13.659
I would fall, and fall, and fall,
but I'd always just hop back to my feet

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.500
and think to myself, was it my hands,
feet or shall I reposition my body?

00:04:21.356 --> 00:04:26.215
And eventually, my dad suggested
that I should find a new project

00:04:26.216 --> 00:04:30.359
because he thought that this one
was just out of my reach.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.494
But I knew that I had to try
at least one more time,

00:04:34.495 --> 00:04:38.954
so I said, "Why not?
Just give it one more go."

00:04:38.955 --> 00:04:42.424
So I put my shoes back on
and chalked up my hands.

00:04:42.425 --> 00:04:45.705
And it just happened! I don't know how.

00:04:47.206 --> 00:04:50.665
I just got on the wall,
and I seemed to just execute.

00:04:50.666 --> 00:04:55.586
I was able to realize my dream;
and I was standing on top of a boulder.

00:04:58.426 --> 00:05:03.013
And then I realized
that 99% of climbing is falling,

00:05:03.014 --> 00:05:06.144
and what you might consider failure.

00:05:07.264 --> 00:05:10.613
That means I just fall on my butt
over, and over, and over again.

00:05:10.614 --> 00:05:14.056
And that success, that's only one percent.

00:05:15.236 --> 00:05:18.965
It's so worth it!
At the end, it's so worth it.

00:05:18.966 --> 00:05:21.878
I agree with what Bill Gates said,

00:05:21.879 --> 00:05:24.878
"Success is a lousy teacher."

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:28.772
This also ties into my daily life.

00:05:30.362 --> 00:05:33.610
I've been having trouble doing homework

00:05:33.611 --> 00:05:38.541
because I have a pretty hectic schedule.

00:05:38.542 --> 00:05:42.917
So I wake up at 6 a.m.
in the morning, go to school,

00:05:42.951 --> 00:05:46.360
and then I train at the climbing gym
for about 4 hours,

00:05:46.361 --> 00:05:51.600
and then I'm back home
when it's about 10.30.

00:05:51.601 --> 00:05:53.864
And then I start doing homework.

00:05:53.869 --> 00:05:58.732
For me, homework is also my V14.

00:05:58.733 --> 00:06:00.832
(Laughter)

00:06:00.833 --> 00:06:04.543
That's just how much I struggle with it.

00:06:04.544 --> 00:06:10.203
It's also really easy to get distracted
when your phone is just a pocket away.

00:06:10.204 --> 00:06:16.812
And on social media like Facebook,
Instagram, or Snapchat,

00:06:16.813 --> 00:06:20.925
people only post things that are happy,

00:06:20.926 --> 00:06:26.155
like eating food,
which is what I post a lot.

00:06:26.156 --> 00:06:28.255
(Laughter) Yeah.

00:06:28.256 --> 00:06:30.475
Or just like traveling.

00:06:30.476 --> 00:06:36.685
And this is how people see
just me having fun and me climbing.

00:06:36.686 --> 00:06:40.862
But in reality,
this is sort of what happens.

00:06:40.863 --> 00:06:42.802
Yeah (Laughter)

00:06:42.803 --> 00:06:44.362
I hate it so much!

00:06:44.363 --> 00:06:45.643
(Laughter)

00:06:48.246 --> 00:06:51.018
But from climbing,

00:06:51.758 --> 00:06:58.537
I've learnt that homework
is a part of the 99% to success.

00:06:58.538 --> 00:07:04.355
And I've learnt that nothing worth doing
is going to be easy,

00:07:04.356 --> 00:07:09.452
but the effort that you put into it,
is going to pay off at the end.

00:07:09.453 --> 00:07:13.098
And I think that it's important

00:07:13.099 --> 00:07:16.488
to endure and climb
through your problems

00:07:16.489 --> 00:07:20.156
because failure is a huge part of success.

00:07:22.386 --> 00:07:26.065
You don't have to be a rock climber
to understand this,

00:07:26.066 --> 00:07:31.637
but I like to think
that everyone in this room is a climber.

00:07:31.638 --> 00:07:34.299
Think about it. What's your V14?

00:07:35.549 --> 00:07:39.748
Because after all,
we are all climbers at heart.

00:07:39.749 --> 00:07:40.909
Thank you.

00:07:40.910 --> 00:07:42.530
(Cheers) (Applause)
