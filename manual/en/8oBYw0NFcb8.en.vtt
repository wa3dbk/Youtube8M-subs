00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:13.219
BlackBerry Curve 9320.

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:15.759
Expected May 2012.

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.770
The BlackBerry Curve 9320 is a relatively
low cost messaging device which is closely

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:25.720
related to the BlackBerry Curve 9220 which
was launched last month.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.329
It's a slight upgrade to the old Curve 9300
and it sits a little below the Curve 9360

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:35.260
in RIM's product range.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.730
This is a straight and pretty minor update
to the old Curve 9300, the main difference

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:45.450
being that the 9320 runs the latest edition
of the BlackBerry OS, version 7.1 and it comes

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:52.500
with a better camera and some other minor
tweaks such as a dedicated key for BBM.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.309
The 9320 is a very conventional looking BlackBerry,
with a compact QWERTY keyboard, a 2.44" 320

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:07.540
x 240 pixel display, a 3.2 megapixel camera
and WiFi and 3.5G connectivity plus GPS and

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.850
mobile hotspot support.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.390
It does everything that every other BlackBerry
does, and for an entry-level smartphone the

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:17.969
specification isn't bad at all.

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:26.340
Inside is a 1450 mAh battery, the BlackBerry
Curve 9320 measures 109 x 60 x 12.7mm and

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.609
weighs 103 grams.

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:33.289
It looks identical to the 9220, but there's
very little chance of market confusion as

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.750
the 9220 is for the Indian market only.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.689
RIM say that the 9320 will be available on
various carriers worldwide.

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.689
In the UK, the 3 network have announced that
the handset will be available from 14th May

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:55.179
for £140 for the prepay version or free on
a £15/month contract, T-Mobile UK are offering

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:01.060
a similar deal of £150 prepay or free on
a £15.50/month contract.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:09.920
No doubt many other operators will be joining
them.
