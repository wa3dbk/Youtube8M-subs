00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.540
So are you looking to find out on how you
can bleach your teeth? Well my name is Michelle

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.530
and I'm a dental assistant with Solutionz
and I'm going to explain to you on how you

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.290
can bleach your teeth. It is pretty simple.
First you really need to think about on how

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.749
white you want your teeth to be and then depending
on that you would be able to choose on what

00:00:18.749 --> 00:00:24.250
method is best for you. There are a couple
of different methods. You can either go see

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.609
your general dentist and he would be able
to make you actual upper and lower custom

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.841
fitting bleaching trays which then in return
you would have to take those home. He would

00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:38.270
also give you a bleaching solution to use
and then you would just take the bleaching

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.120
solution. You would only want to put a minimal
size amount of the bleaching solution into

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.310
the trays and then you place the solution
on each individual tooth. For example you

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:55.650
would want to kind of take the solution. You
would want to put a drop on each individual

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.950
tooth. You would actually want to do it on
the very front of the teeth, also too you

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.310
can place it on the back part of the teeth
and you would then put your trays in your

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:13.890
mouth, wear them for the recommended amount
of time as far as two times a day at 30 minutes

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.400
a session or you can wear it once a day for
an hour then you would just take the trays

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.710
out, brush and floss your teeth as normal
and rinse out the trays and then continue

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.700
doing that for at least two to three weeks
then you will start to see results within

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.960
at least three to four days you will start
to see results. The longer you continue bleaching

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.450
your teeth the more results you will see and
the whiter your teeth will be. Also too you

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.450
can purchase over the counter tooth whitening
toothpaste, then you continuously use that

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.530
two to three times day. This procedure actually
you would start to see the effects. It will

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.080
take a lot longer to see the effects as if
you were to go to your general dentist and

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.150
get your actual custom fit bleaching trays.
So once again my name is Michelle and I just

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.740
showed you and explained to you on how you
can bleach your teeth.
