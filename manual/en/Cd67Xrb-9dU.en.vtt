00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:18.900
I am waiting for you

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.960
With My arms outstretched,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.760
And I beckon you to come.

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.120
Trust Me and do not fear.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.860
My Heart longs to draw you near.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.860
A banquet awaits, My friend;

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.440
Won’t you enter in?

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.940
I know of your weariness and pain;

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:06.780
How you struggle and all seems in vain.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.980
Now here I stand before you

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.640
To comfort and restore you

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.360
Asking you to come back again.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.060
I am waiting for you

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.720
With My arms outstretched,

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.280
And I beckon you to come.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.740
Trust Me and do not fear.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.460
My Heart longs to draw you near.

A banquet awaits, My friend;

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.520
Won’t you enter in?

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.000
Other gods have led you astray.

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:17.920
Their promises turned you away.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.660
But when they all abandoned you,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:26.460
Still I kept My hand on you,

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.920
Whispering, “I am the Way.”

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:41.380
I am waiting for you

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:45.040
With My arms outstretched,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.020
And I beckon you to come.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.800
Trust Me and do not fear.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.280
My Heart longs to draw you near.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:05.920
A banquet awaits, My friend;

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.140
Won’t you enter in?

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.920
My Father has set a Feast – a Blessing.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.020
Securely in Us you’ll abide.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:33.800
Child, all of Heaven cares for you.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:42.720
Come, all is prepared for you.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:49.240
I am waiting for you

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:53.160
With My arms outstretched,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:59.360
And I beckon you to come.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:02.720
Trust Me and do not fear.

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.300
My Heart longs to draw you near.

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:12.940

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.600
Won’t you enter in?

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:30.800
A banquet awaits you, My friend;

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:37.420
Won’t you enter in?
