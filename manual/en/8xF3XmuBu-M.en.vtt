00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.139
Glucose, sucrose, high fructose!

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:03.720
Sugar, you guys.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.610
It's all so....taxing.

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:14.059
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.400
Amidst all of the sensationalism about the
"obesity epidemic", there lies a very important

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.770
nugget of information: Americans now consume
39% more added sugars in our food than we

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:25.210
did 50 years ago.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.390
Particularly, we consume waaaaay more high
fructose corn syrup.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.199
This is why some experts say that sugary drinks
like soda, energy drinks, and fruit juice

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:36.019
cocktails are driving their own public health
issues.

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.420
This has led scientists to try to figure out
how we can better curb our consumption of

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.129
these sugary beverages, and one of the ways
that has been proposed is: higher taxes.

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.350
Now even SAYING the word "tax" is generally
divisive one here in the good ol' U-S-of-A,

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.260
but a new study has found that a soda tax
might actually come with health benefits.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.539
An international study based at the Health
Economics Centre at Monash University concluded

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.949
that by upping the taxes on soda, people will
lose weight -- as much as 8 POUNDS in a year

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:02.539
for those who drink a lot of it.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.580
In their analysis, they compared the economic
effect of 2 types of taxes: the first was

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.970
a 20% tax and the second was a 20 CENT tax
per liter of soda.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.330
Both taxes are regressive, which basically
means it affects the poor more than the wealthy,

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.860
but those effects aren't overly pronounced
in the study.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.860
With a 20% tax, the effect impacts all consumption
levels with a similar force, whereas the benefit

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.380
of a 20 CENT tax is that the tax burden increases
when you buy more of the drinks.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.280
For the 20% tax, people are projected to lose
about 3 pounds, or 1.3 kilos, in a year.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.101
Those who drink A LOT of soda could see that
number doubled.

00:01:34.101 --> 00:01:40.500
The 20 cent tax had a more dramatic effect,
kicking off an 8 pound weight loss, or 3.6

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.700
kilos, in a year.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.180
This was only for the middle class though.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.180
Why?

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.760
Researchers at Duke found that for the rich,
they're still gonna buy the soda either way.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:52.850
For the poor, they're more likely to strategize
-- things like buying in bulk or waiting for

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.850
sales.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.870
So for both these groups, the health effects
aren't as likely to kick in as the middle

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:57.870
class.

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:01.090
While these studies both find some health
benefits, other studies have found that taxes

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.710
WON'T encourage healthier habits.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.360
A recent study by health economists at the
University of Iowa found that just because

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.250
people are drinking less soda doesn't mean
that they won't find more calories elsewhere.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.760
So, what do YOU think about a soda tax?

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.250
Is it worthwhile if there's a public health
benefit?

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.870
Or should people be encouraged to drink less
soda on their own -- without the deterrence

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:19.870
caused by taxes?

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.340
Let me know what you think down below, and
we'll be back soon with more DNews updates.
