Hi Geeks this is Miller over accessorygeeks.com.

00:00:15.303 --> 00:00:18.831
This weekend I felt something very interesting offer on our website.

00:00:18.832 --> 00:00:29.629
Suprise price, we sell cellphone and cellphone plans. Most importantly we sell the droid. Most, a motorola and HTC version models.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.457
Well looks like we upgraded since our last the droid accessory video.

00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:37.895
Droid...

00:00:38.243 --> 00:00:42.887
We’ve planned  with some both. And there are too many deep similaries and no negativities.

00:00:42.888 --> 00:00:49.110
Both offer one is the living in battery, a wall USB charger, guides.

00:00:49.111 --> 00:00:57.469
Differences are the Motorola has 16 GB memory, and HTC has 8 GB pre installed offcourse.

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:05.224
This is an HTC looks cooler and more light weight , but the motorola looks has the more functions.

00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:11.750
The Motorola also has a lid and sliding screen. Take it from me, I’m a geek.

00:01:12.887 --> 00:01:19.993
So to get this sweet, sweet ringers, log on to accessorygeeks.com website and look at the cellphone plan icon.

00:01:19.995 --> 00:01:27.050
It’s under the bluetooth headset icon you could find this in the upper center icon

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:35.225
And before you even __ a phone  save the bonus code found under the telephone number at the top right.

00:01:35.271 --> 00:01:39.706
Go crazy after that.. buy for _ good this year for better.

00:01:39.707 --> 00:01:44.141
Happy holidays geeks. And remember  I’m Miller over accessorygeeks.com .

00:01:44.142 --> 00:01:47.021
