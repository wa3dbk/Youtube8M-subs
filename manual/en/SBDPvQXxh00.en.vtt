00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.379
This time in broadcast but Ricardo has decided to go to visit a company that is fully dedicated to electric bikes

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:09.689
let's see what he tells us

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.029
Urgent message for broadcasting friends

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.450
how are you here I arrive with my transport motorcycle 100% electric, not polluting because

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:26.079
what is that message you already know the sustainable personal mobility is possible today I also want

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.869
tell us how it is possible because we may be able to use electric vehicles in Spain

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.649
electric motorcycles

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:34.970
electric cars

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.139
and it is for no other reason than for the time dedication

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:46.059
the illusion of people who risk their time and their money to make this possible we will know an interesting history the history of

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.639
miguelángel suárez miguel angel who as is

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:57.580
miguelangel tell us what happened on a trip to shanghai china as nothing you get off the airport and start to see a huge mass

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:03.429
of vehicles approaching the traffic lights do not make any noise electric vehicles

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.369
effective people circulate with electro vehicles but normal people of the street even without resources move in electric vehicles

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:15.459
It seems that the government began to encourage and encourage what is the electric vehicle because of its scarcity of oil

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:21.729
because the electricity for it is much cheaper and good indeed a sector of the population that is not especially

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:28.629
well-off are those who have this type of vehicle loaded vehicles are therefore quite advanced especially in

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.389
motorcycles bicycles and electric mopeds

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:37.000
depending on the type of vehicle there are vehicles that even these extra battery frate and you are looking for

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:43.839
excellent product you want the best product in china to become the reference company of the electric vehicle in Spain

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.070
and where can we miguelángel try these wonders and

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.369
buy them in electricity motor in the electric motor can also be purchased through internet internet 7

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.390
Www

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.799
Michelangelo, if you let us, I would love to teach our spectator friends

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:10.539
your warehouse of a warehouse full of electric vehicles that arrive from the far east it seems to me that

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:18.249
we go with is motivated by now we put on helmets but we will make the initial exit indoors you are prepared

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.860
beware that this one has a lot of nerve

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.149
good angel miguel so this is where you keep the bikes this is one of your stores

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:32.020
I'm seeing some little signs of course this is for tracking the infection burden what we do is

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.150
point out the day that has been charged and so we have a control of when the battery has been charged

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:43.150
that's the difference with other types of vehicles here you have to keep track of which lithium service battery has good

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:49.629
because to maintain that burden always has to have the necessary electricity so that it does not die permanently if not to lose the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.740
properties of lithium because it must be charged at least once every two months

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:01.420
we have many more bikes stored that are going to arrive this is a joy it means that shortly we will be like in the East

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.399
Not everyone moving in electric vehicles, good as we told you, we believe in electric vehicles

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.440
but we believe and a lot and we believe that we have a motorcycle spain

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.609
