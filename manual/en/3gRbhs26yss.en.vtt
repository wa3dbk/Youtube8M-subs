00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.340
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.120
Welcome to Tekzilla Bites,
feeding your tech hunger fast.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:07.350
I'm Shannon Morse.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.190
I'm really into using
calendars to plan my days

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:11.890
and make sure that
I don't get behind.

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.400
So if a calendar is made
to be useful and fluid,

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.530
you know I'm going
to check it out.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:18.460
Enter SolCalendar.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:20.450
This is a newly
released free calendar

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.440
app for Android
devices that can sync

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.590
to several online
calendars but also has

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.330
widgets and many features.

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.840
SolCalendar can sync with
multiple calendars from Google,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.970
Yahoo, iCloud, Exchange
and plenty of others.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.870
Allowing SolCalendar to
use your location info also

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:37.620
let's it tell you the weather.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.960
The main month view shows
you all of your events

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.140
for any given month, which
you can swipe to and from.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.650
You'll also notice the handy
weather feature at the top,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.640
and small weather icons for
each day of the current week.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.570
Clicking on an event lets you
edit the date, time, alarms,

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.410
notes, sharing, location, and
it also allows you to repeat it.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.115
You can also add a
cute little sticker

00:00:57.115 --> 00:00:58.910
to each event, which
makes it easier

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.990
to see your items at a glance.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:04.269
Click on a day to create a
new event or to-do, or swipe

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.230
from the left side
to add a new one.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:09.190
Agenda is a day view, and
tasks will list out your tasks

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.994
for the day.

00:01:09.994 --> 00:01:12.410
This is pretty cool because
it will sync with Google Tasks

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:13.460
if you want it to.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.930
Adding new tasks and
editing existing ones

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.020
is all super, super easy.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.500
The last section
is calendars where

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.250
you can edit which calendars
you see of your monthly

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.480
and daily views.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.270
Settings allow you to
customize everything

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.300
from the color of your to-dos
to the weather information.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:29.910
But that's not all.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.540
There is also a
widget-- I mean widgets,

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.480
as in over 10 different
ones that I can choose from

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.760
to add to my home screen.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.047
Holy moly guys, that's
a lot of widgets.

00:01:41.047 --> 00:01:43.130
Each of these can also be
customized based on your

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.690
wants and needs.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.850
Personally, I really
like Sol Calendar.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:48.150
It's very easy to use.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:51.370
It's really, really cute,
and it's very productive.

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.460
You can check it out on
the Google Play Store.

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.610
Now check out some epic
anime on Crunchy Roll.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.740
