00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.709
Hi everybody, Kevin Smith back again, Tubalove.
I'm going to be talking now about volumes

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:13.500
on the tuba. In other words, how loud or how
soft you can play. And, there's quite a difference

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:42.990
here. There's, there's, if you're looking
at sheet music, there's what's called an Italian

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:49.100
word. If you see a word, it says piano, it's
not the instrument piano, it's just an Italian

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.920
word that means soft. So if you see the letter
P, it means play this softly. And as they

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:02.740
want it more softly, they'll add more P's.
Like PP, which means pianissimo - is very

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:09.680
softly. And by the same token, there's an
Italian word called forte, f-o-r-t-e, which

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:19.719
means loud, and as they add F's. FF - fortissimo
 - really loud. FFF, blow your brains out

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:25.470
kind of loud. But at any rate, there's a lot
of different diversity in the volumes that

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.889
a tuba can convey, and in many ways, as I
think I sort of mentioned earlier on, was

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:35.299
that playing softly is, in a lot of ways,
more difficult than playing loud. Because

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:40.520
this is a big instrument, playing delicately,
what you want is to just make sure to play

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.359
softly is that you keep your air stream going,
because as I said also before, some people

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:48.749
might think well I don't have to play too
loud, so I don't need to breathe that much.

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:54.439
That is just flat wrong. You need your air
for support. So, the stronger you feel your

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.969
diaphragm taking in that air, and the more
pressure, and the better air stream you've

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:04.289
got going, the better you're going to play
soft stuff and still keep that nice, big round

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:05.489
sound that a tuba has.
