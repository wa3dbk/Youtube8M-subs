00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.390
&gt;&gt;AH.
YOU MUST BE FELIX; THE BRIGHT YOUNG INVENTOR.

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.570
&gt;&gt;YAH, AND YOU ARE?
&gt;&gt;I AM ALEX, YOUR NEW SUPERVISOR.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:13.879
&gt;&gt;DO YOU HAVE LOTS OF INVENTING EXPERIENCE?
&gt;&gt;NO.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:17.460
EVEN BETTER.
I AM THE OWNER'S SON.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.880
SO OBVIOUSLY I AM PERFECTLY QUALIFIED.
SO WHAT INVENTIONS HAVE YOU TO SHOW ME?

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.350
&gt;&gt;OH, WELL THERE'S ONE THAT I AM
RATHER EXCITED ABOUT.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.140
IN THE FUTURE, PEOPLE WILL BE USING
CELL PHONE DEVICES EVERY MAN AND WOMAN.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.059
SO I HAVE CREATED A MACHINE CALLED VOICE MAIL.
&gt;&gt;OH.

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:34.899
GO ON.
&gt;&gt;YAH.

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:37.579
IT WILL ALLOW YOU TO LEAVE 
MESSAGES ON PEOPLE'S PHONES

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:39.800
AND IT WILL HAVE RECORDED INSTRUCTIONS THAT
TEACH YOU HOW

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.679
TO USE IT FOR YOUR FIRST TIME.
&gt;&gt;NO.

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:45.249
EVERY TIME. WE MUST TEACH
THEM EVERY TIME.

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:48.710
&gt;&gt;BUT, WON'T THEY KNOW HOW TO
USE IT AFTER ONE TIME?

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.960
&gt;&gt;NO.
WE MUST INSTRUCT THEM EVERY TIME.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.909
AND IT WON'T BE REALLY REALLY ANNOYING.
&gt;&gt;OKAY, IF YOU SAY SO.

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.729
OH, AND THEN THERE'S THIS.
IN THE FUTURE PEOPLE WILL USE ELEVATOR MACHINES

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:04.500
TO GET AROUND
AND THEY WILL ALWAYS BE RUSHING TO CATCH THE ELEVATOR.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.900
SO I CREATED A BUTTON
CALLED OPEN DOOR,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.700
WHICH WILL HOLD THE DOOR OPEN.
&gt;&gt;AH YES!

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.229
WE WILL HAVE ANOTHER BUTTON
CALLED "CLOSE DOOR."

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:20.200
WHICH WILL DO NOTHING.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.900
&gt;&gt;WHY WON'T IT JUST CLOSE THE DOOR?

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.030
&gt;&gt;[LAUGHTER] THAT'S CRAZY TALK.
&gt;&gt;LISTEN ALEX, MAYBE I WILL STICK TO INVENTING

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.680
AND YOU CAN LIKE WORK IN MARKETING OR SOMETHING.
&gt;&gt;NO, THE OFFICE IS CLEAR ACROSS TOWN AND

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.259
YOU KNOW
HOW BAD THE TRAFFIC IS.

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.250
&gt;&gt;WELL I MIGHT HAVE SOMETHING
THAT MIGHT HELP WITH THAT.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.320
IT'S CALLED A STOPLIGHT AND IT USES
COLORS TO DIRECT THE TRAFFIC.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.020
&gt;&gt;AH YES!
AND THE COLOR FOR STOP AND THE COLOR WILL

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.100
GO WILL BE THE TWO COLORS THAT
THE COLOR BLIND CANNOT TELL APART!

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.100
&gt;&gt;ALEX THESE ARE REALLY BAD IDEAS.

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.200
&gt;&gt;BELIEVE IN YOURSELF.
&gt;&gt;NO, NOT MY IDEAS.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.500
YOUR IDEAS!
YOU'RE RUINING MY INVENTIONS.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.210
&gt;&gt;NONSENSE.
I AM HELPING YOU.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.689
OH!
WHAT IS THIS?

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:06.869
&gt;&gt;NO, DON'T TOUCH THAT.
THAT IS AN ALARM CLOCK AND IT USES SOOTHING

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.440
BEETHOVEN MUSIC
TO WAKE YOU UP IN THE MORNING.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.720
&gt;&gt;NO.
IT WILL MAKE A NOISE LIKE THIS.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.400
[ALARM CLOCK BUZZ-LIKE SOUND] &gt;&gt;WHAT?
NO.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.540
WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT THAT?
&gt;&gt;[ALARM CLOCK BUZZ-LIKE SOUND] &gt;&gt;STOP THAT!

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.930
YOU'LL GIVE ME A SEIZURE.
YOU WILL GIVE EVERYONE A SEIZURE!

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.819
&gt;&gt;OH, WHAT IS THIS?
THIS LOOKS NICE.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.830
&gt;&gt;OH, THIS IS NETFLIX.
&gt;&gt;WILL BE THE HOME OF ALL LOUSY MOVIES!

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.030
&gt;&gt;OH NO!
PLEASE!

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:36.790
UH, TV REMOTES.
&gt;&gt;WILL HAVE HUNDRED OF BUTTONS THAT DO NOTHING.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:43.790
&gt;&gt;UH, YOUTUBE.
&gt;&gt;WILL LAUNCH THE CAREER OF JUSTIN BIEBER.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:48.099
&gt;&gt;NO!
PLEASE, I BEG YOU.

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:52.500
&gt;&gt;NO, RELAX FELIX.
TOGETHER OUR INVENTIONS WILL CHANGE THE WORLD.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.580
&gt;&gt;WELL AT LEAST I STILL HAVE ONE
INVENTION SO SIMPLE

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:59.129
EVEN YOU CANNOT RUIN IT.
THE BATHROBE.

00:02:59.129 --> 00:03:03.480
&gt;&gt;NO.
THE SNUGGIE!

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:04.930
&gt;&gt;NO!
