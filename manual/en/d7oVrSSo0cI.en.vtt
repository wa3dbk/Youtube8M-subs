00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:08.082
I remember the first time I looked up homosexuality in the Bible.

00:00:08.857 --> 00:00:11.247
I grabbed my Bible off the bookshelf,

00:00:11.247 --> 00:00:14.717
closed my bedroom door, sat cross-legged on the floor,

00:00:14.717 --> 00:00:17.437
and opened directly to the index

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.100
H

00:00:19.675 --> 00:00:21.154
H-O

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:24.628
I slid my finger down the page passing "holiness"

00:00:25.632 --> 00:00:27.995
I remember passing holiness

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.733
I paused.

00:00:29.733 --> 00:00:31.670
I'm getting close.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.705
I checked to make sure the bedroom door was still closed.

00:00:35.202 --> 00:00:38.503
I slid my finger down further.

00:00:39.672 --> 00:00:41.707
"Homosexuality"

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.376
Even looking at the word was terrifying.

00:00:45.376 --> 00:00:47.972
There were five pages listed.

00:00:47.972 --> 00:00:50.044
I flipped to the first one.

00:00:50.543 --> 00:00:55.453
It wasn't a specific verse but rather a 
 lesson box in my teen study Bible.

00:00:55.959 --> 00:00:57.233
I read it

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.035
Alternative lifestyle usually refers to making a sexual choice.

00:01:01.035 --> 00:01:04.770
The impression is that any choice is all right--it's just a matter of preference.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.261
When it comes to sex, don't kid yourself about 
 some of those choices being morally all right.

00:01:09.261 --> 00:01:11.408
It's wrong to have sex with any close relative

00:01:11.408 --> 00:01:13.578
Leviticus 18, 6 through 18

00:01:13.578 --> 00:01:15.355
It's wrong to have sex with animals.

00:01:15.355 --> 00:01:17.180
Leviticus 18:23

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.082
It's wrong to have homosexual sex.

00:01:19.082 --> 00:01:20.823
Leviticus 18:22

00:01:20.823 --> 00:01:25.223
If someone tells you that homosexuality is an alternative lifestyle, meaning that it's OK

00:01:25.223 --> 00:01:28.392
Don't let those words fool you, it's an alternative all right:

00:01:28.392 --> 00:01:29.861
a sinful one.

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.136
Hmmm... not good.

00:01:33.136 --> 00:01:38.006
I flipped back to the index,  surely 
 the other pages would uncover some nuance

00:01:38.006 --> 00:01:39.603
or offer a different perspective. 

00:01:39.603 --> 00:01:44.340
Back and forth I flipped, from index to reference, each one the same.

00:01:45.578 --> 00:01:47.080
One last one.

00:01:47.914 --> 00:01:50.950
Surely this one would contradict the others, would tell me that it's OK,

00:01:50.948 --> 00:01:53.100
that I'm OK.

00:01:53.096 --> 00:01:56.820
But it's more of the same.

00:01:56.822 --> 00:01:58.580
Homosexuality is a sin.

00:01:58.585 --> 00:02:01.280
Gay people are choosing to live is sin.

00:02:01.282 --> 00:02:04.850
AIDS is the result of sinful behavior.

00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:07.560
Gay people can change if they want to.

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:09.570
I close my Bible.

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:12.400
I don't know what to do.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:18.280
There it is written on the page. [Pause] Crystal clear.

00:02:18.277 --> 00:02:19.610
No getting around it.

00:02:20.043 --> 00:02:21.040
Sinful. 

00:02:21.041 --> 00:02:22.240
Abomination.

00:02:22.242 --> 00:02:24.010
Damned.

00:02:24.013 --> 00:02:29.520
Who I like is sinful, who I love is sinful.

00:02:32.149 --> 00:02:35.260
Who I am is sinful

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.720
Where could I possibly go from here?

00:02:39.125 --> 00:02:43.160
I don't know but I can't shake the feeling 
 that I'm not seeing the whole story,

00:02:43.158 --> 00:02:48.310
that even though it seems so black and white on the page, 
 there must be some shades of grey that I'm not seeing.

00:02:48.314 --> 00:02:51.530
There must be some explanation--there must be!

00:02:53.615 --> 00:02:56.480
And I'll find it.
