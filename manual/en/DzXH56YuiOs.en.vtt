MIKE SPINELLI: Hey, welcome
to DRIVE CENTRAL.

00:00:06.076 --> 00:00:06.666
I'm Mike Spinelli.

00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.156
And here's where you're going to
find out what's going on on

00:00:08.156 --> 00:00:09.186
DRIVE this week.

00:00:09.186 --> 00:00:11.006
Because it's all right
here on this paper.

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:13.876
Hit us up on @drive on Twitter,
so we can send you

00:00:13.876 --> 00:00:16.816
questions, and you can send us
questions and suggestions and

00:00:16.816 --> 00:00:17.776
all that stuff.

00:00:17.776 --> 00:00:21.256
Anyway, this week, on RideApart,
Wes and Grant do

00:00:21.256 --> 00:00:24.566
something involving crashing
Suzuki quads.

00:00:24.566 --> 00:00:26.066
I'm not sure what that
means, but let's take

00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.966
a look right here.

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:29.766
MALE SPEAKER: Riding these
things is just so physical.

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:30.576
You have no idea.

00:00:30.576 --> 00:00:32.446
You think you're going to
just ride a machine

00:00:32.446 --> 00:00:33.856
and just cruise along.

00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:37.406
And it's like moving your body
weight and landing jumps and

00:00:37.406 --> 00:00:38.586
shifting around.

00:00:38.586 --> 00:00:41.166
I'm sweating like crazy
right now after

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:42.416
a five-minute section.

00:00:42.416 --> 00:00:43.386
And I go slow.

00:00:43.386 --> 00:00:45.416
It's still super physical.

00:00:45.416 --> 00:00:46.326
MIKE SPINELLI: That's
RideApart every

00:00:46.326 --> 00:00:47.296
Monday here on DRIVE.

00:00:47.296 --> 00:00:49.516
And on Tuesday, J.F.
And his DRIVEN crew

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:50.996
went to Porsche Classic.

00:00:50.996 --> 00:00:53.246
That's where you can bring your
Porsche if it's older

00:00:53.246 --> 00:00:56.976
than 1992 and if you want it
refurbished and restored just

00:00:56.976 --> 00:00:59.786
like it was new, sometimes by
the people who built it in the

00:00:59.786 --> 00:01:00.516
first place.

00:01:00.516 --> 00:01:01.676
Well, that's where he went.

00:01:01.676 --> 00:01:03.356
And here's what it
looked like.

00:01:11.486 --> 00:01:13.706
That's DRIVEN, every Tuesday
here on DRIVE.

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:16.706
And this week on Chris Harris
on Cars, Chris drives three

00:01:16.706 --> 00:01:19.696
lighter-weight versions of some
German sports coupes that

00:01:19.696 --> 00:01:23.126
everybody loves, because they're
delicious, including

00:01:23.126 --> 00:01:26.046
his own Porsche GT-3RS 4.0.

00:01:26.046 --> 00:01:26.996
Let's take a look.

00:01:26.996 --> 00:01:28.246
[MUSIC - ACCELERATING
HEARTBEAT]

00:01:43.566 --> 00:01:45.556
MIKE SPINELLI: That's Chris
"Monkey" Harris every

00:01:45.556 --> 00:01:46.986
Wednesday here on DRIVE.

00:01:46.986 --> 00:01:50.046
And this week, we relinquish our
Road Testament microphones

00:01:50.046 --> 00:01:54.226
to Mike and Zac from Classic Car
Club Manhattan right down

00:01:54.226 --> 00:01:55.416
the block from us.

00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:58.526
And let's see what they
did with them.

00:01:58.526 --> 00:01:59.886
MIKE PRICINELLO: So we're at
the Classic Car Club bar.

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:01.736
We're big fans of driving
and drinking.

00:02:01.736 --> 00:02:02.696
The right order.

00:02:02.696 --> 00:02:05.616
The other one-- get you in
a little bit of trouble.

00:02:05.616 --> 00:02:06.856
ZAC MOSELEY: Oh, you
want a beer?

00:02:06.856 --> 00:02:07.986
MIKE PRICINELLO: Yeah,
keep on thinking.

00:02:07.986 --> 00:02:08.996
So I'm going to throw
it to Zac.

00:02:08.996 --> 00:02:10.056
And it doesn't have
to be one car.

00:02:10.056 --> 00:02:10.586
Can be anything.

00:02:10.586 --> 00:02:11.016
It could be used.

00:02:11.016 --> 00:02:11.266
It could be new.

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:12.586
100 grand.

00:02:12.586 --> 00:02:13.342
What do you buy?

00:02:13.342 --> 00:02:15.366
Always for yourself for
your own garage.

00:02:15.366 --> 00:02:16.566
ZAC MOSELEY: All right,
and I have access to

00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:18.386
no other cars anymore.

00:02:18.386 --> 00:02:19.776
MIKE PRICINELLO: You have
access to no other cars.

00:02:19.776 --> 00:02:22.166
$100,000 to sort your
garage out.

00:02:22.166 --> 00:02:23.066
ZAC MOSELEY: $100,000.

00:02:23.066 --> 00:02:24.316
All right.

00:02:26.546 --> 00:02:29.046
MIKE PRICINELLO: This is such
a Mitt Romney game we play.

00:02:29.046 --> 00:02:29.546
ZAC MOSELEY: OK.

00:02:29.546 --> 00:02:31.016
Cadillac CTS-V wagon.

00:02:31.016 --> 00:02:32.046
It's manual.

00:02:32.046 --> 00:02:33.686
MIKE PRICINELLO: $62,000
over the limit.

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:34.586
ZAC MOSELEY: No, I--

00:02:34.586 --> 00:02:34.926
I--

00:02:34.926 --> 00:02:35.576
I--

00:02:35.576 --> 00:02:36.446
MIKE PRICINELLO: You
know somebody.

00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:37.896
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:37.896 --> 00:02:39.186
MIKE SPINELLI: That's
Road Testament every

00:02:39.186 --> 00:02:40.706
Thursday here on DRIVE.

00:02:40.706 --> 00:02:43.946
And also on Thursday, Mike Musto
on Big Muscle drives an

00:02:43.946 --> 00:02:45.296
early prototype Corvette.

00:03:00.346 --> 00:03:02.666
That's Big Muscle every Thursday
here on DRIVE.

00:03:02.666 --> 00:03:05.366
And don't forget to watch
Shakedown on Mondays and

00:03:05.366 --> 00:03:08.546
Fridays with Leo "The Adult"
Parente who tells the

00:03:08.546 --> 00:03:10.906
motorsports world to
get off his lawn.

00:03:10.906 --> 00:03:13.586
And that's it for DRIVE
CENTRAL this week.

00:03:13.586 --> 00:03:16.976
We will see you next week for
another fantastic week of

00:03:16.976 --> 00:03:17.916
DRIVE programming.

00:03:17.916 --> 00:03:18.256
Later.
