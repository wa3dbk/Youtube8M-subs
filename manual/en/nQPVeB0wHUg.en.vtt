I'm glad that I took the opportunity for kids kart  today,

00:07:03.016 --> 00:07:05.016
and it looked they had a lot of fun with that.

00:07:08.834 --> 00:07:10.834
Most of them had no experience of even riding a kart.

00:07:10.834 --> 00:07:12.834
 

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.160
They were a pretty good driver thoguh. 

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.980
Unfortunately the weather was not good so we had to do that inside.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:20.980
 

00:07:23.714 --> 00:07:25.714
I wish the weather was always sunny for these things since we know they can enjoy more.

00:07:25.714 --> 00:07:27.714
 

00:07:29.654 --> 00:07:31.654
I'm grateful for all your supports ,SANYO AUTO,KRP that gave me this chance.

00:07:31.654 --> 00:07:32.534
