Hi honeys and welcome back to Challenge Hollie
on Videojug.

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:09.519
This week, I have been challenged to do makeup
on my model Sophie, who has been very brave

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:12.540
to volunteer, and I am going to be doing makeup
with my left hand.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.480
So I am going to keep my right hand behind
my back and do the whole look using my left

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:17.480
hand.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:18.480
[Music]

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:19.480
Okay.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:25.810
So we are going to start off by applying the
foundation.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:32.509
So this is in the Match Perfection by Rimmel
and I believe the colour is Ivory, which matches

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:33.899
the model's skin tone perfectly.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.230
Now, this is a little tricky using my left
hand because normally, I would be using my

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.230
right.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.610
So, I would just be buffing the foundation
into the skin.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.870
Does it feel all right babes?

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:43.870
Yeah.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:44.870
It does not feel funny or anything?

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.870
No.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.870
It feels all right at the moment.

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:50.290
I promise I will try not to poke you in the
eye.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.290
Okay.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.110
Next, I am going to go on to eyes and I am
going to be using the beautyuk eyeliner and

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.500
shadow pencil sticks.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.420
It is like a double ended pencil.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:07.170
So, we are going to use the turquoise colour
and I am going to try and attempt to do an

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.880
aqua eye line, quite a thick bold line.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.930
So if you just close your eyes for me babe,
probably best you keep your eyes closed.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:16.010
And we are just going to put this on.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.810
I am not pushing too hard am I babes?

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:20.050
No, I am fine.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.280
Have you ever had anyone do your makeup left
handed before?

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.280
No I don't think I have, this is a first!

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.280
Okay.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.030
So I am using this aqua colour because this
is a real spring, summer look.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:36.630
So we are going to do a bold eye line which
is very bold, imminent.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:42.450
And then we are going to do a nice, strong,
like orangey lip.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.320
So next, I am going to be putting an eye shadow
over the top of that aqua eyeliner and I am

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.110
going to be using this palette here which
is by Sugarpill Cosmetics and it is in the

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:52.250
colour Mochi, which is an amazing blue aqua
colour.

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.470
It is the one down the bottom.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.840
And I am going to be applying it with this
little, tiny brush.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.570
So we are just going to pat this on over the
top of that blue.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.460
This is a lot harder than I thought it was
going to be.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.980
By putting the eyeshadow over the top of the
eyeliner, it is going to make it stay on a

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.560
lot longer, so it does not come off.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.460
You always want to set any liquids or creams
that you do with powder to give it a longer

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:21.530
lifespan, if you like, on your face.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.170
So great for summer looks if you are going
to be going in the heat where it is like nice

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.640
and humid, then you are going to want to put
all shadows and powders over the top of liquids

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.720
and creams.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.720
Dramatic.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:34.720
Okay.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.010
So we are going to bronze up the cheeks a
little for that beautiful summer look.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:42.480
I am going to be using this powder base by
HD Brows.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.122
And it is the foundation powder in number
nine and I love this for contouring.

00:02:47.122 --> 00:02:48.540
It is literally like the perfect contour colour.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.540
Okay.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:56.260
So here is this little chiseled cheek powder
brush we are just going to apply in upward

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:58.630
strokes just to bronze up the cheek a little.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.650
You are definitely bronze babes.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:01.650
Okay.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.310
So I am going to use this sleek blusher and
this is in the colour Rose Gold that is a

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.620
beautiful summer, warm, bronzey, shimmery
colour.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.780
With the same brush, we are going to apply
this to the apples of the cheeks.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.880
This is definitely a challenge.

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.630
So to finish this look off, we are going to
be using a really bright, bright, bright lipstick.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.280
This is the Topshop one in Charmed.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.170
Which is perfect for summer and spring colours.

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:33.330
I'm just going to apply this.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.640
Sorry babes, nearly got it on your tooth!

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.640
Like this.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.730
I think if I had to put on makeup with a broken
right arm, I do not think I will be leaving

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.770
the house.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.770
Gorgeous.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:49.390
Give me a little.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:50.390
Perfect.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.640
Okay, we are going to fill in the brows.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.180
This is going to be tricky with my left hand
guys but I am going to be using the Ben Nye

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.240
powder palette.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.710
This is the pressed color palette.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:04.690
This I just think is perfect for doing the
brows.

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:09.160
And I am going to do a bold brow so I am going
to use quite a dark brown.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.160
Okay.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:13.790
So we are going to be using this little, tiny
angle brush.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.190
And starting from the inside corner, I am
going to try and, oops.

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:23.400
You are going to have a scouse brow now babes.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.530
Just little strokes as I normally would.

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.570
Beautiful.

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:35.740
Okay, so we are just going to be using the
Telescopic Mascara by L'Oreal and I have just

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.600
got it on a little disposable mascara wand.

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:49.060
And we are just applying, being very careful.

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.460
[Music]

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:55.870
Perfect.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:56.920
That looks all right.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:05:01.290
So to finish off the lips, we are just going
to add some clear gloss.

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.260
This is just going to make it look really
dewy and summery.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.370
And glossy.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:06.370
Perfect.

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:13.410
And there is our completed left handed makeup
look.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:18.180
I have done a beautiful aqua, very bold eyeline,
not intentionally.

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.199
It is probably the left hand, made it really
bold.

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:24.010
And some really shimmery gold, peachy cheek.

00:05:24.010 --> 00:05:25.730
And then, a beautiful glossy coral lip.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.100
So thank you so much for watching honeys.
