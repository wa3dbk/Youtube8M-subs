00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.840
Right now I'm going to show you some good
exercises for using a hangboard, and this

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.230
device right here is called a hangboard.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.290
You can kind of think of it as a glorified
pull-up bar almost.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.290
Basically, there's different positions on
this hangboard that allow you to isolate different

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.290
grips.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:26.439
So you can practice different types of hand
positions and work on developing what's known

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:28.269
as contact strength.

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:34.030
So when you're using a hangboard, one of the
exercises is simply hanging.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:42.160
Starting with some of the larger spaces on
the hangboard, and then hanging.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.350
You can continue to do so, moving down the
hangboard, getting to smaller and smaller

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.420
positions.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.270
There's many different types of hangboards
that offer different shapes, from sloping

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:56.090
holds, to big positive holds, to smaller little
edges that are called crimps.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:01.640
So moving down, once you get more technical
holds, once again you'll practice the different

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.820
position, and simply get comfortable hanging
on it.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.250
It's a great way to start to develop contact
strength, and also kind of ease into using

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.030
your tendons by putting more and more of your
body weight on a smaller surface.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.700
That sort of motion of just hanging without
pulling is a good indicator of really how

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.590
small of a hold you could be pulling on, without
risking injury.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.702
Once you're comfortable hanging in some of
the different positions, you can then start

00:01:30.702 --> 00:01:36.659
to incorporate more movement by basically
just doing some pull-ups, and adding some

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.830
sets, and some routines to how you do those
pull ups.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.680
Perhaps you do a larger number of pull-ups
on the bigger more positive holds, and then

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.180
dropping down to some of the smaller sizes,
and reducing the number.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.550
So you could start on the big positive holds,
maybe do a couple of pull-ups, however many

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:54.899
you're comfortable with.

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.180
And then reduce that number, grab a smaller
hold, and as you work your way down perhaps

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.520
when you get to some of the smallest sizes,
you're just hanging on those by the time you

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.119
get there, and don't even worry about pulling
up.

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.929
This is just to kind of train some different
positions and give you a good idea about how

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:14.580
your tendons are going to react to pulling
on those small holds, and help you develop

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.330
some of that contact strength.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:20.860
So, that is a hangboard, and some basic exercises
to get you going.
