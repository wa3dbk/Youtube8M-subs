00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.350
textbooks are very expensive it's a
problem having to pay for the missus

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.040
schott has come up with what i find to
be very novel way to save money on

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:08.539
textbooks

00:00:08.539 --> 00:00:11.599
are will protect workers expenses

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:12.680
cancel back

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.949
camera there

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:17.749
were happened

00:00:17.749 --> 00:00:20.849
action for contact

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.880
handheld

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.349
or not

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:27.760
skimpy

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:31.970
also regrettable writers

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.480
refer to your computer

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.690
you're also your

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.010
rich there

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:39.790
amendment two

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:44.600
credible

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.510
corridor an unfair

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.300
expert

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.100
and uh... that further research on
student commercials without excellently

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.210
like that your dog daycare stand it

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.080
that study of the no that was excellent
out first of all i didn't even know that

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:05.120
such technology existed like might not
know scanners existing on is the right

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:07.000
but a standard that bad

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.220
and bull and he's eating use a one-time
literally had to spend it

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.600
but it because they did not have been
all over that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.880
that on some piece of technology i wish
i will not that it's been so much money

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.330
on tax but i did

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:24.979
that's great good for you it's like the
it's like a sticky

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:26.520
animal and food

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.250
but we did this a little bit in graduate
school there would be like these of

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.420
course packets then we would put this
use a copy machine or something like

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.560
that but this is

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.060
hand-held all the answers infomercial is
like a black-and-white video simulated

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.060
have been for those booklet instead of
adult happy and didn't happen

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.570
outside europe the

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.420
but i do have bad luck everybody always
has the option to the library and make

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.720
copies of the pages or whatever but look
across many visa copy machine

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:54.960
uh... it's a huge pain in the back
because you have to keep going back and

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.720
forth spanning the entire block in the
least pages and it was a nightmare when

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.460
i'm trying to do it so highlight that
because of the simplicity of it as a

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.259
different anything is that there is in
fact i love her

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.660
yet definitely out because i have been
there now

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:11.810
on and the textbook companies and being
a little bit of trouble you have there

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:12.230
been a number
