Wow!

00:00:10.133 --> 00:00:10.800
Nice!

00:00:11.666 --> 00:00:12.600
Oh, shoot.

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:14.433
Oh, there you go.

00:00:14.566 --> 00:00:15.200
There you go.

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:18.233
Nice! I'm doing good so far.

00:00:18.366 --> 00:00:19.500

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:21.366
You're doing awesome!

00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:24.200
Alright! Keep it up.

00:00:25.733 --> 00:00:27.566

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:30.233
- Go!
- Wha-

00:00:30.366 --> 00:00:31.466
Holy crap.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.900
- Crap, I should calm down!
- You're alright!

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.533
- Calm down!
- Go!

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.366
Yes! No...

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:42.200
Not this again.

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:43.133
Too bad.

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.466
Oh, man...

00:00:44.666 --> 00:00:46.266
I died in the same place.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.133
Yeah.

00:00:47.366 --> 00:00:48.133
Geez...

00:00:48.666 --> 00:00:52.400
- The last part of this...
- Uh-huh.

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:55.433
...crosswalk tune makes me panic.

00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:59.800
- Makes me panic? Panicky...
- Yea.

00:01:00.633 --> 00:01:02.966
Pa... Panics me?

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.000
It makes me feel that way.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.266
Why don't we just cross the road?

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.766
That would be too much trouble.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:11.600
Really?

00:01:11.733 --> 00:01:13.500
The character in this game...

00:01:13.833 --> 00:01:16.033
...kinda looks like you.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.533
Oh, yeah you're right.

00:01:18.666 --> 00:01:24.133
So I feel bad whenever he dies.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.266
No you don't.

00:01:28.866 --> 00:01:30.100
How'd you know?

00:01:34.133 --> 00:01:36.166
Whatever, let's just get to the movies.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:37.733
Can I just play one more game?

00:01:37.866 --> 00:01:39.200
Are you serious?

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.000
Yeah.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:40.900
Ok, sure.

00:01:41.033 --> 00:01:43.000
Alright! Gonna score high this time.

00:01:45.633 --> 00:01:46.666
- There you go.
- Wow.

00:01:47.833 --> 00:01:48.600
Nice!

00:01:48.833 --> 00:01:49.966
This part is so easy.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:50.966
Yep.

00:01:51.833 --> 00:01:52.600
There you go.

00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:55.833
Nice and easy.

00:01:57.666 --> 00:01:58.666
We made it.

00:01:59.833 --> 00:02:01.600
Ok, I'm gonna calm down.

00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:04.666
Very nice.

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:08.133
- Oh, shoot.
- Oh, man.

00:02:08.566 --> 00:02:10.200
Not this again, crap.

00:02:12.933 --> 00:02:14.066
I'm screwed.

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:18.400
See, I told you it's this tune's fault.

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:20.500
That's why I said to cross the road.

00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:23.700
The movie theater is on this side.

00:02:23.833 --> 00:02:24.933
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.266
Ok, let's go now.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.400
Why'd we stop here?

00:02:28.866 --> 00:02:33.833
To be continued...

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.933
I'm gonna try again.

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:32.000
I don't get it.
