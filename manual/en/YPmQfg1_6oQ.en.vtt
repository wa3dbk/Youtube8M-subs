00:00:05.893 --> 00:00:08.683
Why is my PS4 not reading discs?

00:00:08.683 --> 00:00:13.923
I’m assuming you actually put a disk in,
and that it is not the cleaning disk.

00:00:13.923 --> 00:00:17.813
I do not think I’ve put a cleaning disk
in it for the time I’ve had it.

00:00:17.813 --> 00:00:21.452
Then the first solution is running a cleaning
disk in it.

00:00:21.452 --> 00:00:25.713
If the reading head is dirty or grimy, it
won’t read the disks.

00:00:25.713 --> 00:00:28.743
As long as I do not have to take it apart
to dust it.

00:00:28.743 --> 00:00:33.233
That’ll ruin the warranty, though it does
not hurt to vacuum up dust around the fan

00:00:33.233 --> 00:00:35.572
vents is not a bad idea.

00:00:35.572 --> 00:00:39.693
You might want to delete really big files
so that the device has the memory to run the

00:00:39.693 --> 00:00:41.103
new disk.

00:00:41.103 --> 00:00:44.033
I wonder if the disks are unreadable.

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:48.393
An unreadable disk error could mean there
is dirt or fingerprints on the laser lens

00:00:48.393 --> 00:00:54.153
inside the PS4, a disk tray that is out of
alignment or scratches and fingerprints on

00:00:54.153 --> 00:00:55.503
the disk.

00:00:55.503 --> 00:01:00.073
The problem is with multiple disks, and it
is not because I am putting the shinny side

00:01:00.073 --> 00:01:02.533
on the wrong side in the machine.

00:01:02.533 --> 00:01:04.994
If the disk is not lined up, it cannot play.

00:01:04.994 --> 00:01:09.033
A surer sign of this is when it cannot eject
the disk.

00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:14.092
I’ve heard people say the disks are sometimes
ejected without reason.

00:01:14.092 --> 00:01:17.073
One possibility is a weak laser beam.

00:01:17.073 --> 00:01:19.393
The solution is to clean the laser lens.

00:01:19.393 --> 00:01:25.823
I’m not taking apart a PS4 to clean a laser
lens, even assuming I can tell what it is.

00:01:25.823 --> 00:01:30.832
That’s why you buy something like CleanDR
or another lens cleaner kit that you use like

00:01:30.832 --> 00:01:32.653
a disk itself.

00:01:32.653 --> 00:01:34.982
What if it is a software problem?

00:01:34.982 --> 00:01:40.043
You could turn it off, bring it back up in
safe mode and select to reinstall the software.

00:01:40.043 --> 00:01:43.003
I’ve heard you could rebuild the database.

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:48.643
That’s the next option, well, maybe the
last option on the list.

00:01:48.643 --> 00:01:51.562
After doing that, restart the PS4.

00:01:51.562 --> 00:01:54.773
I did say to try reinstalling the software.

00:01:54.773 --> 00:02:00.173
Now, rebuilding the database is a more likely
solution if it consistently tries to eject

00:02:00.173 --> 00:02:04.272
the disk, but not necessarily when it simply
cannot read it.

00:02:04.272 --> 00:02:08.272
For some people, touching the power button
until it beeps works.

00:02:08.272 --> 00:02:10.763
I mean turning it off and turning it back
on.

00:02:10.763 --> 00:02:15.583
And you might want to wait at least a minute
for the power to dissipate, so the unit forgets

00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:18.393
any errors that kept it from reading the disk.

00:02:18.393 --> 00:02:21.953
If that does not work, I’m reading the user
manual.

00:02:21.953 --> 00:02:25.203
Nah, just call tech support.

00:02:25.203 --> 00:02:29.143
And that only after restoring default settings
in safe mode.

00:02:29.143 --> 00:02:33.823
You're assuming it is safe for the PS4 to
fail that way, too, and that I won't get so

00:02:33.823 --> 00:02:34.972
frustrated I go Gallagher on it.
