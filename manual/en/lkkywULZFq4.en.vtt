00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:06.050
How to Eat Sushi at a Restaurant.

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.630
Sushi is one of the fastest-growing cuisines
across the globe.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.840
To become a true citizen of the world, prepare
yourself with this primer on sushi-eating

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:15.860
rituals.

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:23.040
You will need Sake A sake carafe and cups
Cold Japanese beer or warm green tea Chopsticks

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:30.020
A dinner plate or platter Small condiment
dish Soy sauce Prepared wasabi At least 2

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:37.760
pieces of sashimi At least 2 pieces of nigiri
sushi At least 6 pieces of maki roll and pickled

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:38.910
ginger slices.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:39.910
Step 1.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:45.140
Go to a restaurant specializing in sushi—Japanese-owned
or -operated establishments tend to offer

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.300
the most authentic selections.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.760
And if you’re in a land-locked place, make
sure they pride themselves on sushi that’s

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.260
as fresh as possible.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.500
Step 2.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.100
If you’re offered a hot, moist towel, wash
your hands with it now.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.220
It will be removed from your table before
your food is served.

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.220
Step 3.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.899
It is customary to order some sake, likely
served in a carafe with small cups, to enjoy

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:07.260
before your meal is served.

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.159
Although expensive sakes are often better
enjoyed chilled, sake with sushi is traditionally

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.930
served warm, since the fish will be cold.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:15.930
Step 4.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.820
Pour sake for your dinner companions—traditionally,
no one should pour it for themselves, at least

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.240
for the first round—and then toast.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.790
Hold your cup aloft and say, “Kampai!”

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.080
It’s customary for the most senior person
at the table—the boss, or the eldest person—to

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.110
raise their glass the highest.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.180
Step 5.

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.560
When your sushi platter arrives at your table,
switch your beverage to cold Japanese beer

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:37.710
or hot green tea.

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.880
Step 6.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.090
If your chopsticks come wrapped, take off
the wrapper and break apart the sticks—but

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.470
don’t rub them against each other to remove
splinters, which rudely implies that the restaurant

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.470
has cheap chopsticks.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:52.490
When you’re not using them, they should
be propped on the holder or soy sauce dish

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.590
parallel to you.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:55.590
Step 7.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:56.590
You’re done when your plate is clean—except
for the wasabi and gari, of course.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.590
Place your chopsticks horizontally across
your soy sauce dish to signal that you’re

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.590
finished, and thank the chefs.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.590
Step 8.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.590
Pour a small amount of soy sauce into the
little empty dish, but don’t pour in more

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.590
than three tablespoons at a time.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.240
If you need more later, add more then.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.509
Step 9.

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.430
Notice the green mound of wasabi on your sushi
plate.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.590
This spicy horseradish is used to season soy
sauce and add flavor to the fish.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.484
With one chopstick, take a pea-size amount
and stir it into the soy sauce.

00:02:15.484 --> 00:02:16.484
Step 10.

00:02:16.484 --> 00:02:17.484
Continue eating the pieces of nigiri sushi
and maki rolls one at a time, alternating

00:02:17.484 --> 00:02:18.484
with pieces of gari and topping off the soy
sauce dish as necessary.

00:02:18.484 --> 00:02:20.140
Sushi aficionados believe you should only
use wasabi for sashimi—never for nigiri

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.620
sushi or maki rolls, since the chef has already
used the precise amount of wasabi necessary

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.510
to enhance the sushi’s flavor.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:27.510
Step 11.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.890
If you have a plate of sushi and sashimi,
it is customary to eat sashimi first.

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.030
With your chopsticks, pick up one piece of
sashimi, dip it in soy sauce, then place the

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.720
whole piece in your mouth.

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.650
If you don’t know how to use chopsticks,
don’t try to eat sashimi—it is considered

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.610
incredibly uncouth to use a fork.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:46.610
Step 12.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.990
Using your chopsticks, eat a piece of gari,
or pickled ginger, from the pile of wet slices

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.380
on your sushi plate.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.330
This is to be eaten between pieces of fish
as a palate cleanser.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:56.330
Step 13.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.180
Continue alternating eating sashimi with palate-cleansing
ginger.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.180
Step 14.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.690
When you have finished all your sashimi, refill
your soy sauce dish.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.250
Step 15.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.530
With your chopsticks, pick up a piece of nigiri
sushi and drag it through the soy sauce fish-side

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.930
down, so the rice doesn’t soak up too much.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.710
Place the entire piece in your mouth, unless
it is very large, in which case two bites

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:18.710
are acceptable.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:19.710
Step 16.

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:29.430
If you are uncomfortable using chopsticks,
eating nigiri sushi with your fingers is an

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.450
acceptable custom.

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:38.950
If you’re sitting at the sushi bar, offer
to buy the chefs a round of sake or beer.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:49.570
It’s not necessary, but it just might make
you a new friend.

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:59.760
Did you know Soy sauce was first made in China
more than 2,500 years ago by Buddhist monks—it

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:03.719
didn't reach Japan until the 6th century.
