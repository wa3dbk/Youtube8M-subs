Hi! My name is Dawn Shannon for Expert Village,
owner of Intuition Salon and Spa. Now I’m

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:09.680
going to show you some different partings
for this particular style or if you wanted

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.090
to change it just a little. I’m always using
a very good comb. I never use inexpensive

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.330
combs, as this helps to contribute to the
haircut coming out better. We’re going to

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:28.460
have her tip her head down. With this particular
style we’re actually going to use triangular

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:42.350
partings that go like this following the shape
of the head.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:01:05.909
Now, if I wanted this to be more of a square
haircut, I would take partings more like this.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:13.570
And I would take them straight across through
like this. This will create more of a square

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.579
shape through the haircut but what we want
to create is more of an angular look because

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:22.940
it creates a more softer look. If you wanted
to create a more bolding blunt look, you’ll

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:39.060
do the square partings. So back to the triangular
partings, we’ll be starting here

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:45.680
and working our way through the haircut and
this way and same through the sides. Always

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:54.679
making sure the head is properly tilted. This
will be your triangular parting; this will

00:01:54.679 --> 00:02:22.200
be your square parting.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.580
And that’s how you do triangular and square
partings.
