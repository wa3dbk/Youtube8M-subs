00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.033
Hi, this is Eric Schoening with the National 
Weather Service in Salt Lake City. This is a 
short

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:08.066
briefing about a winter storm that will move into 
Utah on Tuesday.

00:00:08.066 --> 00:00:12.033
The two main impacts we're expecting with this 
storm are snowfall across much of the

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:16.000
state, and much colder temperatures. This 
snowfall will impact travel across

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
pretty much all of Utah, and we'll give you 
details about where we're expecting the worst

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.066
impacts. The storm will also usher in the 
coldest temperatures of the season so

00:00:24.066 --> 00:00:28.066
far, and it will feel like the middle of winter 
through the rest of the week.

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:32.033
First we'll tell you about the snow amounts 
we're expecting, and then we'll move onto road

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:37.000
impacts. You can see that we're expecting 
lighter amounts of snow in far northern Utah and

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.066
southwest Wyoming. The cold front will begin to 
strengthen around the time it moves through

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:45.033
the Salt Lake Valley, which will result in the 
highest snow accumulation totals in Utah

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:49.000
Valley, central Utah, and southern Utah. The 
mountains will also receive a fair amount

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
of snow, generally one to two feet in all Utah 
mountains south of Interstate 80.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
We'll talk about the road impacts in northern 
Utah, then move on to southern Utah. In the

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
far north, roads will mostly be impacted with 
road snow overnight Monday into early

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Tuesday morning, and major routes should 
generally be cleared up by the Tuesday

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
morning commute. In the Salt Lake Valley, 
we're expecting road slush beginning around

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
midnight, and then the potential for road slush 
will continue into both commutes on

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Tuesday. And finally, in Utah Valley, the higher 
elevations of Interstate 80, and

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
northeastern Utah, we are expecting snow to 
accumulate on the roads for Tuesday morning

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and Tuesday afternoon. This will lead to 
hazardous travel for both the morning and

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
afternoon commutes. Once the sun sets on 
Tuesday, temperatures will be cold

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
enough that any snow that falls will stick to the 
roads in all locations.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.033
In central and southern Utah, widespread road 
snow is expected. We're expecting very

00:01:42.033 --> 00:01:47.066
difficult travel in central and southern Utah 
Tuesday afternoon through Wednesday morning,

00:01:47.066 --> 00:01:51.033
especially along Interstate 15 from Spanish 
Fork to Cedar City, and along most of Interstate 
70

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:56.066
in the state. This snowfall will also impact most 
other roads in this portion of the

00:01:56.066 --> 00:02:00.000
state, including all mountain passes. More 
intermittent impacts from snow are expected

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.066
as you head further east, including cities such 
as Hanksville and Green River.

00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:10.000
Once you get into the lower elevations in far 
southern Utah, little to no

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.066
weather-related travel impacts are expected.

00:02:14.066 --> 00:02:19.033
So, in summary, we're expecting a strong cold 
front to move through Utah tonight through

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:24.033
Wednesday morning. Northern Utah will start 
seeing snow overnight into early Tuesday

00:02:24.033 --> 00:02:28.033
morning, while southern Utah will start to see 
impacts Tuesday afternoon and evening.

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:33.000
Accumulating snowfall will be heavy, and will 
impact travel. Along the Wasatch Front, expect

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
slush in the Salt Lake Valley for Tuesday 
commutes, and accumulating road snow with

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
more significant impacts in the Utah Valley. The 
worst impacts will be in central and southern

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.066
Utah, and travel will be quite hazardous in these 
areas Tuesday afternoon through

00:02:48.066 --> 00:02:52.066
Wednesday morning. Finally, this storm will 
also bring much colder temperatures for the

00:02:52.066 --> 00:02:57.066
state for the rest of the week, with most highs 
staying below freezing heading into the

00:02:57.066 --> 00:03:02.066
weekend.

00:03:02.066 --> 00:03:06.066
