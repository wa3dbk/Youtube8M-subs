00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.200
My dad started making Bhujing in 1940

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.300
We cut the chicken into small pieces

00:00:13.663 --> 00:00:15.663
Add cut potatoes to this

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.894
Now make a masala mix of jeera, dhania, haldi and salt

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.000
And mix this with the chicken and potato

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.800
Then cook this over charcoal

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:49.133
We then take oil and sliced onion in vessels

00:00:53.713 --> 00:00:56.900
And add the cooked chicken and potato to this

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.900
And then cook over gas, covered with a lid on top

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.100
Now make a paste with clove, cardamom, cinnamon, garlic, dried coconut and green chilly

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Grind this into a coarse mixture 

00:01:29.421 --> 00:01:31.421
Then add to the cooked chicken

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Then at the end, add nylon pohe to this
