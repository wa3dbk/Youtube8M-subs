00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.400
This is a strategy for keeping your pool clean.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.750
You want to net out all the big stuff first
and brush your pool at least once a week.

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.270
That'll keep algae from growing and forming
on the sides of your pool as long as all your

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:28.440
chemicals are maintained properly.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:33.300
You want to start with the top of your stairs
going from the top to the bottom.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.780
Brushing that all off and than right up against
the inside corner of the bottom step.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:41.920
Your going to want to sweep the dust and debris
away from the edges.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.180
Like I said netting everything out first will
make this a lot easier.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.560
So all that's left is the dirt and stuff that
will settle to the bottom.

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.710
Than you are going to want to push as much
of the debris as afar as you can.

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.750
AS you can reach with your pole towards the
main drains and than you will be able to use

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.890
your main drains like a central vacuum unit.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.799
You can push all the dirt right into those
main drains.

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:10.450
If you need more suction power at your main
drains you can close off your anti cavitation

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.170
devices at your skimmer baskets.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.619
That way you'll have more suction power.

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:16.810
It will pull more at the main drains.

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.950
Than you are going to brush the entire pool
shell.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.030
Again brushing everything towards the main
drains.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.470
This is a strategy to minimize vacuuming.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.229
If need be you can follow this up with vacuuming.

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.110
This is a way of maintaining it and getting
most of it out.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:44.539
Whatever settles left you can detail with
your pool vacuum.

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:48.799
Again this keeps algae from forming on the
shell of your pool as long as your chemicals

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:49.599
are maintained properly.
