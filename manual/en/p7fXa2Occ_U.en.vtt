00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:08.217
"Hi, Bob."

00:00:08.217 --> 00:00:11.237
"Morning, Kelly. The tulips looks great."

00:00:11.237 --> 00:00:14.966
Have you ever wondered
how your dog experiences the world?

00:00:14.966 --> 00:00:16.581
Here's what she sees.

00:00:16.581 --> 00:00:18.696
Not terribly interesting.

00:00:18.696 --> 00:00:22.266
But what she smells,
that's a totally different story.

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:25.381
And it begins at her wonderfully 
developed nose.

00:00:25.381 --> 00:00:28.400
As your dog catches 
the first hints of fresh air,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.725
her nose's moist, spongy outside helps
capture any scents the breeze carries.

00:00:34.725 --> 00:00:37.465
The ability to smell 
separately with each nostril,

00:00:37.465 --> 00:00:39.099
smelling in stereo,

00:00:39.099 --> 00:00:41.797
helps to determine the direction 
of the smell's source

00:00:41.797 --> 00:00:44.265
so that within the first 
few moments of sniffing,

00:00:44.265 --> 00:00:48.291
the dog starts to become aware of not
just what kind of things are out there

00:00:48.291 --> 00:00:50.695
but also where they're located.

00:00:50.695 --> 00:00:52.303
As air enters the nose,

00:00:52.303 --> 00:00:56.101
a small fold of tissue 
divides it into two separate folds,

00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:59.151
one for breathing 
and one just for smelling.

00:00:59.151 --> 00:01:01.140
This second airflow enters a region

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.423
filled with highly specialized 
olfactory receptor cells,

00:01:04.423 --> 00:01:08.534
several hundred millions of them,
compaired to our five million.

00:01:08.534 --> 00:01:12.391
And unlike our clumsy way of breathing 
in and out through the same passage,

00:01:12.391 --> 00:01:15.313
dogs exhale through slits 
at the side of their nose,

00:01:15.313 --> 00:01:19.491
creating swirls of air that help
draw in new odor molecules

00:01:19.491 --> 00:01:24.148
and allow odor concentration to build up
over mulitple sniffs.

00:01:24.148 --> 00:01:27.716
But all that impressive nasal architecture
wouldn't be much help

00:01:27.716 --> 00:01:32.562
without something to process the loads
of information the nose scoops up.

00:01:32.562 --> 00:01:36.996
And it turns out that the olfactory system
dedicated to proessing smells

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:42.655
takes up many times more relative
brain area in dogs than in humans.

00:01:42.655 --> 00:01:44.487
All of this allows dogs to distinguish

00:01:44.487 --> 00:01:48.155
and remember a staggering 
variety of specific scents

00:01:48.155 --> 00:01:53.416
at concentrations up to 100 million times
less than what our noses can detect.

00:01:53.416 --> 00:01:56.082
If you can smell a spritz of perfume
in a small room,

00:01:56.082 --> 00:01:59.780
a dog would have no trouble smelling it
in an enclosed stadium

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.542
and distinguishing its ingredients,
to boot.

00:02:02.542 --> 00:02:05.768
And everything in the street,
every passing person or car,

00:02:05.768 --> 00:02:08.060
any contents of the neighbor's trash,

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.568
each type of tree,

00:02:09.568 --> 00:02:11.556
and all the birds and insects in it

00:02:11.556 --> 00:02:15.830
has a distinct odor profile telling
your dog what it is, where it is,

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.977
and which direction it's moving in.

00:02:18.977 --> 00:02:21.161
Besides being much 
more powerful than ours,

00:02:21.161 --> 00:02:26.042
a dog's sense of smell can pick up things
that can't even be seen at all.

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:27.967
A whole separate olfactory system,

00:02:27.967 --> 00:02:31.506
called the vomeronasal organ,
above the roof of the mouth,

00:02:31.506 --> 00:02:36.033
detects the hormones all animals,
Including humans, naturally release.

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:38.310
It lets dogs identify potential mates,

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.550
or distinguish between friendly 
and hostile animals.

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.250
It alerts them to our various 
emotional states,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.396
and it can even tell them 
when someone is pregnant or sick.

00:02:48.396 --> 00:02:51.117
Because olfaction is more primal 
than other senses,

00:02:51.117 --> 00:02:54.400
bypassing the thalamus to connect
directly to the brain structures

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.993
involving emotion and instinct,

00:02:56.993 --> 00:03:01.625
we might even say a dog's perception 
is more immediate and visceral than ours.

00:03:01.625 --> 00:03:04.165
But the most amazing thing about 
your dog's nose

00:03:04.165 --> 00:03:06.343
is that it can traverse time.

00:03:06.343 --> 00:03:09.340
The past appears in tracks 
left by passersby,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.977
and by the warmth 
of a recently parked car

00:03:11.977 --> 00:03:16.887
where the residue of where you've been
and what you've done recently.

00:03:16.887 --> 00:03:18.807
Landmarks like fire hydrants and trees

00:03:18.807 --> 00:03:21.884
are aromatic bulletin boards 
carrying messages of who's been by,

00:03:21.884 --> 00:03:23.330
what they've been eating,

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:25.198
and how they're feeling.

00:03:25.198 --> 00:03:26.771
And the future is in the breeze,

00:03:26.771 --> 00:03:31.386
alerting them to something or someone
approaching long before you see them.

00:03:31.386 --> 00:03:33.841
Where we see and hear something
at a single moment,

00:03:33.841 --> 00:03:38.092
a dog smells an entire story
from start to finish.

00:03:38.092 --> 00:03:41.075
In some of the best examples
of canine-human collaboration,

00:03:41.075 --> 00:03:44.414
dogs help us by sharing
and reacting to those stories.

00:03:44.414 --> 00:03:47.368
They can respond with kindness
to people in distress,

00:03:47.368 --> 00:03:49.131
or with aggression to threats

00:03:49.131 --> 00:03:51.928
because stress and anger 
manifest as a cloud of hormones

00:03:51.928 --> 00:03:54.507
recognizable to the dog's nose.

00:03:54.507 --> 00:03:55.792
With the proper training,

00:03:55.792 --> 00:03:58.196
they can even alert us 
to invisible threats

00:03:58.196 --> 00:04:00.925
ranging from bombs to cancer.

00:04:00.925 --> 00:04:03.180
As it turns out, humanity's best friend

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.528
is not one who experiences 
the same things we do,

00:04:06.528 --> 00:04:11.762
but one whose incredible nose reveals 
a whole other world beyond our eyes.
