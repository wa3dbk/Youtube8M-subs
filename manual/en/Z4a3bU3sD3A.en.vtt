Hi this is Stewart and I'm currently
on a property here that's going to go up

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.700
for sale in about a week's time here.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.540
In Seattle Washington area here and
the client

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.980
this lawn has been aerated and thatched and the client

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.609
has seeded and fertilized and put out some lime

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.529
and now the client's gonna put out peat moss. I was just giving him a quick

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:25.849
sample on how to do this and using a
peat moss roller

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.119
is a really nice quick efficient way
and you get a lot higher quality results

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.930
then when you spread it by hand. This is
a peat moss roller here

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.250
and has a little attachment here that
slides back and forth usually they have

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.079
a lock on it

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:44.770
and this one's a little tough. So you put
the peat moss in the middle that

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:49.110
and I usually roll it right on up to the peat moss bag

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.590
and then start loading it up with a
shovel and what this does,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.020
it's got expanded diamond cut metal on
there, and it keeps

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.570
the very large chunks of peat moss from
getting onto your lawn

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.909
One of the problems I see mostly
with homeowners

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.890
is they put on the peat moss too thick.
Then it locks or binds together.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.000
The seed will germinate underneath and it will die because it

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.500
cannot get through there. So the peat
moss rover really helps.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.820
I keep it a little thin. I did a couple little
strips here

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:24.990
as an example for him and, like i say,
this house goes up for sale in about a

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.810
week's time

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.470
so he's just put down some bark and 
they're doing some finishing touches to

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:30.100
their lawn

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:37.100
he and his kids. There's a peat
moss bag.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.820
How I like to do these peat moss bags...you see how I cut it and then fold that last

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:43.509
piece back.

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:47.799
Before I cut this I take my boot and stomp
on this real heavy and try to break it

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:48.350
up a bit

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.799
and then take a I like square to shovel
like that thing

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:56.549
and then use that to load the
peat moss into the peat moss roller

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.950
and this works out really really nice

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.410
and this peat moss roller can be used for
other things too.  In Fall time

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:10.770
if you have some very very fine compost
you can use this to screen compost

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.390
and as you put very very fine compost
over your lawn, which will help

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.410
amend your soil,

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.830
you could also probably try it if you
had a very fine fertimulch.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.020
That's very very beneficial to do
for your lawn.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.110
In Fall time I have seen just some
fantastic results

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.330
when people do this. Once again this is
Stewart and hope you enjoy the video

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.900
thank you
