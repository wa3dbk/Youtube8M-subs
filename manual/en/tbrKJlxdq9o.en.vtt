BURGER KING CHICKEN FRIES.

00:00:02.968 --> 00:00:04.937
SURE ENOUGH, THEY WERE
DISCONTINUED FOR 2012.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.472
LIKE MY LIFE
DOESN'T SUCK ENOUGH.

00:00:06.505 --> 00:00:07.840
DO YOU STILL FREQUENT
A BURGER KING?

00:00:07.873 --> 00:00:09.642
UH, NO, I'VE BEEN BOYCOTTING
THEM EVER SINCE.

00:00:09.675 --> 00:00:11.244
I'M TALKING ABOUT,
SHE WAS HUGE.

00:00:11.277 --> 00:00:13.413
A BIG, BIG LADY.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:18.584
YOU--YOU CAN'T BELIEVE IT,
HOW HUGE SHE WAS.

00:00:18.617 --> 00:00:20.553
MY FAVORITE FOOD
IS BEANS AND CORNBREAD.

00:00:20.586 --> 00:00:22.121
I LOVE BEANS
AND CORNBREAD.

00:00:22.154 --> 00:00:23.322
'CAUSE I'M JUST
A COUNTRY BOY.

00:00:23.355 --> 00:00:24.924
YOU KNOW, LOVE
THAT BEANS AND CORNBREAD.

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:27.060
'CAUSE THERE AIN'T NOTHING WRONG
WITH BEANS AND CORNBREAD.

00:00:27.093 --> 00:00:29.762
I HAVE BEEN A REPUBLICAN
IN TIMES GOOD,

00:00:29.795 --> 00:00:32.765
AND I HAVE BEEN A REPUBLICAN
IN TIMES BAD!

00:00:32.798 --> 00:00:33.766
DANIEL TOSH IS GONNA BE

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:35.368
MY PRESIDENTIAL
CAMPAIGN MANAGER.

00:00:35.401 --> 00:00:36.369
WHOO!

00:00:36.402 --> 00:00:37.837
HELL, YEAH!

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.573
I HAVE NEVER BEEN NOSTALGIC
BECAUSE UNLIKE EVERYONE ELSE,

00:00:40.606 --> 00:00:42.942
I DON'T GET UGLIER AND FATTER
AS I GET OLDER.

00:00:42.975 --> 00:00:44.844
THOSE THREE FOLKS
I KIND OF REMEMBER

00:00:44.877 --> 00:00:47.346
ARE THE FEW, THE PROUD,
THE REDEEMED.

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:48.981
I'VE BEEN REDEEMING PEOPLE
PROFESSIONALLY

00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:50.049
FOR SEVEN YEARS NOW.

00:00:50.082 --> 00:00:51.651
15 ALL TOLD.

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:54.220
EVERY PERSON I REDEEM IS LIKE
FAMILY TO ME,

00:00:54.253 --> 00:00:56.622
WHICH IS WHY I AVOID THEM
AS LONG AS POSSIBLE.

00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:58.024
BUT ONCE IN A WHILE,

00:00:58.057 --> 00:01:00.593
IT'S IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE
OUR BELOVED TOSH LEGENDS

00:01:00.626 --> 00:01:02.428
DIDN'T DIE ALONE
IN THEIR APARTMENTS

00:01:02.461 --> 00:01:04.097
WITH CATS EATING THEIR FACES.

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:07.133
THAT'S WHY I FLEW PHIL, DARRELL,
AND THAT CHICKEN FRIES GUY

00:01:07.166 --> 00:01:09.602
BACK TO HOLLYWOOD
FOR THE THIRD ANNUAL

00:01:09.635 --> 00:01:11.904
TOSH.OH, THAT'S WHAT
THEY'RE UP TO NOW

00:01:11.937 --> 00:01:13.739
REDEMPTION REUNION SPECTACULAR.

00:01:13.772 --> 00:01:16.542
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:01:16.575 --> 00:01:18.044
WELCOME TO TALKING TOSH,

00:01:18.077 --> 00:01:20.780
THE ONLY SHOW THAT COMES ON
DURING TOSH WHERE WE TALK ABOUT

00:01:20.813 --> 00:01:22.849
WHAT TOSH IS TALKING
ABOUT ON TOSH.

00:01:22.882 --> 00:01:24.684
I AM YOUR HOST, DANIEL TOSH,
FROM TOSH.0.

00:01:24.717 --> 00:01:25.985
LET'S TALK TOSH.

00:01:26.018 --> 00:01:27.687
I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER
OUR FIRST GUEST

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.591
FOR BEING PASSIONATE,
ENTHUSIASTIC, AND WAY TOO LOUD.

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:34.427
PLEASE WELCOME PHIL DAVISON!

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.163
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:01:37.196 --> 00:01:38.531
HOW YOU DOING, DANIEL?

00:01:38.564 --> 00:01:39.765
- PHIL, GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU TOO.

00:01:39.798 --> 00:01:40.766
THANKS FOR HAVING ME.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.368
ALL RIGHT, FIRST THING'S FIRST,

00:01:42.401 --> 00:01:43.803
SCREAM AS LOUD AS YOU CAN.

00:01:43.836 --> 00:01:45.004
AHH!

00:01:45.037 --> 00:01:46.205
WHAT HAVE YOU
BEEN UP TO, PHIL?

00:01:46.238 --> 00:01:47.240
JUST BEEN WORKING.

00:01:47.273 --> 00:01:48.941
WORK IN OHIO
AS A LEGAL ASSISTANT.

00:01:48.974 --> 00:01:50.843
YOU DIDN'T BECOME
STARK COUNTY'S TREASURER.

00:01:50.876 --> 00:01:52.245
THAT'S CORRECT.

00:01:52.278 --> 00:01:54.714
HAS ANY COLLEGE ASKED YOU
TO GIVE THE COMMENCEMENT SPEECH?

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:55.715
NO, THEY HAVEN'T.

00:01:55.748 --> 00:01:56.716
THAT'S A SHAME.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.017
I'M PISSED ABOUT IT, MAN.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.453
HAVE YOU EVER SENT ANY PHOTOS
OF YOUR PENIS TO ANYONE?

00:02:00.486 --> 00:02:02.421
YES, I HAVE.

00:02:02.454 --> 00:02:03.789
PHIL, YOU CAN'T
BE DOING THAT.

00:02:03.822 --> 00:02:04.790
YOU DATING ANYONE?

00:02:04.823 --> 00:02:05.958
- YES.
- NICE.

00:02:05.991 --> 00:02:08.027
YEAH, SHE'S NOT HAPPY
WITH ME.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.529
WELL, WHY WOULD SHE BE?

00:02:09.562 --> 00:02:10.663
EXACTLY, YOU KNOW.

00:02:10.696 --> 00:02:12.431
HOW MUCH DO YOU SPEND
ON DRUGS A MONTH?

00:02:12.464 --> 00:02:14.667
ABOUT $200.
IT'S ABOUT 1/4 BAG A WEEK.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.336
SUM UP OBAMA'S PRESIDENCY
IN ONE WORD.

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:19.038
FAILURE.

00:02:19.071 --> 00:02:21.407
DID YOU INVEST YOUR MONEY
FROM THE SHOW WISELY?

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.408
YES, I HAVE.

00:02:22.441 --> 00:02:23.409
I'VE PUT IT IN AN IRA FUND,

00:02:23.442 --> 00:02:24.410
AND OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS,

00:02:24.443 --> 00:02:25.411
IT'S GROWN EXPONENTIALLY.

00:02:25.444 --> 00:02:26.546
SO I'M DOING FINE.

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:27.647
IS THERE ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:28.714
TO THE HATERS OUT THERE?

00:02:28.747 --> 00:02:30.049
YOU KNOW WHAT
I'D LIKE TO TELL 'EM?

00:02:30.082 --> 00:02:32.485
- WHAT'S THAT?
- [BLEEP] ALL OF YA.

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:33.519
YOU KNOW WHAT?

00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:35.154
WHAT THE HELL ARE
YOU PEOPLE DOING?

00:02:35.187 --> 00:02:36.155
YOU WANT RATINGS?

00:02:36.188 --> 00:02:38.258
I'LL GIVE YOU RATINGS.

00:02:40.226 --> 00:02:42.628
WELL, THAT'S ALL THE TIME
WE HAVE FOR PHIL.

00:02:42.661 --> 00:02:44.130
THANK YOU FOR COMING ON.

00:02:44.163 --> 00:02:46.365
I KNOW YOU NEED TO GET BACK
TO YOUR VAN DOWN BY THE RIVER.

00:02:46.398 --> 00:02:47.900
ALL RIGHT,
LET'S TALK MORE TOSH.

00:02:47.933 --> 00:02:49.335
NOW, ACCORDING
TO MY CALCULATIONS,

00:02:49.368 --> 00:02:50.970
OUR NEXT GUEST
IS MOMENTS AWAY

00:02:51.003 --> 00:02:52.271
FROM DYING
OF KIDNEY FAILURE

00:02:52.304 --> 00:02:54.106
BECAUSE HE ONLY
EATS FAST FOOD.

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:57.743
PLEASE WELCOME BACK DAVE,
THE BK-CHICKEN-FRIES GUY.

00:02:57.776 --> 00:03:01.647
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:02.848
- DAVE.
- HEY.

00:03:02.881 --> 00:03:03.950
HAVE A SEAT.
NICE TO SEE YOU.

00:03:03.983 --> 00:03:05.551
- YOU STILL DATING THAT REDHEAD?
- YES.

00:03:05.584 --> 00:03:06.586
OH.

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.788
HOW SHOCKED WERE YOU
WHEN YOU FOUND OUT

00:03:08.821 --> 00:03:11.991
BK HAD CAVED
TO OUR DEMANDS

00:03:12.024 --> 00:03:13.326
AND BROUGHT BACK
THE CHICKEN FRY?

00:03:13.359 --> 00:03:15.228
[CHANTING]
BRING THEM BACK.

00:03:15.261 --> 00:03:16.762
BRING THEM BACK.

00:03:16.795 --> 00:03:18.130
I WAS ACTUALLY
VERY SHOCKED,

00:03:18.163 --> 00:03:19.899
'CAUSE I JUST THOUGHT I WAS
THE ONLY ONE WHO CARED.

00:03:19.932 --> 00:03:21.467
DAVE, I CANNOT BELIEVE
YOU ARE NOT

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:23.736
ON YOUR KNEES RIGHT NOW
SLOBBING ON MY KNOB.

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.137
YOU KNOW,
I MAY BE THE LENIN

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:26.405
OF THE CHICKEN FRIES MOVEMENT.

00:03:26.438 --> 00:03:27.506
YOU ARE THE TROTSKY.

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:28.774
DID THE CHICKEN FRIES TASTE

00:03:28.807 --> 00:03:30.109
AS GOOD AS YOU REMEMBERED?

00:03:30.142 --> 00:03:31.110
THEY WERE STILL SPICY.

00:03:31.143 --> 00:03:32.478
I THINK THEY WERE
A BIT SOGGIER

00:03:32.511 --> 00:03:34.513
BECAUSE THEY CHANGED THE METHOD
IN WHICH THEY MAKE THEM,

00:03:34.546 --> 00:03:36.749
BUT ASIDE FROM THAT,
THEY WERE PRETTY DAMN GOOD.

00:03:36.782 --> 00:03:37.750
HOW'S YOUR HEALTH?

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:39.218
I'M STILL ALIVE.

00:03:39.251 --> 00:03:40.386
I'M PROBABLY HEALTHIER

00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.088
BECAUSE I'VE BECOME
SLIGHTLY LESS

00:03:42.121 --> 00:03:43.623
OF A PICKY EATER
SINCE THE SHOW.

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:44.757
WHAT DO YOU ENJOY NOW

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.025
THAT YOU DIDN'T HAVE
A TASTE FOR BEFORE?

00:03:46.058 --> 00:03:47.493
ON THE HEALTHY SIDE, RICE.

00:03:47.526 --> 00:03:49.428
ON THE EXTREMELY
UNHEALTHY SIDE, BACON.

00:03:49.461 --> 00:03:50.529
TALK ABOUT RICE.

00:03:50.562 --> 00:03:52.398
ALL RIGHT, WHAT I LIKE
ABOUT RICE IS THAT

00:03:52.431 --> 00:03:55.434
I CAN ADD AS MUCH [BLEEP]
SPICE TO IT AS POSSIBLE

00:03:55.467 --> 00:03:57.303
AND IT JUST TASTES
LIKE THE SPICE.

00:03:57.336 --> 00:04:00.172
DID YOU INVEST YOUR MONEY
FROM THE SHOW WISELY?

00:04:00.205 --> 00:04:01.741
NO, IT PROBABLY JUST SAT
IN MY BANK ACCOUNT

00:04:01.774 --> 00:04:02.842
UNTIL I PAID RENT.

00:04:02.875 --> 00:04:05.411
DID WE COVER
AN ENTIRE MONTH'S RENT?

00:04:05.444 --> 00:04:06.545
YES.

00:04:06.578 --> 00:04:07.546
THAT IS INCREDIBLE.

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:08.814
THAT IS INCREDIBLE.

00:04:08.847 --> 00:04:10.449
DID YOU EVER
IN A MILLION YEARS THINK

00:04:10.482 --> 00:04:12.318
YOU DESERVED
TO BE ON TOSH.0 TWICE?

00:04:12.351 --> 00:04:13.586
NO.

00:04:13.619 --> 00:04:15.621
IT'S LITERALLY
THE LEAST I COULD DO.

00:04:15.654 --> 00:04:16.822
WHO'S READY TO TALK
MORE TOSH?

00:04:16.855 --> 00:04:18.124
TOSH IS.

00:04:18.157 --> 00:04:20.493
OUR NEXT GUEST WAS PLAYING
A LITTLE HARD TO GET,

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:22.995
BUT WE FINALLY CONVINCED HER
TO COME BACK ON THE SHOW.

00:04:23.028 --> 00:04:27.099
PLEASE WELCOME
THE SURPRISINGLY STRONG FANNY.

00:04:27.132 --> 00:04:30.202
[CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKING]

00:04:30.235 --> 00:04:31.537
ALL RIGHT, I'LL TAKE
THE TAPE OFF,

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:33.306
BUT YOU HAVE TO PROMISE
NOT TO SCREAM.

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:34.707
OKAY?

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:35.775
ALL RIGHT.

00:04:35.808 --> 00:04:38.010
- HELP ME! HELP--
- OKAY, OKAY.

00:04:38.043 --> 00:04:41.947
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEBODY HAS TO GO
BACKSTAGE AND CALM DOWN FIRST.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:43.849
OH, YOUR HAIR SMELLS SO GOOD.
WHAT IS THAT?

00:04:43.882 --> 00:04:45.818
WHAT IS THAT, A CLEMENTINE MIX,
OR TANGERINE?

00:04:45.851 --> 00:04:46.819
I'M SO BAD AT THIS GAME.

00:04:46.852 --> 00:04:48.154
WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

00:04:48.187 --> 00:04:51.290
OUR FINAL GUEST SAID
"BEANS AND CORNBREAD"

00:04:51.323 --> 00:04:52.525
SIX TIMES IN A ROW,

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:54.694
AND EVERYONE THOUGHT
IT WAS HILARIOUS.

00:04:54.727 --> 00:04:59.031
PLEASE WELCOME BACK STANDUP
COMEDIAN DARRELL BLUETT.

00:04:59.064 --> 00:05:02.335
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:05:02.368 --> 00:05:04.704
DARRELL, DO YOU KNOW
WHERE YOU ARE RIGHT NOW?

00:05:04.737 --> 00:05:07.773
YEAH, TALKING TO YOU.

00:05:07.806 --> 00:05:09.608
YOU LOOK AMAZING.
WHAT'S YOUR SECRET?

00:05:09.641 --> 00:05:10.976
JUST EATING BEANS
AND CORNBREAD.

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:12.445
- THAT'S IT?
- YEAH.

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:16.182
DO YOU EVER GET SICK AND TIRED
OF SAYING "BEANS AND CORNBREAD"?

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:18.284
NO, I THINK IT'S GREAT,
'CAUSE I LIKE THE ATTENTION.

00:05:18.317 --> 00:05:20.286
HOW ARE THINGS GOING
IN DARRELL BLUETT'S WORLD?

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:21.520
OH, IT'S GOING GREAT.

00:05:21.553 --> 00:05:23.689
EVERYBODY KNOW ME
BY "BEANS AND CORNBREAD."

00:05:23.722 --> 00:05:25.524
EVEN THE POLICE EVEN
IN MY HOMETOWN,

00:05:25.557 --> 00:05:28.060
THEY SAY, "HOW YOU DOING,
BEANS AND CORNBREAD?"

00:05:28.093 --> 00:05:29.562
THE POLICE ARE NICE
TO YOU, THOUGH?

00:05:29.595 --> 00:05:30.563
OH, THEY REAL NICE TO ME.

00:05:30.596 --> 00:05:31.931
OKAY, GOOD.

00:05:31.964 --> 00:05:33.999
WHAT DID YOU THINK OF
LOUIS C.K.'S LAST SPECIAL?

00:05:34.032 --> 00:05:36.502
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHO LOUIS K IS.

00:05:36.535 --> 00:05:37.803
HE'S NEW.

00:05:37.836 --> 00:05:39.271
DO YOU EVER WATCH YOURSELF
ON TV?

00:05:39.304 --> 00:05:41.006
I'VE SEEN MYSELF ONE TIME

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:42.775
AND I SAID,
"WHO'S THAT UGLY GUY?"

00:05:42.808 --> 00:05:44.110
- YOU TALKING ABOUT ME?
- ME.

00:05:44.143 --> 00:05:45.144
OH.

00:05:45.177 --> 00:05:47.246
[LAUGHS]

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:48.247
I THOUGHT YOU WERE--

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.415
I THOUGHT YOU WERE
CALLING ME UGLY.

00:05:49.448 --> 00:05:52.017
DARRELL, DO PEOPLE
ASK YOU IF I'M GAY?

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.153
YES, THEY DO.

00:05:54.186 --> 00:05:55.855
YOU TELL 'EM I GOT
A GIRLFRIEND, RIGHT?

00:05:55.888 --> 00:05:58.057
I TOLD 'EM, I SAID YOU GOT
PLENTY OF GIRLFRIENDS.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:59.225
THANK YOU.

00:05:59.258 --> 00:06:01.427
THEY EVEN ASK ME
IF I'M GAY SOMETIMES.

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.795
OKAY.
WHAT?

00:06:02.828 --> 00:06:04.464
THAT'S--ARE YOU?

00:06:05.798 --> 00:06:06.766
I DON'T THINK I AM.

00:06:06.799 --> 00:06:07.767
I DON'T THINK SO.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:08.934
YOU GOT A GIRLFRIEND
RIGHT NOW?

00:06:08.967 --> 00:06:10.736
I DON'T HAVE A GIRLFRIEND,
BUT I'M NOT GAY.

00:06:10.769 --> 00:06:12.271
YOU DON'T HAVE
TO GET UPSET WITH ME.

00:06:12.304 --> 00:06:14.707
HOW MANY GOOD MINUTES OF
STANDUP DO YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW?

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:16.242
I CAN DO ABOUT 30 MINUTES.

00:06:16.275 --> 00:06:17.543
WHAT'S THE RESPONSE BEEN?

00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:18.711
THEY'VE BEEN LIKING IT.

00:06:18.744 --> 00:06:21.981
THEY SAID I NEED TO WORK
A LOT HARDER AND STUFF

00:06:22.014 --> 00:06:25.484
AND COME UP WITH MORE
MATERIAL AND STUFF.

00:06:25.517 --> 00:06:27.787
I FEEL LIKE IF
I GOT MY OWN IDEAS

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:30.790
AND I DO WHAT I SHOULD DO,

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:33.392
THEN I FEEL LIKE
IT'LL BE MY MATERIAL

00:06:33.425 --> 00:06:34.727
INSTEAD OF BEING
SOMEBODY ELSE,

00:06:34.760 --> 00:06:35.761
'CAUSE IT'S A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:06:35.794 --> 00:06:37.730
WANT TO TRY TO BE
LIKE SOMEBODY ELSE,

00:06:37.763 --> 00:06:39.698
LIKE EDDIE MURPHY
OR RICHARD PRYOR

00:06:39.731 --> 00:06:41.066
OR SOMEBODY LIKE THAT,

00:06:41.099 --> 00:06:43.369
AND I'M NOT TRYING
TO BE LIKE THEM.

00:06:43.402 --> 00:06:45.004
YOU KNOW, I'M JUST TRYING
TO BE MYSELF.

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:48.507
THE MATERIAL I GOT,
I EXPERIENCED IT FOR MYSELF,

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.410
YOU KNOW, AND THEN
I SEE THINGS MYSELF

00:06:51.443 --> 00:06:54.780
AND I JUST USE THAT
AS WHAT I SEE, YOU KNOW,

00:06:54.813 --> 00:06:57.650
NOT SOMEBODY ELSE
HAVE ALREADY SEEN

00:06:57.683 --> 00:07:00.653
AND TRYING TO WORK ON
THEY MATERIAL, YOU KNOW--

00:07:00.686 --> 00:07:04.824
THIS IS THE LONGEST
SENTENCE IN THE WORLD.

00:07:04.857 --> 00:07:07.226
WHAT DID THEY MEXICANS SAY
WHEN TWO HOUSES FELL ON 'EM?

00:07:07.259 --> 00:07:08.227
THEY SAID, "OH!"

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:09.628
GET OFF ME, HOMES.

00:07:09.661 --> 00:07:10.996
GET OFF ME--
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

00:07:11.029 --> 00:07:13.032
HOW ABOUT WHEN THE GUY
WALKED IN THE ELEVATOR

00:07:13.065 --> 00:07:15.668
AND HE ASKED THE LADY,
"HEY, CAN I SMELL YOUR FEET?"

00:07:15.701 --> 00:07:17.670
AND SHE SAID, "NO."

00:07:17.703 --> 00:07:19.505
AND HE GOES, "OH, IT MUST
BE YOUR PUSSY THEN."

00:07:19.538 --> 00:07:20.706
OH.

00:07:20.739 --> 00:07:22.575
- I AIN'T HEARD THAT ONE.
- [TITTERS]

00:07:22.608 --> 00:07:23.976
- KNOCK, KNOCK.
- WHO'S THERE?

00:07:24.009 --> 00:07:25.444
- ORANGE.
- ORANGE WHO?

00:07:25.477 --> 00:07:26.679
ORANGE YOU GLAD
WE HAD YOU BACK?

00:07:26.712 --> 00:07:28.047
DARRELL BLUETT,
EVERYBODY.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.381
WELL, THAT'S ALL
THE TIME WE HAVE

00:07:29.414 --> 00:07:31.851
FOR TONIGHT'S INSTALLMENT
OF TT ON THE CC.

00:07:31.884 --> 00:07:34.286
SO ON BEHALF OF DARRELL, FANNY,
DAVE, PHIL, AND FANNY,

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:35.754
GOOD NIGHT, AND REMEMBER,

00:07:35.787 --> 00:07:37.022
IF TOSH IS TALKING ABOUT IT,

00:07:37.055 --> 00:07:39.024
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT
ON TALKIN' TOSH.

00:07:39.057 --> 00:07:40.793
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

00:07:40.826 --> 00:07:42.828
WAVE, DARRELL.

00:07:42.861 --> 00:07:44.797
LISTENING
TO DARRELL BLUETT SPEAK

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.096
IS ONE OF MY FEW TRUE JOYS
IN LIFE.
