00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:14.610
Understanding the differences between tangible
personal property and real property in a residential

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.640
setting can be difficult.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:26.060
Real property is generally permanent, such
as a house, driveway, fence or garage.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.160
If you are a contractor and you're working
on real property, this means you are the consumer

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.120
of the materials and you pay sales or use
tax when you purchase the materials.

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.630
When it's real property, you don't charge
your customer sales tax.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.149
Tangible personal property is property not
permanently attached to real property such

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:52.140
as furniture, curtains and portable appliances.

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.520
If you are a contractor and you're working
on tangible personal property, you are the

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.620
retailer.

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.079
That means you *don't pay* sales or use tax
when you purchase the materials but you charge

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.210
your customer sales tax on the labor and materials.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.880
Here are some additional real property items:
Land

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.200
Walls
Roof

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.799
Deck
Sidewalk, and

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.020
Fence

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.840
Landscaping is a taxable service.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:27.490
That means these items outside the house are
treated like tangible personal property and

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.969
sales tax is charged to the customer:
Shrubs

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.860
Flower beds
Trees, and

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:34.860
Sod

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.810
Here are some items inside the house that
are real property when installed:

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.229
Hardwood floors
Staircases

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:52.399
Ceiling fans, and
Built in appliances like dishwashers, furnaces

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.570
and water heaters are real property when they're
installed.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:01.789
Here are some items inside the house that
are tangible personal property:

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.840
Furniture, lamps and curtains
Portable appliances, such as refrigerators

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.250
and stoves.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.500
Although real property when installed, these
are some items considered tangible personal

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.830
property when repaired:
Furnaces

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.340
Water heaters and
Dishwashers

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.910
Remember, if you are a contractor performing
real property improvements, you are the consumer

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.280
of the materials and you must pay the sales
tax on those purchases.

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.390
You don't charge your customer sales tax.

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:42.690
If you are working on tangible personal property
you are the retailer of those materials.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.590
You don't pay sales tax on your purchases
but you do charge your customer sales tax

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.410
on labor and materials, unless the customer
can claim an exemption.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.880
