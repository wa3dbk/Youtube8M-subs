00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:02.780
- [Announcer] This module is sponsored by

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.393
the Children's Trust.

00:00:05.498 --> 00:00:08.165
(playful music)

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:12.870
- Hey, today the KidVision VPK kids are

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:17.050
at Marlins Park to find
out about baseball.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:19.270
Baseball is our national sport.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.890
And did you know that
baseball is a compound word?

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.820
It's two words in one,
base and ball, baseball.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:27.653
Hi. (laughs)

00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:28.486
- Hi.

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:29.319
- Nice to meet you.

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:30.152
- Hi, I'm Christina.

00:00:30.152 --> 00:00:30.985
How you doing?

00:00:30.985 --> 00:00:31.818
- Good.

00:00:31.818 --> 00:00:33.860
And these are the KidVision VPK kids.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:34.693
- Hi, kids.

00:00:34.693 --> 00:00:35.526
- [Kids] Hi.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:38.143
- Are you guys ready to see some baseball?

00:00:38.143 --> 00:00:39.553
- [Kids] Yes.
- Yes.

00:00:41.377 --> 00:00:43.540
Have you ever been on a baseball field?

00:00:44.536 --> 00:00:47.295
(ball park organ music)

00:00:47.295 --> 00:00:49.795
Oh, man, look at the red clay.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:54.544
This is an amazing park.

00:00:54.544 --> 00:00:56.083
(kids chattering)

00:00:56.083 --> 00:00:58.940
- Here at Marlins Park we have, not one,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.560
but two fish tanks, with double layer

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.320
bullet-proof glass, guys.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:05.600
On the baseball field teams play.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.680
So it's two teams come together,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.420
they throw ball, they catch ball,

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.850
they hit home runs.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.705
It's where all the exciting
part comes, with teamwork.

00:01:13.705 --> 00:01:16.302
- Hi, look at that, it's Billy the Marlin.

00:01:16.302 --> 00:01:18.068
- Guys, it's Billy the Marlin.

00:01:18.068 --> 00:01:20.818
(Billy whistles)

00:01:22.102 --> 00:01:24.143
(Billy whistles)

00:01:24.143 --> 00:01:27.890
- Yeah, it's so nice to meet you, hi.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.620
- Kids, Billy knows all about teamwork.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.130
He is the number one team player,

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.283
here at the ball park.

00:01:34.678 --> 00:01:39.678
- Oooohhhhhhh, look at that. (laughs)

00:01:39.919 --> 00:01:43.910
Aaaahhhhh, you got a kiss
from a, a kiss from a marlin.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:44.743
(Billy buzzes)

00:01:44.743 --> 00:01:46.993
(laughing)

00:01:47.858 --> 00:01:49.406
Look at that!

00:01:49.406 --> 00:01:50.852
Aww.
- Aww.

00:01:50.852 --> 00:01:52.290
- Bye, Billy.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.364
Thank you for visiting with us
- Bye, Billy.

00:01:55.364 --> 00:01:58.531
- [Christina] Go, run, run, run!

00:01:58.531 --> 00:02:01.226
(tires squealing)

00:02:01.226 --> 00:02:03.970
(playful music)

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.020
- Let's go to the bullpen
and throw some balls around.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.853
- You guys ready?

00:02:07.853 --> 00:02:09.390
- Yeah.
Let's head over.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.790
- I'm gonna throw the ball at you,

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.962
and you're gonna catch it.

00:02:12.962 --> 00:02:16.140
Come on in, come on in the bullpen.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.360
You think there's bulls in here?

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.220
- All right, team, right now we're

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.800
in the home team bullpen,

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.580
where the pitchers actually warm up

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.970
before they get called on to the field.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.787
So we're on the pitcher's mound right now

00:02:30.787 --> 00:02:33.040
and we're gonna warm up our pitching arms.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.220
One, two, three, go.

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:37.053
Whoo!

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.932
- [Christina] Whoa!

00:02:41.858 --> 00:02:43.895
- [Kid] Home run.

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:45.027
- [Christina] All right, ready?

00:02:45.027 --> 00:02:46.688
Aaaannnnnd, go.

00:02:46.688 --> 00:02:48.046
All right.

00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:49.270
- [Penny] Wow, good throw.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.394
- [Christina] That's a strike.

00:02:50.394 --> 00:02:51.977
- [Penny] Whoooooo!

00:02:54.494 --> 00:02:55.411
Yeeeaaahhh!

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.931
(dramatic music)

00:02:58.931 --> 00:03:01.181
(cheering)

00:03:03.174 --> 00:03:04.007
He's safe!

00:03:05.955 --> 00:03:07.255
(kids chattering)

00:03:07.255 --> 00:03:08.581
Hurray for the Marlins.

00:03:08.581 --> 00:03:09.414
- It hit the top.

00:03:09.414 --> 00:03:10.485
- It did.

00:03:10.485 --> 00:03:12.231
- It hit the lights!

00:03:12.231 --> 00:03:16.410
- It hit the lights, that was a home run.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.170
All right, guys, this was a lot of fun.

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.000
You guys got to learn all
the fundamentals of baseball.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.903
We're gonna go into the president's suite.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:27.783
All right?

00:03:27.783 --> 00:03:30.960
So, very important thing: after a long day

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:33.320
of hard work and playing the teams,

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.620
we gotta hydrate ourselves.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:36.200
So let's grab some water and

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.950
take a look at the field, guys.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.110
So, let's all grab our water bottles

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:41.859
and head to the seats.

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:42.692
All right.
- Thank you.

00:03:42.692 --> 00:03:44.233
I am thirsty.

00:03:44.233 --> 00:03:46.470
(silly noises)

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.973
- [Christina] Look at the field, guys.

00:03:47.973 --> 00:03:49.310
- [Kid] What is that called?

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.370
- That is a home run feature.

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.945
The home run feature actually moves,

00:03:53.945 --> 00:03:56.730
lights up, and shoots water every time

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.540
a baseball player from the Marlins

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.780
hits a home run.

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:01.520
That's why it's called a home run feature.

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.050
- Say, the baseball field
has a lot of great shapes.

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:05.610
Look at all those shapes.

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.270
- The baseball field is
the shape of a diamond.

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:10.460
- That's right, the field itself is shaped

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:11.470
like a diamond.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.866
What shape is the pitcher's mound?

00:04:13.866 --> 00:04:15.000
- A circle.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.370
- [Penny] That's right, the
pitcher's mound is a circle.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.880
Good job.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:21.610
And where home plate is is a circle.

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.900
And, Sam, what shape is
the home plate located in?

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.733
- A circle.

00:04:25.733 --> 00:04:28.536
- [Penny] That's right, home
plate is in a big circle.

00:04:28.536 --> 00:04:30.030
Good job.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.340
And how about the scoreboard?

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:32.870
What shape is the scoreboard?

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:33.930
- [Marissa] A rectangle.

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.390
- That's right, the
shape of the scoreboard

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:37.770
is a rectangle.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:39.120
You can learn all about shapes

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.960
at playing baseball, can't you?

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:42.793
Yeah, you know what?

00:04:42.793 --> 00:04:45.380
You're right, there's a lot
of TV's in this stadium.

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:47.337
What shape are the TV's, Sam?

00:04:47.337 --> 00:04:48.170
- [Sam] Rectangle.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.003
- [Penny] That's right,

00:04:49.003 --> 00:04:50.217
they're rectangles.
- They're squares.

00:04:50.217 --> 00:04:51.611
- And they're squares.

00:04:51.611 --> 00:04:52.983
Good looking.

00:04:52.983 --> 00:04:56.316
(ball park organ music)

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:13.550
- So we're here at the first ever

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.257
bobblehead museum, here at Marlins Park.

00:05:16.257 --> 00:05:17.980
And you guys have been a great help.

00:05:17.980 --> 00:05:19.504
Do you guys want a bobblehead?

00:05:19.504 --> 00:05:20.550
- [All] Yes.

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:21.423
- All right.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.065
You're welcome.

00:05:25.065 --> 00:05:25.898
- Thank you very much.

00:05:25.898 --> 00:05:26.731
- Any time.

00:05:28.305 --> 00:05:29.138
- Thank you.

00:05:29.138 --> 00:05:29.971
- Any time.

00:05:29.971 --> 00:05:30.817
- Thank you.

00:05:30.817 --> 00:05:32.760
- And for the teacher, of course.

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.190
- Thank you very much.

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:36.140
We had a great time, thanks.

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.188
- Thanks for coming.

00:05:37.188 --> 00:05:38.021
- Go Marlins.

00:05:38.021 --> 00:05:38.854
- Go Marlins.

00:05:38.854 --> 00:05:40.396
- Go Marlins.

00:05:40.396 --> 00:05:42.618
- Let's go, guys.
- Bye, kids.

00:05:42.618 --> 00:05:43.951
- Come on, kids.

00:05:45.156 --> 00:05:47.959
- ♪ For it's one, two, three strikes, ♪

00:05:47.959 --> 00:05:52.292
♪ you're out, at the old ball game. ♪

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:54.242
Yay!

00:05:55.319 --> 00:05:57.819
(silly music)

00:05:58.737 --> 00:06:01.404
(playful music)
