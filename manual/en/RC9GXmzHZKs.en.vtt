00:00:01.571 --> 00:00:05.348
The front of the canoe is the part of 
 the canoe that has the seat further back.

00:00:05.348 --> 00:00:07.655
So, any questions before we go out?

00:00:07.655 --> 00:00:41.448
(MUSIC)

00:00:42.818 --> 00:00:48.534
The Family Outdoor Skills Camp for Deaf and Hard of Hearing 
 Children maybe the only camp of its kind. 

00:00:49.036 --> 00:00:51.576
Young people with hearing disabilities and their families 

00:00:51.576 --> 00:00:57.593
come here to learn outdoor skills and enjoy Missouri’s outdoors together.

00:00:57.593 --> 00:01:10.061
(MUSIC)

00:01:10.061 --> 00:01:12.935
This is not just a program for the kids. 

00:01:12.935 --> 00:01:18.317
This is a program for the parents and 
 guardians of these children as well. 

00:01:18.317 --> 00:01:21.826
The parents don’t know how to do a lot of this stuff. 

00:01:21.826 --> 00:01:23.565
So we’re teaching everybody. 

00:01:23.565 --> 00:01:29.681
You get to see a lot of kids that don’t usually get 
 the opportunity to come outside and be around the water.

00:01:29.681 --> 00:01:31.587
They’re new to it. They’re learning. 

00:01:31.587 --> 00:01:38.640
And they just really, really have a good time and that’s 
 the fun part is just watching them have fun. 

00:01:41.213 --> 00:01:47.400
Most of the time the other camps, the other activities 
 that you do, you are always making adjustments. 

00:01:47.397 --> 00:01:54.420
You are always making compromises. It’s different here.

00:01:54.417 --> 00:01:58.900
We all get to participate in the activities with other families. 

00:01:58.896 --> 00:02:02.770
They all have deaf kids, They’re all going through the same things.

00:02:02.773 --> 00:02:08.620
We all get to enjoy it together. And it’s a diversified group. 

00:02:08.623 --> 00:02:16.140
It gives her a chance to be with her friends and 
 to go somewhere where she knows she’ll understand, 

00:02:16.143 --> 00:02:21.060
where she doesn’t have to worry that she's not going to know 
 how to do it or understand what someone’s saying. 

00:02:21.057 --> 00:02:23.460
She can just be free and have fun. 

00:02:23.464 --> 00:02:27.310
It gives her confidence to try stuff that 
 she might not have tried before. 

00:02:33.391 --> 00:02:37.700
We look forward to this every year. We mark our calendars. We can’t wait.

00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:45.930
Now it’s late October and many of the campers are back, 

00:02:45.926 --> 00:02:51.710
but this time to take advantage of Missouri’s special 
 deer season set aside for young people.

00:02:51.708 --> 00:02:55.280
All of the elements of a good hunt take place, 

00:02:55.285 --> 00:02:58.260
the hearty breakfast, 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.580
reconnecting with old friends,

00:03:03.575 --> 00:03:11.130
sneaking out early to take your position, 

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.140
the patient waiting

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:25.070
(MUSIC)

00:03:25.067 --> 00:03:29.080
experiencing the rising sun, 

00:03:29.078 --> 00:03:37.470
the beautiful fall colors...   

00:03:37.468 --> 00:03:42.320
the adventure!   

00:03:42.315 --> 00:03:45.290
(gun fired)

00:03:51.607 --> 00:03:55.180
When Rocky don’t understand what I’m saying she’ll look at the translator 

00:03:55.184 --> 00:04:02.470
and I will repeat to the translator and the translator will make 
 her hand signals and tell her what she needs to do.

00:04:02.471 --> 00:04:05.380
It’s pretty neat to see the look on her 
 face. The glow on her face. 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.930
I wish I had this when I was 
 a child. It’s pretty neat, pretty awesome.

00:04:14.928 --> 00:04:22.530
And of course, just like any other hunt... the 
 stories of the day must be told.

00:04:22.526 --> 00:04:28.210
I told him wait until the deer turns and he had 
 his gun on him for probably about two minutes,

00:04:28.209 --> 00:04:35.800
and as soon as that deer turned to its left, he 
 shot it, dropped it right in its tracks. 

00:04:35.796 --> 00:04:39.310
We got to go out there and had to 
 pry the smile off his face. 

00:04:39.306 --> 00:04:41.610
One happy guy.
