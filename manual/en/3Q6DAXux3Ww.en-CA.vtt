00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.549
Best selling sewing machine in North America.
It's because it's strong it sews through thicknesses

00:00:10.549 --> 00:01:02.479
and it has a high speed. Going all over the
place there. (laughing) This is Janome's Memory

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:11.650
Craft 6600 it is their top seller in Janome,
Canada and North America. It's very unique,

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:18.920
in that it has a dual feeding system. Most
sewing machines only have feed dogs on the

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.940
bottom of the machine. This one they've attached
an extra little feed dog that sits underneath

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:31.610
your presser foot. So it's an even feeding
system. they've also added on here a dual

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:37.850
feeding system as a differential feed. You
know how sergers have differential feed you'd

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.160
never buy a serger without differential feed
because it stops the slippage of your fabric.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:48.770
This is the only machine on the market that
has that feature to it. As you're sewing,

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.340
with this dual feeding system, you can actually
see these two little feed dogs on the side

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:10.000
of your presser foot lifting up and walking
your fabric through. Very quiet machine but

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.910
yet very strong. It's all metal casting it's
got a long arm so that you can get the large

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:26.110
quilt through here. It has the little thread
cutter built-in to the machine. Pressing the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:32.920
button it clips your thread top and bottom
for you. Has a very convenient feature of

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:42.370
your presser foot lifter located here as well
as behind. So if you're turning corners and

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:49.720
you want both hands on your fabric when you
turn your corner, you don't have to take your

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.030
hands off your fabric. Stops with the needle
down, you can keep both hands so you've got

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:05.780
more control and more precision over your
sewing. The pressure on your presser foot

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.930
can be controlled with your regulator here.
With a little window in the front indicating

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:17.140
where your pressure is. You've got industrial
spool holders here so you can use large quantities

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:22.060
of spools of thread. And a separate motor
for winding the bobbin. So you can actually

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:29.620
sew...and wind a bobbin at the same time.
Your fliptop lid stitch selector here. Fliptop

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.209
built-in book. Has a display of all your stitches
that are built in to the machine. Several

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:39.370
quilt stitches of course, buttonholes, so
it's not just a quilting machine it's a sewing

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.209
machine as well. You can make garments and
buttonholes and whatever you make for your

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:50.120
home sewing. The alphabet is built-in on the
other side. Many times people like to enhance

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.379
a quilt by putting somebody's anniversary
date or a birth date on there. That's doable

00:03:54.379 --> 00:04:01.310
as well. The rotary hook again gives it a
very smooth run and your clear bobbin cover.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.450
Because this is a quilting machine it comes
with a loaded accessory box. The accessories

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:13.700
that you need for quilting is the walking
foot, which in this case is built-in. The

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:20.379
1/4" foot. Stipple quilting foot. Are all
included in your accessories. So there's very

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:25.909
little extra that you have to purchase. It
also comes with a table extension so you've

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:28.399
got a larger working area to work on....
