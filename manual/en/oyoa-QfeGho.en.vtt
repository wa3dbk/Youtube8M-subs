00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:16.167
[MUSIC]

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:31.167
I MEAN HORSETAIL FALL IS
AN AMAZING NATURAL PHENOMENON

00:00:31.167 --> 00:00:33.567
IF YOU SEE IT UNDER
THE RIGHT CIRCUMSTANCES,

00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:36.233
WHEN THERE'S ENOUGH WATER,
WHEN THE LIGHT'S RIGHT.

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:44.733
THIS THIN RIBBON OF WATER
JUST GLOWING NEON ORANGE

00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:47.100
WITH THE CLIFF
AND THE SHADE BEHIND IT

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.200
SO IT JUST SEEMS LIKE IT HAS
ITS OWN SORT OF LIGHT

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.200
THAT THERE'S-- THERE'S
NOTHING ELSE CREATING IT.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.433
SO, IT'S REALLY AN AMAZING
AND BEAUTIFUL THING TO SEE.

00:00:57.433 --> 00:00:59.233
YOU KNOW, EVEN IF YOU
DON'T PHOTOGRAPH IT,

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:01.233
JUST STANDING
THERE WATCHING IT

00:01:01.233 --> 00:01:02.900
UNDER THOSE
CIRCUMSTANCES

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.133
IS I THINK A REALLY
COOL THING.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.900
WELL, HORSETAIL FALLS,
I'VE ALWAYS CALLED IT

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.000
"EL CAPITAN" FALL.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.333
IT WAS SOMETHING WE SAW
ON THE SPRING EVERY YEAR.

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:15.767
AND IT WAS WONDERFUL
BUT IT WAS SORT OF

00:01:15.767 --> 00:01:18.767
AN EPHEMERAL
WATERFALL

00:01:18.767 --> 00:01:20.867
THAT IF YOU HAD
A GOOD SNOW YEAR

00:01:20.867 --> 00:01:22.733
AND YOU HAD A LOT
OF WATER AT ONCE

00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:24.500
IT WAS PRETTY SPECTACULAR.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.733
THE EARLIEST PHOTOGRAPH OF
HORSETAIL FALL THAT I KNOW OF

00:01:27.733 --> 00:01:30.167
WAS MADE BY ANSEL ADAMS
SOME TIME IN THE 30s,

00:01:30.167 --> 00:01:31.633
AND IT'S BLACK AND WHITE.

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:35.200
IT'S HARD TO TELL WHETHER
HE OR ANYONE FROM THAT ERA

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.567
KNEW ABOUT, YOU KNOW,
THAT ORANGE COLOR,

00:01:37.567 --> 00:01:39.933
THAT ORANGE GLOW
ON HORSETAIL FALL

00:01:39.933 --> 00:01:41.667
AT THAT CERTAIN TIME
OF THE YEAR.

00:01:41.667 --> 00:01:43.867
EVEN IF ANSEL ADAMS
DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT IT,

00:01:43.867 --> 00:01:46.333
HE PROBABLY DIDN'T CARE
BECAUSE HE WAS PHOTOGRAPHING

00:01:46.333 --> 00:01:48.133
IN BLACK AND WHITE SO,
YOU KNOW, WHAT DOES HE CARE

00:01:48.133 --> 00:01:50.033
ABOUT SOME ORANGE COLOR?

00:01:50.033 --> 00:01:52.067
THIS IS AN ANSEL ADAMS'
PHOTOGRAPH

00:01:52.067 --> 00:01:55.800
OF THE HORSETAIL FALLS
OR EL CAPITAN FALLS

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:57.067
IN A PROFILE VIEW.

00:01:57.067 --> 00:02:00.967
THIS WAS TAKEN AROUND
1952 ACCORDING TO HIS NOTES.

00:02:00.967 --> 00:02:04.500
THE COLOR IS THERE
BUT HIS CAMERA IS ONLY

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.333
GONNA PRODUCE BLACK
AND WHITE IMAGE.

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:08.700
AND HIS EXPOSURE AND HIS
TREATMENT IN THE DARKROOM

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.233
WAS SUCH TO MAKE IT LOOK LIKE
WHAT HE WANTED IT TO BE,

00:02:13.233 --> 00:02:14.767
NOT NECESSARILY
WHAT YOU AND I

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.800
WOULD SEE AT
THAT SAME TIME.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.467
THE FIRST PHOTOGRAPH OF
THAT NEON ORANGE GLOW

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:24.700
ON HORSETAIL FALL
THAT THAT I KNOW OF

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:27.700
OR I THINK ANYONE KNOWS OF
WAS MADE BY GALEN ROWELL,

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.800
VERY FAMOUS PHOTOGRAPHER
IN 1973, I THINK.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.100
AND HE DESCRIBES BEING
HERE IN THE VALLEY,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.500
BEING KIND OF ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF VALLEY

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.233
AND SEEING THAT LIGHT
ON HORSETAIL FALL,

00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:41.967
AND DRIVING AROUND
THE VALLEY,

00:02:41.967 --> 00:02:46.267
EXCEEDING THE SPEED LIMIT TO GET
TO A SPOT AND PHOTOGRAPH IT.

00:02:46.267 --> 00:02:49.533
AND I THINK HIS PHOTOGRAPH
IS STILL ONE OF THE BEST

00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:51.767
THAT I HAVE EVER
SEEN OF IT.

00:02:51.767 --> 00:02:53.200
HI. I AM,
TONY ROWELL.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.900
WE'RE AT THE MOUNTAIN LIGHT
GALLERY IN BISHOP, CALIFORNIA.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.400
WE'RE LOOKING AT MY FATHER,
GALEN ROWELL'S FAMOUS IMAGE

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.767
OF LAST LIGHT
ON HORSETAIL FALL,

00:03:01.767 --> 00:03:03.467
ON EL CAPITAN.

00:03:03.467 --> 00:03:05.833
38 YEARS LATER AFTER
THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE

00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:08.067
HAVE PHOTOGRAPHED
THE FALL,

00:03:08.067 --> 00:03:10.800
I THINK HE WOULD BE FLATTERED
THAT SO MANY PEOPLE

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.333
ARE COMING TO PHOTOGRAPH
THIS RARE PHENOMENON.

00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:21.700
WELL WE'RE HERE BECAUSE WE WANT
TO SEE THE FAMOUS FIRE FALLS

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.600
AND THE--

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.200
I'M HERE BECAUSE
HE WANTS TO SEE IT.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.467
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:25.467 --> 00:03:27.500
I'M THE PHOTOGRAPHER.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.800
WELL YOU DON'T GET
TO SEE THIS IN--

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.300
ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD,
I THINK.

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:34.667
THIS IS THE MOST
SPECIAL WATERFALL,

00:03:34.667 --> 00:03:37.600
GLOWING IN RED,
WHERE DO YOU GET THAT?

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:38.800
YUP.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.767
WELL IT LOOKS
A LITTLE BIT LIKE

00:03:41.767 --> 00:03:45.200
THE OLD FIRE FALL THAT THEY USED
TO HAVE OFF OF GLACIER POINT.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.300
THE FIRE FALL BASICALLY WAS
AROUND FIVE IN THE AFTERNOON.

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.567
THEY WOULD BUILD A BONFIRE,
LIGHT A BONFIRE OF RED FIR BARK

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:55.600
RIGHT ON THE EDGE
OF GLACIER POINT.

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:57.767
AND IT BURNED DOWN AND
USUALLY BY ABOUT 9 O'CLOCK

00:03:57.767 --> 00:03:59.967
IT WAS JUST A PILE
OF RED COALS

00:03:59.967 --> 00:04:02.433
AND THEY HAD
THESE LONG PUSHERS.

00:04:02.433 --> 00:04:05.367
THEY'D OPEN THE LITTLE GATE
AND STARTED PUSHING

00:04:05.367 --> 00:04:08.100
AND THEY TRY TO KEEP
A STEADY FLOW OF THE COALS

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:12.833
GOING OVER THE EDGE UNTIL
ALL THE COALS WERE GONE.

00:04:13.567 --> 00:04:20.500
LET THE FIRE FALL!

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.900
AND THE WAITING FIRE TENDERS
PUSH THE COALS OVER THE BRINK.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.433
SILENTLY THE GLOWING CASCADE
FANS OUT INTO A FIERY CATARACT,

00:04:30.433 --> 00:04:33.500
DRIFTING DOWN IN SLOW
MAJESTIC MOTION.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.500
FOR A FLEETING MOMENT, IT'S
BEAUTY HOLDS YOU SPELLBOUND

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.833
THEN YOU GATHER IT UP AS
YOUR MOST TREASURED MEMORY

00:04:40.833 --> 00:04:45.600
OF YOSEMITE,
VALLEY OF ENCHANTMENT.

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.633
WE'RE HOPING TO CAPTURE THAT
FLEETING MOMENT WHEN NATURE

00:05:04.633 --> 00:05:08.000
KIND OF COMES TOGETHER AND
PRODUCES SOMETHING SPECTACULAR.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.600
I THINK IF THE
SUNLIGHT COOPERATES

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.833
AND THE CLOUDS DON'T
COME IN WE COULD--

00:05:12.833 --> 00:05:15.233
WE COULD HAVE SOMETHING THAT
WILL REALLY BE SPECIAL.

00:05:15.233 --> 00:05:17.600
TRYING TO PHOTOGRAPH
HORSETAIL FALL GIVES YOU

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.067
AN APPRECIATION FOR
THE MOVEMENT OF THE SUN,

00:05:21.067 --> 00:05:23.700
YOU KNOW, THE CHANGING ANGLES
OF THE SUN DURING THE YEAR,

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:26.200
YOU KNOW, THE CHANGING
WATER FLOW FROM THE SNOW PACK

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.000
AND THE TEMPERATURE.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.167
IT ONLY OCCURS IN FEBRUARY
FOR A 2-WEEK PERIOD

00:05:32.167 --> 00:05:34.933
AND DOESN'T OCCUR
EVERY SINGLE YEAR.

00:05:34.933 --> 00:05:37.433
IT DEPENDS ON
IF THERE'S WATER FLOWING,

00:05:37.433 --> 00:05:39.700
IF YOU'VE GOT
A NICE CLEAR SKY.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:42.067
IF YOU HAVE ANY CLOUDS
OR ANY FOG,

00:05:42.067 --> 00:05:43.733
YOU WON'T GET THIS.

00:05:43.733 --> 00:05:46.933
SO, YOU MAY MISS IT
FOR YEARS, IT MAY NOT OCCUR.

00:05:46.933 --> 00:05:50.500
THAT'S ONE THING IN PHOTOGRAPHY,
YOU LEARN MORE ABOUT WEATHER

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:53.433
THAN ANYTHING ELSE
AND JUST LOOKING AT THIS.

00:05:53.433 --> 00:05:56.833
I'M HOPING THAT IT DOESN'T,
YOU KNOW, GET ANYMORE OCCLUDED,

00:05:56.833 --> 00:06:00.133
ANYMORE TIGHT BETWEEN
THOSE CIRRUS CLOUD.

00:06:00.133 --> 00:06:04.600
AS THE SUN STARTING TO SET,
THE SHADOWS WILL RUN ACROSS

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.933
THE FACE OF EL CAPITAN.

00:06:06.933 --> 00:06:09.733
THAT LIGHT SOURCE
WILL START TO SHRINK IN

00:06:09.733 --> 00:06:12.767
AND JUST HIT THE FIRE FALL
OR HIT THE WATERFALL

00:06:12.767 --> 00:06:16.700
AND CAUSE THE WATER TO GLOW,
YELLOW, ORANGE, RED.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.633
MAKES IT LOOK LIKE LAVA.

00:06:18.633 --> 00:06:21.367
THAT MAKES THE PICTURE
VERY SPECIAL,

00:06:21.367 --> 00:06:23.367
IF YOU CAN TAKE
A GOOD PICTURE,

00:06:23.367 --> 00:06:25.833
BECAUSE IT HAS NOTHING
TO DO WITH YOUR TECHNIQUE

00:06:25.833 --> 00:06:28.533
OR WITH ANYTHING,
IT'S JUST--

00:06:30.667 --> 00:06:33.767
AH, WELL, THE LUCK.

00:06:33.767 --> 00:06:38.533
YOU SIT HERE AND YOU WATCH THIS
GRAY AND SILVER AND WHITE

00:06:38.533 --> 00:06:42.667
AND PRETTY SOON
A LITTLE PINK COMES UP.

00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:45.633
AND THEN IT GETS
REDDER AND REDDER.

00:06:45.633 --> 00:06:47.500
IT LIGHTS UP LIKE--

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.000
LIKE SOMEONE PUT
MAKEUP ON IT.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.167
I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY THERE'S
THE PHOTOGRAPHY ASPECT,

00:06:52.167 --> 00:06:53.867
AND THEN THERE'S PEOPLE
WHO LIKE YOSEMITE.

00:06:53.867 --> 00:06:55.567
AND IF YOU HAPPEN
TO LIKE BOTH OF THINGS

00:06:55.567 --> 00:06:59.233
THEN THAT'S PROBABLY WHY YOU
WANT TO KEEP TRYING TO COMEBACK.

00:06:59.233 --> 00:07:01.933
I'M SURE MANY OF THESE PEOPLE
HAVE COME EVERY YEAR,

00:07:01.933 --> 00:07:03.867
THEY DON'T JUST
COME ONCE.

00:07:03.867 --> 00:07:07.567
NO MATTER WHAT YOUR
LEVEL OF EXPERTISE IS,

00:07:07.567 --> 00:07:11.000
YOU'RE GONNA GO HOME WITH
PICTURES THAT YOU'RE GONNA LOVE

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.967
BECAUSE IT'S HARD TO TAKE
A PICTURE OF YOSEMITE

00:07:12.967 --> 00:07:14.167
THAT ISN'T GREAT.

00:07:14.167 --> 00:07:16.500
PHOTOGRAPHY IS PROBABLY
AN EXCUSE TO COME OUT HERE,

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.100
SEE THE SIGHTS,

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:20.967
A GOOD EXCUSE TO COME
UP HERE AND SPEND SOME TIME.

00:07:20.967 --> 00:07:24.333
YOU CAN'T GO ANYWHERE WITHOUT
GETTING SOMETHING SPECIAL.

00:07:24.333 --> 00:07:26.433
EVERYTHING HERE
IS SPECIAL.

00:07:26.433 --> 00:07:29.967
EVERYTHING FROM THE AIR
YOU BREATHE TO SUNRISE,

00:07:29.967 --> 00:07:33.333
THE SUNSETS, THE FOG
IN THE VALLEY,

00:07:33.333 --> 00:07:35.167
IT JUST GOES
ON AND ON.

00:07:37.633 --> 00:07:39.500
I DON'T KNOW, IT'S JUST
BREATHTAKING TO ME.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:41.400
IT'S JUST BREATHTAKING.
I THINK THAT'S IT.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.633
THERE'S ALWAYS
ANOTHER PHOTO,

00:07:43.633 --> 00:07:45.300
THERE'S ALWAYS
ANOTHER EXPERIENCE

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.267
IN THE EXACT SAME
SPOT YOU'RE AT.

00:07:47.267 --> 00:07:48.733
SO, YOU JUST NEED
TO BE OPEN

00:07:48.733 --> 00:07:51.400
AND IT JUST KEEPS GIVING
GIFT AFTER GIFT AFTER GIFT.
