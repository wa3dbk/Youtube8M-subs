00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:15.600
What's up guys?

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.170
Now I'm here to show you guys how to finish
your story, all right?

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.529
This is like in Top Rock, beginning of your
story, we're gonna end it.

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.410
End the sentence with a period, question mark,
exclamation mark, whatever.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.140
How we end our stories with a freeze.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:30.140
All right?

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.570
So, we're gonna go elaborate on these freezes,
we're going to go into a baby freeze into

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.710
a shoulder freeze.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.090
All right?

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.230
It's very important you go down up and down
levels, if you just stay stationary within

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.210
one level, after a while it gets boring.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.050
You wanna grab everybody's attention and plus
challenge yourself by going up and down levels.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.780
So right now we're going to go from a baby
into our shoulder, all right?

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.230
Watch the levels.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.690
Check it out.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:05.150
We're going into regular baby and from here
what we're going to do, since we're like that

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:10.490
and I'm on my right arm, right elbow, I'm
going slide boom, like this.

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:11.950
Like that all right?

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.890
Remember, shoulder freeze is like this, so
you're here, I want to slide like that.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:23.610
Check it out, I move my hands here, and what
I do with this hand, my left hand, I'm going

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.710
to slide onto my shoulder like this.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.032
The same time my hips are gonna go up.

00:01:31.032 --> 00:01:33.430
I'm gonna put the weight onto my right elbow.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.680
Onto my shoulder, like that.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.110
Here, up.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:56.840
Back down, switch to the other side, same
thing on the other side.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.950
Boom.
