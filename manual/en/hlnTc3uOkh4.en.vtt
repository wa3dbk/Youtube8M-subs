00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.923
(Simon and Martina are going to...

00:00:03.923 --> 00:00:07.997
(Upbeat OpenTheHappy Music)

00:00:07.997 --> 00:00:10.961
Open The Happy!)

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:14.107
So, our door bell rang today, and we got this package 
 at the door,  (The giant ZE:A Limited Edition CD!)

00:00:14.107 --> 00:00:16.781
And we were like, Wow! This is pretty gigantic. What could this 
 possibly be for?   (Sunglasses + CD = Awesome) 

00:00:16.781 --> 00:00:21.981
We opened it up, and it turns out we got 
 like some small ZE:A Special Edition CDs, 

00:00:21.981 --> 00:00:26.839
and by small I mean like... (Dinosaur roars) ridiculously gigantic. 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.454
Ok, guys. We have got to show you what's inside of 
 these CDs that we are going to give away.

00:00:30.454 --> 00:00:32.080
These are absolutely insane.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.371
[S] It's a special one for Martina.    (Yeahhh!!!)

00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:36.990
(Martina sings) A special one for Martina! (Twinkling sound)

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:40.568
[M] Ok, so open this up. This is actually like... 

00:00:40.568 --> 00:00:43.671
can you see that picture there? It's a winmeal? 

00:00:43.687 --> 00:00:47.085
[S] What's a winmeal? You mean windmill. (Martina's 
 high pitched voice) That is so sick!

00:00:47.085 --> 00:00:54.229
Uhhhh. I also have my own pair of ZE:A sunglasses, 
 or (Che-ah) should I say? (English vs. Korean pronounciation)

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:59.379
[S] I guess you can say, these are 
 cool glasses. [Both] (Dramatic Dun nuuuuhhhh) Yay-yuh!

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.784
[M] We got a book that has pictures and 
 autographs and stuff on it. [S] Uh-huh.

00:01:03.784 --> 00:01:10.107
[M] Then we got the second album Limited Edition, I 
 guess this is a photobook. (Try booklet.) [S] Uh-huh.

00:01:10.148 --> 00:01:12.404
[M] You can see inside of it. I'm not 
 going to show very much though 

00:01:12.404 --> 00:01:14.583
because it should be a special edition for those who won it.

00:01:15.084 --> 00:01:21.631
[S] Uh-huh. [M] And then, we got the signed/autographed CD as well.

00:01:21.631 --> 00:01:28.172
That's pretty insane. [S] I have never seen CDs 
 like that before from any artist ever.

00:01:28.172 --> 00:01:30.359
[M] Maybe because we've never done Limited Edition CDs?

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:34.334
[S] Is this what Limited CDs are usually like? 
 Because this is a huge box.  

00:01:34.334 --> 00:01:36.634
[M] Although...you know what we've never shown people? [S] What?

00:01:36.634 --> 00:01:39.773
[M] Our signed Big Bang and 2NE1 CDs. [S] Oh, right. But 
 those are especially for us. [M] Those are special for us.

00:01:41.103 --> 00:01:46.000
(Martina laughs) [M] Can't give those away, I just, I have them and you 
 can see that the writing, if you touch it, it can smudge off.

00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:50.490
And I'm like, I'll just keep them wrapped up in some, 
 some paper and leave them there to stare at.

00:01:50.487 --> 00:01:54.870
But, whoa people, whoa.  [S] Anyhow, this is 
 what we're giving away for the giveaway.

00:01:54.873 --> 00:02:00.600
You have until Monday to participate and get yourself a cool pair 
 of shades. [M] So, it's going to be congratulations 

00:02:00.602 --> 00:02:05.540
to whoever receives this. Expect it to take a long time to 
 show up in the mail because this thing is huge.

00:02:05.536 --> 00:02:11.740
Yes. [S] And very heavy, it's gonna cost us a lot 
 of money to ship to you guys. [A] Awwww. Hhmmmm.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:17.590
(Watermelon Holders- So Brilliant) or
(Our interview with ZE:A- Win those CDs)

00:02:17.593 --> 00:02:21.780
Thanks for watching Simon and Martina on Open The Happy! (Upbeat OpenTheHappy music)
