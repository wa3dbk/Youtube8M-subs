00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:05.979
In this video, we'll look at how to
operate the manual climate control

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:06.740
system.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.900
Remember, for all these functions to work
properly,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.980
the engine must be running.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.320
The control panel is equipped with three
large controls:

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.650
the temperature control dial, the blower
speed selection dial,

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.610
and the mode selection dial.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.160
Let's start with the temperature control
dial. Turn the temperature control dial

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.090
clockwise for warmer air

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.460
and counterclockwise for cooler air.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.570
In the middle of the dial is the air
selection switch.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.510
You can choose outside air or
recirculate the air that's in the cabin

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:46.769
choosing recirculated air is useful to
prevent

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:50.789
unpleasant odors such as diesel exhaust
from entering the vehicle.

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.159
Closing the door blocks outside air flow.

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.780
This indicator lights up when
recirculated air is selected.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.120
You may have to switch back to outside
air if the windows start to fog. 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.780
Turning the temperature dial all the way
to the left

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.020
engages max AC mode. The compressor will
come on

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.899
and the recirculation door position will
be selected automatically.

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.100
Setting the dial to any other position

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.600
automatically selects outside air.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.740
Now let's check out the blower speed
control. Turn the blower speed control to

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:27.370
the right

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.910
to increase the blower speed. Turn it to
the left

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.860
to decrease the blower speed. Turning the
control

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.120
all the way to the left turns the blower
off. Because air can  enter the cabin through

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:42.560
the open outside recirculation door,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.550
a small amount of airflow can be felt
even with the blower off. 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.800
Push the switch in the center of the
dial to turn air conditioning

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.780
on and off. A sound is made whenever you
press the switch.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.740
Now let's look at the mode selection
dial. This dial changes the location

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:07.590
and amount of air flowing from the vents, as well as controlling the front and

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:08.879
rear defrosters. 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.280
This is the face position. 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:16.730
Air flows only to the panel registers.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.870
In this position,

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.079
air flows to the panel registers and to
the floor area.

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:26.220
In this position,

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.770
air flows only to the floor area.

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.540
Here,

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:33.800
air flows to the floor 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:38.799
area as well as the windshield and the
door windows.

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.580
In the defrost position,

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.130
air flows to the windshield and the door
windows.

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.849
Push the switch in the center of the
dial to defog the rear window.

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:54.450
When selected, the light comes on. The defogger and light

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.670
automatically turn off after twenty
minutes. Remember that defroster

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.130
performance is improved

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:04.210
if the inside glass surfaces clean.

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:08.070
Here are a few suggestions so you can
get the most out of your climate control

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.780
system.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:13.430
For quick defrosting set the mode dial
to the defrost position,

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.959
set the blower speed to the maximum
position,

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:22.570
and set the temperature to the highest
position. 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:26.130
For quick cooling, set the mode dial to
the face position,

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.330
the temperature dial to the max AC
position,

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.600
and the blower speed to the highest
position. 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.520
For quick heating, select the highest
temperature, 

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.210
select outside air, place the mode dial
in the floor position,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.250
and place the blower speed dial in the
full position.
