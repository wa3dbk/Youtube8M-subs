00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Scalesia affinis is an endemic plant that is distributed throughout the various islands.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Nevertheless, here in Santa Cruz ,Scalesia affinis is an endangered species.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Of course, endangered is a word that often bandied about, but this really is an alarming problem. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
In Santa Cruz are the last remaining 70 specimens that are 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
restricted to just the area of El Mirador.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Today, we are going to sow an endemic species of Santa Cruz. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
an endangered species, Scalesia affinis, also known as Lechoso 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
To protect this Scalesia, a few years ago, thanks to the help

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
of the Charles Darwin foundation and the Galapagos national park, 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
the construction of this fence began so as to protect the remainder of 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
this plant population that is endemic to the island.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
In this way, we want, with the help of Waterboxx technology, 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
to improve the restoration of this symbolic species on the island of Santa Cruz 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and in turn we want the plant that we are going to sow within this 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
protected area in the town of Puerto Ayora to become the symbol of our 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Waterboxx ecological restoration project

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Right, I惴 going to explain to you basically how sowing with Waterboxx  works.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Firstly, we look for land that is clear, without any large plants on it.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
When we find the right land, we start digging a small hole

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
We try to impede capillary action as much as possible so that there is no competition  

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
with the roots for water and place the box facing north to south so that at the hottest time of the day.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
so the sun does not strike the plant.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The box has been designed specifically for this purpose and afterwards we proceed with planting.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Everything is covered, and perfectly sealed so that no humidity is lost 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
and then the correct amount of water necessary for retaining the humidity is added. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The wick supplies the necessary amount of daily water to the plant.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Then, this can be complemented by placing rocks on the outside.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Afterwards, it is important to clear the area a little  

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.000
of roots and nearby plants so that they do not compete for humidity.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Waterboxx technology is very interesting and is not very difficult to understand. 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.000
This means that anyone with training can follow the steps and procedures necessary  

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
to sow the plant perfectly.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Everyone can use it, it can be used extensively, it愀 not complicated and it is not hard  

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.000
For it to be used in land like this which is an arid area.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
The Waterboxx project in the Galapagos islands is an extremely important challenge. Why?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Because in the Galapagos what we want is to save water.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Waterboxx can also be used to restore natural habitats.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and one of the plants that is also incorporated into the Waterboxx project  

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.066
Is logically Scalesia Affinis which we are currently testing in Santa Cruz.
