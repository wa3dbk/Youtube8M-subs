00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:04.340
Yes, this video is going to be showing you how to use the Alienware Respawn USB

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.980
that I showed you guys how to setup in a
previous video

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.870
So please do check out my other video if you dont know how to create this USB

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:15.039
and that video shows you step by step how to create it

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:19.130
now what this USB will allow you to do is, recover your computer back to the

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.589
factory condition that you received in

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:27.579
you could also use the same USB to copy those setting onto a completey new

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:32.789
hard drive for instance, I created a
copy from a normal harddrive and then

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:37.960
I used this USB to recreate that image on a Solid-State drive

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.190
so what you want to do is insert the AlienRespawn USB into the drive

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.890
and power up your laptop. Youll see once the BIOS loads, Respawn begins.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.320
and youll end up at this screen. It gives you two options. The one you want to select is

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:52.240
restore my computer

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.780
and just press next

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.190
say here youll find a full list of backup
images on the USB. All you have to do is

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.319
make a selection, click and thats it just
click next

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:03.889
you'll then recieve a prompt telling
you that your hard drive going to be

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:07.590
reformatted. Since i'm using a new hard
drive for this video it makes no

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.790
difference just click yes

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:15.790
and continue. Youll see this next
bit takes about twenty to thirty minutes

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.240
and then once it's complete just press
Restart

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.350
and the new hard drive will boot to the
same settiings as the one that you copied

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.100
it from

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.820
it doesn't matter if your using a normal
harddrive or solid-state drive, in fact

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.050
that's exactly what i've done here. Ive copied from a 500GB

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:34.110
hard drive

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.490
to a 120GB Solid-State drive

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.570
it makes no difference. so you can see
that Windows then begins to load as if

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:43.619
it's the first time you've ever used it

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.759
for those out there that are abit unfamiliar with this, its just things like setting your

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:48.640
location, time and keyboard

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.250
click next

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.649
then you have to give yourself a
username

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.210
and your computer an ID and you can
also set a password, since i dont watch any

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.159
porn I dont need a password on my computer so i'll just click next

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:03.800
and then accept the Windows licence terms

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.020
the screen after this allows you to choose your Windows update settings

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:08.869
Im going to sort that out later

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.219
and then you have to set a timezone

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:13.219
for now Im just gonna click next

00:02:13.219 --> 00:02:15.740
and it might ask you to set your wireless network

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:19.560
i'm just gonna skip all that and then windows restarts

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.319
and after a while you come to this screen asking you to choose your Dell update options

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.749
that all seems abit long to me so Im going to deselect that and click finish

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:29.049
and there you have it

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:31.199
Ive just set up this computer

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:33.570
on the same things as when i received it

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.829
using a brand new hard drive

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:39.439
for those people that are using this video to setup a solid-state drive on this

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:40.489
machine

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:43.940
you can check out my previous video showing you how to install the Harddrive

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.740
into your computer or my next video which
is going to be about flashing the BIOS

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.870
because some of the Alienware BIOS cap the transfer speed of your hard drive

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:57.189
for instance this hard drive that I put in here
is a Sata3 SSD and it won't be running

00:02:57.189 --> 00:02:59.629
at Sata 3 speeds just yet

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.529
so check those out and let me know what you
think

00:03:02.529 --> 00:03:02.979
Ok, bye
