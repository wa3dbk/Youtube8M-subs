00:00:15.103 --> 00:00:22.790
Mercedes uses plug-in hybrid tech for 10 models over the next few years.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:31.876
We already know the S 500 e and this is the C 350 e. A very important car.

00:00:32.791 --> 00:00:39.702
Thanks to its hybrid tech, it's eligible for big tax benefits.

00:00:41.354 --> 00:00:52.370
Few cars are like it: the Mitsubishi Outlander, the Volvo V60.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:01:01.065
VW has the Passat GTE soon and BMW works on a 3 Series.

00:01:01.065 --> 00:01:03.269
And now this C Class. 

00:01:05.211 --> 00:01:15.465
Interesting on paper, but not cheap: it starts at 58000 euros.

00:01:15.465 --> 00:01:21.776
The estate is 2000 more. Which is still a lot for a car.

00:01:23.634 --> 00:01:34.633
Still, this Lease Edition is well-equipped: air suspension for a nice ride.

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:44.766
Leather, satnav, climate control - the lot. Value for money.

00:01:44.766 --> 00:01:51.640
Also, the tax benefits make it worth your while.

00:02:00.144 --> 00:02:06.809
On to the tech: it's a petrol hybrid, unlike the Volvo.

00:02:06.809 --> 00:02:16.387
There's a 2.0 turbo petrol engine with 211 PS and a 7 G-Tronic 'box.

00:02:16.387 --> 00:02:29.967
The 60 kW electric motor is built inside that 'box - 279 PS in total.

00:02:29.967 --> 00:02:40.755
Also, 600 Nm. So 0-100 kph goes in 5.9 seconds. Nice performance!

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:56.292
It can only drive 31 km on electric power, what a disgrace.

00:02:56.292 --> 00:03:11.129
Yet in China, there are extra benefits for cars to exceed 30 km.

00:03:11.878 --> 00:03:29.266
Yeah. My commute is 50 km, so I can't even do that on electric power.

00:03:29.841 --> 00:03:39.331
Still, the hybrid system works nicely - Mercedes knows how to do that.

00:03:39.331 --> 00:03:50.000
It's more refined than the V60 and doesn't vibrate much.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:04:00.381
The G-Tronic is not smoother than Lexus' CVT, mind you.

00:04:06.425 --> 00:04:12.120
The C Class should use 2,1 liters of fuel for each 100 km's.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:21.211
In practice, it's far more. But the car does help you to drive economically.

00:04:21.211 --> 00:04:41.843
The satnav plans on which roads electric power can be used the best.

00:04:41.843 --> 00:04:54.763
Also, there's a 'haptic throttle' - like BMW has on the ActiveHybrid 5 series.

00:04:54.763 --> 00:05:17.379
The radar monitors the cars in front and sends you a signal when they slow down.

00:05:17.487 --> 00:05:25.387
That way it teaches you how to drive using less fuel. It works fairly well.

00:05:30.461 --> 00:05:45.279
Is that the essence of this car? No. But it shows hybrid cars can be great.

00:05:49.892 --> 00:06:00.981
Still, it's less practical. The batteries are in the rear so the boot is compromised.

00:06:00.981 --> 00:06:09.902
That's 135 liters gone! Still, you can drop the rear seats.

00:06:09.902 --> 00:06:18.143
Estate fans: you can't get a hitch without losing maximum tax benefits.

00:06:18.143 --> 00:06:28.479
As then it needs different rear tires which increase emissions.

00:06:28.479 --> 00:06:41.488
So there are some niggles, but it's a great car overall. You're lucky to get it.

00:06:42.514 --> 00:06:44.410
+ Smooth drivetrain and handling; tax benefits

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:47.792
- The hitch issue; poor EV range
