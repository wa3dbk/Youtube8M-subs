[MUSIC CONTINUES]

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:21.000
&gt;&gt;BEN OPPENHEIMER: Several years ago,
Neil Tyson, myself, Mordecai and 
Mike Shara all sat down and said,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.410
"Well, what are we going to do for the next space
show?" well, and I had the idea of doing one

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.529
on stars, and I remember Neil said, "well,
you can't do one on stars. It's just gonna

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:42.640
be a bunch of balls of gas floating around
or nothing interesting to look at."

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:49.559
&gt;&gt;LIKA GUHATHAKURTA: I had to start off really with what would it be like to tell the story 
of the birth and death

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:56.449
of a star with all the rich visuals we have
from different NASA missions.

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:03.449
&gt;&gt;OPPENHEIMER: It's really the closest you can come to a solid combination of science and art.

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.369
And that has always been something that I've loved.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.520
What is unique about our space shows is that the scientists are involved from the very beginning,

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:23.090
all the way through to the end. Every step of the production process involves us.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:28.240
&gt;&gt;MORDECAI-MARK MAC LOW: We went
out and Ben and I identified which of our

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:32.500
colleagues was doing the best work in each
area that we wanted to cover, and then we

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.579
went and said, "look, if you bring models
to the table, can you bring observations to

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:44.240
the table that will allow us to tell the story
using the best, most current understanding that we have?"

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.460
&gt;&gt;OPPENHEIMER: We have data represented in
the show from roughly forty different scientific

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.090
research groups around the world. If you count
all of the people who were involved in making

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:02.549
that, it's easily three or four times that
number, so, you're talking about at least

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:13.410
a hundred, or even more scientists from around
the world. NASA has a real interest in educational

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:21.930
outreach and public education. And so, we
were, we managed to find this common interest,

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.930
Dick and Lika work in the helio-physics division
and of course, a lot of the science here,

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.040
we're talking about stars, the most important
star to us is the sun. It deals directly with

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.480
the science that they do.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:38.340
&gt;&gt;GUHATHAKURTA: Helio-physics is
the domain or the sphere of influence of the

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:45.420
sun. And the sphere of influence of the sun
goes way beyond the sun. It starts at the

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:53.560
very core of the sun and touches where the
sun rains over the medium, interplanetary

00:02:53.560 --> 00:03:01.629
medium ends, which is just before the interstellar
medium, the medium of the Milky Way Galaxy,

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:09.340
begins. People are familiar with the night
sky, and stars, and galaxies, and Zodiac signs.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:15.010
People are less familiar with the inner workings
of stars, and what helio-physics brought into

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:22.140
this show is that you are able to actually
see a star up close, see its inner-workings,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:37.400
both with real observations and simulations.
And I think that's pretty profound.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:42.080
&gt;&gt;MAC LOW: One of the most difficult
problems in astronomy is determining

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.970
the distance to objects. And that's

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.549
been an extremely active field of research
for more than a century. But we've already

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:55.790
gotten a long, long way, because we can determine
the distance to stars out to hundreds of light

00:03:55.790 --> 00:04:04.069
years using satellite telescopes and just
noticing how far they shift against the background,

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.579
we can determine the distance to distance
galaxies by how fast they're moving away from us.

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.319
&gt;&gt;OPPENHEIMER: All of our ideas are models, 
and we attempt to get them as close to

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:14.370
reality as possible.

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:19.049
So in the first scene where you're seeing
the birth of the first stars, you're seeing

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:24.820
our best conception of what happened there,
and this is based on the theoretical models

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.300
of how these early stars formed.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.020
&gt;&gt;MAC LOW: We want people to look at the night sky with new eyes, to

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:36.690
look up at the stars and also at the sun,
with a deeper understanding of what they're

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.510
looking at. A deeper view of the sky.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:44.100
&gt;&gt;GUHATHAKURTA: We have
created some shows that really will change

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.280
anyone who watches those shows their view,
of the cosmos, the view of the relationship

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:54.080
of our star with our planet, other planets,
and general, what are stars?

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.310
&gt;&gt;OPPENHEIMER: At the very least,

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:59.710
I hope people will go in there and the next
time they, you know, after they come out,

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.580
the next time they look at the night sky they'll
see it a little bit differently.
