00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.380

This is a wonderful, green juice

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.820
juices from wheat germ

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.040
should be prepared when the size of sprouts

reaching a ten
twelve centimeters

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.860
I visually show you today

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.670
then it was

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.060
see ...

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.020
I do not know whether you can see?

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:07.950
sprouts cut off at the root

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.330
because it contains

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.000
the most useful
substances

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.580
as low as possible, as soon as possible.
Most interestingly,

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.790
apart from wheat germ from here that "mats"

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:19.780
great

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.710
facials obtained

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.479
you in any beauty salon this will not do :)

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.219
cut ...

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:28.430
I will show you all the wonderful "flower bed"

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.980
we have grown up in the home

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.750
it really is possible to do

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.750
how to do it, we will show the next time

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:41.840
In the meantime, see what will happen next

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.810
add a little more ...

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.880
and you can start [a juicer included] 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.260
Juice we do, of course, on the auger juicer

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.130
all now can see

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:56.890
cake

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.090
completely dry, extruded

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.979
say that again
this is only possible

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.230
on auger juicer

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:09.050
that's what
we got

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.859
the fact that we have grown

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:14.579
juice from wheat germ

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:18.129
It does not need to consume a lot!

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:21.469
it should start to drink with 30 grams

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:23.489
then - 60

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.989
and the maximum consumption of
product - 120 grams of juice per day

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.019
You can mix it with apple or

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.129
with carrots

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:33.769
then it will be tastier

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.780
the usefulness of juice is preserved only highlights

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:40.830
if you are young and healthy

00:02:42.289 --> 00:02:44.979
then the juice you need to drink, too,

00:02:44.979 --> 00:02:47.579
if there are problems with the gastrointestinal
intestinal tract - also

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.869
if you want to boost immunity

00:02:49.869 --> 00:02:51.499
it is the same
great

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:54.359
natural remedy

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.459
