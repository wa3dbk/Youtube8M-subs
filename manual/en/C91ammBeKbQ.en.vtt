00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.019
My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village and I am making tomato soup. Now you

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:11.549
have got a couple of options at this point;
one you could serve it as is if you wanted

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:17.160
a rustic, traditional very, very rough soup
like something you would have maybe back in

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.160
the Middle Ages, or even later. Also this
would make a really great soup if you were

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.570
doing like a stew base. But what I am going
to do today is I am going to actually puree

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:30.730
this for a little more modern version. I am
also going to put a little more salt and pepper

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:42.220
in here real quick. All right and since I
am going to puree this, I am going to turn

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.170
the heat all the way off on this because I
am not going to need it at this point. I have

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.560
just got a little hand blender here, a pretty
simple thing you can buy these at pretty much

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.610
any store and what I might want to do is I
am going to take a towel because I don’t

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:59.780
want this to go all over the place and make
a huge mess. I’ll put it over, make sure

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.930
that your burner is off when you do this because
otherwise you will catch your towel on fire,

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.710
but I put it over a large part of that, I
am going to put the mixer on the open part

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.640
and this way I don’t make a giant splatterly
mess when I do this, or I do but it just stays

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:20.049
inside the towel. What I’ll do at first
is I will just do a series of pulses, as opposed

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:23.670
to just cranking it up to high and letting
it go because this will actually get some

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:39.009
of the big chunks out of the way. And then
I am going to puree away, you don’t want

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:46.020
to keep it in one spot because then you won’t
necessarily get all the chunks out of it and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.469
also you don’t want to just leave it sitting
on the bottom because then you won’t pull

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:53.920
all of the chunks into it either, all right
so that appears to be pretty well done and

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.020
see how you can see at the bottom of the towel
how much of a mess I saved myself from making.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.179
So we will set that over there, that is very
hot and so this looks pretty well pureed I

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:09.170
am going to go ahead and set this on the bottom
of the pan, in the bottom and turn it on now

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:26.870
just so I can make sure that I get anything
that is left in the bottom. All right, so

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:35.700
we are pretty near done at this point, I am
just going to scrap all the soup off of that,

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.440
I’ll set this aside and you will see me
going back to scraping the sides of the pot

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.839
like I said that is just reduced down soup,
but most of all that is just flavor.
