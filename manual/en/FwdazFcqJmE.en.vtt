00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.833
This video shows the many functions of the ATIS diagnostic software available at tiepie automotive.

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:18.299
When atis is started the following options are available: Scope, to access all measurements, Brands for brand specific

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:27.000
information and measurements, Help, for an ATIS guide, and Scope options to view the available options for the scope.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:33.666
This view is a categorized overview of all the available labscope measurements.

00:00:34.166 --> 00:00:41.932
It lists all petrol and diesel engine related measurements, the compression test, engine power measurement,

00:00:41.933 --> 00:00:46.899
current measurements and measurements with the scope options.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:48.666
and various other measurements.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:56.300
In the EMS petrol section, a choice can be made between sensor measurements and actuator measurements.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.500
In the sensors section, all available sensor measurements for petrol engines are categorized.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:09.566
Selecting the engine torque sensors category shows all intake related sensors.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:16.666
Selecting MAP sensor opens a page that gives access to all information on the MAP sensor.

00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:22.633
This dialog describes the operation and signal values of a MAP sensor.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.533
Clicking the connection button opens a dialog explaing how to connect the automotive labscope to the MAP sensor.

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:38.899
The information button displays additional measurement information, describing the measurement conditions.

00:01:40.233 --> 00:01:46.266
Clicking the Measurement button opens the Multi Channel oscilloscope software to measure a MAP sensor signal,

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:48.232
with the automotive labscope.

00:01:48.466 --> 00:01:53.032
The labscope and the measurement software are automatically setup properly to measure a 

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:59.066
MAP sensor signal and a known good example signal is loaded to compare the measured signal with.

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:09.399
The Diagnostic info button displays diagnostic information that helps determining whether the MAP sensor is defective or not.

00:02:10.266 --> 00:02:18.266
Two additional measurements are available for the MAP sensor: a continuous measurement and a power supply measurement.

00:02:18.566 --> 00:02:22.366
Depending on the component, different measurements can be available. 

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:26.600
Now let's perform this measurement on a VW Polo.

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:31.632
Click the Search button for brand specific information and measurements.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.566
Select the brand of the car that needs to be measured.

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:38.433
And select the correct model.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.766
A more detailed search can be performed by also selecting fuel type, .... Motor management system and engine code.

00:02:49.033 --> 00:02:54.566
The engine code button displays photographs of possible engine code locations.

00:02:57.866 --> 00:03:01.799
Using the engine code, the correct systems can be found.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.966
The search button diplays a list of available systems that can be measured.

00:03:10.866 --> 00:03:18.466
Selecting the correct motor management system displays a schematic diagram of the system with a list of available components.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:26.533
If the ECU has presented a fault code, it can be entered in ATIS to determine its meaning and possible causes.

00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:34.633
A fault description is displayed, as well as a schematic representation with symbols for the possible causes.

00:03:34.933 --> 00:03:39.799
The Symbols explanation button displays the meaning of the used symbols.

00:03:43.833 --> 00:03:48.933
The photographs on the location tab can help locating the Mass Air Flow sensor.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.266
The air mass sensor is found in the second diagram.

00:03:57.533 --> 00:04:00.966
Its entry in the list gives access to the measurements.

00:04:02.833 --> 00:04:04.499
All measurements are shown.

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:11.866
Connect the labscope to the MAF sensor as indicated and click the measure button to perform a measurement.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:17.366
When the Multi Channel measurement software is opened and the settings are loaded,

00:04:17.633 --> 00:04:21.133
 start a measurement by pressing the 'S' key.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.766
The signal will appear on the screen.

00:04:23.966 --> 00:04:30.466
Now start the engine and follow the measurement instructions given on the measurement information page.

00:04:48.733 --> 00:04:52.733
The measurement is ready and the signal can be analyzed.

00:04:55.366 --> 00:05:00.666
