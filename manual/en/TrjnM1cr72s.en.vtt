00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:19.160
When Australia separated from Gondwana ages ago, its animal species were isolated from the rest of the world. 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:24.080
Not quite all of them, though. Birds could still fly between the land masses. 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.880
Giant birds called moas developed in these jungles where food was abundant and there were few predators. 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:37.080
Some of them weighed as much as 550 pounds. 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:43.320
This is a distant relative of those birds.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.480
 This brush-turkey, or pouched talegalla, is hard at work.

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.400
A kangaroo is watching him, but the bird is too busy to notice. 

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.000
These Australian turkeys are anything but lazy.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.920
The talegalla is polygamous and has to provide a place for his females to lay their eggs.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.400
 He’s building a very unusual nest.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.040
The turkey gathers together leaves and other plant materials to build his love nest

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:35.240
That’s a nest? Yes it is, and some may weigh as much as four tons. 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.400
That turkey’s got himself quite a job to do

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.000
It works like this: The turkey gathers all the leaves he can. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.120
Then a fungus grows among them and they decompose. 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:55.600
This process of decomposition produces heat, which turns the nest into a real incubator.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:03.480
the incubator always has to be between 30 and 35 degrees Celsius.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.840
to take the temperature of the nest the turkey has a thermometer in his tongue or in his beak we don´t really know.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.160
And here he is, deep-sea diving in a sea of leaves

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.120
all in the name of reproduction. 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.360
A very original system. 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:32.400
After a few go-rounds, scientists have decided that evolutionarily speaking,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:41.000
 these turkeys are very close relatives of the reptiles since only these birds and reptiles use this system of heated nests. 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.680
 It’s a curious case, but whatever it takes to reproduce.
