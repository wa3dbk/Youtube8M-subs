00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.350
What's up, y'all?

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.700
My name is Dila Lopez.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.540
We are Death's Sea Crew and we are going to
show you how to do Diversity's Transformer.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.160
So first you have to pick eight friends.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.070
You need at least eight people to do this.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.470
The head of the team is going to be in the
front.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:41.660
At the front of the arrow.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.460
You're going to have Vive, or whoever you
want to the left.

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:46.830
Michael is to my right.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.870
Ester just over his right shoulder.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.500
And Sierra and Charlie are just over their
shoulders.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.390
And you need somebody directly behind you
who can do a handstand.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.570
And another person behind you who has strong
abs.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.430
So here we go.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.830
First thing is four heartbeats.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.740
It goes five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.050
Boom, boom.

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.360
Boom, boom.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.670
Boom, boom.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:11.980
Boom, boom.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.460
And then Michael and Vive are going to transform
first.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.270
Five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:18.270
They move.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:19.970
Step and step.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.410
They go down on three, four.

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.650
Next you have Sierra and Ester.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.990
They come out.

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.990
Step.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.990
Step.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.990
And step.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:30.399
And they lean back.

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.530
They become the legs of the transformer.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:36.869
Next you have Alice who comes and does a handstand.

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:37.869
Yep.

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:38.869
Pick her up.

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:39.869
There you go.

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.021
And then you have Melissa who comes through.

00:01:41.021 --> 00:01:42.600
Through the legs.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.340
She becomes the little alien on the body of
the transformer.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.340
Boom.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.840
There you go.

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.340
Then now Charlie goes behind.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.300
We open up our arms.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.770
And then we lock it in on boom.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.619
Then the right leg moves first.

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:00.619
Boom.

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:01.619
You punch to your left.

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:02.619
The left leg moves.

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:03.619
Boom.

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:04.619
Punch with your right.

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:05.619
Right leg.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:06.619
Boom.

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:07.619
And then left.

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.619
Boom.

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:09.619
That's the Diversity Transformer.

00:02:09.619 --> 00:03:14.900
Let's do it in real time.
