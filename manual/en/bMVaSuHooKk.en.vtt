00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.530
One year after the F-Type launch, we drive the closed F-Type Coupe.

00:00:06.644 --> 00:00:16.798
It begs the question: which one is prettier? I prefer the open car.

00:00:16.945 --> 00:00:27.619
Many disagree. Rightly so, it's just magnificent. Let's just enjoy it.

00:00:59.153 --> 00:01:05.746
Right. What. A. Rear! The spoiler's a bit smaller on this coupe, too.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.852
Also, this is the F-Type R, limited - yet - to the coupe.

00:01:11.153 --> 00:01:19.269
Its supercharged V8 has 550 ps. The chassis is more dynamic, too.

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:45.624
'Wow' sums this car up nicely. It's overwhelming. Brutal all over.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.630
Brutal in the design and the way it drives. Amazing!

00:01:51.603 --> 00:02:00.176
The V8 noise seems to be even more present, even in regular mode.

00:02:00.376 --> 00:02:04.268
The cameraman complains about losing his hearing. And he's used to it.

00:02:04.422 --> 00:02:09.472
It's almost embarrassing. Not everyone outside will like it.

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:38.680
Noise aside, the engine's great. So much power, and instantly too.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:48.440
And it keeps on going. Instant power whenever you want.

00:02:51.212 --> 00:03:03.611
There's the well-known 8-speed ZF 'box. It's great, though a bit slow.

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:09.801
It always responds well though, even in Normal mode.

00:03:09.957 --> 00:03:16.770
It works instantly with these nice metal flappy pedals, too.

00:03:16.948 --> 00:03:25.012
While some DCT's don't always respond as you would like. I prefer this.

00:03:34.106 --> 00:03:38.654
The steering's fine. Old-fashioned hydraulic set-up, so you feel everything.

00:03:39.192 --> 00:03:47.821
It's great to play with this car as it's very communicative.

00:03:55.596 --> 00:04:03.809
The ride is the relative weakpoint of this car. It's not bad though.

00:04:03.963 --> 00:04:14.500
It responds well but there's too much movement. The seat is a bit too high.

00:04:14.676 --> 00:04:20.521
When you push it there's a bit too much roll. It's no die-hard sports car.

00:04:20.748 --> 00:04:25.172
It's more of a very dynamic, brutal GT.

00:04:29.755 --> 00:04:39.141
It's just not as precise and razor-sharp as a 911, for instance.

00:04:55.097 --> 00:05:00.613
At the convertible launch, Jaguar stated it's not a Boxster or 911 rival.

00:05:00.758 --> 00:05:05.128
Now, they admit this car appeals to the same audience.

00:05:07.483 --> 00:05:12.720
But, the V6 S offers 911 performance for Boxster money.

00:05:13.107 --> 00:05:18.714
While the F-Type R offers Turbo S performance for 911 money.

00:05:22.523 --> 00:05:30.774
They didn't try to copy the 911, but made it their very own car.

00:05:31.192 --> 00:05:35.112
The Jaguar is more brutal, kind of like an AMG Mercedes.

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:48.503
Design overkill and brutal power, coupled to good steering.

00:05:50.768 --> 00:05:56.119
You'd get a different audience than 911 buyers with that.

00:05:56.168 --> 00:06:00.924
So this is a great different choice. This offers so much fun.

00:06:01.079 --> 00:06:04.998
You don't have to drive it hard to feel it's great.

00:06:05.051 --> 00:06:09.545
It's fun at any speed. Cracking job.

00:06:15.349 --> 00:06:18.208
+ Great design; Noise, power and spectacle

00:06:18.423 --> 00:06:21.923
- Much pricier than the V6 S; Not refined on the limit
