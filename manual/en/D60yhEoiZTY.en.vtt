Hey guys, in this video we'll prepare Nkwobi
which is spicy cow foot! I'll list all the

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.690
ingredients in the description. Here are some
details about some of the ingredients. This

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.320
is the cow foot. It's been cut into big
chunks. Where I live, the butchers can do

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.760
that for you.
This is Akanwu, kaun or edible potash. This

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:28.970
is what makes the palm oil curdle as you will
see later. I prefer the powdered potash because

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.199
you just mix it with water and sieve while
with the solid one, you'll need to wash

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.499
and wash to get enough potash that'll make
the palm oil curdle.

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:44.219
These are ehu seeds also known as Calabash
Nutmeg. Ordinary nutmeg cannot be used as

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.589
an alternative to this because they do not
have the same flavour at all. I usually buy

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:56.589
mine from Nigeria. Crack it with a nutcracker,
peel it like this and blend with a dry mill.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:10.969
Now let's make the Nkwobiiiii. We cook the
chunks of cow foot with these big chunks of

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:18.049
onion. Add the stock cubes. Then add just
a small quantity of water. You can top up

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.810
the water as it dries up but make sure you
always have a small quantity of water in the

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.359
pot.
While that is cooking, mix the potash with

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:35.359
a small quantity of water and set aside. Pour
the palm oil into a clean dry pot. Add the

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:40.619
potash, sieving it in the process. You can
do this when you mixed it, I just didn't

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:47.619
want to get another bowl dirty hahaha
Stir and you'll see the oil curdle and turn

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:55.079
yellow. Add more potash if necessary but not
too much.

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:02.079
Add crayfish ... pepper ... ground ehu and
mix everything well.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.220
When the meat is well done, remove the ... you
know the chunks of onion we added earlier.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:34.040
Add salt, then increase the heat to high and
cook till all the water has dried. This is

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.170
why it is important that you only add a small
amount of water at a time when cooking it.

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:47.170
Add the beef to the palm oil paste and stir
very well. Transfer to a stove and heat it

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:04.659
up some more till piping hot.
Meanwhile, cut the utazi into long thin slices

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:12.730
like so ....
Cut the second onion into rings.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.730
Dish the Nkwobi and garnish with the onion
rings and the sliced utazi. If you can't

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.760
find utazi, just use bold spinach leaves for
the full effects. Actually, that's what

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:30.910
I used here. Please don't tell the elders
in my village, Enjoy!!!
