hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session with your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:29.560
Today I'm going to show you one of the best breakfast paratha using cauliflower. Cauliflower is such a wonderful vegetable, just blanche it in water and toss it in butter and it will taste fantastic

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:44.320
For this cauliflower paratha first we're going to make the dough for the paratha. You know I've take wheat flour, in this add some oil, just add some salt. Mix this with the flour

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:55.860
You know adding this oil in the flour will not only make the dough flexible when you rolling and stuffing the paratha but also when you cook the paratha it will give nice crispy edges

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:07.240
Dear friends in this add water and make the dough slightly softer. So just kneed this and make it into a medium soft dough. Look at this dough, the dough is slightly stiff

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:19.580
but once you cover it with a wet cloth and rest it for around 10-15 minutes, the dough will soften out. Now the dough is all ready, so let's make the stuffing for the paratha using cauliflower

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:32.840
and here I've taken the cauliflower you know I took a grater and just grated this cauliflower. And not only the florets but also the stem parts whichever is slightly tender you can grate them

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:47.240
But do not grate the tough part of the stem and that will not taste good in the paratha. For this take some butter in a bowl, in this add pepper powder, some jeera powder that is cumin seed powder.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:57.060
Ok. In this add some aamchur powder. This will give a touch of sourness that makes this cauliflower paratha very tasty

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:13.460
Add chilli powder, this chilli powder will give nice aroma. The pepper will give little hotness and in this add some chopped coriander, you can add little extra. In this you can add little salt and now mix this

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:30.020
till this is nicely mixed up and creamed. Ok. Now this looks good. In this add this grated cauliflower and now mix this also till all this masala mixture is mixed with the cauliflower

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:44.400
Ok. Now for the awesome paratha, the stuffing has to be more than the dough, so just make them into roundles, you know you're able to make the roundles because you added the butter and the mixture is cold

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:54.180
That's why you'll be able to make tthis into roundles. You know this is the kind of paratha that is done in exclusive five star hotels by exclusive chefs

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:05.360
Dear friends you make it at home and you'll go gaga over these cauliflower parathas. Look at this, I've divided them into 4 portions and the masala is bigger than the dough. That's how it should be

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:16.660
And then take the dough and make a well like this with the hand and with the edges slightly thinner because they are all going to get together and it will form a thick mass

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:29.440
So the edges have to be thin and the center has to be slightly thicker. Now put this cauliflower masala inside and then slowly pull this and then look at this

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:35.000
This is good. It is nicely sealed well and now with the help of little flour we're going to roll them

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:52.100
You know the other way you can do is just roll it thin and then put the masala inside and then get all the edges to one place. Now just sprinkle some flour and then roll this into paratha

00:03:52.100 --> 00:04:03.920
While rolling it if you want you can use help of little flour, so this doesnt stick and cook it on both sides add very little butter because already butter is inside, just very little butter

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:20.360
just to coat on top because this will make it cook nicely and also give a nice color. And now look at this paratha, so perfectly done and because of the nice stuffing, because of the heat that is hitting the cauliflower

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:29.960
the buttered cauliflower it becomes nice and flavorful. You know lot of people add hing, garam masala and what not that will over power this cauliflower

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:39.900
Whenever you're making a nice tender vegetable like cauliflower just add little less masalas, you know the way simple ones I showed that way your paratha will be nice and tasty

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:54.440
Look at this paratha. You know not because we added butter or because of the spices but the way we cook the cauliflower. You know just stuffed it raw and let it cook with the heat that comes within.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:08.360
Dear friends this way your cauliflower paratha will be the tastiest and the best. wow! You know these kind of awesome parathas make it for breakfast and the entire day you'll be happy happy like me.

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:13.620
