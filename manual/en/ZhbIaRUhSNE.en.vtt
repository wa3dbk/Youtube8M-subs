00:00:00.976 --> 00:00:04.886
The Holy Land is now freed
from that horrible curse.

00:00:04.887 --> 00:00:08.996
The Dragon Tribe's long held
wish has finally come true.

00:00:10.172 --> 00:00:15.888
But Ishubahn... no, this world,
has entered the Age of Man.

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:22.045
We, dragons, have outlived
our usefulness.

00:00:23.112 --> 00:00:29.652
Atrushan. The Silver Scale
vanished within my body...

00:00:30.354 --> 00:00:35.982
but I shall use my strength to
restore you to your original form.

00:00:36.918 --> 00:00:41.795
Return with me to Dragulia.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.975
We, dragons, shall build
a new Holy Land.

00:00:48.974 --> 00:00:52.340
Emerald Dragon...
I...

00:00:55.856 --> 00:00:59.404
Want to go on living as a human!

00:00:59.405 --> 00:01:06.036
Atrushan...

00:01:08.003 --> 00:01:10.727
I don't want you to blow
that horn ever again.

00:01:10.728 --> 00:01:15.118
And you'll never be
alone again this way.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:31.853
Well, I'll return to Ervad
to flirt some...

00:01:33.464 --> 00:01:36.144
Here I go...

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:39.382
Gonna keep an eye
on Hathram?

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.076
E-excuse me...!
What are you getting at?

00:01:55.158 --> 00:01:59.945
Atrushan, Tamryn. Since you're
together, I don't know if it's adequate to ask. 

00:02:00.534 --> 00:02:04.101
Wouldn't you like to
travel some time with me?

00:02:05.317 --> 00:02:08.424
Sounds good! What do you
think, Tamryn?

00:02:11.111 --> 00:02:14.202
Even if you said you don't want
to come, I'd bring you along anyway!

00:02:15.112 --> 00:02:16.267
Well then!

00:02:19.366 --> 00:02:24.405
Children! They must make
their way into this world.

00:02:25.368 --> 00:02:30.412
Falter though they may, their
lives are without regrets.

00:02:31.983 --> 00:02:39.726
But they can not truly falter,
for they know no fear.

00:02:39.727 --> 00:02:43.778
Such is the proof of youth.

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:49.791
Indeed, their journey
is merely beginning.

00:02:51.782 --> 00:02:59.150
He, too, shall experience the
fleeting beauty of human life...

00:03:28.353 --> 00:03:34.518
