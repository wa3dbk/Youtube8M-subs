00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.800
Since nobody likes losing their village,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.000
we’d like to make sure this never happens to you.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.400
To ensure your village is protected from lost progress,

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.100
you’ll need your own device, your village

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.570
and one Google account to use in Google’s Play Games.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.100
Google Play Games is a versatile Android program

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.160
that allows you to save game progress,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.600
while letting you share your achievements

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.700
and experiences with friends who also play games.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:35.800
Here is my village.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.900
I have a Google account, but my village currently is not attached to it.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.100
To ensure that my progress will always
be saved,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.100
I’ll enter the game settings and tap “Google Play - sign in”

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.200
As you can see, there are a couple accounts currently being used on this device.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.700
You will need to be absolutely sure that you select your own account to proceed.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.700
That’s important!

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.000
This is because in Clash, your village can
only be attached to a single Google account.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.900
Meaning your village will permanently attach itself to the first account selected

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.390
that has no village attached to it.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.200
So to protect your village!

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.200
Create an account by tapping on “Add Account”

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.400
and then following the steps required

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Or sign in to a pre-existing one!

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:28.170
Because I already have a Google account, I’ll go ahead and choose mine.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.300
A loading indicator will appear notifying
you with a “welcome text”.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.300
Be sure that this message contains your username.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.900
Now that my village is safe, Ill go destroy
some goblins!

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.100
Have a shiny new Android device you’d like to Clash on?

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.000
Or want to transfer your village to a working device?

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.380
To get your village onto this new device,

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.000
you will first need to set up the device with your Google account – as you should already have one.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:56.500
I’ll go ahead and set up my device.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.700
Once your device has booted up,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.400
go to the Play Store and download Clash of Clans.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:20.800
When you open the game, the beginner’s tutorial
will begin.

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:23.500
Since your village should already be attached to a Google account,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.100
skip the tutorial by tapping on “Google play sign in”.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.500
A pop up will appear alerting you that there

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:36.500
is a village attached to the Google account
on your device.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.300
Tap on load game, as it should be yours , and your village will appear!

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.600
So don’t forget, for safe Clashing on Android,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.800
you’ll need: your own device, one village, and your Google account.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:49.800
Clash on!
