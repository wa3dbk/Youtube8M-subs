[music playing] Hey everybody, welcome back
to the channel.

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:15.000
I'm Jennifer and today I have blind bag mystery
for you, these are blind boxes they are by

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.740
My Little Pony.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.970
And they are mystery minis vinyl figures.

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:21.850
So let's get started and see who we got.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:29.240
Now these are by Funko and Hasbro and they
are definitely for ages 5 and up and certainly

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.869
not under 3 cause of the small parts.

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.100
You can see the different sides of the box
there, and they're pretty awesome.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.000
There are 12 to collect.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.739
There is a one in 12 chance to collect each
one and there are 2 glow in the dark figures,

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:53.300
that also have corresponding ordinary uh versions
of them inside.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.030
And here we go with box number
1.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:16.710
Oh wow I think this is Spitfire, what a gorgeous
pony.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.000
This is the most gorgeous vinyl mini figure,
this is indeed Spitfire.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.400
Look at that hair, this is just amazing.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:29.960
All the
little details of paint in there, even the

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.180
goggles have beautiful paint stripes on them,
and on the feet.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.020
And if you look underneath here, you can see
the my little pony logo

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.380
there.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:45.220
The main features of this collection are of
course the black bodies for the non glow in

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:50.430
the dark figures and the contrasting really
bright hair, and it just looks incredible.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:54.620
This is definitely one of the best ones I've
pulled out of this set, and definitely a favorite.

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:00.240
What do you think of em, be sure and let me
know in the comments section below.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:10.240
And now onto box number 2.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:32.659
Oh, I think this is Fluttershy's hair, oh
it is indeed!

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:33.659
Wow!

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:41.569
Look at this gorgeous Fluttershy, she has
so much sculpted hair, it is beautiful.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:49.060
I love the black body and there's so much
detail here on her cutie mark.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:53.200
Gorgeous little eyes and if you notice, each
one of these figures has a completely different

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:59.280
mold and completely different paint for the
eyes, so they're all really really special.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:05.480
What do you think of her, be sure and let
me know in the comments section below.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:16.170
And now onto box number 3.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:30.170
Oh, and last but certainly not least this
is derpy hooves.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.939
This is the gorgeous derpy hooves, this is
the ordinary version, there is a glow in the

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:37.279
dark one as well.

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:43.439
I love the orange coloring in the eyes, the
black body looks really good in contrast to

00:03:43.439 --> 00:03:47.709
the yellow hair, and awesome cutie mark on
both sides.

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.189
Which again is unusual to My Little Pony mini
figures, usually they just

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:54.359
have it on one side.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:59.260
So what do you think of em, let me know in
the comments section below.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:07.400
Now the 3 we got again are Spitfire, Fluttershy,
and ordinary version Derpy, and I think they're

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.400
all fantastic.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.700
I don't know if I can pick a favorite on these
3, I have really, its kind of a tie for me.

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.280
I love them all for different reasons.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.140

your favorite is in the comments section below.
