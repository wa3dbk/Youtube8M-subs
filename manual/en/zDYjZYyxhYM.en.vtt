00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.160
Basically, determining the right haircut for
you is by me seeing what I don't want.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.990
What I call this, you have a very flat top
here, which is fine as your head shape.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.920
But it looks like someone hit you over the
head with a frying pan, so that's not the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.250
haircut we want for you.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.220
What we want to do is create a little bit
more height and movement up here, and we want

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:26.710
to get you a little bit more rounded.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.180
So, we don't want to encourage square, flat,
tight.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:01:08.180
This is the before, and you'll soon see the
after.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.880
Determining the right haircut for each individual
- for him it had a lot to do with, as you

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.450
saw in the before picture - he was really
flat and heavy here.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:22.240
So, by removing a lot of this weight, I got
him to round out a little bit more, getting

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.090
it off of his forehead.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.710
It was very heavy down here, pushing his face
forward.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.200
I wanted to create a little bit of Steve McQueen
lift around the front, and a little bit of

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.359
fun texture because he's young, so it's like
a perfect celebration.

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:39.229
But we actually removed a lot of hair from
him.

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:44.009
And all the heaviness was laying here and
it was really flat, so there was nothing that

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:51.169
he could do style wise or any product unless
he really gunked it up, which is unnecessary.

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:54.239
We just removed a lot and it was very much
geared towards his head shape.

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:58.719
We wanted to create it more rounded in on
the sides, and create a little bit more height

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:00.039
up on top.

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:04.059
It totally opened and broadened his face.

00:02:04.059 --> 00:02:05.630
This'll grow in really great, too.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:08.280
It'll have some long, and lots of different
textures in it.
