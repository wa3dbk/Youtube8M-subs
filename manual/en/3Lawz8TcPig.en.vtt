00:00:00.117 --> 00:00:04.260
(piano music playing)

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:06.632
Steven: We're in the Prado
in Madrid and we're looking

00:00:06.632 --> 00:00:09.025
at Goya's "Black Paintings."

00:00:09.025 --> 00:00:11.031
Beth: Yeah, we're in a
room filled with them.

00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:13.737
Steven: They had been the
paintings that he had made

00:00:13.737 --> 00:00:16.868
to decorate his home
just outside of Madrid.

00:00:16.868 --> 00:00:18.701
Literally, they had been
painted on the walls

00:00:18.701 --> 00:00:20.739
and we're looking at one of
the most striking of these

00:00:20.739 --> 00:00:23.637
panels, Saturn, sometimes referred to as

00:00:23.637 --> 00:00:26.118
"Saturn devouring one of his children."

00:00:26.118 --> 00:00:28.838
Beth: It had been prophecized
to Saturn that one of his

00:00:28.838 --> 00:00:33.451
sons would dethrone him.
Saturn is god of time.

00:00:33.451 --> 00:00:38.117
So in order to prevent that
occurrence, Saturn devours

00:00:38.117 --> 00:00:42.518
his children as they're born,
but one escapes, Jupitar,

00:00:42.518 --> 00:00:47.246
and so Saturn in the end is
dethroned and he can't escape

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:49.247
the fate that's been allotted to him.

00:00:49.247 --> 00:00:52.142
Steven: In fact, one could
argue that he causes his fate

00:00:52.142 --> 00:00:55.769
by trying to reverse it.
So it's this terrible story

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.547
rendered in the most horrific
way possible and it's a

00:00:58.547 --> 00:01:02.981
reminder that this is an
allegory for the ideas that Goya

00:01:02.981 --> 00:01:04.709
was thinking about at this moment.

00:01:04.709 --> 00:01:06.415
Beth: Of power?

00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:09.489
Steven: Of power and the way
in which a power treats its

00:01:09.489 --> 00:01:12.057
own children, its own
chargers. You know ...

00:01:12.057 --> 00:01:13.863
Beth: In order to stay in power.

00:01:13.863 --> 00:01:16.560
Steven: Goya had seen the Spanish state,

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.220
the Spanish monarchy destroy the country.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.699
Beth: Well, then he saw Napolean's army

00:01:21.699 --> 00:01:24.416
destroy the country and
then he saw the restoration

00:01:24.416 --> 00:01:26.946
of the monarchy destroy the country.

00:01:26.946 --> 00:01:29.364
Steven: So this notion of
the cyclical nature of time,

00:01:29.364 --> 00:01:32.749
the notion of turning
on one's own charges,

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:35.415
turning on one's own
children but here rendered

00:01:35.415 --> 00:01:38.965
allegorically, but in the
most vivid and I cannot

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:40.430
imagine more powerful manner.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.665
Beth: In one way, I read
Saturn's bulging eyes and his

00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:48.581
Steven: desperation

00:01:48.581 --> 00:01:53.899
in one way as "I'm not
going to lose my power",

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:58.497
but on the other hand, I also
feels like he knows he must

00:01:58.497 --> 00:02:03.033
do this and he's aware of how
terrible it is and just sort of

00:02:03.033 --> 00:02:07.382
does it in this insane,
chaotic, frenzied way.

00:02:07.382 --> 00:02:11.516
Steven: He is as Goya has
rendered him almost dissolving.

00:02:11.516 --> 00:02:15.748
You can see his basic anatomy,
of course, but look at his

00:02:15.748 --> 00:02:18.342
right elbow and the way
in which the skin sort of

00:02:18.342 --> 00:02:22.380
wraps around and his
forearm almost dissolves.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.360
His shoulder begins to dissolve.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.324
We can see his thighs and they
begin to pick up the light,

00:02:28.324 --> 00:02:29.787
but then there seems to be some, an

00:02:29.787 --> 00:02:33.730
extra piece of him just
above, let's see, his left hip

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.528
and so there is this way in
which his insanity is in a sense,

00:02:37.528 --> 00:02:41.700
he's coming apart and
his interest in rendering

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.710
the meat of the body,
the flesh of the body,

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.624
and all of its violence
and all of its physicality

00:02:48.624 --> 00:02:52.054
and all of its grotesqueness.

00:02:52.054 --> 00:02:55.197
Beth: Well, I think the
word "flesh" is right.

00:02:55.197 --> 00:02:59.486
There is something about his
own body that looks like meat,

00:02:59.486 --> 00:03:03.248
like butchered meat and at
the same time that he is

00:03:03.248 --> 00:03:05.258
butchering and eating his own son.

00:03:05.258 --> 00:03:08.902
Steven: This is the result
of what Goya witnessed.

00:03:08.902 --> 00:03:11.461
This is Goya's reflection
of the world that he saw.

00:03:11.461 --> 00:03:13.803
Beth: And his understanding of humanity

00:03:13.803 --> 00:03:16.020
and what it was capable of.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.020
