00:01:11.366 --> 00:01:14.633
extreme prize money, and many gossips
were altogether enough to draw attention

00:01:14.633 --> 00:01:20.266
around Korea and even around the world
to the final game of Ongamenet LOL.

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:28.300
2012 May 19th, with about 10,000 audiences
it has raised the curtain in Ilsan Kintex.

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:36.333

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.233
and the players gave everyone
a full tension each and every moment.

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:54.600

The final winner of the LOL
regular league was MIG Blaze,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.900
who has been said to be the second

I am the happiest
and the saddest coach.

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:25.266
One team should work hard,
and one team should stand firm.

00:02:25.266 --> 00:02:38.900
MIG won’t be satisfied here,
we promise to reach out to the world.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.133

my mind and cheered for Blaze.

I am feeling sorry since Mera cries.

00:02:48.233 --> 00:02:50.566
