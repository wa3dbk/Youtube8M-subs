Hello and welcome to Videojug.

00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:08.880
We're going to show you how to roast a leg
of lamb.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:16.570
You'll need the following ingredients:
1 Leg of Lamb from 1 and a half to 2 kilos,

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:27.980
6 cloves of garlic peeled and cut into 4 slices
length ways,

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.060
2 to 3 springs of rosemary,
6 tablespoons of olive oil,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.021
2 tablespoons of wholegrain mustard,
Freshly ground black pepper and salt.

00:00:32.021 --> 00:00:33.021
You will also need the following utensils:
Roasting tray and

00:00:33.021 --> 00:00:35.160
Rack, and a
Small Knife

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:46.630
Step 1: Preheat the oven to 250 degrees centigrade.

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:57.329
Step 2: Rub the leg of lamb with the mustard
and season it with salt and pepper.

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:20.549
Step 3: Make incisions in the lamb with the
small knife.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:31.280
Then put the garlic and rosemary inside the
incisions.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:38.340
Step 4: Place the lamb onto a roasting tray
and drizzle some oil over the top and place

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.119
on a roasting rack.

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:44.360
Step 5: Place the roasting tray in the oven
and cook for 1 hour.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:55.969
After about 30 minutes lower the temperature
to 200 degrees for another 30 minutes.

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.789
Step 6: After the cooking time check that
the meat is cooked.

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.600
The best way is to stick a knife into the
thick part of the leg.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.130
The cooked meat should be a pinkish color.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:16.030
Leave the meat to rest for fifteen minutes.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.290
Then carve and serve with roast potatoes.

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:27.530
And that is how to make roast leg of lamb
the Videojug way.
