00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.720
Metroidvanias.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.389
Some people love them, some people hate them.

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:17.030
I used to not like them very much but I’ve
been getting into some modern ones lately.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.070
Over the years since Super Metroid blazed
a trail for the genre, game developers have

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.570
taken the formula and almost perfected it
by now.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.640
But what happens when a game takes the core
philosophies of a Metroidvania, and throws

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.640
it out the window?

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.080
Today on Good Game Design we’re going to
look at the “controlled freedom” principle.

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.280
When you think of Super Metroid, what are
the major gameplay themes?

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.780
You start powerless and slowly explore to
gain power-ups to progress to new parts of

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.060
the map, all the while getting stronger until
you can finally reach the final boss.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.930
Now, while one game does follow this pretty
similarly, it just feels vastly different

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.030
in its gameplay.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.290
And that game is Ori and the Blind Forest.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.040
If you haven’t seen this game before, wow
there’s a lot that’s breathtaking about

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.040
it.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.040
It’s absolutely gorgeous.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.040
The world is just brimming with life and color.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.420
The story is simultaneously heart breaking
and heartwarming.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.140
You play as Ori, this cute little guy, who
is trying to restore the forest to its former

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.490
glory by gathering the 3 elements, water,
wind, and fire to help bring the great tree

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.850
to its original power.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.499
You do this by traveling to the different
areas of the map, some of which are accessible

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:20.530
at the beginning, and some will require new
powerups to reach them.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.650
Huh, sounds a lot like the old tired formula
so far, right?

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.149
But like I said, it’s the game feel that
is drastically different.

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.929
After the introductory area to get used to
the controls, the first major power-up you

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:32.700
receive is the wall jump.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.820
You see, in most Metroidvanias, the obstacles
and platforming are centered around the fact

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:41.189
that you can’t jump high enough, or can't
cross a big enough gap, or a giant wall that

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.189
can’t be opened.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.079
Most of the time, Metroidvanias make you feel
helpless, until you slowly but surely gain

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.819
ability in your character, and in yourself
as a player.

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:53.189
Normally this is a great tool for progression,
but instead Ori and the Blind Forest makes

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.979
you feel super powerful right from the get
go.

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.979
There are huge walls blocking your path all
over the place, but from the very start, Ori

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.919
says “nope, you can go wherever you want!”

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.080
They still are able to limit the player’s
wall jumping by giving curves to certain walls,

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.149
but the key is in how it feels to the player.

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.390
You already feel empowered and your journey
is just beginning.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.790
This is the key feeling that Ori gives you:
freedom.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.820
Instead of limiting a players power so that
they can’t cross certain sections, they

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.700
instead change the entire layout of the levels
to accommodate your power, and still feel

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.110
like your progressing.

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.420
Even just by Ori’s design you can tell you’re
meant to be nimble and quick.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.780
Ori is very small, and it took me awhile to
realize exactly how small, but if you look

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.730
at the mushrooms and other things in the world
relative to Ori, we’re talking like a couple

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.870
centimeters high at best.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.670
I thought this Owl was just GIGANTIC, but
really it’s more that Ori is absolutely

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:42.670
tiny.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:44.590
However, Ori is very fast and floaty.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.640
He controls easily and never lets the player
feel restricted, even before your first powerup.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.450
Another way the player feels free is the way
this game incorporates save points.

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.939
Instead of the game saving automatically every
once in awhile, you have the ability to set

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.230
your own save points whenever you’d like.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.920
This uses limited energy, but you need to
make sure you’re saving often, otherwise

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.069
you might be sent back a long ways if you
forgot.

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:08.980
You see, the game doesn’t hold your hand
and say, oh you died, I’m sorry, here try

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.769
again, it’s saying, hey you’re a big boy,
you can go wherever you want, you need to

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.319
be in charge of your own saves buddy.

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.269
It’s kind of like when you reached high
school, and the teacher was like “I’m

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:21.180
not going to remind you about your missing
assignments anymore, you need to be responsible

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.200
and do it on your own”.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.249
It all adds to the theming of freedom, you’re
powerful, but “with great power comes great

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:29.849
responsibilit”-okay, you get the idea.

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:33.329
Certain areas of the game aren’t even blocked
off to you, it’s just a much harder area

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:34.489
with difficult enemies.

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:38.240
I had to realize on my own that I wasn’t
supposed to go here yet, but the game gave

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.299
me that choice in the first place – that
freedom to choose.

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.409
It’s like the enemies are saying “Feel
free to come up here, dude, just know that

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:45.409
I’m going to break your face!”

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:50.150
Again, you’re given freedom, but controlled
freedom, instead of just control.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.280
Here’s the beautiful thing about Ori, though.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.970
Even though I got that wall jump and felt
unstoppable and like I could go anywhere,

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.040
the game CONTINUED to make me feel even stronger!

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.620
You get a double jump very early on to cross
gaps easily, you get a feather to glide in

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.799
the wind and float to new platforms, all Aladdin
on the Super Nintendo style!

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:09.650
But the power that stood out to me most was
the bash ability.

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.469
I don’t think I’ve seen something like
this in another game before.

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:16.700
If you press Y when near an enemy or their
projectiles, you will freeze and “bash”

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.200
that object, you can either use it to boost
up to new areas, or bounce it in the opposite

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.140
direction of yourself to solve puzzles, or
harm enemies.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:28.760
When you gain this ability, the game opens
up all sorts of new possibilities for travel.

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.761
The platforming starts getting way more complex,
and you have to travel full sections with

00:04:32.761 --> 00:04:35.700
no ground just bashing on projectiles and
enemies.

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:39.660
Immediately after learning this ability, you
face off against a mini-boss, where you need

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:43.510
to both bash off of shots in one direction
to reach platforms, and then bash them in

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.760
another direction to damage the boss.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:49.440
This gets you really comfortable with how
to use the bash in two different ways.

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.740
Then there’s a really challenging section
to put your abilities to the test.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:56.640
It's a pretty cool little move that made me feel slick in my movement.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:00.510
Throughout the whole game I felt strong, there
was never a point where I felt incapable,

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.390
and yet when I reached the end of the game,
I was blazing through crazy hard sections

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:07.950
without any trouble, and I realized that I
WAS limited in the beginning, it just never

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:08.950
felt that way.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.510
When I would revisit old locations to get
hidden collectables, I was breezing through

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:15.900
sections that gave me trouble earlier and
I realized that the game was only giving me

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:19.560
a piece of the true power I would have eventually,
and yet I never felt limited.

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.400
It's like Ori just took everything to a new level.

00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:26.800
Think of it this way, instead of having extremely
limited powers and then slowly unlocking new

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.520
abilities to reach new areas, Ori gave you
lots of power to unlock new abilities to give

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:33.940
you even MORE power as you reached new areas.

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.750
It’s like the ceiling can’t hold us, said
Moon Studios.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:40.110
Let’s give the player a new experience they’ve
never had before.

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:44.990
And truthfully that’s what Ori and the Blind
Forest is: a new fresh look at the Metroidvania

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.990
formula.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.470
The story and Lion King aesthetic drew me
in, but the gameplay is what kept me playing.

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.310
They took the shackles off early, and only
gave you more and more to work with, until

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.830
you reach the end and the climax shows you
what you’re really made of.

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:02.170
And that’s why Ori and the Blind Forest
has Good Game Design, thanks for watching.
