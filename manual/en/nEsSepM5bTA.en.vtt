bjbj Hi, I'm Catharine. I'm a makeup artist
with BHCosmetics. Today's tutorial is a little

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:19.829
bit of a holiday-inspired look. We were inspired
by Anne Hathaway in the November issue of

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:25.720
Vogue, specifically this look here. It is
a variation on a brown contoured eye using

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:31.210
very chocolaty cool browns and light pinkish
pearly tones for the lip. And then everyone's

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:38.289
favorite, of course, for holiday, we're using
a berry lip tone. So hope you enjoy. First,

00:00:38.289 --> 00:00:46.780
I'll apply BHCosmetics' eye and lip primer
to my entire eyelid. Then using BHCosmetics'

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:53.050
stiff smudger brush, I'll apply a peachy cream
color eyeshadow for the base over the entire

00:00:53.050 --> 00:01:02.590
lid to just under the crease line. Next, with
a small soft contour brush, I dip into a mix

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:09.040
of warm brown and light gray eyeshadows and
begin to create an exaggerated contour line

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:14.810
starting from just past the outer corner of
the eye and bringing it all the way in to

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:20.350
just past the inner corner of the eye. Then
connect the outer edge of the contour to the

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:27.390
outer corner of the eye. Now, take a pencil
brush and dip into a mixture of the warm chocolate

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.990
and black eyeshadows and create a thick and
smudged out line right at the upper lash line.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:42.510
Go over once more to really deepen this lash
line color. Do the same for the lower lash

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:50.229
line. Now using BHCosmetics' thick smudger
brush, mix a creamy vanilla shade and a peachy

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:59.540
pink eyeshadow to highlight the brow bone.
I'm using a set of Demi lashes to really thicken

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:06.869
my own lashes and draw attention to the eyes.
Apply a thin line of lash glue to the strips.

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:12.553
Then with a set of tweezers or your fingertips,
apply the center of the lash strip to the

00:02:12.553 --> 00:02:19.700
center of your eyelid at the lashline. Attach
the outer end first, then the inner end of

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:26.109
the lashes, making sure to press the strip
into your lash line to ensure proper adhesion.

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:34.450
Now take the BHCosmetics mascara brush and
blend your natural lashes into your strip

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.889
lashes. Next, take a thickening black mascara
and apply. Start from the base of the lashes,

00:02:41.889 --> 00:02:46.829
and give a little wiggle to encourage the
lashes into the brush and squeeze upwards

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:57.310
to the end of the lashes. Then, with an angled
liner brush, camouflage the lash strip and

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:05.470
remaining glue with a black cream liner. Going
back in with the pencil brush, I'm going to

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.730
deepen the color of the lower lash line, again
using a mixture of the warm chocolate and

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.770
black eyeshadows. Now, taking the BHCosmetics
concealer brush and 10 color camouflage concealer

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.030
palette, I begin to erase any dark shadows,
fallout, or discoloration under the eye. I'm

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:31.250
also extending this into the temple area,
creating a slight cheek highlight. Don't forget

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:39.150
to blend into the hairline. Take the remaining
concealer on the brush and swipe it down the

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.840
center of your nose to further define the
bridge of the nose. Now with the BHCosmetics

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.079
blush brush, I chose a rosy pink blush from
the 6 color contour palette and lightly swept

00:03:51.079 --> 00:03:58.610
this onto the apples of the cheeks, mound
of the chin, and just a bit on the nose. Now

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.990
to finish the look, we'll use the BHCosmetics
lip brush and dip it into a sweet raspberry

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:09.450
shade on the 32 lip gloss palette. Keep this
application light, as we want to create more

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:26.660
of the washed or stained berry color of the
lips. Thank you for watching our Anne Hathaway
