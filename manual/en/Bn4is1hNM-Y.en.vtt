00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.220
My name is Michelle Nicola, and I am the Spanish
teacher and Heritage Club coordinator at

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.450
De La Salle North Catholic High School in Portland,
Oregon.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:54.290
My mother laughed hysterically when I said
that I wanted to be a teacher because, growing

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:56.130
up, that was the last thing that I wanted
to do.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:01.500
And I just kind of kept tugging at this thread,
and, all of a sudden, I'm a teacher, and I

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.860
couldn't think of doing anything else.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.900
I really understood what it's like to live
in the moment and it's my students that help

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.000
me do that.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.220
They teach me.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.480
The term “heritage Spanish speakers” is
a relatively new term.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:28.470
Under the broad definition, it would be anyone
who has a cultural or linguistic connection

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.530
with another country or culture.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:39.330
In the narrow definition, it's someone who
grew up speaking another language at home,

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.750
and then, for whatever reason, English or
another language became dominant.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.750
The social language versus the academic language—it's
some of that academic language that gets left

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.200
behind in the Spanish.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:00.530
So, what I try to do in my class with them
is try to fill that gap.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.870
Even though I know that there are some things
in the classroom that are out of my control,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.140
at the end of the day, if the class doesn't
go well, that's my responsibility to look

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.000
at that and to figure out why.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.470
I try to, as much as possible, let my kids
know that I see them.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.260
Students more or less know how I'm going to
assess them, and they know what the target

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:23.340
is.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.760
It's not about when they learn it, it's that
they learn it.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:34.260
I teach with a method called TPRS, which is
Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling,

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:42.430
and the basis of that method is personalization
and comprehensible input—how they identify.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.639
And we tell stories, and I have them draw
pictures and then we talk about the pictures

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:49.140
that they drew.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:56.070
I use music in the classroom because it infuses
joy into the classroom in a way that nothing

00:02:56.070 --> 00:03:03.190
else can, so I want to give them some practical
and some fun ... There's this idea that school

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.630
shouldn't be fun, and, I don't know, why not?

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:15.020
Heritage Club is a group of kids who come
together and want to celebrate the different

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.220
cultures, races that are in existence in our
community.

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.010
The theme this year is allyship.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:26.790
I think Ms. Nicola encourages us to get out
of our comfort zones and learn about somebody

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:32.230
else's culture that we aren't a part of or
learn more about our culture.

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:37.870
We do a lot of work with being allies to each
other, and I think she encourages us to look

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.690
past skin color and stereotypes and to really
get to know other people in our community.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:50.120
The Heritage Club affects the school environment
because it gets people talking, and there

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:56.070
aren't easy solutions to any of these problems,
but if people start talking about it, then

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:01.510
people can learn from each other, then people
can be influenced by each other, and that's

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.250
when we start to see change.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.100
As a staff at De La Salle, we follow up and
we have our own culture conversations.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:15.850
That's our goal, is the ability to connect
on multiple levels with anyone.

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:21.650
I think my advice to new teachers is to start
doing that work of getting yourself out of

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:26.810
your comfort zone, of getting yourself into
somebody else's reality, because we all need

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:31.380
those times when we're with people who are
like us, but it's when we're with people who

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.580
are not like us that we're really gonna grow
and we're really gonna find out who we fully

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.080
are.
