Very excited today!  Last night I defeated in the rematch

00:00:28.451 --> 00:00:31.143
against the big Popa's Revenge Burger Challenge at

00:00:31.371 --> 00:00:34.411
Rascals in St. Andrews, Scotland.  Got the win

00:00:34.713 --> 00:00:37.593
Now today I'm here for a delicious burrito.

00:00:37.767 --> 00:00:40.647
Not many burrito challenges around the UK.

00:00:41.243 --> 00:00:44.763
I am at Mexigo in St. Andrews, Scotland, I'm taking on

00:00:44.763 --> 00:00:46.469
their Big Ass Burrito Challenge!

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.809
Now we've got this four pound burrito.

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.389
It's got chili, some chicken, and filled with rice, beans, healthy vegetables like lettuce

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:02.260
We've got this side of fries, and a side of onion rings.

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:07.239
We've also got another spicy thing...

00:01:07.239 --> 00:01:12.278
10 of their mega death wings.  but I've been informed they're not going to make me cry

00:01:12.278 --> 00:01:15.149
We'll have to see.  I'll save them for the end.

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.645
We've got 45 minutes to finish everything here.

00:01:17.645 --> 00:01:20.102
Nobody's been able to complete the challenge.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.370
If I win I get the meal free, I'll get a free t-shirt, and

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.092
most importantly I'll be the first to win, so lets get it started!

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.460
Alright, lets get this burrito down, then we'll do these

00:01:44.086 --> 00:01:46.486
sides, then we'll do these 10 wings.

00:01:49.274 --> 00:01:50.394

00:02:37.553 --> 00:02:40.263

00:03:19.664 --> 00:03:20.944
Very good burrito!

00:03:24.193 --> 00:03:27.233
