00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.066
Rodriguez: RATHER THAN REITERATE
A STEREOTYPE,

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:16.627
ART CAN SHOW HUMAN BEINGS
IN VERY MULTIDIMENSIONAL WAYS.

00:00:16.627 --> 00:00:20.495
IT CAN SHOW THE WAY IN WHICH
WE WISH TO BUILD THE WORLD.

00:00:20.495 --> 00:00:23.363
HOW DO I WISH
TO SEE MYSELF PORTRAYED?

00:00:23.363 --> 00:00:25.528
THAT'S WHY I CREATE ART,
IS TO THINK OF MYSELF,

00:00:25.528 --> 00:00:28.033
"WELL, HOW DO I SEE MYSELF
AS A WOMAN OF COLOR,

00:00:28.033 --> 00:00:30.528
HOW DO I REPRESENT MYSELF
AS SOMEONE WHO HAS POWER,

00:00:30.528 --> 00:00:35.099
AS SOMEONE WHO HAD THE ABILITY
TO DECIDE FOR HERSELF

00:00:35.099 --> 00:00:36.693
WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO
WITH HER BODY?

00:00:36.693 --> 00:00:39.033
OR HOW CAN I SHOW ART IN A WAY

00:00:39.033 --> 00:00:41.594
THAT HUMANIZES
BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE

00:00:41.594 --> 00:00:44.000
SO THAT WE'RE NOT JUST
OVERWHELMINGLY SHOWN

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.099
AS CRIMINALS OR AS SOMEHOW
AT THE MARGINS OF SOCIETY,

00:00:47.099 --> 00:00:49.297
BUT THAT WE'RE SHOWN
AS THE CENTER.

00:00:49.297 --> 00:00:51.297
!!musiC@!!!musiC@!

00:00:55.297 --> 00:00:56.627
MY NAME IS FAVIANNA RODRIGUEZ,

00:00:56.627 --> 00:00:59.297
AND I'M A VISUAL ARTIST
AND AN ACTIVIST.

00:00:59.297 --> 00:01:03.396
AND I DO WORKS AROUND
IMMIGRATION, WOMEN'S ISSUES,

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:07.066
GLOBALIZATION,
AND ECONOMIC INJUSTICE.

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:10.693
!!musiC@!!!musiC@!

00:01:10.693 --> 00:01:13.594
PRINTMAKING HAS A HISTORY
OF BEING A VERY ACCESSIBLE

00:01:13.594 --> 00:01:15.330
AND DEMOCRATIC MEDIUM.

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.198
A PRINT IS A MULTIPLE,

00:01:17.198 --> 00:01:24.198
MEANING THAT YOU CAN PRODUCE
100 SCREEN PRINTS OR 1,000.

00:01:24.198 --> 00:01:26.033
PRINTMAKING THROUGHOUT

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:28.627
SOCIAL JUSTICE HISTORY,
IN PARTICULAR,

00:01:28.627 --> 00:01:32.660
HAS BEEN A TOOL THAT ARTISTS
HAVE USED TO EXPOSE THE TRUTH

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:34.066
TO FIGHT FOR JUSTICE.

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:36.033
AND I'M PARTICULARLY
INTERESTED IN IT

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:39.231
BECAUSE IT'S THE WAY THAT
I WAS TRAINED AS AN ARTIST.

00:01:39.231 --> 00:01:42.759
AND MANY OF MY MENTORS
ARE PRINTMAKERS THEMSELVES.

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:48.264
AND I ALSO REALLY WANT A MEDIUM
THAT IS ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE.

00:01:48.264 --> 00:01:50.000
I BELIEVE THAT ART
IS A HUMAN RIGHT,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
AND ART IS SOMETHING
THAT EVERYONE CAN AND SHOULD DO.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.759
I'M THE DAUGHTER OF MIGRANTS.

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:58.693
MY MOM CROSSED THE BORDER
IN ORDER FOR HER

00:01:58.693 --> 00:02:00.660
TO HAVE A BETTER LIFE,
AND I WAS BORN HERE.

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.627
AND IF IT WERE NOT FOR THAT,

00:02:02.627 --> 00:02:07.462
I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE BEEN
BORN IN PERU IN A PLACE

00:02:07.462 --> 00:02:13.165
WHERE IT'S VERY HARD
TO BE A WOMAN ARTIST.

00:02:13.165 --> 00:02:15.198
THIS PIECE,
"MIGRATION IS BEAUTIFUL,"

00:02:15.198 --> 00:02:20.132
IS USING THE MONARCH BUTTERFLY
AS A METAPHOR.

00:02:20.132 --> 00:02:22.759
THE MONARCH BUTTERFLY,
IN PARTICULAR, CROSSES BORDERS.

00:02:22.759 --> 00:02:26.000
IT FLIES FROM MEXICO,
THROUGH THE UNITED STATES,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.594
AND THROUGH CANADA,
AND THEN BACK.

00:02:27.594 --> 00:02:31.363
AND I WANTED TO USE THIS
METAPHOR TO CELEBRATE MIGRANTS,

00:02:31.363 --> 00:02:33.462
BECAUSE OFTEN, WHEN WE THINK
ABOUT MIGRANTS

00:02:33.462 --> 00:02:38.165
CROSSING THE BORDER, THERE'S
A NEGATIVE ASSOCIATION TO IT.

00:02:38.165 --> 00:02:40.429
SO IN THE BUTTERFLY,
YOU SEE TWO FACES.

00:02:40.429 --> 00:02:43.660
AND, AGAIN, I DID THE TWO FACES
VERY MUCH IN THE SAME STYLE

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.726
THAT I DO MANY OF MY CHARACTERS,

00:02:45.726 --> 00:02:49.231
WHICH IS WITH BIG NOSES
AND REFINED CHEEKBONES

00:02:49.231 --> 00:02:51.594
AS A WAY TO CELEBRATE
OUR INDIGENOUS ANCESTORS,

00:02:51.594 --> 00:02:54.132
OUR AFRICAN ANCESTORS.

00:02:54.132 --> 00:02:58.429
MY STYLE HAS EVOLVED
THROUGH KIND OF A HYBRID

00:02:58.429 --> 00:03:00.099
OF DIFFERENT INFLUENCES.

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:03.000
I WAS VERY INFLUENCED
BY HIP HOP, AND, IN FACT,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.693
A LOT OF MY COLORS,
THE VIBRANCY IN COLORS,

00:03:05.693 --> 00:03:09.528
COMES FROM JUST SEEING
A LOT OF GRAFFITI GROWING UP.

00:03:09.528 --> 00:03:12.297
AFTER I TURNED 18
AND I JUST TASTED FREEDOM,

00:03:12.297 --> 00:03:16.429
I DROPPED OUT OF SCHOOL
AND WENT TO LIVE IN LOS ANGELES

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:19.264
TO LEARN FROM SOME OF
THE CHICANO PRINTMAKERS THERE.

00:03:19.264 --> 00:03:21.693
SOME KEY MOMENTS FOR ME WERE

00:03:21.693 --> 00:03:25.495
LEARNING THE SCREEN PRINTING
PROCESS AND LEARNING ABOUT

00:03:25.495 --> 00:03:27.594
THE CUBAN POSTER ARTISTS.

00:03:27.594 --> 00:03:29.726
!!musiC@!!!musiC@!

00:03:34.726 --> 00:03:37.198
SEEING WORKS BY EMORY DOUGLAS,

00:03:37.198 --> 00:03:40.429
THE MINISTER OF CULTURE
OF THE BLACK PANTHER PARTY,

00:03:40.429 --> 00:03:42.594
SEEING WORK BY CUBAN ARTISTS

00:03:42.594 --> 00:03:44.330
WHO WERE DOING ALL KINDS
OF POSTERS

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.528
DURING THE '60s AND THE '70s.

00:03:46.528 --> 00:03:49.462
I REMEMBER SEEING ART
BY THE GUERILLA GIRLS

00:03:49.462 --> 00:03:53.231
AND JUST BEING SO MOVED
AND INSPIRED,

00:03:53.231 --> 00:03:55.528
BUT JUST IN AWE
THAT THESE ARTISTS

00:03:55.528 --> 00:03:58.330
HAD CRITICIZED THE SYSTEM
IN THAT WAY.

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:00.627
AND THAT REALLY DROVE ME
TO CREATE ART

00:04:00.627 --> 00:04:04.759
THAT WAS ABOUT SHOWING US
IN MULTIDIMENSIONAL WAYS,

00:04:04.759 --> 00:04:06.462
NOT JUST POSITIVE WAYS,

00:04:06.462 --> 00:04:10.396
BUT JUST SHOWING US
AS FULL HUMAN BEINGS.

00:04:10.396 --> 00:04:12.462
WHEN I FIRST STARTED
BEING TRAINED,

00:04:12.462 --> 00:04:15.099
IT WAS SO ABOUT CREATING
THE RIGHT MESSAGE

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:20.330
AND CREATING THIS PRECISE
INTERVENTION IN THE CONVERSATION

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.528
AROUND GENTRIFICATION
OR AROUND POVERTY

00:04:23.528 --> 00:04:25.264
OR AROUND WOMAN'S ISSUES.

00:04:25.264 --> 00:04:28.099
AND I WANTED TO JUST BE SO EXACT
IN WHAT I HAD TO SAY.

00:04:28.099 --> 00:04:32.231
AND WHEN I LEARNED THE FULL
SPECTRUM OF PRINTMAKING,

00:04:32.231 --> 00:04:35.561
I REALIZED THAT PART OF ME
HAD TO JUST GIVE UP CONTROL

00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:39.462
AND JUST OPEN MYSELF UP
TO THESE ACCIDENTAL MEDIUMS.

00:04:39.462 --> 00:04:42.330
AND THAT OPENED UP
A WHOLE NOTHER PROCESS FOR ME,

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:48.264
WHICH WAS MONOTYPING AND DOING
MORE LARGE FORMAT WORKS.

00:04:52.066 --> 00:04:54.429
OOH, THAT ONE LOOKS GOOD.

00:04:58.132 --> 00:05:01.231
THE WORLD IS VERY HUNGRY
FOR YOUR STORIES.

00:05:01.231 --> 00:05:06.429
THERE IS AN ABSOLUTE NEED
FOR BOOKS ABOUT YOUR EXPERIENCE,

00:05:06.429 --> 00:05:12.759
STORIES, COMICS, SHORT FILMS,
VIDEOS, PLAYS, PERFORMANCE.

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:15.429
I WISH THAT WE AS ARTISTS
REALLY UNDERSTOOD

00:05:15.429 --> 00:05:17.330
THE OPPORTUNITY
THAT IT OUT THERE,

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:21.099
FOR US TO COLLABORATE
WITH SOCIAL CHANGE AGENTS

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:24.231
AND NOT JUST...NOT JUST,
YOU KNOW,

00:05:24.231 --> 00:05:25.726
SHOW OUR WORK TO ART LOVERS,

00:05:25.726 --> 00:05:27.099
BUT SHOW OUR WORK TO PEOPLE

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.330
WHO ARE TRYING TO CHANGE
THE WORLD.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.330
