00:00:03.019 --> 00:00:11.589
Today's Tutorial is from my 7 Deadly sins
series, and I am doing Gluttony.

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:19.399
I'm taking an Orange shadow and applying this
above the lid and kind of following the way

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:21.259
my eye shape is.

00:00:21.259 --> 00:00:25.839
And then, I'm going to take a yellow shadow
and go underneath the brow and extend it to

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:31.329
the bridge of my nose, but i'm not going to
go all the way down, I'm just going to stop

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.429
in the center of my nose and just above my
brows.

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:47.369
Then, I'm going to take a more defined brush,
and kind of intensify that orange color and

00:00:47.369 --> 00:00:50.059
follow that yellow line.

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.509
And I did experiment with a pink blush, but
it wasn't as vibrant as I wanted it to be,

00:00:54.509 --> 00:00:56.379
so I switched off to a pink shadow.

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:04.289
But I am going to use the blush to kind of
map out and gradient my under eye area.

00:01:04.289 --> 00:01:08.029
And then, Take that yellow shadow and go underneath
the waterline.

00:01:08.029 --> 00:01:12.049
And with a lime green shadow, I'm going to
add this to the tear duct and on the outer

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:14.769
corner of the eye.

00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:19.528
On the lid, I'm applying that same yellow
shadow; I did spray it with some setting spray,

00:01:19.528 --> 00:01:24.468
so that way it was more intensified and vibrant.

00:01:24.468 --> 00:01:34.568
And again, blending out that pink color.

00:01:34.568 --> 00:01:37.089
Adding a little bit of mascara to the upper
and lower lashes.

00:01:37.089 --> 00:01:39.659
And you can add falsies if you want.

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.218
I didn't have any falsies that I liked, so
I just skipped it.

00:01:43.218 --> 00:01:48.858
And for the lips, I'm applying my city color
lip stain gloss â€” and I really love it!

00:01:48.858 --> 00:01:54.549
This is in the pink color and all the products
will be listed in the description bar, as

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:59.089
usual, so please open that up, and check it
out if you have any questions.

00:01:59.089 --> 00:02:00.089
And we are finished!

00:02:00.089 --> 00:02:02.208
