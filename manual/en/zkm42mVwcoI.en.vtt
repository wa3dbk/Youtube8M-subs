Salute!

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:07.180
So the Phantom camera went out to the doctor to get fixed like we told you earlier

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:15.000
But we do have some videos in stock that we had uploaded a while ago on my personal channel

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.620
So I think it's time to use these videos and we're gonna put them out on this channel so you guys can enjoy it

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.960
But oh ya I forgot

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:23.200

Alright so what you're about to watch today is

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.020
A video that I've done earlier this year.. or less than a year ago

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.180
Probably early 2014 yeah

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.320
So we've filmed a chameleon eating crickets

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.620
And I thought that it was interesting

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.620
I thought it was interesting in slowmotion it looked cool so..

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.200
So I did some work on it 

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:58.200
And it's my pleasure to share this one with you guys

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.700
For those that are scared of insects or stuff like that

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.960
