00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.200
Hi, I'm Emily Larew continuing on with our
intermediate hip hop combination. We're now

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:11.250
on our fifth count of eight counts, five through
eight, and we will be doing--adding our scarecrow

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.190
and snap. So, we just finished out on four.
Your hand is in high five position. You are

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:23.539
going to wave it. Your hands go back into
a blade, and they go out and around, and six.

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:28.730
So your elbows are straight in line with your
shoulders, arms hanging, dangling down like

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.219
a scarecrow. We're here on four, you're going
to go five and six. All right, stepping forward

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:42.110
on our right foot, we're going to go five
and six. So our toes are turning to the right.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:48.430
Try it again. So our toes are facing in, we
go five and six, keeping your knees bent.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:56.890
So let's put our arms with our legs. Three,
four, five, and six. Good. From here you are

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.980
going to pound on your leg with your fist.
Make sure it's to the diagonal and not straight

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:08.080
back, because otherwise we'll lose it in the
front. So here you are on six, we're going

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:15.960
to lean forward, seven and--so as you can
tell I'm leaning forward--seven and, every

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.670
time I hit my leg. So, you're going to straight
your right leg, bend your left leg, from there

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.150
I want you to pretend like you've got dust
on your shoes, the bottom of your shoes, and

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:29.770
your wiping it off and flicking it. So, we're
going to slide, seven, eight. Good. And from

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:38.590
there I want you to snap as you dust your
foot off. So, we have six. You go seven and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.320
eight. And you're just going to lean your
head over to the left as you dust and snap.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:51.689
And your hand goes to your hip. All right,
so try it from the four. Three, four, five,

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.079
six, a seven and eight. Good. Let's put it
all together, from the top. Ready, here we

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:07.350
go. Five, six, five, six, seven, and one and
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight,

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:16.510
one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One and two, three, four, five, six, seven,

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:25.050
eight. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven,
eight. One and two, three, four, five, six,

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:31.520
seven and eight. Good. That was our fifth
count of eight for our scarecrow and our snap.
