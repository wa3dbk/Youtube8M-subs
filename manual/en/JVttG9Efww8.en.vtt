00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:13.619
Hi this megan with Beadaholique.com and
today I'm going to show you how to do

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:17.840
this half hitch knot zipper pattern for
macrame

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.189
and I'm just using a waxed cotton
cord

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:23.169
and you're gonna want

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:28.979
the outside pieces to be about five
times the total desired finish length

00:00:28.979 --> 00:00:32.049
plus a couple inches just used for
knotting

00:00:32.049 --> 00:00:37.809
so the inside piece you'll just want it to be
the length that you want finished and

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:39.770
then five times on the outside

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.730
You're actually not going to see the inside piece

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.530
except for at the ends

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.900
so keep that in mind

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:55.020
Take your lengths

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.390
knot them

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.290
and secure them

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.870
to your work surface with tape or
you can put them on a clipboard

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.810
you can safety pin it to something

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:11.410
however you like to work when your doing macrame

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.850
so

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.880
Half hitch knot is the same knot used in
a friendship bracelet

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.590
you're going to take

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.640
the left strand

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.790
and place it over the center strand

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.700
and then through the loop here,
pull the end of the left strand

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.850
you should have

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.510
this kind of a shape here and then just pull
it

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:38.760
up and to the left and tighten

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.360
then take

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.010
the right strand place it over the center
strand

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.180
through the loop, pull the end of the right
strand

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.790
and pull that up into the right to tighten
them

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.610
and that's actually all that this is.
It's just that repeated. You just alternate

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:56.650
so

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:59.150
left over

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:04.829
and pull through the loop

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.450
right over

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.450
and pull through the loop

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:16.619
and as you work it's going to

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:18.430
come up together

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.560
after you do a little bit, once it starts
to be too far in the front

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.399
you can just

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:27.939
grab the ends and

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:34.939
pull them to the back until they're at the sides
again

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.869
it gives you an alternative
to the

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:41.819
plain square knots

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.669
for the sides of a bracelet or

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:49.609
any kind of piece of macrame that
you want to do

00:02:49.609 --> 00:02:53.389
and you can just finish this the same
way that you would finish

00:02:53.389 --> 00:03:00.389
macrame square knotting. We do have
a video on how to do that

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:07.059
Every few stitches you grab the
sides pull it back until it's flat

00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:10.189
and that's how you get that zipper tooth looking pattern
