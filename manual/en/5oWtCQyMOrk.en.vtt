00:00:00.554 --> 00:00:03.844
- Okay! Ready, set,
- Woo Hoo!

00:00:04.952 --> 00:00:06.888
(funky music)

00:00:09.007 --> 00:00:10.409
- I'm 67!

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:12.236
- 66, babe!

00:00:12.236 --> 00:00:13.375
- I'm 72.

00:00:13.375 --> 00:00:16.361
- Oh wow, bravo.
- Sweet! Yeah!

00:00:16.361 --> 00:00:18.617
(funky music)

00:00:22.904 --> 00:00:24.895
- Uh, swam with snakes in Argentina.

00:00:24.895 --> 00:00:26.032
- White-water rafting.

00:00:26.032 --> 00:00:27.475
- I'm not gonna say.

00:00:27.475 --> 00:00:28.386
- Oh!

00:00:28.386 --> 00:00:29.428
- Too extreme.

00:00:29.428 --> 00:00:30.606
- My name's Bill Booth.

00:00:30.606 --> 00:00:33.248
I developed tandem jumping
in the early 1980's.

00:00:33.248 --> 00:00:35.340
There is not now, nor will there ever be,

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.266
a perfect parachute, a
perfect airplane or pilot,

00:00:38.266 --> 00:00:40.339
or for that matter, a perfect student.

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:42.412
(women singing)

00:00:42.412 --> 00:00:43.569
- I don't see any gravestones.

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:45.396
(laughing)

00:00:45.396 --> 00:00:46.717
- We're gonna get you all ready right now.

00:00:46.717 --> 00:00:48.668
Who wants to be the first to?

00:00:48.668 --> 00:00:50.476
- Why not? I'll go.

00:00:50.476 --> 00:00:51.833
(laughing)

00:00:51.846 --> 00:00:52.791
- At first, my friend said,

00:00:52.791 --> 00:00:55.250
they're not really gonna make
you go skydiving are they?

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.407
Which I think is hilarious

00:00:56.407 --> 00:00:58.236
but I'm so grateful for the opportunity.

00:00:58.236 --> 00:00:59.841
- You gotta get out there and enjoy life.

00:00:59.841 --> 00:01:01.406
What's life if you don't live it?

00:01:01.406 --> 00:01:02.563
Let me feel that jumpsuit.

00:01:02.563 --> 00:01:03.539
- I want a jumpsuit!

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.590
I think they are adorable looking.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.618
- I think I'll go au naturel.

00:01:08.618 --> 00:01:11.422
- Angels fly because they
take themselves lightly.

00:01:11.422 --> 00:01:14.414
Don't take life too seriously.

00:01:15.122 --> 00:01:16.206
- I love that one.

00:01:16.206 --> 00:01:18.582
I used to say that all the
time, I'd forgotten it.

00:01:18.582 --> 00:01:21.103
(ominous music)

00:01:24.497 --> 00:01:25.411
- [Voiceover] You ready to skydive?

00:01:25.411 --> 00:01:26.476
- Sure am!

00:01:26.476 --> 00:01:28.305
- [Voiceover] Yeah!

00:01:28.726 --> 00:01:31.152
(intense music)

00:01:49.516 --> 00:01:52.035
- [Voiceover] They open the
door for that first time,

00:01:52.035 --> 00:01:55.834
and you actually see how far
you are away from the Earth.

00:01:55.834 --> 00:02:00.203
That's where it really begins
to sink in, what you're doing.

00:02:00.203 --> 00:02:03.117
(inspirational music)

00:02:26.838 --> 00:02:29.499
They say there's peak life experiences.

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.970
Well this was one of them!

00:02:35.345 --> 00:02:39.931
You can't grab enough of the
scenery in your mind's eye.

00:02:43.045 --> 00:02:44.954
- [Voiceover] It's total faith

00:02:44.954 --> 00:02:48.368
knowing that everything's
going to be fine.

00:02:49.844 --> 00:02:50.798
- [Voiceover] I felt no fear.

00:02:50.798 --> 00:02:53.337
I felt no fear of the ground below

00:02:53.337 --> 00:02:55.920
and me not attached to it.

00:02:58.992 --> 00:03:00.922
The transition to the parachute opening

00:03:00.922 --> 00:03:04.534
is almost like going through
a different dimension.

00:03:05.941 --> 00:03:08.963
- [Voiceover] It was so peaceful.

00:03:12.076 --> 00:03:16.181
- It was like some kind
of euphoric sorta nirvana.

00:03:16.181 --> 00:03:17.339
You see the ground coming up

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:20.406
and you know it's all going
to be over in a few seconds.

00:03:20.406 --> 00:03:22.885
And it was just amazing.

00:03:22.885 --> 00:03:25.018
Woo! Piece of cake babe.

00:03:25.018 --> 00:03:26.705
What are you talkin?
- [Voiceover] Yeah!

00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:28.024
- [Voiceover] You can let
go of the harness now.

00:03:28.024 --> 00:03:29.387
(laughter)

00:03:29.387 --> 00:03:31.235
- Now I need a shot of whiskey!

00:03:31.235 --> 00:03:33.328
(laughing)

00:03:33.328 --> 00:03:35.725
- I feel like I aged 10 years.

00:03:35.725 --> 00:03:36.884
How does my hair look?

00:03:36.884 --> 00:03:39.098
- That air is so loud
like a freight train.

00:03:39.098 --> 00:03:40.865
- And I'm still not hearing very well,

00:03:40.865 --> 00:03:44.299
I hear echos in my head,
but that will go away.

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.676
- It's not a matter of feeling younger,

00:03:46.676 --> 00:03:50.090
it's just being more confident,
being in more control.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:51.979
- I don't feel old anyway.

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:53.015
(laughing)

00:03:53.015 --> 00:03:55.331
- I just exceeded I think
one of my own limits.

00:03:55.331 --> 00:03:57.526
- I feel very proud of myself.

00:03:57.526 --> 00:03:59.639
- Regret would be not to do it.

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.532
- It was wonderful.

00:04:02.962 --> 00:04:04.933
I never want to do it again.

00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:07.148
- I would do it again if
I had the opportunity.

00:04:07.148 --> 00:04:08.814
- I've always taken that leap of faith

00:04:08.814 --> 00:04:10.947
and it's always paid off.

00:04:10.947 --> 00:04:13.321
(inspirational music)
