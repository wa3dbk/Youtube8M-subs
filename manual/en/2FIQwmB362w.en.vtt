00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:02.570
My name is Aaron Kyro

00:00:02.570 --> 00:00:04.390
I've been skateboarding for many years

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.379
And today I'm going to teach you how to do
a hard flip

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.179
You can put your wheels in a crack if you
want to but you don't have to

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:15.139
I'm just going to do it for the purpose of
showing you the foot position here

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.100
So you see my front foot is turned almost
at a 90 degree angle

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:21.480
So it's almost straight up on the board

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.330
And my back foot is off on the tail but it's
way off to the back of the side

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.760
And on this trick you're going to be kind
of on the ball of your feet

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:35.590
On both feet. You can see how my front foot
is propped up, turned a lot

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.610
And my back foot is propped up on the edge
as well

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.790
Because your back foot is going to shove forward

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.660
And your front foot, like I just showed you
there

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.210
Is going to shove off the side causing the
flip

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.400
This is a bit of an awkward foot position

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.680
Because you have to get your front foot out
of the way

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.079
So your board can flip around

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.860
So here's another show of how the board is
going to turn in the air

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.190
You're going to catch it with your front foot
and then land

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:03.559
And here's a couple ways that you can practice

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:07.710
So a good way to practice this trick is just
to practice flipping the board

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.799
And stepping off with your back foot and letting
your front foot stay on there

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:15.270
And of course the more you practice the flick
of the board

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.060
Before you actually start committing, the
better

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.619
You'll just get more used to it

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.670
The hardest part of this trick is actually

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:24.469
Just getting your front foot out of the way

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:27.509
That's why I put my foot so straight like
that

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:30.170
Because I can flick it with my toe

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.549
But I can still get my front foot off the
side enough

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.189
To get it out of the way of the board and
let the board spin

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:39.950
So with your back foot you're going to do
a front shove motion

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.229
A front sweep and with your front foot

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.020
You're just going to do the same kind of kick
flip motion

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.749
But you're going to have your foot very straight

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:51.529
And like I said, it's just to get that front
foot out of the way

00:01:51.529 --> 00:01:52.959
The board will flip rather easily

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:55.819
Because your back foot is shoving the board
right into

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:58.219
Your toe of your front foot

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:01.359
So yeah, here's another view of it straight
on

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.789
And then when it pops around, you can practice
the catch

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:07.119
As well while stepping off

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.209
When it pops around, you're going to catch
it with your front foot

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.599
While it's still in the air

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:12.819
And then just put both feet down

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.650
I know you guys can get this one. It does
take a lot of practice

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.629
But you guys will get it down, I'm sure of
that

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.489
If you don't have your kickflips or your heelflips
or your 180s

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.769
Some of your basic tricks down

00:02:22.769 --> 00:02:26.569
I definitely recommend this video here: Skateboarding
Made Simple

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.180
I put a ton of work into it. It's 50 minutes
long

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.069
I know you're going to like it

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:35.790
Also if you want to watch the slow motion
version of the hard flip

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.569
You can click the link above and that will
take you there

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:42.129
Sometimes watching the slow-mo version also
helps out

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:45.920
To see the foot placement and to see how to
move your foot

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.370
Here's some other playlists of some other
videos

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.849
I want to thank you guys a lot for watching
all my videos

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.810
And for all your support
