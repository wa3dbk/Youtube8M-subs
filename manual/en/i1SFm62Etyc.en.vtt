00:00:15.419 --> 00:00:18.910
Welcome to Nuke Norway's Top 5 Funniest Game
Glitches.

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:22.199
I'm Jay Davis and I'm gonna be counting 'em
down.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.170
I wish I could talk that way all the time
"Luke I am your father... and under this costume,

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.449
I am also a large black man".

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:36.120
Anyway, at number 5 on our countdown of funny
game glitches, spotted by Youtube user venom

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.519
4911, we have the spinny kitty glitch from
the game "Witcher".

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:43.660
Here kitty kitty.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.000
Kitty?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.019
Oh my god!

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.359
Kitty!?!

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.479
No kitty NO!

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:56.749
...Kitty?

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:03.219
At number 4, from Youtube user Great SkillsBF,
we have the disco zombie from the game "Killing

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.420
Floor".

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.830
What do you do when you find a glitchy dancing
fat zombie in a game?

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:19.380
Well you dance along of course!

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:29.299
See?

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.310
You can never have a good zombie dance party
without some asshole coming along and shooting

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:35.170
someone in the face!

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.811
At number 3, from Smillster, we have the crazy
dumpster glitch from the game Skater 3.

00:01:39.811 --> 00:01:49.189
Don't make green dumpster angry, you won't
like green dumpster when he's angry!

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:57.320
At number 2, from Youtube user wetGaming1...
er, why is he wet?

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:05.960
Anyway from Wetgaming1, we have the ice errr
"incident" from the game NHL 12.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:14.630
Oh no... that's definitely gonna be a penalty.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:19.180
And at number 1 from Youtube user ItsThaBus,
we have the Shaun! glitch from the game Heavy

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.180
Rain.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.730
Warning there are some spoilers in this clip,
so if you are playing or plan on playing Heavy

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:33.510
Rain, close your eyes and put your fingers
in your ears... and sing Old McDonald or something.

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.840
Anyway here's what happened, these guys were
playing Heavy Rain and the main character

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.310
got stuck in an audio loop and they could
make him say "Shaun!" over and over during

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.630
the closing cinematics of the game.

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:50.400
The footage is a little wobbly because it
was recorded from a video camera, but it's

00:02:50.400 --> 00:03:31.379
still fucking hilarious!

00:03:31.379 --> 00:04:32.380
Check it out.

00:04:32.380 --> 00:04:38.680
