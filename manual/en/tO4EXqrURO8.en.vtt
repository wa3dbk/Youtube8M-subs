00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:12.730
Fallen leaves are in plentiful supply at
this time of year

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.950
and they're one of the best sources of
organic matter for gardeners.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.160
We'll show you 7 ways to make use of the
season's most abundant crop.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.860
Leafmold is gardeners' gold.

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:25.900
It's what's left when leaves have rotted down after a year or two,

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.560
and can be used in many ways in the
garden.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.960
It is low enough nutrients so as not to scald tender seedlings

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.710
but with just the right quantities to
dramatically improve soil structure

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:38.170
and boost its water retention.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:40.940
Make leaf
mold by creating a wire mesh bin

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.920
out of 4 sturdy upright posts wrapped in
chicken wire and secured in place

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.600
Simply heap your
leaves into it and leave them for a year or two.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.460
An even easier method is to fill
ordinary plastic sacks about three-quarters full,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.540
tie the top securely, and puncture holes into the bottom and sides to allow its contents to breathe.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.020
Place the bags out to the way and forget
about them for a year or two.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.939
Great compost is made by getting an even
mix of browns and greens,

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:13.040
and fallen leaves are an excellent
source of carbon-rich browns.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.440
Add them in layers, alternating with your
usual sources of nitrogen-rich greens

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.300
and leave for a season.

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.080
Turn the pile
occasionally to aerate it if required.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.040
If you use hot composting methods, just add a small amount of leaves

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.560
and try to shred them and mix them in thoroughly first,

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.180
as they don't break down as quickly as the other
ingredients.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.260
Shred leaves to make an attractive
organic mulch

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.290
which can be used throughout your
garden and containers.

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.780
Just add a 2- to 3-inch layer of the shredded leaves to your soil

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.080
but take care to keep it away from the
stems of your plants.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.240
The mulch will help to retain water and will suppress weed germination.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.500
Leafmold
also makes an excellent mulch.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.900
Fork shredded leaves right into your soil
before winter.

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.920
Next spring you'll find earthworms and
other microorganisms teeming in your soil,

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.670
which will be crumblier and water-retentive. 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.640
Just take care not to add too many,

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.930
as large quantities can deplete
nitrogen in the soil as they break down.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.420
A 6-inch blanket of leaves protects
tender plants from winter wind and cold.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.560
Cover cold-hardy vegetables such as
carrots, kale, leeks and beets,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.280
and you'll be able to harvest them all
winter.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.040
You'll need to provide some sort of frame around the leaves to prevent them from blowing away.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:32.000
This no-dig method of gardening is best started or replenished in the fall.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.860
It involves layering greens and browns
on a bed to 2 feet high

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.160
which will soon rot and sink down.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.360
As a rule of thumb, you need twice as many browns in each layer as you do greens,

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.740
and leaves make a great source of browns
at a time when they are most plentiful.

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.680
If you run out of steam with all the
other methods,

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.340
bag them up as you would for making
easy leafmold, and leave them.

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:58.600
They make an excellent source of browns early in the growing season (when they're often in short supply)

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.520
and if you do forget about them you'll find wonderful bags of leafmold!

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.920
The best leaves to use are oak, beech and
hornbeam.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.780
Other deciduous tree leaves also work,
well, but thicker leaves such as horse chestnut,

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.940
sweet chestnut, walnuts and sycamore will take longer to break down.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.740
Tough evergreen leaves like holly take too long for even the most patient gardener,

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:22.640
and are best shredded before adding to the compost heap.

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.580
Pine tree needles can be collected to
make an acidic leafmold

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.540
suitable for ericaceous plants such as
the blueberry,

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.600
 but they can take many years to break down.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:37.320
Be careful with some kinds of leaves -
walnuts, eucalyptus and camphor laurel leaves

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:41.080
contain substances that inhibit
plant growth, and are best avoided.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.860
And never use
leaves which have been exposed to pollutants,

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:48.930
such as those from the roadside,as you
don't want to introduce problems into your soil.

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:52.240
It might be tempting to just let nature
run its course

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:54.680
and to leave them where they fall or blow.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:57.240
Left on the grass however, they will exclude light

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:01.800
and if left in big enough quantities can
form a barrier through which water cannot pass,

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.280
This will result in dead patches of
grass by next spring, so raking them up is advisable.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:10.959
Clearing
leaves may seem like an endless task,

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:12.720
but the results are well worth it.

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.980
Putting your leaves to good use before
winter

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:17.939
is a great way to get a head start on next season's growing

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.840
and ensure a great supply of organic
matter for your plot.

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:32.920
