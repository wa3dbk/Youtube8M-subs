00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.120
So we're changing the door on this minivan,

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.940
Plymouth Minivan. Plymouth Voyageur 1999.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:15.400
And we had to take this piece,

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:21.420
we had to take this piece out of the back end here,

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.820
so the centre track will come out.

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:27.240
This piece just screws in there,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.320
so that the centre track will slide out of it.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:35.860
We also took the bolts out of the bottom hinge,

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.260
and out of the top hinge,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:47.500
and therefore we put them back into here, and into there.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.840
Should be easy, we've only been at this for ten minutes,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.980
so we should have it back on in another ten minutes.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.309
So, we slipped that back in,

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:05.040
and we've got a couple of bolts into the top hinge

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.280
in here again, and putting the bolt in the bottom now.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.920
And then we'll put the cable on, what's the cable for?

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.020
It's for the locking. Locking, okay.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.940
The door actually locks in down here. Oh okay.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:24.980
And there's a bolt here that locks in that way. Yeah. so,

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.540
we have these bolted back together now.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.920
This is back together, and that cable is together.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.100
The cable is for the lock when it goes backwards,

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.500
so it doesn't slide on you,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.460
and then you can undo it by doing that.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.080
So, it's all working great. Space is nice.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:48.360
Everywhere is nice and even here.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.420
That's what you have to look at, is your mouldings,

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.120
or your doors, if they're all even because you

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:00.500
may have to adjust the tightening of those brackets.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.380
So, looking good, it's got, totally matched the paint

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:12.500
of the car that was in the auto wrecker. Fantastic job.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.240
