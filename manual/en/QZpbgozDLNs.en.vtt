00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:09.539
Hello, my name is Bob Strosin from Golden
Eagle Log Homes.

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:15.160
Today, we're going to go over our weather
tight window and door flashing system.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:20.340
Here at Golden Eagle, we have developed the
very best flashing system available on the

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:26.590
market today, this will keep out the wind,
water, bugs, keep the customer from having

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.570
any problems and you the builder from having
any callbacks.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.730
To start off, you're going to set your window,
once your window is set, you are going to

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.570
measure out four and a half inches on each
side, four and a half inches on the bottom,

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.120
seven and a half inches on the top and just
take a Skil saw and put a saw kerf in the

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.120
logs.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.820
This is all explained on the plan, we are
going to send you a flashing that will slip

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.640
into that saw kerf, like that.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.710
Before that flashing is slipped in, we would
like to take and have a bead of silicone caulk

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.240
run around a nailing flange.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.080
The side pieces are then slipped in.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:18.909
After the side pieces are slipped in, a bead
of caulk is run around the log and the flashing.

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:26.909
We are going to send you a half log or split
log for trim and that is nailed in to the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:35.210
jam with 10-penny casing nails that we provide.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:43.400
Okay, once the trim is all fastened in we
then put this drip cap on that top saw kerf,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:49.170
just like that, very easily done, very weather
tight and looks terrific.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:53.300
Once it's all finished, you are going to want
to caulk the joints all the way around the

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.020
window and on top of the drip cap.
