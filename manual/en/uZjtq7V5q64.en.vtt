00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.299
Hello, in this segment we're going to cover
automotive chains, the different styles and

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:11.910
their appropriate uses. Basically we have
two different style chains and there's a lot

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.360
of different variations out on the market
of these chains, but its just basically two

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.210
different styles that are most commonly referred
to as automotive chains and that be in the

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.449
cable chain and in the standard chain and
then you got various combinations of mixtures

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:33.090
of both. And the basic difference is the standard
chain is made of as you can see all made of

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.360
chain, its much heavier built a lot of times
you'll have a welded on portion through the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.580
center links of a hardened material to give
a better bite into ice and it also gives a

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:51.050
longer lasting because its a hardened material.
Generally its just got a much more aggressive

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:57.030
bite to it a lot better traction capabilities,
but its also much bigger, much heavier and

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.900
as you can see in size and design that this
wrap around your tire is going to give you

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.799
a much rougher ride if you're on a smooth
surface then for say the cable chain next

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:15.260
to it. And these are commonly used mostly
on trucks and automotive as well. If you live

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.960
in a situation where you're going to be driving
in the snow and bad weather eight or nine

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.569
months out of the year on unpaved roads, unmaintained
roads, then these are definitely a better

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:31.170
fit for you. The actual chains themselves
will last longer and give you more mileage

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:39.609
and a lot more aggressive bite. But for people
for temporary driving uses like cars, that's

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:46.709
where the cable chains come in. They're a
much lighter design, they don't add as much

00:01:46.709 --> 00:01:52.429
size requirements as far as extra clearance
in the wheel wells and because of their design

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:59.369
of cables versus chains, they're much smoother
and much quieter. So it gives you a lot better

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.899
ride quality than the chains would. But it
suffers a little bit in the traction capabilities.

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.450
This particular cable chain here is one of
the high quality ones which gives you the

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.120
ability to replace individual links. Most
of the cable chains aren't designed that way.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.489
And basically its all just put together with
aircraft grade cable which you see on the

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:25.150
actual traction links that wrap around the
tire. These are sections of spring which is

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:30.819
a hardened material. So its a real hard just
cutup sections of spring put on there and

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.620
that will give a better bite into ice and
snow and because its hardened, it will last

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:40.659
longer than wearing on the cable. And so those
are the basic two types of chains that are

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.280
available and out on the market for the automotive
systems and they both have their pros and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.860
cons and we'll get more in detail into that,
I just wanted to get you familiarized with

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.290
them before we start our training session.
Please watch our next session, we'll cover

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:53.860
the safety.
