00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.440
one, two, three, four!

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:04.180
Rev up your engines!

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.540
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.040
today I'm going to show you why it's a good
idea to wax your car, because if you

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:27.560
don't, your car can end up like this,
all faded and rusty, and to think that

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.350
this was once my car, I sold it to a
customer years ago, needless to say it

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:38.450
hasn't been waxed even once, in all those
years, now as crazy as it sounds, the

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.930
paint on your car is still somewhat
flexible, and if you don't wax it and

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.480
keep it pliable, it'll crack fade and
rust, now once it starts cracking, it's

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.880
too late,
so you need to wax it so the cracks

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.260
never start in the first place, now you
don't want to wax over dirt because the dirt

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.390
will scratch it, and it won't seal it
right, so first you have to wash your car,

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:05.180
use a little soap that's made just
for washing cars, then rinse the car off

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.680
before you use the soap, and when you're
cleaning with the soap, don't use a sponge

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.240
they can actually scratch the paint, I
use this sheep's wool mitt, it does a

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:21.530
good job cleaning, and it doesn't scratch,
let's start cleaning, and if you notice,

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.790
I'm doing it in the shade, don't wash
your wax a car and a Sun, it'll spot up,

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.330
you want to do in the shade, so you can
dry off easy and the Sun won't make it

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.030
spotty, then rinse all the soap off,

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.909
and then when you're done rinsing, you
want to get a chamois and take it off, I use

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.780
ione of these synthetic ones, because they
work fine and they last for years this

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.930
thing's over five years old, still
doesn't have rips and tears and it dries

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.570
fine, keep squeezing the water out,
and wiping it off, so there's no water

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.210
spots, and then comes a patience part, you
want to wait an hour or so in the shade,

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:01.409
so it dries off, because you don't want to
wax a car that has any water on it, and you

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.259
don't want to put it in a Sun, because
the Sun will get it too hot and the wax

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.209
won't work right, then once the car is
totally dry, get out the wax, and start

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.519
waxing, now there's all kinds of waxes,
solid ones, liquid ones, ones that claim

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:19.110
they last forever, but really, the solid
wax ones that are hard, that are a little

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.739
bit harder to put on, but they last
longer, and they're going to make your car

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:27.450
look better in the long run, the ones you
squirt on they don't hold up as well, now

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.519
once the cars dry, you get one of these
applicators, rub it inside on the hard

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:38.450
wax, and then do circular motion on the
car, do a section at a time,

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.600
because you don't want to get a whole
bunch of an on, then when it dries, it's

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.920
too hard to get off, so you do like the
hood, do the whole hood, and wait a few

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.209
minutes, and then start buffing off the
first side you did, then the other side,

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.500
when you see it starting to get dry and
hazy like this, it's time to buff it off

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:59.970
with a towel, now some guys are fanatics
and Ithey will use these microfiber towels, me,

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:03.299
I use our old house towels and they're
worn out and the wife is going to throw them

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.310
away,
hey I run it through the washer they're

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.510
nice and soft and they're good for
buffing, you just gently buff it off in a

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.829
circular motion, and you turn the tile
every so often, so you don't load it up

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:20.280
with wax, and when you're done with this
side, you can now see that the other side

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.000
is dry and you can buff that, waxing your
car section-by-section, gives it a good

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.500
gloss, doesn't build up too much, and it
will buff out really nicely, if you do

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.859
the whole car and then go back, some of
that white stuff is going stay on and your

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:39.359
car is going to look horrible, and of course
people are going to say, okay how often

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:44.880
should I wax my car, well it's a good idea to
wax it four times a year, once for each

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.830
season, and yeah it could be a hassle and if you're lazy, you can pay a

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:54.210
wax place to wax it for you, but just
realize, are they going to do as good of a job as

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:59.850
you are on your own car, and sure I'm as
lazy as the next guy, but I'm also cheap

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.400
so I do it myself, because really do you
want your car to end up looking like

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.200
this, at least while you own it, and
really wouldn't you rather have a nice

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.100
shiny car to drive around in, and
remember if you got any questions just

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.280
visit the Scotty Kilmer channel and
I'll answer them as soon as I'm done

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.510
drinking some of this moonshine!
