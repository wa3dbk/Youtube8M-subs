00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.029
Hey, everyone. I'm going to demonstrate for you

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.909
how to do a deep barbell back squat now this exercise is really going to target the glutes and quads

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.820
You will have some hamstring and calf engagement as well

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:29.449
But the few main things you want to keep in mind while doing this exercise

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.980
Is you want to keep your core nice and tight the whole time you do it keep your chest up

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.160
And you want to make sure you keep your glutes

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.369
engaged on the way down and on the way up throughout the whole exercise

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.400
Okay now to get started with the bar

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.589
You want to keep your hands relatively close

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.460
so you can utilize the natural shelf that'll be built on your back

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.129
with closed hands and going across your shoulders and

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.129
Whenever you pick the bar up off the rack you want to get your whole body

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.560
Under the bar before you pick it up

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.560
because when you start to lift really heavy you don't want to have one foot forward one foot back and

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:02.179
risk injuring yourself

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:03.030
Okay

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.720
So I'm going to do I like to line up my thumbs on the edge of the grip of the bar and then swing them

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.720
down to make sure they're even

00:01:11.399 --> 00:01:14.299
My shoulders like this get my whole body underneath

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.720
Push it up now I'm stepping all the way back for demonstration purposes

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.359
You should stay in the rack while doing this exercise

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.379
So I put my feet a little wider than shoulder width apart

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:31.729
And then my toes kind of stick out to the sides a little bit just like this

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:38.329
I'm gonna keep my core nice and tight, and I try and keep my wrist straight and then I'm going to flex my glutes, okay

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.100
So you're going to come down and then guys explode up and

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.949
breathe out on the way up. Just like this glutes tight core engaged

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.330
Just like that down

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.190
glutes engaged core engage down

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.759
Up a couple more down

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.050
up

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.050
one more

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.009
just like that with. Re-rack

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:16.359
So that's how you do a deep barbell back squat. Hope you guys enjoyed this demonstration video and as always
