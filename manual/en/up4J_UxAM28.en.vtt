00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.459
Hi there I'm Andrea the senior designer
here at Beadaholique

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.730
in today's video I'm gonna show you how
to do a brick stitch

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:18.400
to teach you brick stitch today

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.050
I'm gonna use three different colors a
Miyuki

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.640
4 millimeter cube beads I've got

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.699
lovely brick red color a mustard yellow
color

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:29.300
and

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.570
nice deep purple color and I've got a
contrasting

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.500
green stopper bead. I've got black

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.769
wildfire thread  in the point 016

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.070
size threaded onto my size

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.220
10 needle and the only reason I'm using
black today is as usual to

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.500
be able to show you the thread path a
little bit more

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.159
easily against the colors but normally
you would use a similar colored thread

00:00:58.159 --> 00:00:59.269
or crystal

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:04.360
colored thread so that you cannot see
the thread like most bead stitches

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:08.090
first I'm gonna add a stopper bead leaving
about

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.070
a six- to eight-inch tail you go through
the stopper bead and then

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.960
you past through it one more time

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.710
and that will keep your beadwork on your thread

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:27.100
And now the base row for brick stitch is
actually

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.820
a stitch that we have separate video for
and it's called ladder stitch

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.860
so if you do not know ladder stitch already please review

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:38.979
this video before moving on to the
second row

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.270
once you have your base row completed

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.429
what I like to do is

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:50.569
flip my work over to start work on the
second row to do this

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:54.630
I'm gonna pick up the second color the
yellow color I'm gonna pickup

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.310
two of these beads and I'm going to pass
my needle

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.160
underneath the thread that is connecting

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:09.160
the last two beads of the base row 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.850
this should cause your beads to sit on
top

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.360
of the base row you gonna go

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:27.460
back up through the first bead

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:32.760
of the second row down through the second
bead

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.540
and now you're gonna pick up the thread
between

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.850
the second to last and the third to last
bead

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.640
in the base row you're gonna pass between
those two beads and through

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:54.640
the thread connecting them you can go
back

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:59.520
up through the second bead in the second row

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:05.489
pull tight now you're going to add

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.500
pick up one more bead

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.370
and then you're going to you

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.430
pass through the thread between

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:19.530
the next

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:26.459
two beads in the base row go back

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.970
up through that last bead that you added

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:37.049
add one more bead and you're going to continue
in this manner until you have

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:43.470
the second row completed

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:47.140
you can flip your bead work again so you're always working in the same

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.400
direction basically

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.420
now as you can tell

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:57.000
think that most people would agree that
it would be easy to do

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.290
decrease the stitch by

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.560
completing the next row the way that
we did that row and that row

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.090
and it would gradually get smaller like
a pyramid

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:12.459
so if that's what you want

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.620
then that is very easy to do but if it's
not what you on

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:21.709
then what you're going to do is pick up

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:25.789
two beads of your third row and this time

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:30.990
you're going to go through

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.380
the last bead in the previous row

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:43.380
and also through

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.300
the thread between the

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.570
first two beads in your base row

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.700
you're gonna pull that tight and then go

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:59.070
up through the last

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:02.880
bead of the second row

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.050
up through the first bead

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:13.039
of the third row back

00:05:13.039 --> 00:05:16.310
down through

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:20.050
the second bead of  the third row and
through

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:23.070
the thread between the first two beads

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:29.400
and the second row and then

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:32.950
back up through that second bead and that's
how you begin

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:38.810
the third row and then from there on
your gonna complete that row exactly how

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.190
you did the previous row

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:44.560
and then you're gonna do the fourth row
how you did the second row and

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:48.140
so on and so forth now that you have
come to the end of the third row

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.360
you've picked up your final bead of this row what you're going to do

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:56.860
is you're going to add the bead you can

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.300
put it into place if you like

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.130
but you need to go past your 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.440
needle down through the last

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:14.390
bead in the second row and this is the
tricky part

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:17.970
you're going to pass it

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.110
underneath the thread

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:24.860
connecting the last two beads

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.620
of the base row and then

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:32.380
back up through the layers back up through

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.700
the last bead

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:42.700
of the second row

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:49.529
and the last bead of

00:06:49.529 --> 00:06:52.599
the first row

00:06:52.599 --> 00:06:55.960
to tighten that stitch up

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:59.479
you're gonna go back through those last two

00:06:59.479 --> 00:07:04.950
beads of the last row once again

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.630
so as you can see your thread is coming out of

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:15.490
the second bead of the third row

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:19.260
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to pass
it

00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:22.589
between

00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:26.279
the two last beads underneath that thread

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:29.310
go back through that same

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.909
path that you just made this method is
slightly more complex than

00:07:34.909 --> 00:07:38.300
from other ways of doing brick stitch
but it insurers that there will be no

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.390
thread

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:42.800
sticking out on the side of your bead
work which is

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.560
how some people prefer to

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:52.839
teach brick stitch this way all your thread
work is completely hidden

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:55.390
and they have it that's basic brick
stitch
