Hey goalies, this is Mike, in this video let's
take a closer look at the new CCM Extreme

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.800
Flex II 860 Goal Pads

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.490
The 860 stays true to traditional EFlex design,
with traditional knee rolls here in front,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.490
you've got one break below the knee.
And if i turn the pad to the side you'll also

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:33.110
see that it's pre-curved and it's got a nice
soft break at the top. And it's got a softer

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.500
break here at the boot so you get a nice soft
pad that's also somewhat stiff here at the

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.810
5 hole so it keeps that sturdy when facing
impacts.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.510
An improvement has been made to the 860's
boot in the fact that it's got better torsional

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:52.720
flex. The pad as you can see twists a little
bit more here at your foot allowing the bottom

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.899
of the pad to move better with your skates
which improves your mobility when pushing

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.510
laterally across the crease.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.130
The 860 features some updates here to the
leg channel, you still maintain this nice

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.510
wide knee cradle, you've got a double elastic
strap that you can either wear behind your

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:13.880
knee or down to the calf lock if you want
to open it up a bit. One of the other changes

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.920
that's been made is you've got one strap now
that runs behind the knee, you can either

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.490
wear it diagonally down here at this buckle
position or you can move this buckle position

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.830
up and wear the strap directly behind the
knee.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.939
The boot has a medium depth to it, this power
push technology is again the torsional flex

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.720
that's been built in to the boot. And you've
got a standard HD foam toe tie.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.200
Unlike the Reebok XLT Series the EFlex II
860 has a very flat inside edge which helps

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.939
it seal to the ice incredibly well.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.939
The CCM Extreme Flex II 860 comes in Senior
and Intermediate sizes and we have them in

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:57.520
