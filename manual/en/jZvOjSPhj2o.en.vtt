00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:09.660
Today we're going to make a castle cake.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.200
And for that we're going to actually need
two cakes of different sizes.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.619
I've chosen to use an 8-inch square and a
6-inch square and we're going to tare our

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.770
cake, which means we're going to stack the
larger one on the bottom and then we're going

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.910
to place the smaller one on the top so we
get a, a built castle.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.230
So we start out with our 8-inch, we're gonna
put some icing on the board, and this is just

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.840
gonna help to hold our cake in place.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:35.870
And we're gonna put on our first layer of
cake, gonna put it even on the board so we

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:36.870
have a even amount around it.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:45.210
And we're gonna cut off the top of our edge
of our cake, so that it'll be nice and even

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:48.750
when we put it together.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.660
We're gonna add some icing to the middle and
that's gonna hold our second layer in place.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.810
And we'll add our second layer of cake.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:13.180
Wanna make sure that it's nice and even on
all four sides.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:29.570
If not, we can always go back and even it
out a little later.We're gonna cut away our

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:37.380
second layer on the top, so it's nice and
even .Then we'll add some more icing.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:44.030
Now for our top layer, thinking about we're
gonna do a stacked cake, we wanna get it as

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.530
even as we possibly can.

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:59.720
We're gonna take our last layer, and I'm just
gonna cut it across the top before i stack

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:05.420
it on, just so it's even on that side.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:15.390
so what we're gonna do is we're gonna flip
our cake over and we're gonna put it bottom

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.520
side up.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:22.650
Push it down a little bit so we get it nice
and even.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.810
This way we get a nice even cake across the
top.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.935
And now we're gonna give our cake a crumbcoat,
so that it can hold all the crumbs together.
