00:00:07.957 --> 00:00:08.790
What's up everybody?

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.740
Rackboyz Fitness-- if
you've seen the other video

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:15.740
with my NutriBullet, about
it jamming, a lot of people

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.080
were having this issue.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.990
And I figured out how to fix it.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.320
Now, What was happening was--
I put the original video

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:24.902
on the screen, annotation.

00:00:24.902 --> 00:00:25.970
You can check it out.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:30.520
But what was happening was
when you put your cup in,

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.956
it wasn't pressing down.

00:00:32.956 --> 00:00:35.240
The motor wasn't spinning.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.660
And that's because
these little rivets

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.020
on the side-- which when
you press your cup down,

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.770
it's what clicks into place
and it starts the motor.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.740
What happened was
they were jamming.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.810
And if you look
closely, you can see

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:51.900
that there's stuff
in the inside,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.090
because what happens
is sometimes,

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.490
when the stuff leaks, it gets
into the inside and it sticks

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:59.990
and it jams.

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:04.660
And I didn't realize at
the time what was going on.

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.640
So other people have been
having the same issue.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.190
I took a little bit
of WD-40, sprayed it

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.370
into each of the spots, let
it sit for 10, 15 minutes,

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:20.460
and it loosened right up.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.530
I did this about a week ago.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.500
And it's still good,
as you can see.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.130
I just started it
with no problem.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.510
So it's just a matter
of this stuff sticking.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.900
I just checked my YouTube.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.140
There's people
saying that they used

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.490
a solution of water and vinegar.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:41.910
And some people use oil.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.585
Just like I said, I used WD-40.

00:01:44.585 --> 00:01:46.210
You've got to just
put something that's

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.680
going to loosen up the crap
that gets into the inside of it.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.980
And that's a really
easy way to fix it.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.450
Some people take it apart.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.060
I'm not trying to take
this thing apart and go

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.560
through all the hassle.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.280
I'm just going to make a
better effort, which I have,

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.010
moving forward of trying
not to overfill my cup,

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.840
making sure it doesn't
spill and leak into here,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.990
and just try to be a little
bit more safer with this thing.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.600
But get some WD-40 if
you're having this problem

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.326
and squirt it in there,
just a little bit,

00:02:20.326 --> 00:02:21.450
and it should do the trick.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.180
So I hope this helps.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.540
Until next time, stay
focused, stay fit, people.
