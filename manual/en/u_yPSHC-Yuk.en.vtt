00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:07.120
You just learned how you're going to turn
your partner. You can add a turn yourself.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:16.039
It makes the step much more lightly, more
energetic. Let's come into our basic. Now,

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.970
I'm going to review. Her turn will be a review.
You already saw it in a previous clip. We're

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:33.230
going 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7. Let me do it again.
Again, just showing the step. 5, 6, 7, 1,

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:49.010
2, 3. Here's the full step. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5,
6, 7, 1, 2, 3. The very first part, you've

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:57.620
already learned. You're open breaking. 1,
2, 3. If you were going to decide to turn,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.420
this 3 step is very important that you take
a big enough step, because all you have is

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:16.830
5, 6, 7 to switch again. Again, let's move
it up. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7,

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:26.850
1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 1. Notice all the
leading is with the left hand. Let me break

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:33.280
down what the left hand is doing. First, you're
extending your hand on your 1 to get the open

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:41.619
break. 2, 3, goes over your partner's head
and comes back down. Your 5, is again you're

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.320
extending your arm into a similar open break.
Now, 6 is very progressive. You're bringing

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:55.439
the hand to your waist as you come 6, 7. See
that. If you place your partner's hand there,

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.979
that's a message. You're telling her keep
your hand there. Notice she keeps her hand

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:11.540
there and you pick it up out of the turn.
Again. 1, 2, 3, extend, place on your body,

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:17.420
and catch. You want to catch it right before
the 1. Again, I'll show smoothing it out a

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:29.720
little bit. 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7. Here's
our basic into the step. 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7,

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:37.310
1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, and 1,
2, 3, 5, 6, 7.
