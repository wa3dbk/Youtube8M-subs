00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.840
(bouncy piano music)

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.261
&gt;&gt; We're in the Louvre in Paris

00:00:06.261 --> 00:00:08.008
and we're looking at of the great

00:00:08.008 --> 00:00:10.020
18th Century French paintings,

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:12.657
Pilgrimage to Cythera by Watteau.

00:00:12.657 --> 00:00:15.149
&gt;&gt; Here we are looking
at a Rococo painting

00:00:15.149 --> 00:00:17.352
and the main subjects of Rococo paintings

00:00:17.352 --> 00:00:19.259
were the lifestyle of the aristocracy.

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:20.628
&gt;&gt; Well we certainly have that.

00:00:20.628 --> 00:00:22.693
Cythera is an island in Greece and it was

00:00:22.693 --> 00:00:24.690
believed, perhaps, to be the birth place

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:26.061
of the goddess Aphrodite.

00:00:26.061 --> 00:00:28.046
&gt;&gt; Cythera is an island
that was mythically

00:00:28.046 --> 00:00:30.321
associated with the goddess of love.

00:00:30.321 --> 00:00:33.667
&gt;&gt; Look, the sculpture
of her has Cupid's bow

00:00:33.667 --> 00:00:35.185
tied around it and we have

00:00:35.185 --> 00:00:36.924
a vine of roses growing up it.

00:00:36.924 --> 00:00:39.105
You can't miss the
connotations of love here.

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.853
&gt;&gt; No and there's a little
Cupid sitting below that.

00:00:41.853 --> 00:00:43.523
He's got his quiver on the ground,

00:00:43.523 --> 00:00:44.844
as though he doesn't really need

00:00:44.844 --> 00:00:46.674
to do anything here because love is

00:00:46.674 --> 00:00:48.487
all around him already.

00:00:48.487 --> 00:00:50.676
&gt;&gt; He seems to be tugging
ever so gently on the

00:00:50.676 --> 00:00:53.516
skirt of the young woman
who sits there so coyly.

00:00:53.516 --> 00:00:56.213
&gt;&gt; As though he's urging
her to fall in love

00:00:56.213 --> 00:00:58.347
and of course her male
companion seems to be

00:00:58.347 --> 00:01:00.049
doing the same thing, but she

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:02.013
looks down rather demurely.

00:01:02.013 --> 00:01:03.918
&gt;&gt; It's a bit of a conspiracy, isn't it?

00:01:03.918 --> 00:01:05.676
I'm not sure that she stands a chance.

00:01:05.676 --> 00:01:07.998
&gt;&gt; As you follow the couples as they head

00:01:07.998 --> 00:01:10.560
down the bank toward
the boat that is either

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.909
going to take them away from Cythera

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.298
or to Cythera...

00:01:14.298 --> 00:01:15.565
&gt;&gt; It should say that the art historians

00:01:15.565 --> 00:01:17.565
have been arguing this
point for quite some time.

00:01:17.565 --> 00:01:19.246
&gt;&gt; You can see that the couples get

00:01:19.246 --> 00:01:22.927
closer and closer toward
a state of intimacy.

00:01:22.927 --> 00:01:23.927
&gt;&gt; Oh, that's right.

00:01:23.927 --> 00:01:25.543
When you look at the
figures that are down below

00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:26.707
in the middle of the painting,

00:01:26.707 --> 00:01:29.239
you see the woman who holds the man's arm

00:01:29.239 --> 00:01:30.456
of her own volition.

00:01:30.456 --> 00:01:32.723
She doesn't need to be coaxed any longer.

00:01:32.723 --> 00:01:35.252
I see this progression of
figures almost as a dance.

00:01:35.252 --> 00:01:36.995
Look at the way the
hands are together as it

00:01:36.995 --> 00:01:39.733
would be in a formal
dance of the 18th Century.

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:41.893
You can see the prow of the ship with a

00:01:41.893 --> 00:01:44.563
beautifully carved nude
woman and above that,

00:01:44.563 --> 00:01:46.363
what is presumably in Cupid,

00:01:46.363 --> 00:01:49.663
there is a red silk cloth
that drapes the entire prow.

00:01:49.663 --> 00:01:52.267
We see garlands of flowers
and then you can see

00:01:52.267 --> 00:01:53.646
the oarsmen of the boat.

00:01:53.646 --> 00:01:55.017
They're ready to take these couples

00:01:55.017 --> 00:01:56.882
either to or from Cythera.

00:01:56.882 --> 00:01:59.019
I tend to think that
they're going to Cythera

00:01:59.019 --> 00:02:01.326
because Watteau has made an effort

00:02:01.326 --> 00:02:03.279
to show us a destination.

00:02:03.279 --> 00:02:05.234
We see a dark outline and

00:02:05.234 --> 00:02:07.462
presumably that is the island of Cythera.

00:02:07.462 --> 00:02:09.949
&gt;&gt; You can see the little
Puti that lead our eye

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:12.721
back into that distance with that torch,

00:02:12.721 --> 00:02:14.573
right above that island in the distance.

00:02:14.573 --> 00:02:17.933
On the other hand, there is that herm,

00:02:17.933 --> 00:02:21.133
that sculpture of Aphrodite,
that suggests that

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:24.408
this island that we're
seeing now is itself Cythera,

00:02:24.408 --> 00:02:26.990
the island of love, and that the figures

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.552
are nostalgically sadly
getting ready to leave.

00:02:30.552 --> 00:02:32.409
&gt;&gt; That's entirely
possible, but I think it's

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:34.376
also possible that it's both.

00:02:34.376 --> 00:02:36.451
That this is a painting
that is about ambiguity

00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:38.915
and should not be read
as a literal narrative.

00:02:38.915 --> 00:02:40.207
&gt;&gt; I think you're right.

00:02:40.207 --> 00:02:43.258
Love here is represented as a dance

00:02:43.258 --> 00:02:45.589
where couple take various positions in

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:47.463
relationship to one another,

00:02:47.463 --> 00:02:50.208
sometimes moving in opposing directions,

00:02:50.208 --> 00:02:52.171
sometimes moving together,

00:02:52.171 --> 00:02:54.929
sometimes one pulls another toward them.

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:57.229
We know that Watteau
was influenced by opera

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:58.804
and by plays so maybe we're seeing

00:02:58.804 --> 00:03:00.577
some aspect of that here.

00:03:00.577 --> 00:03:02.181
&gt;&gt; It's also important
to remember that this was

00:03:02.181 --> 00:03:04.348
painted to be the reception piece

00:03:04.348 --> 00:03:06.675
for Watteau to be included in the

00:03:06.675 --> 00:03:07.951
Royal Academy of Art

00:03:07.951 --> 00:03:11.136
and it's intended audience
as an aristocratic one,

00:03:11.136 --> 00:03:13.222
one that was used to formal dance.

00:03:13.222 --> 00:03:15.559
&gt;&gt; This is a new type of painting

00:03:15.559 --> 00:03:17.307
called the fete galante,

00:03:17.307 --> 00:03:20.142
an outdoor entertainment
for the aristocracy.

00:03:20.142 --> 00:03:21.926
&gt;&gt; Interestingly, Watteau was a bit late

00:03:21.926 --> 00:03:24.324
getting this to the Academy and that was

00:03:24.324 --> 00:03:27.367
because of private
commissions that intervened,

00:03:27.367 --> 00:03:30.008
but when it was accepted there was no

00:03:30.008 --> 00:03:32.137
category for the fete galante.

00:03:32.137 --> 00:03:34.420
But the painting was seen as so important

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.645
that they created a new category so that

00:03:36.645 --> 00:03:38.139
it could be accepted and this was

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:40.554
rather revolutionary,
especially considering

00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:43.521
that the Academy was strongly divided

00:03:43.521 --> 00:03:44.858
between two camps,

00:03:44.858 --> 00:03:48.083
the followers of the artist Reubens

00:03:48.083 --> 00:03:51.023
and the followers of the
French artist Poussin.

00:03:51.023 --> 00:03:52.998
&gt;&gt; That is a division between artists who

00:03:52.998 --> 00:03:55.255
adhere to a philosophy that says

00:03:55.255 --> 00:03:57.770
line is most important in painting,

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.308
that clear outlines and internal modeling

00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:03.329
and that sense of finish
were you don't see

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:05.888
the brush work is most important

00:04:05.888 --> 00:04:08.771
versus the Reubenists,
the followers of Reubens,

00:04:08.771 --> 00:04:10.475
who believe that color was most important

00:04:10.475 --> 00:04:12.251
and it's so clear when you look at the

00:04:12.251 --> 00:04:15.907
luscious colors here that Watteau was an

00:04:15.907 --> 00:04:18.549
adherent to the Reubenist ideas.

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:20.255
&gt;&gt; There's no question that the Rubeunists

00:04:20.255 --> 00:04:21.616
carried the day at this point.

00:04:21.616 --> 00:04:23.888
&gt;&gt; Absolutely and here
you can see that the

00:04:23.888 --> 00:04:26.308
outlines are soft,
figures merge a little bit

00:04:26.308 --> 00:04:28.164
into the background.

00:04:28.164 --> 00:04:30.693
They have lovely passages where we can see

00:04:30.708 --> 00:04:32.354
the hand of the artist.

00:04:32.354 --> 00:04:34.274
This is something that is very typical of

00:04:34.274 --> 00:04:37.059
Baroque Art with Reubens and also here in

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:38.613
Rococo Art with Watteau.

00:04:38.613 --> 00:04:40.845
&gt;&gt; This a period that we call the Rococo

00:04:40.845 --> 00:04:43.305
and it is the Enciene Regime that is

00:04:43.305 --> 00:04:46.891
it is the last century the
nobility will rule France.

00:04:46.891 --> 00:04:48.186
&gt;&gt; The nobility, they were all family,

00:04:48.186 --> 00:04:50.556
were less than a century away from

00:04:50.556 --> 00:04:52.449
the French Revolution which will of course

00:04:52.449 --> 00:04:55.699
annihilate this way of life literally

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.788
and usher is what we, in many ways,

00:04:57.788 --> 00:04:59.408
consider the modern world.

00:04:59.408 --> 00:05:03.159
&gt;&gt; Here we see an image of
the aristocracy at play,

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:05.411
of this fantasy of the
world they had created

00:05:05.411 --> 00:05:08.406
for themselves, but here
within a fantastical setting.

00:05:08.406 --> 00:05:18.226
