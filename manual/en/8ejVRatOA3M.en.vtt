00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.320
You could die doing what we're doing.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:17.779
You definitely go,

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.420
go crazy at times.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.259
The guys will push it.

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.499
My crew will push it to the max. How high
can we jump these 

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:29.249
water craft in the air?

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:31.769
As a leader i've learned that,

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.850
in bad weather we're coming off the water.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.040
The water temperature's 37 degrees so it could be a flat, calm day

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.790
and if you're swimming in that water for too long you will become hypothermic and death will knock on the door.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.760
As the expedition leader I've got to weigh-out everybody's wants and needs 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.880
and figure out what are necessities.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.490
When you go and you do a trip like this
you get re-calibrated. 

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:01.460
You know it's not, this is an emotional

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.870
roller coaster for us but i think a lot
of people get the impression that you know

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:09.470
some guys jumping on some Sea-Doo and
going out for a spin

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.770
is what the show's about.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.720
And it's...it

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.369
It's not. It's about a brotherhood.

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:18.160
It's about a group of guys coming together

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.190
and having a lofty goal.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.360
And achieving those goals.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.049
Or failing together and then coming
back and trying again.

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:27.880
I think we're going to be inspiring 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.509
when people start watching our shows

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:31.640
 and start seeing what we're all about.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:38.530
I think that America needs some
inspiration. We need to get off the couch. You know. Um. 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.390
I think people down in the lower 48 forgot 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.350
what being American is all about.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:43.320
and um...

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.060
It's about triumph and tragedy. 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.160
But at the end of the day overcoming it.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:50.930
The most surprising thing about season
one is we made it...

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.200
as far as we did.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:58.100
My name's Steven Mall, I'm expedition leader
of dangerous waters, and this is my next.
