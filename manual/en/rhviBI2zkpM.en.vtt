00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.600
Hey, dear brother.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.540
Hola hermanito.

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.420
You called? You alright?

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.240
Yeah, don't ask...

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.440
You've seen who it was, haven't you?

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.340
Chris, what's up?

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.700
I saw Ramon. 
- What?

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.160
Fuck, I was stone-still.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.820
After all that happened to your brother...

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.900
Chris, I'm missing you all so much. But...

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:42.120
...but you won't come.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:48.220
I'm in.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.180
It's just that I lose control easily sometimes.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.440
- Select file. -

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.200
- Shithead. -

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:11.540
- Don't feel any pity for him! -

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:16.800
Dude, we're on TV!

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.460
...this Video went viral and raised a big debate.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.980
Who's made the video? 
- God knows...

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.520
I was tortured, dude! 
- Tortured...

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.020
I've done some research on Ramon.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.220
As usual, that dick hasn't thought a bit about

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.280
us looking stupid when he shits in public.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.260
You should've thought about that in advance.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.260
He totally went through hell.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.040
Can anyone with a shitty childhood behave like that?

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.760
This guy's got no conscience. No sympathy.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:57.560
Maybe now he understands what it feels like.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.640
Hey, if you've got trouble with your family...

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.460
There's no trouble with my family!

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.180
My mum isn't my family.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:13.380
Hey! 
 - Hey.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.780
Can I stay at yours?

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.640
Was it right?

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.800
Was it right what we've done?

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.000
I hope he's not loosing his nerve and ends it all now.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.500
The video has taken the last bit of his dignity.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.260
It was the only thing that was left.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.480
Our video will last forever.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:49.220
