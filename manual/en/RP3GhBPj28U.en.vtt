00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.250
How are classes?

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.850
They’re good!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Yeah…What are you doing for fun?

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.000
Well I haven’t really done anything yet, haven’t met anyone.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.250
Well let me say this. I met a ton of great people in the residence halls doing all sorts of fun things.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.250
Okay, well if I tell you what I like to do, will you point me in the right direction?

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.000
Yeah…Let’s do it!

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.500
You should stick around after class.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
That’s a great idea.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:43.000
You can start a study group or join one. There are plenty of great places in the University Union to study. When you need a break you can play games in the Game Room.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.500
I had no idea there was all this stuff going on.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Yes, and there’s more!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:20.500
There’s the Women’s Resource Center, the Multicultural Center, and the Pride Center. You can get involved in student government. You can help shape the Sac State experience. And of course, there’s other clubs, like the Greeks. The Theater and Dance Department put on great plays and musicals. We have concerts, art exhibits, movies, and other events offered through UNIQUE programs.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.500
I love football! I’ve heard all about the Hornets and the Green Army.

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.000
You’re so smart. And check out our new field.

There’s a great bike trail here that follows the American River all throughout the city. And Peak Adventures offers exciting trips all year round. The Aquatics Center offers any water sport you can imagine. Here at The Well you can do lots of different things: rock climbing, take fitness classes, work out with your friends, or if you’re into sports, there are tons of intramural and club sports.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I don’t know where to start.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:07.500
Start anywhere! You’ll be doing fun stuff you love and making lifelong friends. College is about the whole experience and being a part of our community.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.250
I’m so excited!
