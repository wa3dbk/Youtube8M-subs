Hey everyone, I'm Mindy
from Cute Girl Hairstyles.

00:00:04.101 --> 00:00:05.600
And this morning
we're going to film

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.590
what I'm calling same side Dutch
braid, which is an outside,

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.970
you know, the
outie French braid.

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:13.960
So really fun, really cute.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:17.770
I have started by just
slightly wetting her hair down.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:22.130
And we're going to take just
kind of a triangular piece

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.460
right here by her
forehead, crown.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.920
And we're going to start just
a typical outie French braid,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.080
otherwise known as
the Dutch braid.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.892
Now we've already done videos
on all of the French braiding,

00:00:34.892 --> 00:00:36.600
so if you're learning
how to French braid

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.220
refer to some of
the other videos.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.670
OK, we're going to just
pick up hair as we go in

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:44.380
and the only trick
to this hairdo

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.130
is I'm going to try to stay
as close to her hairline right

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.650
in here by her ear as possible.

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.820
So I saw this on a girl when
I was at Walmart the other day

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.200
and it looked super cute.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.890
She was a little
older, maybe 18.

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.414
And she had done it a
little bit looser which

00:01:07.414 --> 00:01:09.080
I have a hard time
with for some reason.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.800
I always have a tendency to
pull their braids really tight.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.330
So I'm going to show
you a trick to make

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:18.020
it look lose even if you
are going to pull it tight.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.410
As you can see I am pulling--
tip your head for sec,

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:23.880
babe-- all the way, I'm
pulling hair all the way

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:24.780
from the other side.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:29.670
I want all of her head
of hair in on this side.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.820
So I'm just kind of
smoothing in as I go.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.680
That piece, right there,
the one I just did

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.700
is the hardest piece
probably of the whole thing

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.000
because you're
literally pulling hair

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.850
from the opposite side
of the head and over.

00:02:02.445 --> 00:02:05.618
Oh, we'll have to undo that one.

00:02:05.618 --> 00:02:06.890
Me no likey.

00:02:13.582 --> 00:02:18.330
OK, now I'll fix that later.

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.060
OK, keep going.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.075
You can see why I wet hers down
a little, she's got fly aways.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:39.590
Like I said, you
can do this-- I'm

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:41.380
doing kind of the tight version.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:43.730
Maybe it's because I have
younger kids and they,

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:46.950
you know, their hair tends
to fall out if I don't.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.290
But you can also do a
really loose version

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.360
of this too if you're a
little older or an adult

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.520
and it would look
really fun and cute.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.370
OK.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.730
Once I've got all
the hair picked up

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:04.750
I'm just going to
continue, finish off

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:12.910
that braid all the way down.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:13.529
Sorry, honey.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.075
And secure it with
a rubber band.

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.670
OK.

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.140
So now I'll show you a trick.

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.070
If you take it and you just tug
on those like the little bumps

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.090
part of the braid
all the way up.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.905
It's kind of the cheater
way to make it look loser.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:04:02.140
And then add a little
hairspray wherever you need it.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.260
And you're done.
