00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.740
Awhile ago, I made a tutorial on how make
a Moleskine style notebook.

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.510
Since then, many of you have asked how to
add a pocket to it.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.190
So in this tutorial, I will show you how to
add an expandable pocket to the back of your

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.129
book.

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:22.710
I still use the original book I made from
the tutorial, and it has held up pretty well.

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.789
If you're wondering why those pages look so
wrinkly, somehow my drink always sweats onto

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:30.230
my pages as I'm writing... anyways...

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.110
If you want to make this book for yourself,
check out this tutorial here.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.340
You can also find the link in the description
below.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.620
For a quick and easy way to add a pocket,
you can glue an envelope to the inside cover.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.980
You can choose to leave the flap or cut it
off.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:01:03.010
Or you can make an expandable pocket like
this.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:11.030
Here's a list of materials and tools I'll
be using to make one.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.680
First off, I'm using two 8.5x11 inch sheets
of paper.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.940
You may need to adjust some of the measurements
if your book is not the same size.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.771
I want a small border around the pocket, so
I'm going to trim off half an inch on 1 sheet

00:01:23.771 --> 00:01:27.490
of paper.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.020
Then fold it in half, and run a bone folder
along the edge.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:35.350
If you don't have a bone folder, you can check
out these substitutes here, or see the link

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.000
in the description below.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.240
Now score a line 3/4 inch from the open end.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:02:00.170
And then fold those flaps inward.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:08.810
And cut the ends at a slight angle.

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:12.980
When this is folded, you should have about
an 1/4 inch border around the pocket.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.610
Set that aside, and cut the other piece of
paper in half.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:25.650
Take one half, and cut that in half to form
two small pieces.

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:31.310
Starting with one, fold it in half.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:45.730
And then fold the sides in half like this.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:54.000
Do the same thing with the other small piece.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.430
Now glue them to the larger piece.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.090
I'm using Elmer's craft bond extra strength
glue stick.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.650
You can use other types of glue made for paper,
but I like this type because it's strong,

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.920
acid free, dries fast and won't warp your
paper.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:11.880
Glue the outer flap onto the side of the pocket.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:28.430
And make sure the middle zig-zag is folding
toward the inside of the pocket.

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:37.030
Then glue the top flap over.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:49.489
Glue the ends of the flaps to the other side
of the pocket.

00:03:49.489 --> 00:04:04.720
And glue that top flap over.

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:27.900
Finally, glue the entire pocket to the inside
cover.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.569
Now you have an expandable pocket.

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:35.199
I find it's really helpful for loose pantone
chips, swatches or business cards.

00:04:35.199 --> 00:04:39.150
