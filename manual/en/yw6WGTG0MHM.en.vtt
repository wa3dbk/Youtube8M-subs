00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:08.090
This video is for the 1998-2004 Cadillac Seville Rear Electronic Air Suspension Conversion

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.850
Installation.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:15.210
Always read the instructions first and follow all safety procedures before servicing any

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.660
vehicle.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:24.210
Before raising the vehicle, first disconnect
the ground battery cable.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.720
Now, safely raise and support the vehicle
and remove the rear wheel to gain access to

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:44.070
the rear shock.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.970
First you need to put jack stand or jack under
the control alarm to remove the lower shock

00:00:48.970 --> 00:01:12.750
mount.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:22.840
Now disconnect and remove the electronic strut
connector and disconnect the air line.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.390
Remove the line but don't discard it.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:41.320
We'll be using that line again later.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:57.780
And disconnect the sway bar end link.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:10.580
You'll need spring compressors to remove the
coil spring.

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:22.450
We removed the bottom isolator but we're going
to use it with our new coil spring.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.730
Replace the old shock with the new one.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:36.720
You have to access the shock mounts in the
trunk.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:49.180
Now compress the new coil spring and install
it.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:03:03.290
We're using the factory isolators that came
with the vehicle.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:19.460
Now connect the lower shock mount and reconnect
the sway bar end link and remove the spring

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:26.860
compressors.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:44.020
It may take some leverage to take the sway
bar end link back in.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.590
With the battery ground cable disconnected,
we're ready to install the supplied resistor

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.960
to the electronic shock connector.

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:07.180
It doesn't matter which in the resistor it's
tied into.

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:14.690
Simply plug one wire to one end of the resistor
and the other wire into the other end.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:22.409
We use a crimping tool to crimp this together.

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:35.759
Okay, after the resistor is crimped together,
go ahead and tape up the resistor and be ready

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:49.639
to re-install it back into the vehicle.

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:55.919
Use a zip tie to tie it out of the way.

00:04:55.919 --> 00:05:00.289
After you've completed this, go back up to
the top where it was originally plugged in

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:05.619
to and plug it back in.

00:05:05.619 --> 00:05:31.240
Now re-install the rear wheel and safely lower
the vehicle to the ground.

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:39.240
Please call us for a free diagnosis at 866-597-2397.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:46.289
This concludes the installation for the 1998-2004
Cadillac Seville Rear Electronic Air Suspension

00:05:46.289 --> 00:05:46.919
Conversion.
