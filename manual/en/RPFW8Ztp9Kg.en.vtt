00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.066
The President:
Good morning, everybody.

00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:07.900
I am here to announce today the
distinguished public servant I'm

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.367
appointing as our nation's new
ambassador to the People's

00:00:11.367 --> 00:00:13.500
Republic of China.

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.367
I'm making this appointment
mindful of its extraordinary significance.

00:00:18.367 --> 00:00:21.066
Given the breadth of issues at
stake in our relationship with

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:26.333
China, this ambassadorship is as
important as any in the world --

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.567
because the United States will
best be able to deal effectively

00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:32.700
with global challenges in the
21st century by working in

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.367
concert with China.

00:00:35.367 --> 00:00:39.400
There are few countries in the
world with a past so rich or a

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.300
future so full of
possibility as China.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.367
With a vast population,
a growing economy,

00:00:45.367 --> 00:00:48.967
and far-reaching influence,
China will have a crucial role

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:52.633
in confronting all the major
challenges that face Asia and

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:55.467
the world in the years ahead.

00:00:55.467 --> 00:00:57.533
And that's why we're working
with the government of China to

00:00:57.533 --> 00:01:00.567
stem the financial crisis that's
devastated economies around the

00:01:00.567 --> 00:01:03.600
world and help lay a foundation
for sustainable growth and

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.700
lasting prosperity on
both sides of the Pacific.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.734
That's why I've spoken with
Chinese President Hu Jintao

00:01:09.734 --> 00:01:11.400
about a number of
regional threats,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.900
including the situations in
North Korea and Pakistan.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.400
And that's why we will continue
working together with China on a

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.500
whole host of global challenges
-- ranging from energy and

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.433
climate change to public health;
from nuclear non-proliferation

00:01:25.433 --> 00:01:28.800
to terrorism and
violent extremism.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.967
I believe there's much to
be gained from a closer,

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:33.100
working relationship with China.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.033
But improved relations with
China will require candor and

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:39.100
open discussion about those
issues where we don't always

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.867
agree, such as human rights
and democracy and free speech.

00:01:43.867 --> 00:01:47.800
And it will require that each of
our nations play by the rules in

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.500
open and honest competition.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.300
And that's why this
ambassadorship takes on such importance.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:57.834
I can think of no one better
suited to take on this

00:01:57.834 --> 00:02:01.800
assignment than the Governor
of the great state of Utah,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.700
Jon Huntsman.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.867
When I asked Jon to
accept this critical post,

00:02:05.867 --> 00:02:07.800
I knew it would require a
sacrifice on the part of his

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.066
family, and I want to thank Mary
Kaye and all of their children

00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:14.500
for making this possible.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.233
I knew it would require a
sacrifice from Jon -- who will

00:02:17.233 --> 00:02:20.100
be giving up a seat
as a popular governor,

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:23.433
having just been reelected
to a second term.

00:02:23.433 --> 00:02:28.367
And I hope the good people
of Utah will forgive me and

00:02:28.367 --> 00:02:32.367
understand how proud they should
be of their governor for his

00:02:32.367 --> 00:02:36.467
willingness to answer
his nation's call.

00:02:36.467 --> 00:02:39.033
Finally, I knew that because
Jon is not only a Republican,

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:41.867
but a Republican who co-chaired
my opponent's campaign for the

00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:44.967
presidency, this wouldn't be the
easiest decision to explain to

00:02:44.967 --> 00:02:47.467
some members of his party.

00:02:47.467 --> 00:02:49.166
But here's what I also know.

00:02:49.166 --> 00:02:53.567
I know that Jon is the kind of
leader who always puts country

00:02:53.567 --> 00:02:57.000
ahead of party and is always
willing to sacrifice on behalf

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.633
of our nation.

00:02:58.633 --> 00:03:00.834
That's what Jon has always done.

00:03:00.834 --> 00:03:03.233
Throughout his career, Jon has
shown a willingness to move

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:07.033
beyond the old ideologies and
stale debates that all too often

00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:09.133
bring progress to a standstill.

00:03:09.133 --> 00:03:12.166
Time and again, he's brought
people together across party

00:03:12.166 --> 00:03:15.300
lines to overcome our common
challenges and to move our

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.133
nation forward.

00:03:17.133 --> 00:03:20.066
What Jon brings to this
post isn't just a steadfast

00:03:20.066 --> 00:03:22.200
commitment to advancing the
interests of the American

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.333
people; it's a lifetime of
knowledge and experience that

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:28.467
will help advance this
important partnership.

00:03:28.467 --> 00:03:30.967
Jon brings to this post
experience as a former

00:03:30.967 --> 00:03:34.700
ambassador to Singapore, who's
intimately familiar with many of

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.300
the most pressing challenges
confronting Asia.

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:40.734
He brings experience both in the
private sector and as Deputy

00:03:40.734 --> 00:03:43.400
United States Trade
Representative to Asia and

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:47.600
Africa, where he stood up for
America's economic interests abroad.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.734
And Jon is well prepared to
build a partnership that

00:03:49.734 --> 00:03:53.867
reflects a new understanding
between our two countries

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:59.467
because he's lived in Asia three
times and is fluent in Mandarin Chinese.

00:03:59.467 --> 00:04:02.633
That's the kind of ambassador we
need in China -- an ambassador

00:04:02.633 --> 00:04:05.500
who has a respect for
China's proud traditions,

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:07.767
who understands what it will
take to make America more

00:04:07.767 --> 00:04:11.367
competitive in the 21st century,
and who will be an unstinting

00:04:11.367 --> 00:04:14.900
advocate for America's
interests and ideals.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.567
With Jon Huntsman representing
the United States in China,

00:04:17.567 --> 00:04:20.700
I'm confident that we will
launch a new era of partnership

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.033
between our two nations that
will advance our shared dreams

00:04:23.033 --> 00:04:26.400
of opportunity and security
in America, in Asia,

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.734
and around the world.

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:32.834
So I'm extraordinarily pleased
to announce that Jon Huntsman

00:04:32.834 --> 00:04:36.667
will be our ambassador to China,
and I can think of no more

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:41.700
important assignment than
creating the kinds of bridges

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.834
between our two countries that
will determine the well-being

00:04:44.834 --> 00:04:49.400
not just of Americans
and Chinese,

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.867
but also the future
of the world.

00:04:51.867 --> 00:04:54.567
So, with that, I'd like to
have Jon say a few words.

00:04:54.567 --> 00:04:55.767
Thank you, Jon.

00:04:55.767 --> 00:04:56.567
Governor Huntsman:
Thanks, Mr. President.

00:04:56.567 --> 00:05:01.066
The President:
Thank you.

00:05:01.066 --> 00:05:03.667
Governor Huntsman:
Well, Mr. President, thank
you for those very kind and

00:05:03.667 --> 00:05:05.467
gracious words.

00:05:05.467 --> 00:05:10.834
I never expected to be standing
here under the inquisitive gaze

00:05:10.834 --> 00:05:17.066
of George Washington, and
equally inquisitive gaze of my wife.

00:05:17.066 --> 00:05:20.367
Nor did I expect, as national
co-chair of Senator McCain's

00:05:20.367 --> 00:05:24.100
presidential campaign, to be
called into action by the person

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.767
who beat us.

00:05:25.767 --> 00:05:30.734
But I grew up understanding that
the most basic responsibility

00:05:30.734 --> 00:05:34.467
one has is service to country.

00:05:34.467 --> 00:05:39.300
When the President of the United
States asks you to step up and

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.367
serve in a capacity
like this, that, to me,

00:05:44.367 --> 00:05:48.266
is the end of the conversation
and the beginning of the

00:05:48.266 --> 00:05:52.333
obligation to rise
to the challenge.

00:05:52.333 --> 00:05:56.633
I stand here in my final term
as governor with plenty to do.

00:05:56.633 --> 00:05:59.500
I wasn't looking for
a new job in life,

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.166
but a call from the
President changed that.

00:06:03.166 --> 00:06:08.533
So, Mr. President, I humbly
accept your call to service,

00:06:08.533 --> 00:06:13.567
and I understand that doing so
will carry with it some unique challenges.

00:06:13.567 --> 00:06:16.533
So, first and foremost, I want
to recognize my wife and best

00:06:16.533 --> 00:06:19.233
friend, Mary Kaye,
and my family,

00:06:19.233 --> 00:06:23.800
many of whom are here today, who
have always been willing to heed

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:25.700
the call of public service.

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.100
I am here today solely as
a result of their love and support.

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.300
Second, I owe a tremendous debt
of gratitude to the people of

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.567
the greatest state in America.

00:06:38.567 --> 00:06:43.033
Life's greatest honor has been
to serve the people of Utah as

00:06:43.033 --> 00:06:45.300
their 16th governor.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:48.867
Finally, I must thank
you, Mr. President,

00:06:48.867 --> 00:06:53.567
for your trust and confidence in
me and my family's ability to

00:06:53.567 --> 00:06:57.266
contribute meaningfully to one
of America's most important

00:06:57.266 --> 00:06:59.967
strategic bilateral
relationships.

00:06:59.967 --> 00:07:03.800
You have my commitment that
we will take the U.S.-China

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:08.834
relationship to new heights,
focused not just on that which

00:07:08.834 --> 00:07:11.900
divides us, but
more importantly,

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:17.400
on that which unites us, knowing
that this will be critical for

00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:24.266
lasting peace and prosperity for
citizens on both sides of the Pacific.

00:07:24.266 --> 00:07:27.266
I'm reminded of my
favorite Chinese aphorism.

00:07:27.266 --> 00:07:29.200
It goes something like this:

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:32.934
(speaks in Mandarin Chinese)

00:07:32.934 --> 00:07:36.633
"Together we work,
together we progress."

00:07:36.633 --> 00:07:41.400
This, more than anything else, I
think captures the spirit of our

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.567
journey going forward.

00:07:43.567 --> 00:07:45.367
Thank you so very much.

00:07:45.367 --> 00:07:46.233
The President:
Thank you, Jon.

00:07:46.233 --> 00:07:47.500
Governor Huntsman:
Thanks, Mr. President.
