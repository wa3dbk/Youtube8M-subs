Hello and welcome to Staffordshire University.
Going to university is a very important

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.020
step and it's absolutely vital that do you
think very carefully about it. I hope

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.189
you're looking for the excellent educational
opportunity and thinking about the degree

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:20.969
subject and what that offers to you.

00:00:20.969 --> 00:00:21.519
Clearly, you want to ensure that 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:26.140
you get value for money
whilst you're at university

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.289
and that there's a return on your investment.
I think there are many reasons why you

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.790
should join Staffordshire University. Our
programs are well designed to ensure

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.650

for you.

You should look at the facilities that
we provide that support your learning.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.100
For example, a mock court room, or the
forensic crime scene house.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:58.719
Or the various media suites and the
laboratories across our provision.

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:04.629
We've got a lot of links with national and
international businesses,  not least Cisco and

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.759
Vodafone. Lots of our staff are well
connected with their industries, and are

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.730

well as bringing that experience

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.000

and a critical appreciation of it;

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.860
The ability to be able to communicate
effectively, to be able to challenge

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.730
others to think analytically.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.620
