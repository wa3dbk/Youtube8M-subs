My Emperor, I must remind you it is the 20th of November.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.000
Yeah, so?

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:42.600
The 20th of November is the day we try to take young skywalker to the dark side.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.600
Ah yes, that's right. Take him here.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.300
Guards, leave us.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:05.000
Well young Skywalker, you know why you are here.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:15.000
This is the first time in a year I take you out of prison. You must hate me.

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:27.000
But you can get rid of me by using this, well grab it and strike us down.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Well young skywalker, now you know the power of the dark side.

00:01:51.010 --> 00:02:00.000
Join it, and you will become the most powerful Sith in the galaxy!

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.000
I will never turn to the dark side, NEVER!

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:08.500
Then so be it, Jedi.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.000
Aren't you going to far?

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.400
I'm totally fed up!

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Oooh! Aah! Oh!

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:28.000
Uhm, maybe I was going a little to far, hum.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.500
Rise, my young aprentice!

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.500
Phooo! Phew! It just was a bad dream.
