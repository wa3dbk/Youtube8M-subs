00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:02.940
 

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:03.490
 

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.650
Hi. It's Mr. Andersen and in
this podcast I'm going to talk about polymers.

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.740
Polymers are large molecules that are made
up of smaller molecule called monomers. And

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.670
so even the word polymers can serve as a good
example of a polymer. In other words I could

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.670
rearrange the letters in polymers to make
Mrs. Poley or even a spry mole or even a spying

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:33.070
mushroom. And so basically those letters can
be arranged in different ways to make different

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.340
words. Likewise, monomers can be arranged
in different ways to make different polymers.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.100
And so the large molecule's a polymer but
those building blocks are called monomers.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.520
And so where do we see this? Well in biology
we could see this lots of places. And so this

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.059
right here is a strand of cellulose and cellulose
is a polysaccharide which is made of sugar

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:57.670
over and over and over again. Or this right
here is a protein. Protein is made up of amino

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.059
acids attached over and over and over again.
And so we have 26 letters in the alphabet.

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.000
And we can make words and we can make paragraphs
and even stories. And in life we have 20 amino

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.160
acids. And those amino acids can almost make
an infinite number of proteins. Or this right

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:20.180
here is deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA and that
itself is made up of monomers. Those are called

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:25.690
nucleotides. Essentially we have a phosphate,
a sugar and then a nitrogenous base. And so

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.560
even that nice leisure suit that your dad
may have worn in the 70s is going to be a

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.780
polymer. In other words we're reproducing
the simple chemical over and over and over

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.580
again. And so how do we do that? Well basically
we do it in one of two ways. We either build

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:46.990
a polymer and to do that we use what's called
a condensation or a dehydration reaction.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:52.680
Or we break it down. And so let's start with
building. And so right here we have two amino

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.420
acids. And so amino acids remember are going
to be put together to make proteins. And so

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.350
you can see on this first amino acid we've
got that alpha carbon in the middle, we've

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.210
got an amino group on one side, carboxyl group
on the other. Likewise with this amino acid,

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:08.759
we've got an amino group of this side, we've
got the carboxyl group on this side and then

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:13.640
we have our R groups on either side. And so
basically what happens in a condensation or

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.640
dehydration reaction, if you look right in
the middle, is we're going to remove water.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.710
In other words we have this hydroxyl group
here and this hydrogen here and so basically

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.900
what happens is we give off that water, you
can see why it's called a dehydration reaction.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:34.420
We're losing water and basically we're forming
a bond. We're forming a bond between those

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:40.030
two amino acids. In other words we're making
a simple little polypeptide. And this occurs

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:45.410
over and over and over again when we make
a massive protein. Well, what's the opposite

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.860
of that? We call that hydrolysis. And I always
think of hydrolysis means water cutting or

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:57.780
water breaking. And so let's say right here
we have a simple disaccharide. This is lactose.

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.390
What we can do is we can add water to the
system. And we do that, basically what we're

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.160
going to do, is we're going to break that
disaccharide down into two monosaccharides.

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.970
And so you have enzymes in your body that
are going to help you break down lactose,

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.770
but we still are going to require a water
every time we break one of those polymers

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:21.319
apart. And so basically let me give you a
quick question. You can try to wrap this one

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:27.720
around your head. TRP Cage or trip cage is
going to be one of the smallest amino or excuse

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.360
me, smallest proteins that we have in nature.
And it's found in the saliva of a Gila monster.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.260
And so how many molecules of water would be
required to completely hydrolyze this Gila

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:44.340
monster protein. Now you need to know that
there are 20 amino acids that are found in

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.330
this very small protein. And so how much water
are we going to require to break that up.

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.180
So it's a good question. If you want to put
your answers down below do so. And so basically

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:59.069
why is this important? Well this is a picture
of me when I was little. And my favorite food,

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:04.620
I know this is gross, when I was growing up
was the Filet O Fish sandwich from McDonalds.

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:09.520
And so basically when I was eating that Filet
O Fish sandwich it was made up of a number

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:14.780
of different polymers, like the polysaccharides
in the starch in the bun and the proteins

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.269
that are found in the fish in the fillet of
fish and so basically when I took this in

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:26.130
and ate it, in digestion I was breaking that
back down into its monomers. But then I was

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.010
putting those back together again using dehydration
reaction to make the proteins that are found

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:36.650
in my hair or my skin or all of the cells
in my body. And so you literally are what

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:41.780
you eat thanks to polymers. But again, they
wouldn't be formed unless we had the building

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.780
blocks and those are called monomers. And
I hope this is helpful.
