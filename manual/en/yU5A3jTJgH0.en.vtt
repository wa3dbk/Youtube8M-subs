00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.080
Hi, I'm Trevor and I'm here with Bill
from 5.11. Now 5.11 has a lot of bags

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.530
on the market, I have some of them and I love them, but
you guys rolled out some new products this year which

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.119
are pretty cool, so what can we see, what you got here.

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.100
Well, this is a brand new bag, nobody's
really seen it yet, it's called the

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:20.999
All Hazards Prime

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:25.059
and it's designed for law enforcement.
It's the law enforcement officer who has

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:30.660
to respond to almost anything. Whether it's
a riot, an active shooter situation,

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.690
we put this,

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.610
put this together with them in mind.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.330
And it's been with their help

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.850
so let me just give you,
let's start this off.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.490
Here's an opening where the
officer would put his helmet

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:47.360
and you know that every helmet has
a face shield,

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.800
so we lined the bottom of this

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.850
with a real

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.019
real soft felt so it won't scratch the
helmet face. Nice. Right?

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:56.740
So that will cinch down.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.329
On the front of this

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.090
we have a real nice admin pocket so they
have all of their admin, all of their

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.410
organizational things that they need
all the way up to a key fob,

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.360
places to put your pens,

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.700
the kinds of things you do for
administrative work.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.370
At the very top of the bag

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.660
we've added

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.710
a place to actually put a full
set of goggles in case they're wearing

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.260
goggles, so it's big enough that a set of
goggles will fit into it. Lined as well.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.090
And it's lined with that felt.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.330
Then this section of the bag,

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.390
this is just another example of the
features that we put in

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.500
a lot of times these things will fall,

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.840
we've added a little pull here,
a little pull here so that doesn't

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.610
that doesn't fall out, but you can separate it

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.520
so that you get lots of extra space.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.290
Just the little details you put into it,
that's awesome, that's great to see.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.420
One of the things I love about our bag,

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.580
it almost takes a week to teach somebody
how to use it there's so many great features.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.000
So if you take a look at this section,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.540
you know once you're in an
emergency situation, you really have

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:04.940
to go to your med kit or something like
that.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.929
We've got this set up so you can have a
full med kit. Nice. We've got MOLLE

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.870
here where you can add and organize this with
any of our VTAC Pouches. We've got

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.269
two little

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.479
attachment bags, so if you've got a buddy
that needs a med kit.

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:21.439
You can throw it to him. Nice. Okay,

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:25.599
and the orange allows you to very
clearly see what you have there.

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.930
Yeah, all that contrast, that's nice,

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.930
great to see.

00:02:36.839 --> 00:02:41.739
Then our main compartment,

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.519
(oh, here we go, more) comes with two,

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:48.549
this is capable of holding two ammo mules.

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.189
Each one of these mules will
hold 10 AR Mags.

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:56.459
So, once again, it's a kind of situation
where you need to get this to your buddy.

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.699
You could take these and throw them out, now

00:02:58.699 --> 00:03:02.349
the  bag does not come with these,
these are sold separately, (ok) but

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.999
the bag is designed for them to fit in
there. Fits perfectly in there, yeah. For more

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:08.110
space here if you want to have a tablet

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.419
or a small computer

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.229
and then we've got an elastic pouch here.

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:15.089
Then if you look at the back,

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:19.789
we use aerospace mesh so there is a lot
of ventilation.

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:23.870
We've got extra heavy yoke here
because this thing is

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.269
going to be carrying a lot of ammo,
so we designed this yoke

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.089
to go across the back

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:31.819
and fit really comfortably on the officer.
Really fitted there,

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:34.719
well padded, the ventilation.

00:03:34.719 --> 00:03:36.470
MOLLE on the sides

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:41.309
notice that we have velcro here
for patches and identification,

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:44.149
we've done the same thing in the front.
Top and the front.

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:47.009
So you can ID it very easily

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:52.639
and then in the very back

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:54.069
a place for hydration.

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:55.509
Great. So,

00:03:55.509 --> 00:04:00.029
I mean this really has been well thought
out for the officer that needs to be

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:04.589
ready to go. Everything you need is
right there,

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:06.219
perfect.

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:08.559
Great design, great design.

00:04:08.559 --> 00:04:10.139
This is a fun one.

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:12.269
Like you said, it's going to take
a week to learn how to

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:16.649
learn all the features on it, it just keeps going.
Well, it's so customizable too.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.850
Oh it's great. The way the MOLLE is setup

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.970
you can pretty much do what you
want with it.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.239
That's great, great bag.

00:04:23.239 --> 00:04:25.969
That's the All Hazards Prime. When is this going to be
released, when's this coming out or is it ready to go now?

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:29.939
We have them coming out, they'll be in our spring

00:04:29.939 --> 00:04:32.350
catalog.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.389
And you've got another

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:36.730
new system coming out right here too.
Well this one is available right now

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:37.470
it

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.310
and this bag is our MOAB 10.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.330
Mobile Operations Attachment Bag.

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.160
It's a sling style bag that's ambidextrous,
it can be right or left and you can set

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:54.310
it up way that you want. That's a great
feature. So this would roll up,

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:58.879
stuff in this little part of the
compartment

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:03.090
and it's ready to go as a sling bag for

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.849
a left-handed person.

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:08.279
Okay, this is actually the left handed
person side, okay.

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:09.050
So you can carry

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.979
this bag very easily, quite comfortable

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:13.720
it's not big

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.590
but remember, I said Mobile Operations
Attachment Bag, so it's designed to

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.639
attach to other bags that we have.

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:24.870
I'll show you the internal features of
this in a second, but let me show you how it

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.360
attaches.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:32.099
Each one of these MOAB bags comes
with a set of what we call

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:34.639
our Rush Tier System.

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:36.710
So when you buy this bag you're going to
get

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:38.569
this Rush Tier system

00:05:38.569 --> 00:05:42.919
and I've set it up for you so that you
can see how it works. You have

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:45.499
four of these

00:05:45.499 --> 00:05:47.669
all four sides of the bag

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:49.320
then you take a larger bag

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:53.389
could be the All Hazards Prime
or our Rush 72

00:05:53.389 --> 00:05:57.930
and you add four of these

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:00.099
which come with your bag

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:06.610
and then you can attach this bag 
as a piggyback,

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:07.680
as a piggyback

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:10.599
to all of those.

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:12.760
Great. And then you, so

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.639
you've got your 72 which is a
three day pack

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:17.130
you add this to it

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:20.419
when you get to your sight that you're
going to, all you have to do is unclip it

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:23.820
and you've got your to go bag ready to go.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.719
That is perfect. It's

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:30.110
true to 5.11 look at all the features of this, you
know, the padded straps, the MOLLE systems,

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:34.069
the velcro, it just keeps going and going. 
That's what's great to see you incorporated all of this.

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:37.299
How it clips on, awesome feature of
your larger bag

00:06:37.299 --> 00:06:41.110
leave it at the base you're staying at, your base
camp and ready to go with the MOAB.

00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:45.250
Let me show you one more
fun feature before we're done, okay?

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:48.360
It has almost all of the same
organizational features as all of our

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.389
packs,

00:06:49.389 --> 00:06:51.430
but we've added something special here.

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.349
When you bring this around

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:55.479
we've got a hidden compartment

00:06:55.479 --> 00:06:58.879
so that you can quickly access a side
arm if few need it.

00:06:58.879 --> 00:07:00.079
That's cool.

00:07:00.079 --> 00:07:04.249
Well thought out, that's perfect.
And it has velcro in the inside so you

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:07.549
can at actually attach a holster,

00:07:07.549 --> 00:07:08.899
or it's so well

00:07:08.899 --> 00:07:11.979
set up that you almost don't need one.

00:07:11.979 --> 00:07:14.220
Great feature, I just,

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:17.220
pulled out all stops on this one again, true
to 5.11 you've got everything you can

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.690
possibly need ready to go, great set up.
Yep, it's all ready to go for you in a

00:07:21.690 --> 00:07:25.729
whole lot of ways. Throw another mag in there
too, the possibilites are endless of what you can do these.

00:07:25.729 --> 00:07:30.099
This is designed for radios and you can,
or your iPhone, you can run

00:07:30.099 --> 00:07:33.249
your wire out of this, go right to your ears.

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:37.830
It's got the hydration system available for it,

00:07:37.830 --> 00:07:40.329
just like our other bags.

00:07:40.329 --> 00:07:42.989
That is great. Eyeglass pouch.

00:07:42.989 --> 00:07:44.729
I mean, it's just super.

00:07:44.729 --> 00:07:48.289
Huge fan of the 5.11 bags and
Bill, you know this new stuff, it's

00:07:48.289 --> 00:07:53.009
blowing me away. You guys keep innovating,
coming out with the new things and just,

00:07:53.009 --> 00:07:55.869
I kind of want one of these right now and
I keep looking at that, Bill, thank you so much

00:07:55.869 --> 00:07:58.909
for taking some time with us today, thank you.
It's been my pleasure.
