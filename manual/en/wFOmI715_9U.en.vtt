00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:07.869
Care and cleaning.

00:00:07.869 --> 00:00:12.540
Practice good backup hygiene and
maintain regular backups of your iPhone,

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.540
particularly before entering into a
situation where there is a high chance of theft

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.179
or harsh environments.

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:23.189
Avoid needless drops or impacts of
your LifeProof case, as damage to the

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.910
case or the iPhone is always
a possibility.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.099
Perform a water test after
each serious impact.

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:36.320
Do not use abrasive solvents, bleach,
petroleum, or oxidizing agents on the

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:37.360
case.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.770
Although the screen has a scratch
resistant coating, avoid placing your

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.050
LifeProof screen

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.500
where it can be scratched or gouged.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.500
Avoid temperature extremes. To ensure
longevity, and correct operation of

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.830
your iPhone,

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.510
do not go outside Apple's recommended
operating temperature of zero degrees

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.020
centigrade or thirty-two degrees
fahrenheit,

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.489
to thirty-five degrees centigrade or
ninety five degrees fahrenheit.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.840
Avoid allowing people inexperienced in
the operation or use of your LifeProof

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.480
case, to use it in water.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.980
They may open a port or do something
that could result in a leakage.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.300
This especially applies to children,

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.460
with curious fingers.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.840
Do not use bleach, solvents, or abrasive
polishes.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:29.120
Do not use abrasive cleaning pads or
brushes, as these could scratch the

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.740
optical surfaces or case finish.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.750
Don't put your LifeProof into the
dishwasher,

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.120
or into harsh chemical environments,
or excessive heat.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.080
For minor cleaning, wipe with a warm damp
soft cloth.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.920
For a more thorough clean, ensure all ports are
closed, and wash under fresh running

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:50.439
water.

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:54.260
Only use diluted mild detergent
when cleaning your LifeProof case,

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.409
as dishwashing detergent directly onto
the case is too harsh.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.140
A few drops in a glass of water is just
about right.

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:04.740
Now rinse thoroughly.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.590
Shake the excess water off,

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.409
and dry gently with a soft clean cloth.

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:15.900
Use an eyeglass safe microfiber cloth if
further wiping is needed on the

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.359
touchscreen area.

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:21.039
The case interior.

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:27.199
The LifeProof case is fully sealed from water,
dust, and mud, and rarely needs to be cleaned.

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:30.000
We recommend cleaning the inside of
the case

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.169
only if it becomes contaminated by
fingerprints or dirt.

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:36.669
To clean the inside of the case,

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.539
open the case and remove the iPhone.

00:02:39.539 --> 00:02:46.209
Use a diluted mild detergent, and a soft
cloth with warm fresh water to clean,

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.869
then rinse well. Shake excess water off and
dry gently with a clean soft cloth.

00:02:52.869 --> 00:02:57.119
Use an eyeglass safe microfiber cloth
if further wiping is needed on the

00:02:57.119 --> 00:02:59.789
touchscreen area inside.

00:02:59.789 --> 00:03:02.880
Ensure all parts of the case are clean and
dry,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.320
and check that the o-ring is correctly
seated in place and clean without

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.849
any lint, before following reassembly
instructions.

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.289
For cleaning the o-ring, tap 
it out of the case.

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:18.799
For cleaning the o-ring, remove the
o-ring and wash it in diluted

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:20.080
detergent,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.699
in warm fresh running water.

00:03:22.699 --> 00:03:27.859
Do not set it down on any surface,
instead shake and dry. Align the top

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:31.969
corners first and press the remainder on
until the bottom.

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:35.029
Never use silicon lubricants.

00:03:35.029 --> 00:03:36.799
The o-ring.

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.099
Inspect the o-ring channel to ensure
that it is clean of any lint, dirt, sand,

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.029
or muck,

00:03:43.029 --> 00:03:44.969
as this will cause a leak.

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:49.249
The o-ring channel may need cleaning if
it becomes contaminated with mud or

00:03:49.249 --> 00:03:50.519
sand.

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.149
This is to ensure its continued
waterproofness.

00:03:54.149 --> 00:04:00.039
Gently clean, making sure not to scratch
the screen area or acoustic vents.

00:04:00.039 --> 00:04:01.869
The camera lens.

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:04.499
To clean the camera lens, use rubbing

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:09.989
or isopropyl alcohol, or methylated spirits on
a cotton tip, or a Q-tip,

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.769
to clean the lens.

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.790
Clean the inside and outside of the camera
lens as needed.

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:18.209
The touchscreen.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.000
Use an eyeglass safe microfiber cloth
if minor wiping is needed.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:29.169
For a more thorough clean, follow the
instructions to clean the case's exterior.

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:33.619
We hope you have enjoyed the LifeProof
instruction manual.

00:04:33.619 --> 00:04:36.120
LifeProof is all about freedom.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.900
The freedom to be in touch,

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.590
to build friendships, and to have
companionship in the most unlikely

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.370
places.

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.860
LifeProof opens up new horizons and
opportunities,

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.650
and new places that you can explore.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:52.399
Now it's your turn to use that freedom.

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:56.139
Let's go!
