Hi! I’m Lisa Krone and I’m with Best Epicurean
on behalf of expertvillage.com. I am going

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:17.310
to talk about some dishwasher tips with you
today. First of all number 1; you want to

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.830
make sure that you get some decent dishwasher
liquid. A non-brand name is great but I like

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.050
to make sure that it has at least some orange
or some citrus in it because I think that

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.470
helps break down the dirt and the grease within
the dirt on the dishes. So I always make sure

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.620
that it has some of that in there. If you
are in a pinch and you don’t have any dishwasher

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.120
soap, you can use regular dishwasher or dish
soap that you would use with your dishes but

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:53.000
here’s a word of caution; only use about
a dime size amount or you will be cleaning

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.210
your floor as well and that probably was not
in your plan when you set your dishwasher.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:05.030
So one of the things in question that people
ask a lot is what do I do when I load a dishwasher.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.270
I have a nice dirty dishwasher here and I
will give you an example: my son is a teenager,

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.550
he is 13 and he helped out and you can see
right here that I have way too many utensils

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.260
here in the utensil bin so I am going to have
to pull these out and unfortunately this going

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:28.259
to have to go in the next load, so hopefully
I’ve got enough dishes to put in. You also

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:34.220
want to be careful. We have some wood thongs
in here. These just happen to be okay. When

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.030
they go in a dishwasher they don’t work
but you want to be careful when putting in

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:44.050
your other wooden products. If you have a
really expensive wooden spoon which they sell

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.569
now days which is made out of special wood,
I don’t suggest putting them in the dishwasher

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:55.420
but these were like 75 cents so they go in
the dishwasher. I don’t mind getting more

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.950
of those. Another thing is that you want to
make sure that you put mainly your cups and

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.420
utensils up on the top, your cooking utensils,
and let’s say like for instance, I know

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:12.120
this one happened to have been used when cooking
some eggs. So what I’ve instructed him because

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:20.330
when we do the dishwasher duties instead of
doing it on and off this month, he does the

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.840
dishwasher and next month his 15 year old
sister does the dishwasher and we have a lot

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:32.420
less arguing that way. I tell him that he
needs to clean the cooked egg and gunk off

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.460
of there. You know that you don’t have to
put anything in terribly straight or what

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.110
not, you just want to make sure that all your
sprayers reach to get your dishes. They go

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.760
in all different directions but check where
your sprayers are and that is some dishwasher

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.360
tips. Have a nice clean day.
