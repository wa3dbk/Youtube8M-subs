00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.680
This video is the first of a series of three
videos where we will be talking about how

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:10.980
you can use the Table Analyzer Wizard and
complex queries to import multiple many to

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.599
many data sets into Microsoft Access.
In this video, I am going to import data from

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:21.810
Microsoft Excel. Unlike my previous video,
where I imported a simple dataset from the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.700
Federal Elections Commission, this data will
contain two many to many relationships. This

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:34.909
makes the import process a bit more complicated.
If I take a look at my data in Microsoft Excel,

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:38.910
this data was created by my Access class,
and in the class, students create their own

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.190
databases containing movies they have selected
with the actors and directors that appear

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.930
in those movies.
In order to create the later assignments in

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:52.710
the class, I take all of their data and combine
it into one very large data set. When I look

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.320
at the data set, I have 342 rows of information
in a flat file, really am Excel spreadsheet.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:06.351
I have directors, movie titles, ratings, the
release year, the actor last name, the actor

00:01:06.351 --> 00:01:11.370
first name, and I have the name of the student
who created the data. For the database, I

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.200
call the student the customer and say that
they have rented the movie.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.900
I will now open Microsoft Access. I want to
create a blank database. I will call this

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:29.020
database “movies”, which I will save on
my desktop. Access has opened to a default

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:36.950
table, which I will close so the table disappears.
I will click on the external data ribbon and

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:45.050
import the Excel spreadsheet, clicking on
browse, going to my desktop, finding my spreadsheet

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.310
and then importing the source data into the
new table in the current database.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:56.870
I want to use the data import worksheet which
is shown here. My first row contains column

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.190
headings, so I want to make sure that I check
this checkbox.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.909
Now as I look through my data, I have two
many to many relationships.

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:10.631
I have a many to many relationship between
the movie and the actor. An actor can appear

00:02:10.631 --> 00:02:16.690
in many movies and a movie can have many actors.
I also have a many to many relationship between

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.209
customer and movie. A customer can rent, or
rather, a student can create, many movies

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.190
and a movie can be entered by many students.
I can only use the Table Analyzer Wizard to

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.550
handle one many to many relationship, so I
am going to handle my customer relationship

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.020
in a different way. So I will skip my customer
field for now.

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.120
I will let access create my primary key and
finish the import wizard.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:50.580
So I now have my data in Microsoft Access,
342 records, and it appears just as it did

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.580
in Excel, except now I have primary keys and
I am missing my customer field. I will click

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.530
on the Database Tools Ribbon and click on
Analyze Table.

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:09.070
I want to analyze my data import table. I
want to decide what fields are put in what

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:18.459
tables. At this point, I will split my tables
up and create several tables. I will first

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.740
pull over all of my movie related tables and
give this table the name of movie.

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:40.430
Notice the one to many relationship that exists
between the original table and the new movie

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.660
table. Now I will drag the actor table, the
actor information, into its own table. I am

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.590
going to give this table the name Actor. I
now have a one to many relationship between

00:03:51.590 --> 00:04:00.379
the actor and table 1, and a one to many relationship
between movie and table 1, so this table 1

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:03.629
will now act as my Association table, creating
a many to many relationship. At this point,

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:09.010
I'm going to rename table 1 to cast.
So an actor is cast in a movie and a movie

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:17.280
is cast with multiple actors. I will also
take and drag my director and create a new

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:29.389
table, called director.
Now there are some possible corrections that

00:04:29.389 --> 00:04:34.370
Access might make for me automatically in
my actors table, so I want to take a look

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:39.979
at this. For example, it wants to change Benjamin
Bratt to Billy Boyd. I don't want this to

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:45.020
happen, so I will select leave as is, and
do this for each of these incorrect changes.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:05:00.039
Now there is a correction that I do want to
make sure happens. Eva Mendez, her last name

00:05:00.039 --> 00:05:08.860
is spelled with a S, not a Z, so I will make
sure that correction is in effect.

00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:15.240
At this point, I've made all my corrections.
It will ask me if I want to create a query.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.680
I will click on no.
So it has created my four tables for me. It

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:30.229
has foreign keys as lookup fields.
So far, we have imported data with one many

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:35.659
to many relationship and one one to many relationship.
We will need to do some more work in the next

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:41.349
video, and we will use some complex queries,
such as Make Table, Append, and we will create

00:05:41.349 --> 00:05:42.719
some ad hoc joins.
