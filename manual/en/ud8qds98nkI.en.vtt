00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.779
A baby rhino who was tragically orphaned when
his mother was poached last month, is winning

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:20.960
hearts around the world...and raising awareness
about the need to fight poaching which, by

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:27.240
May 28, had already claimed 442 rhino in South
Africa since the start of the year. Gertjie,

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.579
the little rhino who has been adopted by the
Hoedspruit Endangered Species Centre (HESC),

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:37.530
has been making newspaper and television headlines
from the USA to the Netherlands. HESC first

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.880
told the world about Gertjie on May 8 when
they posted the following heart-breaking message

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:47.539
on their Facebook page: "We took custody of
a very special animal last night. A 3-month-old

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:52.739
baby rhino, anticipated to have been born
on around the 19th February, was brought to

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:56.789
the HESC after being found next to his dead
mother who had been tragically and brutally

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.390
poached for her horn. "It was a devastating
sight, as the tiny animal would not leave

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.980
her side, and was crying inconsolably for
her." Gertjie's mother had been brutally mutilated

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.850
by poachers at Kapama Private Game Reserve
under the cover of darkness, and as with many

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.670
of the rhinos who are poached, she died from
her injuries. It is estimated that about two

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.470
rhino are poached per day...and that if this
current rate continues, rhinos will be extinct

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.670
by 2025. South African supermarket chain Pick
n Pay have got involved to help raise much-needed

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.110
funds for the expensive task of taking care
of Gertjie who needs to be fed every three

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.180
hours.
According to Pick n Pay's website "Gertjie

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.130
is adapting well to life in the Centre and
is slowly becoming more and more confident.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.110
He takes two long walks daily and absolutely
loves his mud baths. And much like any child

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:49.880
Gertjie is scared of sleeping alone at night.
He spends sleep time snuggled up to a staff

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:54.440
member and loves taking a snooze in one of
their laps." Due to the need to feed Gertjie

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.780
for the next 18 months, HESC approached Pick
n Pay for help . "We were only too happy to

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:04.900
be a part of this amazing story and began
gathering as much powdered milk as we could.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.459
Along with our partners at Clover Dairies,
we were able to donate 300kg of fat-free milk

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:15.890
powder to HESC," says Pick n Pay. How can
you help? Pick n Pay is appealing to smart

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.840
shopper customers to donate their smart shopper
points over the next two months to HESC. Points

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.909
can be donated through the smart shopper kiosk
in Pick n Pay stores or via the mobile app,

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.379
and will be used to provide Gertjie with the
milk he needs. Pick n Pay Hypers will also

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.269
have a trolley available for customers to
drop off fat-free milk powder for Gertjie.

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:45.480
