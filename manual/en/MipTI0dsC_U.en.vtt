00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.899
ealealOk, the final step in our bedroom painting
project is to paint the trim. We already painted

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:12.509
the walls with the flat paint and that's dry
so we're going to go ahead and apply the trim

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.510
paint which is going to be a semi-gloss which
is essentially exactly what it sounds like.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:27.960
It has a real nice sheen to it, unlike the
flat. So I'm going to dump everything but

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.790
about a quarter of this can into another bucket.
The reason I'm doing that is because we want

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:41.489
to avoid drips at all costs. If we were working
with a full can, there would be a lot better

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:58.510
probability that you'd be getting drips when
you pull the brush out so. So we went ahead

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.579
and sanded all the trim which is really essential
and that way out trim paint, the new stuff,

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:16.260
has a surface to grip to if you will. Just
take your time. You get a lot of detail in

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:28.250
these old places which can be a little tricky
to paint. And if you have to gap your painters

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:55.310
tape. And once again, this is the first of
two coats, so if you don't get it the first

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:53.210
time, get it the second. Let your brush do
the work for you, just guide it along.

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:59.790
If you get drips one the floor, which is inevitable,
the nice thing about latex is it cleans up

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:08.190
with water so you don't have to use any nasty
solvents. Now where the trim hits the floor,

00:03:08.190 --> 00:04:20.910
is the one place in particular you might want
to use tape. Its a tricky line.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.930
Ok, so we've got our first coat of trim paint
on there. We're going to let that dry for

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:31.170
a good ten hours before we put the second
coat on. Make sure you give it a light sanding

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:38.100
in between coats. Again, the paint, the new
paint needs something to stick to. So that'll

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.460
do it for our bedroom painting project. Hope
you learned something. Thanks.
