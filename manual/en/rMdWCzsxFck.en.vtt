00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520
*intro*

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.700
So I was eating at this restaurant with my best friend Kate

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.560
Wait Jaiden, the audio doesn't sound horrible anymore!

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.680
Oh! I'm glad you noticed!

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.500
It's because I got a brand new microphone

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.300
and it's actually a good quality one

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:21.220
rather than the... microphone that I found laying around at my house one day

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.340
and decided to make an animation.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.320
Now you guys can hear what my actual voice sounds like

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.140
and it's not ergh eirg... uergh..... eirrghh.....

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.220
*awkward silence*

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:32.300
Anyway back to the story...

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.080
Now, the place that we were eating at is REALLY cool,

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.880
because for kids, instead of having those colouring menu things

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.460
You can ask a waiter or waitress if you can get a glob of bread dough to play with.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.580
Freaking bread dough...

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.860
I don't know anyone who would pass the ability to play with bread dough!

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.400
So obviously, Kate and I had to get the hook up!

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.180
But we were both really shy at the time so we had to choose who is gonna be the one who asks the waiter for the dough.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.200
And it wouldn't have been as bad but considering that Kate and I were both above the age

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.620
where you're considered a child who can play with bread dough

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:08.240
and not be judged by adults

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.820
both of us didn't wanna be the one who asked...

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.180
I dont even know how but she ended up covincing me to be the one

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.020
and the waiter came back around 5 minutes later to ask if we needed anything...

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.540
And that's when I panicked and everything went downhill!

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.360
I needed to say seven words: We want some bread dough up in here!

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.080
But, for some reason, I couldn't get myself to say it...

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.760
At first, I couldn't do anything

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.860
and I just stared at him and he kinda gave me this look...

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.960
And then I opened my mouth and this is what came out...

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.720
I...uh...can we...uhm...sorry...can...ugh...we...can we have...ugh...

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.780
I've never stuttered that hard in my ENTIRE life.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.200
And when I realized that...

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.360
I started laughing at myself!

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.500
And then it sounded more like this:

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:04.460
Uh...*laugh*...uhm sorry...can we...ugh...*laugh* ...can we uhm.....sorry uhm....

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.300
Kate's mom had to just cut me off and translate to the guy what i was saying...

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:13.020
And after a look that tried to hide his judgement of me, he walked away...

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.560
I was so embarrassed, but we all got a good laugh out of  it!

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.960
And hey, Bread Dough!

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.880
Automatically Worth It

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:42.420
