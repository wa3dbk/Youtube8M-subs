00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:11.250
Your brain is like a circuit switch, once
you believe you are something, you actually

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.570
embody it, you embody that feeling. If you
were god forbidden in a coma and you woke

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:25.290
up, and you were told that you were once a
navy seal &amp; they want you back now when you're

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.390
healthy. Do you think you would act differently,
hold yourself differently, conduct yourself

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.640
different, have a different self concept of
who you are than if you were told you were

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.190
a piano instructor. Being successful in life
is all about having the proper belief system

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:48.149
of who you are. Truly believing that you are
something unique, that you are something special

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:55.149
in that field. If you truly believe inside
of you that you are one of the best actors

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:00.120
in the world, you will be entirely different
then if you're like, i hope i'm good. If you

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.360
are unsure about who you are then your dreams,
your goals, they will never become a reality.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:20.770
Everyone has mental doubts in life, internal
conflicts... Even the most successful people

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.770
that you look up to, but they don't live there.
It's how you handle those negative thoughts

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.050
in that exact moment &amp; overwhelm them with
positive action. And that comes with this

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.690
upmost confidence in yourself that you can
handle the situation, trust in yourself that

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.079
you are better than the moment.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:51.829
When you have
a revelation, where something clicks inside

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.840
of you, to decide to make a dramatic shift
with your life.

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.290
I didn't know how long it was going to take. It took 12 years to get
that 4 year degree, i didn't know how long

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:15.120
it was going to take but let me tell you something,
i never gave up &amp; i never gave in!

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:25.920
Today may be just another day but it's yours. Don't
let it slip into the shadow of someday...

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.620
No retreat, no surrender, that is Spartan
Law!
