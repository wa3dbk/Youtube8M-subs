Hi, I am Andrew Walker. 
I am an assistant product manager in football hardware.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Before we talk about my job with the Brazuca and the players perception testing 
let's go for a kickabout. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Yeah this is a beautiful stadium. This is where I am at home - 
as simple as that.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Why is testing important? Simply to make sure that we have the best 
possible product out in the market. 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Especially for our top assets and the players
that will be playing with it in the World Cup.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
So you have got to imagine, I get the email from Jochen: 
"Alright testing is confirmed. Get yourself a car from adidas!"

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And I pretty much walked out to the parking lot 
chucked in the bag and start driving.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And then to Milan with AC Milan, Clarence Seedorf - very famous Dutch player -

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
took the time out to sit us down and said "guys, I remember
when I first shot my first goal in the Champions league with an adidas ball"

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000
look how far we have come. How cool is this that this is really the ball for the 2014 World Cup.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Also in Moscow, just having a chat with Capello, one of the best trainers in the world.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Knocking the ball back and forth talking about technigal advances,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
how the game is changing and the products are evolving with the game, with the players.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
It is really a highlight and it is cool to see the guys. They have a job to do and so do we.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
There is some start on that when you think to yourself 
"oh, I just shoke hands with the best player in the world" it is really cool.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It is kind of surreal. You see the guys on TV and then you are sitting there with
Dennis Bergkamp, he wasn't a player at the time, he was a coach.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
He scored I think hundreds of goals for Arsenal. I met Ibrahimovic,
Boateng, Seedorf, Mark Van Bommel.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It was quite interesting to meet Messi.
We sat in a hotel afterwards and wait and wait  - 'is he going to come, is he not going to come'

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Then the guy comes around the corner, really 50 seconds,
shake hands, exchange pleasantries and then "ok, what do you think about the product?"

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Really short and concise but shook his hand, met him, positive feedback
and he enjoyed it and I enjoyed it as well. It is really cool.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Taking that feedback, using it constructively to make the product.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
The fact that I can say I helped make that product the way it is.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000
It might be subjective but just to say I was involved with it,
to leave your mark on the global game on one way or anotherâ€¦
