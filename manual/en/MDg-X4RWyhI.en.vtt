Wow! Look at the bunny's pretty smile!

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.840
Let's count how many teeth he has so far!

This is the biggest smile I've ever drawn!

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.580
How many teeth does the bunny painting have?

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.400
One. Two. Three. Four.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.960
Four for the four teeth.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.900
