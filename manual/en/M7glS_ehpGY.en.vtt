00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.600
Today's question comes
from India.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.570
Dileep asks, "Our website is
not improving in Google

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.810
PageRank despite having regular
updates and foolproof

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.180
content authorized by
proven editors.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.040
What could be the
reason for this?

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.149
Kindly help in sussing
out the issue.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:17.420
Thanks very much."

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.780
OK, so this is an interesting
question.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.190
The thing to remind yourself
about is that the Google

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.890
Toolbar PageRank, number
one, it's only updated

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:25.870
periodically.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.820
So for a while, we would update
it relatively often.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.140
Now we'll update it a
few times a year.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.090
Over time, the Toolbar PageRank
is getting less

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:40.750
usage, just because recent
versions of Internet Explorer

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.990
don't really let you install
toolbars as easily and Chrome

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.970
doesn't have the toolbar.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.350
So over time, the PageRank
indicator will probably start

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.270
to go away a little bit.

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.710
But it's also the case that we
only update this information

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.410
every few months, and so
it does take time in

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.740
order to show up.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.020
The other thing to bear in mind
is that you mentioned

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.200
having regular updates and
having proven editors with

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.800
original content, but that's
not what PageRank is about.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.440
PageRank is about the number
of links to a site.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.680
So check and make sure that you
have a good architecture,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.930
you've got a Home page with
well-linked, static links

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.120
going to the individual
pages of your site.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:20.190
Something like a treelike
structure that leads to the

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:21.860
individual pages can be good.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.600
Make sure that the pages that
are really important are maybe

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.270
just one or two links from your
Home page so that the

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.950
PageRank is still relatively
high there.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.340
And then just make sure that a
lot of people know about your

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.760
content and know that it's
high-quality content.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.170
Because if a lot of people are
linking to your site, and

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.040
those people who are linking
to you have high PageRank,

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.190
then you'll be more likely to
have higher PageRank as well.

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:48.150
So it's not just the quality
of your content.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.900
The quality of your content is
a little bit determining how

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.620
much people will want to link
to you, and then that will

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.550
determine your PageRank.

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.730
But PageRank doesn't look
at the quality of the

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.160
text on your site.

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:01.030
It's looking at the number of
links and the quality of those

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.720
links and how they point
to your website.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.030
I hope that make sense.
