00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.920
What is the image of New Yorkers?

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.000
Chic, sophisticated and confident city people!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.700
They always look busy too.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:26.520
So here I have a makeup look that is quick and perfect for busy New Yorkers!

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.260
Let’s get started!

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.880
Take some foundation on a brush and blend in a circular motion.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.860
This brush allows a quick, easy application and helps foundation really meld in.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.580
For more coverage, reapply with a patting motion.

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.160
To create a naturally glowing skin

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.260
use a highlighter pen with opal shimmers on where light hits

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:02.060
including forehead, nose bridge, chin, and cupid’s bow, and blend.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:08.140
This gives a natural, translucent, healthy glow to skin.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.640
I’m using a peachy orange blush for a natural flush.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:21.280
Using a brush, start from high point of cheekbones and bring it in diagonally.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:26.040
This soft, girly peach color gives a fresh look

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:30.540
and diagonal shape adds sophistication.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.260
I’m going to use a bronze color to add definition.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.940
With a fingertip, apply it onto half of lids for depth and haziness

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.400
and blend away any harsh edge for a gradient effect.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.240
Reapply onto crease area to enhance gradient effect.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.600
Lightly sweep along lower lash line.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.380
I’m going to make eyes defined and sophisticated.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.040
Using a black pencil eyeliner, fill in between lashes

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.640
and give a flick creating a bold wing.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.640
Blunt edge can give a dull image

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.760
so make sure wing is clean and sharp.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:38.900
Keep line thin for inner 2/3 and make it thicker for outer 1/3.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:46.040
Trace along half of lower line and blend using a brush.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.380
Taking a light champaign pencil eyeliner, apply onto inner corner of lower lash line.

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.580
Keep it thin, light for inner 1/3 of lower lash line.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:03.840
This opens up eyes and makes eyes pop.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.280
Now it’s time for mascara!

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.620
Roll brush wand as applying mascara for better application.

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:18.480
This helps mascara on brush get on lashes more for extra volume.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.600
Use a zigzag motion on lower lashes.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.880
I’m using a false lash because I lost some of my own a few days ago.

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:34.920
I’m using a brow pencil to create a chic look.

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.640
Create an arch on 2/3 point for a sophisticated, polished look.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:46.360
Blend to make it look natural using a brow brush to complete.

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:53.260
I’m using a bright orange lipstick for a natural, healthy look.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.900
Apply lipstick and purse lips together a few times.

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:05.240
Creamy formula makes lips look full and glossy.

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:09.740
Makeup is finished! Sophisticated eyes and full lashes!

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:17.580
Natural color combination of eye shadows, blush, and lipstick creates a healthy complexion.

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.760
This makeup look is effortless, polished, and sophisticated!

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:28.900
This completes quick, easy and perfect makeup for New Yorkers.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.060
