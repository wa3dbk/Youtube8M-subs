00:00:02.785 --> 00:00:05.160
Welcome to Tekzilla Bites,
feeding your tech hunger fast.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.880
I'm Patrick Norton, and feels
like driving in the future

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.739
is the kind of product claim
that makes me groan loudly.

00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:13.530
And that's the line
that's front and center

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.190
at the top of navdy.com.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.790
But having gotten
a little face time

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.200
with a prototype of Navdy's
heads up display yesterday,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.949
I've gotta say Navdy's working
on something pretty cool.

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:24.240
I don't know if the future
is going to feel like Navdy,

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.590
but I think Navdy could
make driving better now,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.747
at least if you like navigation
tools and cell phones.

00:00:29.747 --> 00:00:32.080
So Navdy brings together a
bunch of interesting things--

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.140
a very bright pico projector,
maybe the only pico projector

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.550
I've ever liked, that lights
up a 5.1 inch heads up display.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.680
That patent pending
display brings navigation,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.590
text messages, and notifications
from other iOS and Android apps

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.760
together with OBD2
information from your car.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.450
It adds in a mic for
voice recognition

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.180
and an IR camera for
touchless gesture control.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.290
Sound huge?

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:55.230
Its all in a slim package that
sits on your dashboard, powered

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.050
by your OBD2 port,
or from 12 volts off

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.310
your car's electrical system.

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.730
Now, Navdy's going
to ship with support

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.460
for Google Maps in the
box, and the company

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.376
is excited that it'll
be able to deliver heads

00:01:04.376 --> 00:01:07.330
up navigation info-- left
turn-- that won't disappear

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.220
because Uncle
Timmy's texting you.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.260
Matter of fact, you can
swipe right to dismiss

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.160
any notification that
shows up on the screen,

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.202
or swipe left to say answer
that call from the office.

00:01:16.202 --> 00:01:18.660
I like it, though the touchless
controls weren't integrated

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.650
into the demo unit
I got to check out.

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:22.500
And those touchless
controls working

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.770
are going to be critical
to Navdy being awesome.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.287
So what was working on that
unit was OBD2, navigation,

00:01:28.287 --> 00:01:29.870
and the Bluetooth
link from the phone.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:32.596
Navdy's quoting 20,000 nits
brightness for the screen,

00:01:32.596 --> 00:01:34.095
which means it's
totally usable when

00:01:34.095 --> 00:01:35.542
it's bright and
sun shiny outside.

00:01:35.542 --> 00:01:37.750
And when you adjust the fold
up projector and screen,

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.510
you really get the sensation
that the information

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:41.160
is floating out in front
of you near the bottom

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.910
of the windshield.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.368
So unless you're really in love
with the color of your hood

00:01:44.368 --> 00:01:46.170
or the hood ornament
on your vintage truck,

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.829
Navdy's not gonna block
anything useful in front of you.

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:51.120
Don't want notifications from
this or that application?

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.270
Don't want your kids getting
text messages or updates

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.395
from social apps when
they're in the driver's seat?

00:01:55.395 --> 00:01:56.942
Navdy promises
that the user will

00:01:56.942 --> 00:01:58.900
be able to control what
notifications they get.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.646
No text messages, text
messages only when stopped,

00:02:01.646 --> 00:02:03.020
parental controls
so that you can

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.740
control what your
kids have access to,

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.373
and that access looks like
it could be really extensive.

00:02:07.373 --> 00:02:09.789
Navdy says they're going to
ship with iTunes, Google Play,

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:11.430
Pandora controls,
and they're hoping

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.415
to bring on board a lot
more navigation auto

00:02:13.415 --> 00:02:16.522
and entertainment apps before
the units ship in early 2015.

00:02:16.522 --> 00:02:18.480
We didn't get a huge
amount of time with Navdy,

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.560
but I gotta say what
I saw looked smart.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.555
A bright, crisp display, access
to the apps you know and use

00:02:23.555 --> 00:02:26.900
on iOS and Android, no weird
custom apps, no monthly fees.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:29.030
A simple silicon friction
mount for the dash.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:30.920
Not my favorite, but
Navdy says custom mounts

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.160
are coming in the future.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.630
You can root your audio to
the car stereo, your earpiece,

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.000
or the speakers in the Navdy,
and the gesture controls

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.560
are coming from a
third party that

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.191
already has
technology that works.

00:02:40.191 --> 00:02:40.690
Smart.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.874
You know what else is smart?

00:02:41.874 --> 00:02:44.040
Letting somebody else drive
if you've been drinking.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.540
Seriously.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.480
Drive sober or get pulled over.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.420
Nobody gets in their car
thinking I'm drunk, I'm driving

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.580
and I'm going to kill
somebody tonight.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.806
Our sponsors at the NHTSA
want you to know on average,

00:02:54.806 --> 00:02:56.430
more than 10,000
people die on the road

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:57.990
each year due to drunk driving.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:59.865
To stop this deadly
epidemic, law enforcement

00:02:59.865 --> 00:03:01.366
in every state
and most US cities

00:03:01.366 --> 00:03:03.990
are going to be cracking down on
drunk driving from August 15th

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:05.060
through Labor Day.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.900
They'll see you
before you see them.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.020
If you've been drinking,
do me favor, please

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.550
let a sober person drive.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.050
Wow.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:11.758
That was serious.

00:03:11.758 --> 00:03:12.440
You know what?

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:13.939
So is keeping your
eyes on the road,

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.510
not on your phone, which
brings us back to Navdy.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.490
Does driving in the
future sound expensive?

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.520
If you pre-order it 30
days from August 5th,

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.050
it'll cost you $299,
a fraction of what

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:25.400
car manufacturers charge
for in-dash systems.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.000
After that 30 day, offer, the
price is going to go up to $499

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.632
until it ships, which is still
a fraction what a system would

00:03:31.632 --> 00:03:33.090
cost in a new car,
and you probably

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.360
won't get a cool heads up
display that looks like this.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.818
Screw driving in
the future, I want

00:03:36.818 --> 00:03:39.310
to try driving in the now
with Navdy's display and touch

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.900
gestures.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.500
navdy.com is the website
to learn more or pre-order

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:43.230
a Navdy.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:45.990
tekzilla.com is the place where
my big weekly show takes place,

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:48.310
or you can subscribe on
youtube.com/tekzilla.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.480
And if you want to learn
how to tune up your car,

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:53.300
you should check out

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.030
I'm Patrick Norton,
thanks for watching

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:57.910
