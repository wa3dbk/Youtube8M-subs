00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.800
Astronomers have accurately measured the size
of the remote dwarf planet Eris for the first

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.060
time.

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:15.010
They caught it as it passed in front of a
faint star, using the Belgian TRAPPIST telescope

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:20.640
at ESO’s La Silla Observatory, along with
two other telescopes in Chile.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.230
The new observations show that Eris is an
almost perfect twin of Pluto in size.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:31.470
Eris also seems to be extremely reflective,
probably because it is covered in a thin layer

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:38.050
of frozen atmosphere.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:39.840
This is the ESOcast!

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.040
Cutting-edge science and life behind the scenes
at ESO, the European Southern Observatory.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:57.440
Exploring the ultimate frontier with our host
Dr J, a.k.a. Dr Joe Liske.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:02.070
In this episode, we are going to look at new
observations of the distant dwarf planet Eris

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.100
as it passed in front of a background star
— an event called an occultation — and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:12.140
what these results have revealed.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.750
Occultations are rather like eclipses —the
background star disappears behind the object

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.860
and reappears on its other side.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.280
As viewed from Earth, the brightness of the
background star suddenly drops and then returns

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.490
equally suddenly to its previous level.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.350
By looking at these two events, astronomers
can measure the size and shape of the occulting

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.190
foreground object.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:43.090
If they also know the mass of this object
they can then determine its density.

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.650
Occultations of stars by distant objects in
the Solar System are very hard to observe

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.780
because of the small size of the objects.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.370
But occultations are often the only way to
learn about these remote specks, as they are

00:01:55.370 --> 00:02:00.570
too distant and too small to be seen as anything
more than faint points of light, even through

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.390
powerful telescopes.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.479
The occultation technique has now enabled
astronomers to learn a lot more about the

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:10.869
dwarf planet Eris.

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:16.450
Eris was identified as a large object in the
outer Solar System in 2005.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.940
Its discovery was one of the factors that
led to the creation of a new class of objects

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:30.670
called dwarf planets and the reclassification
of Pluto from planet to dwarf planet in 2006.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.920
Eris is three times farther from the Sun than
Pluto at the moment, and until now was believed

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.210
to be about 25% bigger.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:44.110
But the new observations show that Eris is
in fact almost exactly the same size as Pluto,

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:50.910
with a diameter of around 2330 kilometers.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.489
Because Eris also has a moon, called Dysnomia,
astronomers have also been able to calculate

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.970
the mass of Eris by a careful study of this
moon’s orbit.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.300
Using the new diameter and known mass, they
then calculated the density of the Eris, which

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:11.650
now appears to be greater than astronomers
had previously thought.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.569
Eris seems to be a rocky body surrounded by
a thick mantle of ice.

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.040
The dwarf planet turns out to reflect almost
all of the light that falls on it — its

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.040
surface is even brighter than fresh snow on
Earth.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.750
Eris is probably covered in a very thin layer
of frozen atmosphere that is likely to consist

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:34.370
of frozen nitrogen mixed with methane.

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.540
It is probably the result of the freezing
of Eris’s atmosphere as the dwarf planet’s

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:44.300
elongated orbit takes it far away from the
Sun.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:48.730
These important new observations, made with
relatively small telescopes, have allowed

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.709
astronomers to measure Eris’s properties
better than ever before.

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:57.510
This is another step towards understanding
the mysterious objects that lie in the remote

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.730
parts of our own Solar System.

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.440
This is Dr. J signing off for the ESOcast.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:15.659
Join me again next time for another cosmic
adventure.
