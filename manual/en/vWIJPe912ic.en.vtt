00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.100
This came for you.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.920
So hey, remember that one that she sent you where she asked you to get those pictures

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:19.920
of Applejack's brother?

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:20.580
Yeah.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.400
And then she told you to write a critique of Mac's physical appearance?

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.960
Yeah.

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:25.960
Then, she sent you critique to Mac.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.820
Yeah.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.060
Would ya' tell you learn from that?

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.240
A phillips screwdriver is persuasive but not seductive,

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.180
and also, Rarity charges out
the butt for stuff I really think she

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.480
should do as a friend.

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:36.980
So...

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:38.120
What's this one then?

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.040
It says,

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.040
"Drink this, then tell me what you learn."

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.920
All right...

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.780
Hang on...

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.600
And here's a bucket.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.880
Okay, go ahead.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.380
Oh! It's got an aftertaste.

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:53.660
Uh oh..

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.460
Well, I see you didn't barf up the
spell.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:05.000
I know she can make these potions
palatable, anything happen?

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.920
Aye, but truth be told, it's come so far out of
left field for me, I don't actually have

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:10.600
any feelings of about it!

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:11.240
What?

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:13.360
Oh...

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:14.340
What?

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:15.320
Wait...

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:16.280
What?

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:17.940
Pretty much what I was thinkin'.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.040
No one's going to understand but, here we are.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.120
So... what now alicorn princess,

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.960
envy of little girls everywhere?

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.320
Sorry.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.960
I...

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.440
I just turned into an alicorn today.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.400
I'm not used to the wings

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.640
Yeah...

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:42.380
So...

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.200
It's like,

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:45.090
different being an alicorn.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.220
I was thinking about maybe what I could do

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.970
with the new powers like, maybe I could
use them in some awesome battle to get

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:51.960
something I like.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.460
Hey!

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.900
Now that I'm a God, from now on,
you're going to give me my books for free.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.810
See, but then I can't think of anything,
where violence is really going to

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:58.979
benefit me in the long run.

00:01:58.979 --> 00:01:59.479
Hey, come on!

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:00.539
You don't have to close down!

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:01.560
I'll pay normal price,

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.180
I'll pay!

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.320
Ok fine!

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.160
I'll pay double!

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.400
I mean, I always
had potential to be violent.

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.200
So, I guess nothing has changed.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.400
Maybe now it's worse.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.280
YOU KEEP THE BOOKSTORE OPEN!

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.880
YOU GET THE
BOOKSTORE OPEN, OR I WILL SUMMON THE KING

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.860
IN YELLOW INTO YOUR LEFT EAR!

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.040
So you're an
alicorn now, huh?

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.840
Yep.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.280
Are you one forever?

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.300
I don't know?

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.880
Oh...

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.880
Well,

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.280
your wings are very cool!

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.060
Yeah, I guess they're ok.

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.660
You can get around really fast with those I bet.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.959
I guess that's true.

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.499
Oh, hang on, I got to check on something.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.200
Sorry, I'm cooking dinner right now, and I

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.340
almost forgot about it.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.880
Why don't you just use your god-like
magic powers to fix the dress?

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.290
I don't have time to be fixing all your
clothes, if you're just gonna

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.760
spontaneously grow wings.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.940
I don't know any spells for fixing clothes.
