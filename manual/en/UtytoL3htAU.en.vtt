00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:07.419
Hello everyone, Kevin Smith here again, TubaLove,
and the next part of my typical practice session

00:00:07.419 --> 00:00:14.510
is octaves. Now when I started with just doing
the general slurring, I was just going down

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:22.530
to basically the next open note. And then
as I was working on intervals, I was increasing

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:31.880
the note up as far as an octave. What that
was doing is gradually giving my embouchure

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:37.600
time to warm up. Because you'll notice I mean
the longer or the farther the distance between

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.400
each of these notes, the more you have to
adjust your lips and your rather your jaw

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.220
and what's called your embouchure. So if you're
starting out that kind of thing early, you're

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.309
not really giving your embouchure the time
to warm up properly. So now that I've done

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:00.129
the intervals. Now I'm going to take it a
little bit further and just warm up with octaves,

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:06.600
which is the next as I said earlier the note
that sounds just like another one except that

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:15.060
it's higher in pitch like this. Usually when
I do them, I usually do three notes or one

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.030
entirety of two octaves. So if I start in
a low F, and again when you're doing these,

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.030
continue to slur them. Don't tongue yet. The
slurring gives your better opportunity early

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.799
on to get the embouchure going and to get
that feeling of the air support that's needed

00:01:31.799 --> 00:02:08.609
to keep that gliding sound in between the
notes. That real flowing sense.

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:13.540
That the high C there is about as high as
I would go for the moment. And also that clicking

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.739
that you heard was the spit that was building
up in my horn.
