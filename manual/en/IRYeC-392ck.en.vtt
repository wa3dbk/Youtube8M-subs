00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:21.220
Somewhere, Elton John is crying.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.510
It wasn’t bad enough that Shatner decided
he was going to a horrible injustice to the

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.230
concept of the “Rocket Man,” but then
you’ve got these jokers coming along, what

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.360
with their twin-stick shooting and all.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.760
In what could easily be some plot out of Futurama,
this Zap Whatshisface wannabe is charged with

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.829
staying the hell away from a diplomatic envoy
because they’re afraid he’s going to put

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:44.350
too much “dip” in it.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.989
And frankly, they’re not completely off
the mark.

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.970
So he sends you, player-generated avatar character
person, to bounce around the galaxy and fight

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:56.030
off the martian menace while utilizing as
little animation as possible.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:00.070
It’s like a Hanna-Barbera cartoon up in
here.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:08.700
Yeah, I wasn’t doing those audio hiccups,
those come standard with the game.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.610
It wouldn’t be so bad, these sorry attempts
at aping the whole “comic book” aesthetic,

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.490
if there were a level of discretion to it.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:21.800
But no, every time there’s any plot point,
new toy, or... well, if one of them gets bored

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.360
or lonely, BAM.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.760
Poorly acted, poorly timed, poorly written
cutscene, just breaking the flow of an already

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:30.750
dicey game.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.650
When you’re not dealing with these jokers,
you’re two-stickin’ it through various

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.780
environs, running like a man suspended by
strings from John Cusack’s hand and blasting

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.890
the bejeezus out of any green-skinned hostiles
that should materialize in your way.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.920
There are a slew of powered-up weapons and
secondary weapons to aid in your slaughter.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:58.850
Unfortunately, much as you’d like to, you
can’t just wing the actors on your own sidelines.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.720
So if you can tolerate this imbecile, you’ve
got... a shooter with some breadth, even if

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.450
the path through a given area is a little
on the linear side.

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.360
With every downed foe, you collect EXP, which
can be spent between missions on stat upgrades,

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:16.660
weapon upgrades, armaments, or armor.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.420
And if you’re thinking this is kinda similar
to the WizKids collectible strategy game franchise

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:28.280
“Rocketmen” that lasted almost a year
in the mid-aughts, well, you’re correct.

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.800
Now it’s popping up on XBLA and the Capcom
Digital Collection.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.880
Sure, they can republish this but we can’t
get a re-pressing of the original Shantae?

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:40.890
I’d gladly trade this thing for some new
Breath of Fire or something.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.870
Heck, burn this thing at an altar, appease
the spirit of Inafune, and give us hope of

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.280
Megaman Legends 3.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.020
That’d be preferable.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:57.580
That’d be fine by me.
