00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:49.440
Assassin's Creed Rearmed
It is available for iPad and iPhone.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:58.489
Can download and play it for free.
This is a simple Assassin's Creed Multiplayer

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:03.690
game.
But there are some interesting points and

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.890
interesting ideas in this game.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.549
Let's start a quick match and later I can
tell you more.

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:18.549
I start with 1 ability - Disguise only,
select a Synergy Hack to have Disguise twice

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.970
longer.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.550
And here comes the match.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.630
So, I will select Deacon.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.340
I will play against 1 opponent and his name
is raddish55.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:43.340
And we will play in Venice.

00:01:44.049 --> 00:01:49.739
This only like "top-view" game, so a little
bit unusual from the beginning.

00:01:49.739 --> 00:01:54.800
To move - you should tap the screen - you
see I tapped - there is a white point and

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.080
I walk to it.
If I want to run - I double tap to it.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.270
My target is a Doctor,
from the top view he looks like a Big Hat.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.360
you see the icon in the left top corner of
the screen

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.580
and he is near me.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.580
And we successfully killed each other.
When only 2 players in the match, so we can

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:27.440
kill each other, yes if we tap each other
at the same time.

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.610
So, means you should identify your target
quicker.

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.690
And tap him.
You see, he climbed up to the roof and in

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.379
Disguise.
And I killed him.

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:44.620
Because he stunned a civilian
because he did not expect I will be also in

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.659
Disguise.
So I jumped down from the roof and tying to

00:02:47.659 --> 00:02:50.230
find him again.
I get the target...

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.440
This circle is the range of you actions
and you see, the arrow is the compass.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:03:02.440
The arrow is working pretty the same as a
compass in normal Assassin's Creed games.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.900
Arrow becomes more blur and disappear - means
my target is near.

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.990
Oopps, I stunned a civilian.
But he also stunned a civilian - you see - he

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.920
is staying there - not moving.
Ouch, I am late...

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.870
Now Doctor is in the lead.
You can see the score of every player in the

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.790
right top corner.
Totally it can be up to 4 players in this

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.290
match
and there is only one type of the match,

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.910
not like Wanted or Assassinate - is only one,
is something between Assassinate and Wanted.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.150
You see, he was in Disguise, I noticed him
because he was not moving.

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.440
Civilians in this game are always moving.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.319
Every match in Assassin's Creed Rearmed lasts
for 5 minutes.

00:03:55.319 --> 00:04:00.480
He stunned a civilian.
Now, he will die.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:06.150
The interesting concept in this game is that
you actually can kill each other.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:12.390
But how to judge who killed the first?
Yeah, of course, who pressed the character,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.930
who pressed the first - kill the first.
But the is also interesting thing...

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.910
Ok he stunned a civilian again...
But the interesting point is that you can

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:28.910
select your weapon and the weapon has range
and damage - exactly like in a Single player

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:37.910
game.

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.780
We killed each other again.
And spawned too close to each other,

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:51.620
so I have no arrow, but probably he also has
no point.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.870
Ok, you see - he stopped!
Now I know which one!

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:00.680
So, I will try to wait until we will approach
to me.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:07.680
That one behind!
No, I am late!

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.990
Ouch!
A little bit unfair - I spawned just right

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.860
near by him.
Very close again.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:25.860
I think is this one.
Yeah! We killed each other again.

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:33.360
Speaking about the selection of the weapon...
There are just 5 point, or 5 grades of the

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:41.870
range of each weapon and of the damage.
Sure, you want the weapon with the longest

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:47.120
range and with the biggest damage, but this
weapon is very expensive.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:54.120
And probably, to buy this weapon you should
spend some diamonds, maybe you should buy

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.840
it for the real money, real cash.
But by playing the game you can earn some

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:06.840
Florins and you can buy some weapons using
this currency.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:14.830
Ok, I won this game!
Score is counted similar to the Brotherhood.

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:21.990
there is a score and End Bonus.
And you can earn XP and Florins for every

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:26.650
match.
Your level will grow with the XP and you can

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:33.650
use Florins to buy abilities, weapons or streaks.
Now I only have only 3 abilities from 9 in

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:42.139
total.
I will show you more later in other videos.

00:06:42.139 --> 00:06:44.280
And for now -
Have a Nice Game!

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:55.200
