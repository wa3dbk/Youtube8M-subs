Rick Van Zee, company is Frontier Cabinets.
We've been in business for 29 years. We started

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:37.739
in 1984. We're in the city of Norwalk, California.
One of the best tools that we have in our

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:44.739
shop thats free, is Decore.com.
My secretary, Cindy, will get them online

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.729
sometimes when they are on the phone, when
they are not on the phone. Bring them to the

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:55.710
website, walk them through Decore.com. Super easy... pick out door styles, all kinds of

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.269
different things. They've got drawer boxes
to look at, they've got hardware to look at,

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:08.269
its a good tool for us.
You can go to their website and pick out profiles...

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.829
different drawer box styles, solid panel drawer
fronts, recessed panel drawer front, raised

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:19.290
panel drawer front... A lot of times our customers
have a hard time telling the difference between

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.000
a recessed panel door and a solid raised panel
door.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.310
Solid raised panel door right there in your
website is awesome! Lots of galleries for

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.640
them to look for, lots of pictures, lots of
neat things. It's a good thing.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.930
Decore.com has helped Frontier Cabinets in
a way of their new products they have out

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:44.000
there right now its, beaded face frames, which
we've never offered before. Didn't really

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.640
have the need to buy the machine. We don't
do that many jobs.It's a beautiful look.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:56.640
They offer the new finish line, finishes,
paints, all stuff like that. It's beautiful

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.830
stuff they put out there. We went through
there finishing facility and looked at all

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.020
that stuff and how it ran. Nice, nice stuff.
