00:00:01.810 --> 00:00:03.649
That nest is getting ready to hatch.

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.070
Look at ‘em all.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.480
Are you kidding me?

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:09.480
Goodness!

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.400
Each year, from late July to November, tiny
sea turtle hatchlings seemingly vanish into

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.390
the vast ocean along Florida’s coast.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:24.730
The sea turtle lost years includes the time
from which the turtles emerge from their nests,

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.189
crawl down and enter into the ocean, and then
they swim off shore.

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:35.720
Bound for destinations unknown, for decades
researchers were left to guess where the hatchlings

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.060
journeyed during their lost years.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:43.410
We don’t really know what they do, where
they go, in part because it’s really difficult

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.280
to access those off shore waters.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.260
That life history stage has been historically
understudied.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:59.120
Before now we just called them “the lost
years” and kind of threw up our hands.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.500
Depending on the species, sea turtles can
spend anywhere from two to upwards of eight years at sea.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:12.500
We had to just wave goodbye to a turtle off
the beach, and then see it again several years

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:22.890
later when it came back into near shore waters.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:31.100
But now, researchers are beginning to unravel
the mysteries of the sea turtle’s lost years.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.140
For this youngest stage of sea turtle, it’s
really important for us to understand where

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.439
they are, when they’re there, so we can
better understand perhaps what potential impacts

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.020
humans might have on these turtles.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.890
Where do sea turtles go during their lost
years?

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:56.420
And how are new technologies helping to solve
this oceanic enigma?
