Hi! I am Weldon Moon on behalf of Expertvillage.com.
I am going to just show you a few steps to

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.700
building a spiral staircase. One is to obtain
the materials you need to do it. One, you

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.939
need some type of a top for your pole, at
the center of your spiral, so that someone

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:36.230
is not sticking their hands down in and have
them catching rain water and all kinds of

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.789
things. So we have chosen a sphere that we
attach to the top, lot of people would think

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:47.659
well I can just weld that on but in this case
do not do it. It is better to attach it with

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:55.920
screws on the inside of the pipe. Two, when
they move this and powder coat it finish your

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.170
product, they need to be able to hold it and
that is one of the ways, that they can hold

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.149
it by sticking something inside, so that is
one of the reasons you do not want to do that,

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:08.640
another piece we use for the handrail, this
is one that we normally use. This is a piece

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.880
of 2 x 1 channel, 1 x 8 thick, it works quite
well because you can roll it, there is enough

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.750
strength to be able to do that and also you
will be able to twist and that helps you as

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.920
you put that handrail on to your spiral. The
pickets normally that we have used are Â¾

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:40.060
x Â¾ square tubing and it is a 065 wall thickness
on, it works great for pickets. Then also

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.060
our center pipe does not need to be heavy,
so you can use something very light and not

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:56.000
add weight to it, but as you can see this
is a 4 x 1/8 thick tubing and it is exactly

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.090
4 inches in diameter, you can find that is
not a pipe, it is a tubing and so it takes

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.070
a little bit of looking around to get that
one and then also use diamond plate 10 gauge

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:15.569
diamond plate. That has been formed and cut
to the sizes that we need and that how we

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:16.579
use for our trades.
