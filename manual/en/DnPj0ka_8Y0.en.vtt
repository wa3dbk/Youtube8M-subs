This is John Kohler with okraw.com with another
exciting episode for you today.

00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:08.840
What we're going to do is we're going to share
1 simple rule and probably the most important

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.630
rule having to do with raw foods.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:15.510
Many times my videos are fairly long so I
can convey a lot of information.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:19.380
But in this video it's actually going to be
fairly short so let's get right to it.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.300
So the number 1 rule for raw foods if you
ask most people on the street based on my

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.480
independent survey of me
giving a talk around the country entitled

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.050
just because it's raw doesn't mean it's healthy
I always ask the audience

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:38.290
there the rule or what the criteria is for
raw foods and undoubtably the first one that

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.610
people always say
is it's not heated above 118 degrees now that

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:46.040
is your only criteria, if that's your number
1

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.290
criteria for raw foodsyou're in a heap of
trouble in my opinion because you can include

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.130
things
like highly processed foods that are maybe

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.110
not as healthy as other foods.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.200
So in my opinion what the number 1 rule for
raw foods should be is that you want to eat

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.700
whole
natural fresh picked as close to nature foods

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:08.300
as you possibly can.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.350
So in a raw foods diet that means you want
to eat the freshest and highest quality fresh

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.020
fruits
and vegetables and nuts and seeds as you possibly

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.050
can.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.510
So by eating the foods that are the best in
my opinion you're going to have also the best

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.860
health.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.720
This has taken me many years to learn the
true rules of raw foods, we are marketed towards

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.810
every single day of the week, products that
you need to buy to be raw or just products

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.780
to buy in general, all kinds of stuff that's
been marketed to us and I want to cut through

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.080
all
the BS and just give you the solid truth.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:49.729
So hopefully now you know the rule you can
follow it, if there was overall 1 main rule

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.390
that I
had to say by raw foods it's you know, mother

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.690
natures rule.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.710
Eat what's found naturally in mother nature,
people and animals have been doing this for

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.909
literally
millions of years and mother nature can't

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:03.909
go wrong.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.590
It's only when humans get involved and profit
motos and people get involved to sell products

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.390
that they're going to profit off you and potentially
your health is when we get arised.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.680
So remember eat natural foods that are found
in nature as fresh as possible.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.450
So the fresh fruits and fresh vegetables make
up the majority of your diet.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.380
If you have enjoyed this episode learning
this one rule to raw foods be sure to tune
