00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.150
Once the excitement abated, my first rational
thought after playing Wii Sports for the first

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.370
time was, “Holy crap, I can’t wait for
a new Mario Tennis!”

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:31.740
Then, it never came.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.540
And my next thought was, “What the **** happened?”

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:40.770
Fast forward a few years, and Nintendo finally
seems poised to address one of their biggest

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.660
recent letdowns—the sudden deterioration
of Mario sports games.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:51.440
Forget the Square Enix stuff, forget the utterly
average Super Sluggers, forget the mediocre

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.440
mixes.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.770
Camelot is here to revitalize the plumber’s
athletic career with Mario Tennis Open.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:06.820
They just...they should’ve pushed him a
little harder.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:12.600
A new release for the Nintendo 3DS, Mario
Tennis Open is a pretty huge deal.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.990
It’s the first Mario tennis game since the
outstanding Mario Power Tennis, released eight

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.580
years ago for the GameCube.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.750
And if only because it’s done by the same
developer, this game has an immediately satisfying

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.750
feel.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.440
Mario Tennis Open is a throwback to the best
Mario sports games.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.990
Accessible, but slightly complex.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.100
Colorful, but faithful to the game.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.640
The only catch is...it’s also great, but
slightly disappointing.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.820
The game plays exactly like you remember.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.970
It forces you through a tutorial at the beginning—the
first of many additions to make things more

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.220
accessible—but if you’ve played Mario
Power Tennis, you won’t need it.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:58.470
Mario Tennis Open is really the same expertly
balanced game of arcade tennis at its core.

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:08.140
There are 16 characters from the Super Mario
universe to choose from, and they’re mostly

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.179
the usual suspects.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.030
But one of the cool additions to Mario Tennis
Open is you can play as your Mii, and the

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.000
game feels designed around the idea that your
Mii is a primary component.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.920
You’re constantly unlocking new items to
purchase, from new racquets to Mario t-shirts,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.410
that you can use to customize your Mii.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.330
It’s a lot of fun to tinker with, but the
system has a few problems.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.531
First, the items can only be used on your
Mii, and it’d be great if you could customize

00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:36.390
other characters, as well.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.060
And two, it’s kinda confusing to figure
out what impact those items will have.

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:45.920
The customization process also serves to upgrade
your Mii, but the game doesn’t make clear

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.200
what the benefits of Mario wrist bands are.

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.260
Aside from looking badass.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:57.550
In terms of the status quo, there are tournaments,
exhibitions and minigames...always a highlight

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.760
in a Mario tennis game.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.920
In fact, in this case, one has you guiding
Mario through the original Super Mario Bros.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.920
with a tennis ball.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.040
That’s the kind of thing you expect from
Mario tennis, but you also expect the integration

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.350
of the characters’ personalities into the
gameplay...and strangely enough, that’s

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:20.900
where the game disappoints.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.930
One of the highlights of Mario Power Tennis
was the individuality of the characters.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.710
Each one had special powers that referenced
their own games, each one felt different from

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:31.710
the others.

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.150
But in Mario Tennis Open, not exactly the
case.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:39.370
The game’s power-ups are shared—they’re
just panels on the court—and the differences

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:42.430
between characters are a bit less pronounced.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:48.060
It gives Mario Tennis Open a more streamlined
and even realistic feel, but it also feels

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:50.370
slightly less Mario.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:55.710
Even so, it’s easily the best Mario sports
game since Mario Strikers Charged and the

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:00.320
first one since to have that addictive feel
these spin-offs were known for.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:05.800
Most of those classic characteristics are
back, and new additions like crazy gyroscope

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.100
controls make things easier for newcomers.

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:14.370
It’s not Mario Power Tennis, but when it
comes to every other arcade tennis game on

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.900
a Nintendo console since...it’s no contest.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.989
Advantage Mario Tennis Open!

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:27.060
And better late than never.
