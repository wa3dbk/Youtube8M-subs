00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.330
Here, "TAZUKURI" is done.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.620
It has a crisp taste. 
 Please eat up.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:15.140
Hello, I'm Mie SHIRAISHI.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:21.220
Today, we are going to make TAZAKURI
 in New Year OSECHI cuisine.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.510
TAZUKURI is made from anchovy.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:30.380
In ancient times, it was used for a fertilizer in rice fields

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:33.960
There is an old saying hence the name 
TAZUKURI(making rice fields rich).

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:40.860
So, TAZAKURI is as a good luck charm 
to produce a rich harvest.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:44.140
Even now, 
we Japanese eat it on New Year's Day

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.980
I would like to explain the ingredients.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.920
1-3/4 oz or 50g dried anchovy.
You can use dried sardine.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:01:05.010
Today, I will use peanuts.
It tastes good to use walnuts too.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:10.280
Sugar, Mirin(sweet cooking sake) and soy sauce 
are the same in quantity.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.510
It's sesame.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.390
Let's get started.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.860
First, fry the dried anchovy without oil.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.810
Turn on gas.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.190
Turn on the heat to between medium and high.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:43.860
When the pan is heated, 
add the dried anchovy without oil.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.680
Scramble them continually so as to not burn them.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.630
Roast them and make dry well.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.790
Keep scrambling so as  not to burn them.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:11.450
If it's burned, it will badly smell like burning.

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.950
Exsiccate them until you hear a crackling sound from them.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:21.230
You may season them to taste
whether exsiccated or not.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.700
When they are exsiccated, it's done.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:32.170
Once done, take out them from the pan.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.200
Next,
this is the clean pan that has been washed.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.460
Add the seasoning.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.910
The soy sauce.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.880
The sugar.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.240
The Mirin(sweet cooking sake).

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.550
Turn on the gas.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.550
Heat them until dissolved and bubbling.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.310
Add the exsiccated anchovy that you were cooking.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.160
Mix them well.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.560
Cook them quick from now.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:19.500
When all seasoning is mixed together...

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.600
Add the peanuts.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.030
Finally, add the sesame.

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:40.310
Mix them together.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.100
It's done.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.860
Take out them from the pan.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.760
It's done.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.350
Place up them to a dish.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:17.590
I have readied a typical plate in New Year's dishes.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.760
Place them like this.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:31.680
It's taste good to use peanuts 
in place of walnuts or cashew nuts.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.020
It's ready.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.680
Here, "TAZUKURI" is done.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.480
It has a crisp taste.
 Please eat up.
