00:00:00.147 --> 00:00:02.046
- [Dan] Hey Dan from Vehix411,

00:00:02.046 --> 00:00:05.447
we got a '96 Oldsmobile Aurora.

00:00:05.447 --> 00:00:08.634
I'll show you how to program
the keyless into remote.

00:00:08.634 --> 00:00:10.638
As you can see,

00:00:10.638 --> 00:00:13.041
this is the remote.

00:00:13.041 --> 00:00:14.928
It doesn't lock or unlock.

00:00:14.928 --> 00:00:17.181
Can't hear nothing.

00:00:17.181 --> 00:00:21.264
The remote for this
particular year is this kind.

00:00:26.272 --> 00:00:29.105
And this is the part number on it.

00:00:30.174 --> 00:00:33.424
So if you can see it's 2 5 6 7 8 7 9 2.

00:00:39.723 --> 00:00:43.140
And FCC ID is K zero, or K O B U T 1 B T.

00:00:47.792 --> 00:00:51.169
I'll show you how to program this remote.

00:00:51.169 --> 00:00:54.695
What you need is a keyless remote,

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:56.090
and a paperclip.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.307
And your car keys.

00:00:58.307 --> 00:01:00.551
What you're gonna do is,

00:01:00.551 --> 00:01:02.218
crawl under the car.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.774
Which is right over here,

00:01:04.774 --> 00:01:06.383
where the gas pedal is.

00:01:06.383 --> 00:01:09.383
You'll see this data link connector.

00:01:11.845 --> 00:01:13.562
That's what it's called.

00:01:13.562 --> 00:01:16.313
What you do is short out pin number four.

00:01:16.313 --> 00:01:17.587
And the number eight,

00:01:17.587 --> 00:01:18.865
in this case.

00:01:18.865 --> 00:01:21.198
It's one, two, three, four.

00:01:26.004 --> 00:01:26.837
And eight.

00:01:28.602 --> 00:01:30.852
So that's how it should be.

00:01:32.046 --> 00:01:33.769
Four and eight.

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:35.936
The number four, is black.

00:01:39.526 --> 00:01:42.279
Number eight pin is black and white wire.

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:44.456
So make sure you do that,

00:01:44.456 --> 00:01:47.882
so you don't short out
one of these or these,

00:01:47.882 --> 00:01:48.715
you know what I mean?

00:01:48.715 --> 00:01:50.188
Because this thing is kind of like a

00:01:50.188 --> 00:01:52.438
triangle edge looking plug.

00:01:54.796 --> 00:01:56.379
So once we do that,

00:01:57.314 --> 00:01:59.644
before you do that you gotta make sure

00:01:59.644 --> 00:02:01.930
the keys were out of the ignition.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:02.884
Since mine were not in all the way

00:02:02.884 --> 00:02:04.485
I just had them set up over here.

00:02:04.485 --> 00:02:06.296
So key out of the ignition.

00:02:06.296 --> 00:02:07.365
Short that out,

00:02:07.365 --> 00:02:09.548
number four and number eight pin.

00:02:09.548 --> 00:02:10.577
Put the key in ignition.

00:02:10.577 --> 00:02:11.603
Put the ignition on.

00:02:11.603 --> 00:02:13.259
Don't start the car.

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:16.975
And then push lock and and
un-lock for 30 seconds,

00:02:16.975 --> 00:02:18.308
and hold it.

00:02:18.308 --> 00:02:21.773
So we push that and hold
it for about 30 seconds.

00:02:21.773 --> 00:02:25.307
And the car should lock
and un-lock the door

00:02:25.307 --> 00:02:27.989
that will confirm that
it's been programmed.

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.406
So we'll wait for 30 seconds.

00:02:32.328 --> 00:02:34.247
(click)

00:02:34.247 --> 00:02:36.502
Now you heard the car lock.

00:02:36.502 --> 00:02:38.257
Since we did that.

00:02:38.257 --> 00:02:41.991
What we'll do is turn the ignition off.

00:02:41.991 --> 00:02:43.241
Remove the pin.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.534
And then put the key out of the ignition.

00:02:47.534 --> 00:02:49.677
And see what we did.

00:02:49.677 --> 00:02:51.108
(click)

00:02:51.108 --> 00:02:52.339
As you can see the car locks.

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:54.103
(beep, beep)

00:02:54.103 --> 00:02:54.936
And un-locks.

00:02:54.936 --> 00:02:58.511
So that's how we program
the 1996 Oldsmobile remote.
