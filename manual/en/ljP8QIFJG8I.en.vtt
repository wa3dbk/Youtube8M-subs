00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.040
I cross your pathway so frequently

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.410
and yet you pretend to not recognize me.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.360
I have, nevertheless, always been the ally of truly Great Souls :

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.790
Socrate, Khadija, Hugo, Mandela.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.120
Even the prophets were my confidants.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:33.080
With me, they tasted the virtues of patience,

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.440
they transformed their fears into courage,

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.520
they made their tenderness a weapon,

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.480
and of their tears a strength

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.120
to help them know their true identities.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.560
However, some people are still ashamed of me.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
To see me frequently would expose them to contempt, rejection.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.720
But those who accept me in their life win in self confidence and in fulfillment.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.280
So, are you able to see in me an opportunity to transcend yourself ?

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.960
If so, you will find beyond doubt El Rab, El Salem by your side,

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.000
through His Signs.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:24.160
My praise is a promise to walk a better path.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:26.760
I am called Imperfection.
