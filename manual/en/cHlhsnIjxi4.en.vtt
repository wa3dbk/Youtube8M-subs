hi folks this is Doug Reid this is going to
be a quick video on roughing a bowl with a

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.879
band saw and this is to help you prepare
bowl for turning

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:14.879
please remember be safe

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:17.779
the first thing to do is just a bowl
blank which is the piece of wood has

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:20.510
been prepared by someone else or you
could do this yourself

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:23.940
it’s usually a piece of hardwood with a nice 
grain to it and i

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.160
generally it’s waxed on the ends to keep it
from uh... drying too quickly I scribe a

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.390
circle on the bowl blank

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.070
as large if i can fit into the blank and
then i take my band saw

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.450
and just cut to the line

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.770
and it’s always good to remember that band saws
um... cut more quickly than a table saw

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.210
without cutting your fingers

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.289
now what i have them

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.410
blank around the down it doesn't have to
be perfect just has to be close

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.300
i'm gonna take a magic marker inscribed
relying on the side of that bowl blank

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.750
all approximately an inch down it
doesn't have to be exact and this will

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.630
be determined somewhat by uh... the
shape of the bowl you're making

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.199
but i'd take

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.220
my bowl blank

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.730
and my magic markers cried the line and
you know what i'm talking a table this

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.360
is approximately forty five degree angle
doesn't have to be perfect again you

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.890
could've adjust depending upon the size
and shape of your bowl all you could

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.500
just freehand is line that's what i'm
doing here you could use a block of wood

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.390
is that as a guide here to
work to help you with this what you've

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.050
done this word is going to cut to the
line and that's going to help reduce the

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.510
mass it'll make turning easier here they'll
be less clean up and less mess if it's a

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.979
great way to get started

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.950
this is a piece of hard dense wood and I’m going
go through it fairly slowly

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.770
so take your time with it

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:49.180
at work right Notice that I’m wearing hearing
protection and safety

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.360
glasses are a good idea when you're
working with these tools

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.020
almost there

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.850
and folks once we have that cut out
that we have a nice bowl shape started

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.720
here

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.340
and that's really all there is to it
