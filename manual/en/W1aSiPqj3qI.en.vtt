00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.020
That's kinda awkward.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.280
I even hit the helicopter!

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.880
Accidentally pressed the start button.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.740
And lost control because of that.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.620
I'm in peak form so nothing can stop me!

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.040
I keep getting chased to reach level 7. But I still have to be careful not to get busted.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.740
Driving into the spikes could've ruined the entire video.

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.380
If a friend was at my place, he'd probably do everything to distract me.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.740
If I told him I was gonna upload this on Youtube, he'd probably stop distracting me.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.760
Didn't know friendly fire existed in this game.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.160
That was quite funny!

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:00.360
Waiting is boring.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.800
What was that?

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:22.260
I'm gonna skip to where the backup finally arrives.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.160
Better get moving!

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.240
Watch the next part to find out more about the backup!
