The President:
Good evening, everybody, and
let's give it up for our host --

00:00:06.133 --> 00:00:10.567
the tallest elf I've ever
seen -- Conan O'Brien.

00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:14.400
(laughter and applause)

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.934
We're also grateful to all
the outstanding performers,

00:00:20.934 --> 00:00:24.800
the choirs, the glee clubs who
are sharing their tremendous

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.000
talents with us.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.200
Tonight is a chance to get
in the Christmas spirit;

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.300
to spread some joy and sing
along with artists who have much

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.633
better voices than we do.

00:00:36.633 --> 00:00:38.200
(laughter)

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:42.166
But it's also a chance to make a
real difference in the lives of

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:45.467
some very brave young people
being treated at Children's

00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:47.700
National Medical Center.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.333
Many of these kids and their
parents are going through tough

00:00:50.333 --> 00:00:54.767
times right now, and your
support helps give them a reason

00:00:54.767 --> 00:00:58.734
to hope -- not just during the
holidays, but all year round.

00:00:58.734 --> 00:01:02.934
And that's really what
Christmas is all about.

00:01:02.934 --> 00:01:07.133
Each of us is incredibly
blessed in so many ways.

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:10.967
But those blessings aren't
just meant to be enjoyed --

00:01:10.967 --> 00:01:15.433
they're meant to be used and
shared with those who have less.

00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:19.533
The Christian faith teaches us
that on this day a child was

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:22.100
born so that we might
have eternal life.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.033
And at the heart of many of the
world's great religions is the

00:01:26.033 --> 00:01:29.133
idea that we're all better off
when we treat our brothers and

00:01:29.133 --> 00:01:33.133
sisters with the same love
and compassion that we want

00:01:33.133 --> 00:01:34.867
for ourselves.

00:01:34.867 --> 00:01:39.967
So yes, tonight is about Conan
and Diana Ross and Santa and all

00:01:39.967 --> 00:01:42.467
the other talented
folks on this stage.

00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:45.533
But it's also about the
Americans who are spending this

00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:49.667
holiday in a hospital
bed, or a shelter,

00:01:49.667 --> 00:01:54.233
or protecting our freedom on
a battlefield far from home.

00:01:54.233 --> 00:01:58.800
Let's keep them in our prayers,
and follow Christ's calling to

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.867
love one another as He
has loved all of us.

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:04.300
Merry Christmas, everybody.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.900
God bless you, and God bless
these United States of America.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:10.100
(applause)
