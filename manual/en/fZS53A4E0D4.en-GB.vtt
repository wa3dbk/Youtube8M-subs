00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.689
Shipping containers are made for international maritime or overland transport. 

00:00:08.689 --> 00:00:11.919
They're mostly made of steel.

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:16.449
Their strength and resistance convinced an American businessman

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.100
in Manuel Antonio in Quepos.

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:29.119
He built the first hotel made out of containers near the national park.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:35.680
It was challenging

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.780
to get all the containers up here
as the hotel is located on a hillside.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.540
We had to use two backhoes, a tractor and a crane

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.010
to put the containers on top of each other,

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.340
just like legos.

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:53.210
All the parts of the containers

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.160
were used.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.880
For example the doors
were used for making 

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.440
containing walls

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.830
and locking bars
were used to  

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.410
make handrails in the staircase.
Everything was re-used.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.320
We saved some 60% in water and electricity costs

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.190
so the building material was environmentally friendly.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:26.200
The work started in 2013 by putting the containers on top of each other at five levels.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.159
So in fact the container remnants, waste, was transformed into a treasure.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:34.440
Yes, it is the one and only hotel entirely made out of containers in Costa Rica.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.440
Let's go and see the rooms.
Sure.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.760
As you can see, the rooms were completely remodelled.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.910
They have wooden floors,

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:07.840
a safe, cable TV,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.569
bath, warm water and air-conditioning.

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.909
Altogether 51 containers were used,

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:20.729
each 40 feet.

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:23.079
One question occured to me,

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:25.939
what happens if there is an earthquake?

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:27.799
The foundation is solid.

00:02:27.799 --> 00:02:32.239
There's a good layer of cement
to support the weight.

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:38.979
There is not much that a trembling could do.

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:42.509
This hotel, El Faro, is one option in this beautiful area

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:43.579
in our country.

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:47.389
One night in the hotel costs US 125$.

00:02:47.389 --> 00:02:51.679
For many years these containers travelled
around the world transporting cargo.

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:54.449
Today they fulfil tourists' dreams.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.500
