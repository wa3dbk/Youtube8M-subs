00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.470
there's a church a Christian Church that
is expelled the family for not

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.109
abandoning their lesbian daughter it's a
very disturbing story

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.090
cat Cooper is a detective with the
college Dale Police Department in

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:13.519
Collegedale Tennessee

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.529
her family has attended the same church

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.970
for three generations and because they
love her

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.510
they are no longer welcome by the
congregation this is its its

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.550
I don't even need to go into specific
detail we know the story is very very

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.369
well Louis

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.570
I the family a basically was given the
option

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.940
love um distancing themselves from cat
Cooper

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.820
or not being welcome at the church
anymore they did the obvious right thing

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.579
which is

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.590
not the un-christian thing up making
someone choose in this way

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.760
but the Christian thing of saying you
know what %uh what Jesus would have won

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:48.250
it if we

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.699
if we buy into this type love a

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.770
religious teaching what Jesus would have
wanted this for us to love

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:58.850
our family members and not to allow the
fact that she is a lesbian

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.670
and even though our pastor says that
that's bad to abandon her and they did

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.000
the absolute right thing

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.900
and they now have decided to leave

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.210
the church rather than submit to the
hateful values are there

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.659
a what they're they're they're
suggesting here which is that they

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:16.159
basically shine and abandon her remember
Louis

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.280
it's not they were nice

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:23.259
to their lesbian family member it's not
that they allowed her in the family

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:26.820
but under protest it's not that they
allowed her but shunned her

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.329
it's that they didn't kick her out above
the family

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:33.579
and throw her to the curb the way you
would I don't know

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.079
last week's trash what's Christian about
that how can this even be considered a

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:39.060
Christian Church

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.040
locally here you have a family that pic
realizes

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.200
that buried there more important things
then

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.579
paying your type and listening to some
clown

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.500
preacher I mean getting kicked out of
the church is the best thing that has

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:54.250
ever happened

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.030
this family yeah and and they weren't so
much cake out but they were told you've

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.430
got a show on her or you're not going to
be welcome and they said well then

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.810
work we're going to leave how can anyone
honestly say that this Christianity

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.129
which it which is not unique to this
particular church's not

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.410
I it's not everywhere in the US but this

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.330
flavor of Christianity with these views
and this type

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.450
love imposition %uh values how can
anyone really say that this is this is

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.599
Christianity in any kinda realistic form
I just don't believe that it is and I

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:26.099
think

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:30.260
reasonable christians know that that's
the case and they absolutely don't

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.000
endorse this
