00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.769
Gougères (Cheese Puff Pastries)

00:00:08.422 --> 00:00:12.317
Start by mixing the flour, sugar, and salt in a large bowl.

00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:14.410
140G (1.1 US cups) FLOUR

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.503
1 TEASPOON SUGAR

00:00:18.553 --> 00:00:20.843
1 TEASPOON SALT

00:00:21.992 --> 00:00:26.990
Then heat the butter, milk and water on high heat until it boils.

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.890
110 G (1 stick) BUTTER

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.087
12.5 CL (1/2 US cup) MILK

00:00:32.137 --> 00:00:35.603
12.5 CL (1/2 US cup) WATER

00:00:37.088 --> 00:00:42.295
As soon as it starts boiling, pour in the flour mixture and stir briskly with a spatula or wooden spoon.

00:00:42.345 --> 00:00:44.020
Continue stirring over medium heat until it dries out a bit and reaches this consistency.  This is very important.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.928
Then, remove the pan from the stove and add the eggs one by one.

00:00:48.977 --> 00:00:49.997
5 EGGS

00:00:50.046 --> 00:00:56.146
You can use a mixer for this part since it can be quite tiring.

00:00:58.008 --> 00:01:00.931
Make sure to thoroughly mix in each egg before adding the next one.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.647
You should get a soft, even pastry dough when you’re finished.

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:23.156
Add a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of pepper.

00:01:23.206 --> 00:01:24.948
1 TEASPOON SALT

00:01:24.998 --> 00:01:26.748
1 TEASPOON PEPPER

00:01:26.926 --> 00:01:29.442
Also add 180 grams (6.3 oz) of shredded gruyère cheese.

00:01:29.492 --> 00:01:32.061
180 G (6.3 oz) SHREDDED GRUYERE CHEESE

00:01:34.012 --> 00:01:40.264
Since these puff pastries will be larger than typical puff pastries, they'll need a little longer to bake.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.408
Transfer the dough into a large pastry bag, and use a large plain tip to make equal-sized lumps on the baking sheet.  Note that the baking sheet should be covered with greased parchment paper.

00:01:47.457 --> 00:01:52.468
If you don’t have a pastry bag, you can also use 2 spoons.

00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:56.895
Bake at 170° Celsius (340° F) for 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the size of your pastries.  Here, we baked them for 20 minutes.

00:01:57.658 --> 00:02:02.379
You should never open the oven while the dough is baking, since your puff pastries might collapse.

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:04.667
Then turn off the oven.  It's important to leave the pastries inside the oven while they cool.
