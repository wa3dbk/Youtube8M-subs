Hi, this is Alex! And I'm Amanda! And This is PolkaDotsAndPumps! We are going to be talking about some fashion tips

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.359
for short girls

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.390
Me, I'm like..like average height

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:21.840
but, uh, Amanda here

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.750
she's like..tiny.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.150
Some people are like, uncomfortable with their height..and so

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.080
I guess just,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.649
with these tips,

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.610
we can make you feel a little bit more comfortable.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.800
So let's get to it!

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.860
So, the first tip we have for you today is going monochrome. Now, monochrome may sound a little boring, 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.110
but

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:45.010
when you wear multiple colors you're kind of breaking up your appearance.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.420
And so, by wearing one color

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.130
You can elongate it and the best color to go monochrome with is black. 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.630
Now, it's all in the shoe. 

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.210
So, don't be afraid to rock a nice pair of heels.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.680
Ah, just make sure that before you buy them

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.320
the fit is perfect and you're comfortable in them

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.890
because if they feel like they were manufactured in the very depths of Hell,

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.360
Uhm..then you just wasted your paycheck, aha.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.020
Embrace nude pumps!

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.050
They elongate your legs and make you appear taller. But if you have a darker skin tone, 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.380
try and find a nude pump that matches your skin tone. 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.640
For an even taller look, pair with skinny jeans! Sleek lines will elongate your legs. 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.909
These are not for everyone, but if you like them wear a heel or shoe with a pointed toe. 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.420
They're going to elongate your legs

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.450
and make you appear taller.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.890
Beware of tall boots, they can cut you in half! (Not literally)

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.110
If you still love your tall boots, try going monochrome on your legs. 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.570
This will usually work with black boots.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.510
Some people will never give up their black boots.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.160
Like her for example. (Oh yeah.)

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:55.229
Try, 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.220
Black boots with some black leggings or black

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:00.170
opaque tights.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.120
Or any kind of black tights,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:04.850
with an interesting texture. 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.970
Remember that texture can keep a monochrome look interesting!

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:13.009
Always keep in mind dress silhouettes. If you're short there are plenty of dresses that will flatter you.

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:15.199
Body con dresses are not for everyone,

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:18.239
but with the sleek lines they're going to make you appear taller. 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.059
But I beg of you, for all that is good and sacred on this Earth..

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:25.509
Please make sure they fit you. Please

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:27.209
The A-Line is perfect. 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.429
Generally, A-Lines have an empire waist or a waist very close to those

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:35.319
and it gives the appearance of longer legs.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.199
They are perfect for just about everyone! :D

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:41.879
Always watch your hemlines. 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:45.509
Don't try and go for a tea length dress, which are dresses that cut off mid calf, 

00:02:45.509 --> 00:02:48.769
because they're going to make you appear stockier and shorter. 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.769
Try either going for floor-length maxi-dresses, or something that goes

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:54.919
right above your knee.

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.079
I suggest, 

00:02:56.079 --> 00:02:57.569
mid-thigh at the shortest. 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:03.629
Necklines play a huge role, too. U-shaped necklines or V-shaped necklines will make 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:05.649
you appear taller. 

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:09.249
Watch the cleavage and beware of the dreaded nip-slip!

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:13.209
If you're wearing an empire waist or a dress that cinches just below your bust,  

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:15.010
try belting it at the waist.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.539
It will give you the appearance of longer legs. 

00:03:17.539 --> 00:03:18.929
beware

00:03:18.929 --> 00:03:21.659
fourteen bands were overwhelms

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.299

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:30.029
