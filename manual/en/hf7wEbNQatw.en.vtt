00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:07.630
Hello I'm Richard on behalf of expertvillage.com
I'm going to show a example in using some

00:00:07.630 --> 00:00:17.550
of the tools of the game and some of the players
responsibility falls that pertain to the game.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.880
In this situation here I got a 2 ball that
I'm going to shoot at and a 3 ball. The 2

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.189
ball is a little bit out of reach. So what
I'm going to do here is use what we call a

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:40.620
bridge. Your bridge is brought out. You set
the bridge as such. One you want to do when

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.580
you are centering the bridge is you want to
set it flat on the table. You don't want to

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.010
operate the bridge one hand and the cue stick
on the other hand. You want this bridge to

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.760
be actually on the table, your hand on the
bridge and the supports it. You lay your self

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:04.600
on the shot and you are holding your cue as
if you are throwing a dart. You are just laying

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:10.270
your self right over the top of the cue. Rule
number one when you are using the bridge is

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.689
you want to make that object ball. You don't
want to do anything other then drop the object

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.540
ball. Any time you are using the bridge and
you are attempting to try do stuff with your

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:30.319
cue ball a lot of time it results in a miss.
Once the ball is pocket you can go over the

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:37.590
bridge and you get it out of the way. I would
show you another situation on the bridge in

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.959
a moment. But for right now also if the cue
ball happens to come back in contact with

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:48.852
the bridge it would be a fall. If you left
the bridge laying out on the table and the

00:01:48.852 --> 00:01:53.689
cue ball bounces of the rail and comes back
at it and hit it it would be a fall. Also

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:58.899
if a piece of chalk is on the table it is
the players responsibility to move the shooters

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:03.380
responsibility to remove the chalk. The piece
of chalk is on the table the cue ball comes

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:12.360
in contact with the chalk that would be consider
a fall with a shooter. Here is another example

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.840
that I'm going to show on the use on the bridge.
This is a little bit of a more difficult situation

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:21.600
we if you have a ball sitting in front of
the cue ball and you are trying to reach over

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.020
to shot that the cue ball into the cue ball.
In this case you stand your bridge right in

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:35.280
and you get this bridge built up as close
to the five balls as you can. Cue stick sitting

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.530
right over the top and you would be shooting
right over the top into the cue ball hitting

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:51.850
the two ball. ...it is important to know that
if your cue ball is sitting and you come in

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.790
contact to the cue ball with a bridge that
would be consider a fall. In this case we

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.700
are hiding behind the five ball if I come
in contact with the five ball. The five ball

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.050
would happen to come in contact with the cue
ball that would constitute a fall.
