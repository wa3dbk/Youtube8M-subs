00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.160
Sewing on the Cuffs

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.529
This video will show you how to sew
the shirt cuff to the sleeve

00:00:23.852 --> 00:00:27.372
Dealing with sleeve fullness with pleats or gathers

00:00:28.015 --> 00:00:30.895
To top-stitch or not to top-stitch the cuff

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.320
and how to hand finish the cuff

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:45.240
The sleeve has to be gathered or pleated
to get rid of some of the fullness in the width

00:00:45.467 --> 00:00:48.587
I'm going for pleats but it is a matter of choice

00:00:58.351 --> 00:01:00.671
I have marked pleats on the pattern

00:01:00.671 --> 00:01:03.600
I'm folding the pleats towards the sleeve opening

00:01:07.604 --> 00:01:12.324
I have the pleats marked with notches
so it is just a question of folding

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.180
making a pleat and securing with a pin, like so

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.840
You can baste across if you wish

00:01:44.876 --> 00:01:48.876
The cuff and sleeve seams
should be about the same length now

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.800
leaving the 1" extension

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.440
This our sleeve seam
so this is the back side of the sleeve

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.500
This is the top and front of the sleeve

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.300
The binding this side is folded under

00:02:14.905 --> 00:02:19.865
The binding on this side is left pointing out
the extension side of the cuff

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:21.840
These are the pleats

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.520
So right sides together, pin the cuff to the sleeve

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.440
Match edge to edge carefully and pin

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.920
Pin the other end, about 1" from the end of the cuff

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.000
And pin carefully in between

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:11.640
Sewing Over Pins!
Please visit my site for New Guidelines

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.640
Check underneath as you pin
to make sure that the sleeve seam is open

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:24.300
and flat and that the pleats are ok

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:46.560
Machine, making sure that this side of the cuff is free

00:03:54.607 --> 00:03:59.007
The cuff is stitched on
and we now need to tuck the seam allowance in

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.660
Pay particular attention to the cuff ends

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.960
This is a very visible part of your shirt
so do your best to get it right

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.620
At the extension end the seam allowance
needs to be hidden away, folded along the stitching line

00:04:31.221 --> 00:04:35.941
Have your iron at the ready and press
when it is all looking neat and tidy

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.260
Press the seam up, tucking in ends neatly

00:04:43.742 --> 00:04:46.862
Again the sleeve board is so useful for this job

00:04:47.234 --> 00:04:49.954
Use your iron to accomplish a nice finish

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:47.160
This cuff is looking pretty good

00:05:47.622 --> 00:05:50.982
We now have to decide how to finish this seam neatly

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:58.300
As I said before, on this polyester chiffon
I used top-stitching as a finish

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.831
Top-stitching is very useful for making edges
look professional and crisp

00:06:08.529 --> 00:06:12.449
but on this silk version, especially as it is a bold pattern

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:15.200
I like the non topstitched effect

00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:20.060
So good hand finishing is important here

00:06:23.452 --> 00:06:28.012
Watch my video on attaching the collar
for a guide to slip-stitching

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.300
You can’t beat hand finishing

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.820
It doesn’t take long and makes a big difference

00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:50.600
We will finish this lovely classic silk shirt
in the next video

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.840
All that is left to do is to finish the hem

00:06:54.220 --> 00:06:57.960
stitch buttonholes, sew on buttons and it's done

00:07:00.275 --> 00:07:02.995
Buttons, Buttonholes and Sewing the Hem

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.300
are the topics of the next and final video in this series
