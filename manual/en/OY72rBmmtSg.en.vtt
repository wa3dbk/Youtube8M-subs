00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:09.895
President Obama:
Selamat malam.

00:00:09.895 --> 00:00:12.828
Terima kasih,
President Yudhoyono.

00:00:12.828 --> 00:00:16.961
Thank you so much for
welcoming us here today.

00:00:16.961 --> 00:00:19.328
Thank you for your
tremendous leadership,

00:00:19.328 --> 00:00:23.394
and that of Indonesia, as
you host both ASEAN and the

00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:25.027
East Asia Summit.

00:00:25.027 --> 00:00:27.294
And this speaks to your
commitment to the region,

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:33.227
as well as Indonesia's role
as an important leader.

00:00:33.227 --> 00:00:36.494
Let me say the obvious: It is
wonderful to be back in Bali.

00:00:36.494 --> 00:00:40.561
This is the first time
I've been here in 18 years.

00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:44.394
I have to say, 18 years ago,
this entire development did

00:00:44.394 --> 00:00:46.027
not exist.

00:00:46.027 --> 00:00:50.861
So it's a sign of the
remarkable development

00:00:50.861 --> 00:00:52.261
that has taken place here.

00:00:52.261 --> 00:00:54.294
It is always a
pleasure to be here,

00:00:54.294 --> 00:00:59.294
and to have the opportunity to
exchange views with my friend,

00:00:59.294 --> 00:01:01.094
President Yudhoyono.

00:01:01.094 --> 00:01:03.027
I'm pleased to be
here as the first U.S.

00:01:03.027 --> 00:01:06.161
President to attend
the East Asia Summit.

00:01:06.161 --> 00:01:09.227
This is another example of how
the United States is refocusing

00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:12.094
on the Asia Pacific, and
engaging more deeply in regional

00:01:12.094 --> 00:01:17.861
organizations, so we can meet
our common challenges together.

00:01:17.861 --> 00:01:22.628
Our meeting just now focused on
the growing relationship between

00:01:22.628 --> 00:01:24.094
our two nations.

00:01:24.094 --> 00:01:28.127
When I was here last year, we
agreed to forge a comprehensive

00:01:28.127 --> 00:01:30.461
partnership across a
whole range of areas,

00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:33.961
and today we reviewed the
progress that we're making.

00:01:33.961 --> 00:01:38.161
On the economic front, we
welcome the completion of a deal

00:01:38.161 --> 00:01:44.294
that I witnessed this morning --
the decision of Indonesia's Lion

00:01:44.294 --> 00:01:48.661
Air to purchase up to
230 Boeing aircraft,

00:01:48.661 --> 00:01:52.861
worth at least $20 billion
and possibly much, much more.

00:01:52.861 --> 00:01:55.528
This is one of the largest
commercial transactions ever

00:01:55.528 --> 00:01:58.561
between our two countries, and
it's a sign of just how much

00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:01.094
potential our relationship has.

00:02:01.094 --> 00:02:04.661
Today, we're also signing, as
President Yudhoyono mentioned,

00:02:04.661 --> 00:02:06.761
a Millennium Challenge
Corporation Compact that

00:02:06.761 --> 00:02:10.261
will provide $600 million
to support environmentally

00:02:10.261 --> 00:02:13.528
sustainable economic
development, public health,

00:02:13.528 --> 00:02:17.194
and improved public
services in Indonesia.

00:02:17.194 --> 00:02:20.261
With regard to security, we
agreed to a number of steps that

00:02:20.261 --> 00:02:23.594
will expand our cooperation,
including training and support

00:02:23.594 --> 00:02:27.394
to help the Indonesian
military as it modernizes.

00:02:27.394 --> 00:02:30.361
And I'd note that this kind of
defense cooperation not only

00:02:30.361 --> 00:02:33.895
helps build Indonesia's capacity
to ensure its own security,

00:02:33.895 --> 00:02:37.728
it helps Indonesia play an
active role in promoting

00:02:37.728 --> 00:02:39.961
security in the region.

00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:44.161
Finally, I conveyed to President
Yudhoyono our appreciation of

00:02:44.161 --> 00:02:47.928
Indonesia's regional leadership,
which has helped us to achieve

00:02:47.928 --> 00:02:50.795
real progress on issues
like disaster relief,

00:02:50.795 --> 00:02:53.261
maritime security,
and nonproliferation.

00:02:53.261 --> 00:02:56.061
And I thanked him for
Indonesia's efforts to promote

00:02:56.061 --> 00:03:01.127
democracy and human rights,
and advance security and peace.

00:03:01.127 --> 00:03:03.828
So, as I said, I wanted to
thank President Yudhoyono

00:03:03.828 --> 00:03:07.494
for welcoming me back
to Indonesia again.

00:03:07.494 --> 00:03:11.394
I know we're all very grateful
for his leadership and for the

00:03:11.394 --> 00:03:15.127
hospitality of the Indonesian
people and the people of Bali,

00:03:15.127 --> 00:03:18.061
as they host these
two important summits.

00:03:18.061 --> 00:03:20.127
And just as we deepen the
partnership between our two

00:03:20.127 --> 00:03:24.994
nations, I am looking forward to
the progress that we can make as

00:03:24.994 --> 00:03:28.294
a region towards greater
security and prosperity

00:03:28.294 --> 00:03:29.294
for all of us.

00:03:29.294 --> 00:03:32.394
So, President Yudhoyono,
thank you very much.

00:03:32.394 --> 00:03:33.394
President Yudhoyono:
Terima kasih. Thank you.

00:03:33.394 --> 00:03:34.194
President Obama:
Terima kasih.

00:03:34.194 --> 00:03:35.961
(applause)
