00:00:00.227 --> 00:00:03.862
"Title in the Middle", ladies and
gentlemen, everybody stand up!

00:00:03.862 --> 00:00:05.562
How does "Title in the Middle" work?

00:00:05.562 --> 00:00:09.728
Our musician-maestro-improv artist
Daniel Tauszig will play something

00:00:09.728 --> 00:00:12.180
that will inspire the
players to do a scene.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.000
At any point, I'll ring the
bell and the scene freezes.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.491
Then I'll pick one of the
sentences you wrote for us out there

00:00:20.491 --> 00:00:25.126
and that will be the title of
the scene. They'll have to match

00:00:25.126 --> 00:00:30.030
the scene they were doing
with the title you gave them.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.407
There will be a number of short scenes,
all of them start with Daniel Tauszig, go!

00:00:41.826 --> 00:00:46.167
One... Two... Three...

00:00:46.167 --> 00:00:48.736
Oh, no...

00:01:02.881 --> 00:01:06.615
- Nothing is better than friends, right?
- Sure, sure...

00:01:06.615 --> 00:01:11.352
And the scene title is:
'I like to look like an egg'.

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:18.296
Three potential zombies!

00:01:18.797 --> 00:01:21.731
Who can wake up at any time!

00:01:23.336 --> 00:01:25.895
My God, they're waking up!

00:01:35.364 --> 00:01:37.034
Just an impression.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.862
They don't make zombies
like they used to!

00:01:47.735 --> 00:01:49.856
Well...

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.281
I like to look like an egg sometimes,
but not today, zombie chickens!

00:02:07.211 --> 00:02:10.813
I thought I got the shotgun,
but I got the bazooka!

00:02:20.152 --> 00:02:25.156
Daniel Tauszig,
the next theme, please!

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:31.866
Rain in the region...

00:02:32.695 --> 00:02:39.667
Of the coast, stops the cold
front from getting to us, and so

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.446
we have the map here...
This is the info on Hungary!

00:02:46.543 --> 00:02:49.703
Back to you, Antônio, Rosana.

00:02:49.703 --> 00:02:51.970
- Thanks for the weather.
- Thanks for the weather.

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:56.909
Soccer! It looks like the grass will
officially have to be painted pink.

00:02:56.924 --> 00:02:59.021
That's right!

00:03:02.126 --> 00:03:08.072
And the scene title is:
'Dang, you're crazy'!

00:03:13.598 --> 00:03:16.809
The green field just
wasn't working anymore.

00:03:17.345 --> 00:03:25.315
The green was disturbing the players,
who got confused with the shorts!

00:03:26.981 --> 00:03:36.249
- He's going off script... - Russia!
Russia cried uncle and will leave planet Earth!

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:40.556
- This is an exclusive information!
- He's making the news up...

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:42.882
Dollar!

00:03:43.321 --> 00:03:45.039
I have!

00:03:46.805 --> 00:03:52.177
Singer Roberto Carlos asks for
maternity leave to have his first child!

00:03:52.768 --> 00:03:57.088
He's three months pregnant
and wants to have twins!

00:04:04.297 --> 00:04:08.863
Economy!
Inflation is so high that...

00:04:09.263 --> 00:04:12.247
You're crazy!

00:04:25.428 --> 00:04:29.288
Okay, Daniel Tauszig, please...

00:04:40.466 --> 00:04:44.641
- Did he sleep? - I guess we'll
be able to sleep for an hour...

00:04:44.726 --> 00:04:47.079
Let's make it worth...

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:03.011
I think it was...

00:05:09.577 --> 00:05:11.738
Let me do it, Marina, let me do it!

00:05:30.385 --> 00:05:33.289
And the scene title is...

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:37.324
'The armadillo is a cool guy'

00:05:38.424 --> 00:05:40.507
Who rang the bell?

00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:43.944
Get the door,
I'll see what I can do.

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:03.312
Nobody there!

00:06:03.313 --> 00:06:05.239
Damn it!

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:07.733
- He's crying...
- Yeah...

00:06:08.169 --> 00:06:11.189
Look, the corn!
Look, Captain Corn!

00:06:11.389 --> 00:06:13.135
Doesn't work...

00:06:13.135 --> 00:06:17.128
Look... Look at the elephant!

00:06:22.944 --> 00:06:28.527
Look at... The...
Peppa Pig!

00:06:39.362 --> 00:06:42.160
- Quick, get...
- There's nothing else!

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.117
There, the armadillo!

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:49.645
Check out the armadillo!
That guy's cool, you dig?

00:06:49.645 --> 00:06:52.711
Now daddy will sing a rap for you!

00:06:57.834 --> 00:07:01.184
I'll go downstairs to get milk!

00:07:05.176 --> 00:07:08.132
- Sing, daddy!
- I can't hear you, honey!

00:07:09.479 --> 00:07:14.161
My pretty child, time to go to bed

00:07:14.161 --> 00:07:18.981
So your parents
can do something bad

00:07:29.794 --> 00:07:33.867
Anderson, I'd like for you to
talk about the value of friendship.

00:07:33.867 --> 00:07:39.634
Friendship only has value if
there's a chance of revenge.

00:07:40.035 --> 00:07:43.335
