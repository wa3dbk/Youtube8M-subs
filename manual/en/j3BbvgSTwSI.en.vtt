00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.160
Basically, when you're choosing a board for
a beginner, you definitely don't want to get

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.210
a short board.

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:17.590
Basically a beginner needs to have enough
paddle and enough flotation and the board

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:25.330
being stable enough so that they can get up
on it on a slow, mushy wave and get up on

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:29.940
it so it's not real tippy and it's real easy
to stand up.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:35.000
Now, you may want to get a short board because
you look really cool on the beach, but listen,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.190
your learning curve is going to be really
long.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.239
If you get a long board, a wide long board,
thick, it's going to be stable, you're going

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:51.850
to be able to paddle it very easily and get
up on it very, very easy.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.580
You're gonna want to get at least an 8 foot,
22 inches, 3 inches thick long board.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:05.500
That's gonna really float you and give you
enough paddle and having the board being stable

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:12.170
enough so that you're not fighting the tippingness
of the board.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.860
When I talk about tippingness, if you were
to get on a too thin of a board or a short

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.310
board, it's just going to feel like it's going
to come out from underneath you.

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.959
You're going to have a really hard time trying
to paddle that board and get paddling it into

00:01:27.959 --> 00:01:33.070
the wave and getting that board going the
speed you need to get into the wave.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.159
And then once you're in the wave, that long
board, that wider, thicker, long board is

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.109
going to make it so much easier for you to
get up and start planning on the wave right

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:46.109
away.

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:49.299
If you were on a short board it's going to
feel real tippy, it's going to be hard to

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:56.740
get into the waves so do yourself a favor,
go and get a long board with a lot of volume,

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.020
and have it be real sturdy for yourself, and
have fun.
