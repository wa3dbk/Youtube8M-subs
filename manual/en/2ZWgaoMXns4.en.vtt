00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.049
I still have that feeling in my stomach
when they asked me if my daughter was

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:10.490
Elena Subleski and she's critical.
She had a ruptured brain aneurysm and

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:14.350
we're airlifting her to UI Health.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.100
Before my aneurysm erupted,  I was working out

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.230
so I want the flying machine and all the
sudden something came over me kinda like

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:33.020
a flash of pink and white and all of the sudden I couldn't lift my arm, my left arm or my hand

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.400
so I was just panicking for a while and
finally one of the managers came over

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.820
and all I could say was help me and then I
collapse

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:48.120
and they asked if we could get there immediately and I said I'm five and half hours away and they said you don't

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.980
have that much time she's critical and
she's not going to make it. I just said

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:00.129
dear God let us get there safe and let
her pass. I, my biggest fear was she

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.239
was gonna pass away and be by herself. UI Health kept in constant contact with us.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.140
They would call us every 15 20
minutes to give us a report and

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:19.909
how Alana was doing and there was a resident on duty that day he just he was so sweet

00:01:19.909 --> 00:01:24.330
I said can you do me a favor, and he said
yes. I said would you give her a hug and

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.240
kiss me and tell her that I love her. I
didn't think I was gonna see her alive.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.990
He said "I will do that" and so we got to the hospital, and I, we didn't get see her

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.410
before she went into surgery they
said they didn't have time

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.020
so she was in surgery and

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.410
the resident came out he said I gave
her your message and

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.820
I would visit her every day at the hospital

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:57.520
talk to her and tell her your a fighter, and your gonna make it and she's here today and

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.240
I said it's due to the care that she got and the doctor

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.600
first time we met doctor Hanjani was after the surgery

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.390
my husband and I were called to a
waiting room when she said well

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:16.500
surgery is complete and it was tough but
she made it. And I said I'm not gonna let

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.810
her give up this fight and she said I
didn't I won't be there and she so

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:26.880
supportive. She explained everything to
us, and again and when we did leave

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.200
I said I'd I hope it's ok but I said I have to give you a hug because I said you saved her life

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.640
UI Health has been amazing and so grateful that I

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.569
got the surgery there because I don't
think I would have survived without it

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:49.049
because not only did I have one brain
aneurysm rupture but I had an additional

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.820
four more that we found too. The physical
state after my coma, after coming out of

00:02:54.820 --> 00:03:03.400
it was my left arm was still paralyzed
and left leg was still paralyzed

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.300
I go to the YMCA and with my dad or my mom

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:14.530
and I walk the gym and I also have
a physical therapist and personal trainer

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:23.170
that I work with. Just to go back to normalcy again. For other anurism survivors

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.960
just don't give up. It will get better, is my motto. It's gonna get better.
