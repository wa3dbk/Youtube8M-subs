00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:02.890
Today's recipe is Dukan Meatza

00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.980
a low carb pizza, with a crust made out of minced meat.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:11.440
Heat your oven to 200 C / 400 F and let's start with the crust.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.799
You'll need: 400 grams / 1 lb of minced lean beef,

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.199
minced chicken meat, turkey meat...

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:18.800
I'm using half and half

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.240
chicken and turkey.  Have you ever prepare homemade meatballs or hamburguers?

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.949
This recipe is even easier, just wait and see.

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:27.819
We need to 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:33.150
add flavour to this meat. Let's start chopping 1 garlic clove, 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:34.930
add it to the minced meat,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.010
We need about 2 tablespoon of chopped fresh parsley

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.050
(if you don't have fresh parsley, use dry parsley instead)

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.570
add it to the minced meat. We also need 1 small egg, 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.540
lightly beaten,

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.530
If you're watching your cholesterol levels, 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.390
add just the egg white, ok?

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.420
Add 2 heaped tablespoons of oat bran,

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.880
1 heaped tablespoon wheat bran and 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.890
your favourite spices.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.880
I am using my favourite spices ever, a mix called Iberian Touch

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:10.890
(Toque IbÃ©rico)

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.720
that smells of real Iberian Ham, delicious.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.240
Combine everything together, using your hands (your very, very

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.740
CLEAN hands) One tip: do not overmix it.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.760
It's easier to shape it into a pizza "crust"

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:27.260
if you just lightly mix it together.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.960
Here's my oven tray, I am going to place the meat over it an shape it.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.460
I am using a silicone sheet, it's very convenient. If you don't have one,

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:38.050
use parchment paper, a pizza mold or a pizza stone (if you are lucky enough

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.250
to have one)

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.260
As you can see, all you need is to shape the meat

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.010
into the shape of a pizza crust, using your hands

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:51.970
until you get a circular "crust" of about 28 cm / 11 inch diameter.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.680
You can eat this Meatza all by yourself

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.230
or, better yet, share it and serve with a salad on the side.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.910
I am know for being a perfectionist, so I am using the back of a spoon

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.790
to keep shaping my Meatza crust, because I want it 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.419
not very thick, not very thin and with a perfect shape,

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:14.779
just like if it was made out of dough, after all

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:17.419
a diet meal can be as pretty as a "regular" one.

00:02:17.419 --> 00:02:21.489
Can you see how I am using my hand and the back of the spoon to 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.449
press the center down and shape the edges a little thicker?

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:27.329
The result will be worth the effort, I promise.

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.609
Here's my Meatza crust. It looks like a huge hamburger, doesn't it?

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:33.429
It is ready to be covered with tomato and cheese,

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:37.039
or whichever ingredients you like.

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:38.939
I'm going to prepare a very easy tomato sauce

00:02:38.939 --> 00:02:43.059
with tinned diced tomatoes.

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:45.639
All you need is one medium size bowl,

00:02:45.639 --> 00:02:46.999
a strainer,

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:50.879
and 400 grams/ 14 oz tinned diced tomatoes.

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:52.889
Pour the tomatoes

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:57.179
into the strainer (mine is a fine mesh one) to drain the liquid, 

00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:58.029
we want to

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:02.089
drain as much runny liquid as posible, so keep stirring with a spoon

00:03:02.089 --> 00:03:06.259
or with your hands until all the liquid is gone.

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:11.979
Add a pinch of sea salt, pepper to taste and some spices.

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:14.799
Look closer, here I have the strained meat of the tomatoes, 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:19.079
All this liquid would have ruin your Meatza. But don't throw it away:

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:22.159
you can use it for another recipe, ok?

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:23.219
Raw tomatoes

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.789
have a slightly acidic taste.

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:27.189
I like my sauce just like this, 

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:31.619
but you can add a little bit of sweetener if you prefer so.

00:03:31.619 --> 00:03:35.839
Cover the Meatza crust with the tomato sauce, I am using the back of 

00:03:35.839 --> 00:03:36.599
my spoon

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:37.930
to spread it over the crust.

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:39.669
Of course you can use

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:44.309
a canned tomato sauce or pizza sauce, but read the ingredients to be sure

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:46.169
it has no SUGAR in it.

00:03:46.169 --> 00:03:51.279
Do you know what? I am going to use my hands. It's easier and much more fun

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:55.740
to cook using your hands. As long as they are very clean,

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:56.929
no problemo.

00:03:56.929 --> 00:04:00.729
What I have here is 300 grams / 10 oz of fat free yogurt cheese.

00:04:00.729 --> 00:04:06.069
This one is homemade too: mix 500 grams / 16 oz of fat free yogur with 1 teaspoon of salt,

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.179
pour it into a clean cotton cloth or thick cheese cloth and strain it, 

00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:13.309
keeping it in the fridge for 3 to 4 days. 

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:18.029
After that you'll have this wonderfull fat free yogur cheese.

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:21.049
If you can find fat free mozzarella, go on, use it. 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.139
Here in Spain there's no such a thing, 

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.379
that's why I learnt to 

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:28.580
make my own from scratch, and it's pretty tasty.

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.800
If you want to learn how to make it,

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:35.159
you'll find the recipe on both my spanish blog and my 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:36.029
english blog

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:43.029
DukanRecipesbyMariaMartinez.blogspot.com Put the Meatza in the oven for 20-25 minutes.

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.120
The meat should be cooked through and lightly set. Your Meatza will even have 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.760
a crunchy edge! Add some fresh basil, oregano or chopped chives.

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:56.449
And you can cut it

00:04:56.449 --> 00:04:59.229
into slices, just like a regular pizza. 

00:04:59.229 --> 00:05:00.820
