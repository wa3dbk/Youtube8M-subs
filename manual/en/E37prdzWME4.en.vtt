00:00:00.425 --> 00:00:04.644
(Anthony) These graphics are worse than my Atari 2600.

00:00:04.644 --> 00:00:05.910
(Ian) SHUT UP!

00:00:07.038 --> 00:00:09.207
Are you bored with your normal life

00:00:09.207 --> 00:00:11.797
and want to go on a fabulous vacation?

00:00:11.797 --> 00:00:14.372
Well, yeah, but I don't have any money

00:00:14.372 --> 00:00:17.113
and I really gotta finish these nuts.

00:00:17.113 --> 00:00:19.137
Come with me and I'll take you on a trip

00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:21.843
to the exciting world of Minecraft!

00:00:21.843 --> 00:00:23.389
Wait, no! I don't wanna--

00:00:26.127 --> 00:00:27.491
Where's the hotel?

00:00:27.491 --> 00:00:29.432
It's in your imagination!

00:00:29.432 --> 00:00:32.646
You just have to mine resources and build it yourself.

00:00:33.066 --> 00:00:34.565
That sounds like a lot of work.

00:00:34.565 --> 00:00:36.429
How is this even a vacation?

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:39.677
Better get to that mining!

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:40.974
What?!

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:43.757
Uh, so I made my house thing.

00:00:44.037 --> 00:00:45.741
Let's take a look inside!

00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:46.854
Okay.

00:00:46.854 --> 00:00:49.861
So this is the place. It's kinda bare though.

00:00:49.861 --> 00:00:51.248
Could I get a bed or something?

00:00:51.248 --> 00:00:54.018
Sure! You just need to chop down a tree and kill three sheep,

00:00:54.018 --> 00:00:56.817
then break the wood into planks and lay the sheep carcasses over it.

00:00:56.817 --> 00:00:58.421
It's super easy and fun!

00:00:58.421 --> 00:01:00.770
Okay, okay. All this stuff is really complicated.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.257
Do you have a book that has all these crafting instructions?

00:01:04.257 --> 00:01:05.330
Sure!

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.783
Oh, wow. That's a pretty big book.

00:01:07.783 --> 00:01:10.504
Indeed! But that's just a book on crafting with wood.

00:01:10.504 --> 00:01:12.170
- Here's everything.
- What?

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.476
(screaming)

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:20.273
Okay, how do I get around this stupid Minecraft place?

00:01:20.273 --> 00:01:22.439
Can I make a car or something?

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:24.965
Even better! Just make a mine cart.

00:01:26.145 --> 00:01:27.360
How do I make it go?

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.773
It's simple! Just lay down some railway.

00:01:31.153 --> 00:01:32.576
It's still not moving!

00:01:32.576 --> 00:01:35.316
Well, duh! You have to make a powered rail

00:01:35.316 --> 00:01:38.148
with redstone and gold, silly!

00:01:38.628 --> 00:01:40.628
F*ck it! I'll just walk!

00:01:42.517 --> 00:01:44.978
Uh...hi. What's your name?

00:01:45.408 --> 00:01:46.750
Hey! Hey!

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.178
Uh, why is this guy just running around,

00:01:49.178 --> 00:01:51.370
looking at all my stuff and not talking to me?

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.324
People can't talk to each other here!

00:01:53.324 --> 00:01:56.327
You'll have to type everything to them if you want to communicate.

00:01:57.547 --> 00:01:59.936
Wow. You would've thought with the millions upon millions

00:01:59.936 --> 00:02:01.388
of dollars this place would bring in

00:02:01.388 --> 00:02:04.247
they would actually allow you to communicate easily with people.

00:02:04.627 --> 00:02:06.837
(chuckles) Yeah.

00:02:07.257 --> 00:02:10.430
And don't ask what happens at night!

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.071
What happens at night?

00:02:12.071 --> 00:02:16.779
Uh...n-nothing. Just look at that beautiful sunset.

00:02:18.039 --> 00:02:19.602
Oh, yeah! That's the sunset.

00:02:19.682 --> 00:02:23.205
(growling)

00:02:23.205 --> 00:02:25.050
(screaming)

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.751
Uh...can I get a gun or something?!

00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:31.752
No guns in Minecraft, but you can use pretty much anything

00:02:31.752 --> 00:02:34.194
as a weapon, such as a bundle of string!

00:02:34.594 --> 00:02:38.848
Screw this! I'm just gonna dig a hole and wait until the sun rises.

00:02:38.958 --> 00:02:41.888
Just like every new miner on their first night.

00:02:41.888 --> 00:02:43.378
F*cking pussy!

00:02:43.758 --> 00:02:45.102
F*ck you!

00:02:45.797 --> 00:02:46.881
(groaning)

00:02:47.431 --> 00:02:49.394
And everyday, when the sun comes up,

00:02:49.394 --> 00:02:51.442
you get a cool fire show!

00:02:51.442 --> 00:02:53.184
- (flames crackle)
- What's that smell?

00:02:53.184 --> 00:02:56.472
The rotting flesh of burning zombies!

00:02:56.472 --> 00:03:00.080
It burns! (screaming)

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.502
Uh...isn't it vampires that burn in sunlight?

00:03:03.502 --> 00:03:05.117
Uh, what? Uh...

00:03:05.117 --> 00:03:08.500
(speaking distantly) Hey, is it vampires that burn in light or zombies?

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.249
(angrily) What?! Goddamn it!

00:03:11.249 --> 00:03:13.930
How did we [bleep]?! Someone's getting fired for that!

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.466
(overly chipper) Uh, anyway, time to get back to work

00:03:16.466 --> 00:03:18.515
if you want to survive another night!

00:03:18.515 --> 00:03:21.291
Oh, snikey! (groaning)

00:03:21.291 --> 00:03:22.774
Check out what I got now!

00:03:22.774 --> 00:03:24.146
I got my mansion.

00:03:24.146 --> 00:03:25.675
I got a shrine to the endermans

00:03:25.675 --> 00:03:28.346
so those bitches don't steal my blocks anymore.

00:03:28.346 --> 00:03:29.969
Over there is my second house,

00:03:29.969 --> 00:03:34.601
and right next to it is this 1/16th scale replica of that second house.

00:03:34.601 --> 00:03:37.212
And the penis fountain that shoots water,

00:03:37.212 --> 00:03:39.657
and the penis fountain that shoots lava!

00:03:39.657 --> 00:03:42.612
- And that's about it.
- Nice work, buddy!

00:03:42.612 --> 00:03:44.163
Thanks. You know what?

00:03:44.163 --> 00:03:46.230
I think I'm really starting to like it here.

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:47.740
(lighting of fuse)

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.047
- FUUUUUUU--!
- (massive explosion)

00:03:52.777 --> 00:03:53.712
What?!

00:03:53.742 --> 00:03:55.492
I lost everything in my inventory!

00:03:55.492 --> 00:03:57.965
I spent forever gathering that stuff!

00:03:58.215 --> 00:03:59.384
(groans)

00:03:59.384 --> 00:04:01.588
Whatever, at least I still have my mansion.

00:04:02.128 --> 00:04:04.999
Uh, well, we hope the rest of you will enjoy

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:07.791
your stay in the amazing land of Minecraft!

00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:08.956
FML.

00:04:08.956 --> 00:04:10.935
(massive explosion)

00:04:12.285 --> 00:04:14.538
(Ian) Ugh, going in Minecraft sucks!

00:04:14.538 --> 00:04:16.197
But you know what doesn't suck?

00:04:16.197 --> 00:04:18.828
The Honest Trailer for Minecraft.

00:04:18.828 --> 00:04:21.425
So if you wanna see that, click the video on the right.

00:04:21.425 --> 00:04:25.448
(narrator) Enter a magical world where the only limits are your imagination!

00:04:25.588 --> 00:04:27.176
And patience.

00:04:29.435 --> 00:04:31.790
(Ian) And if you wanna see bloopers from this video,

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.644
and this...

00:04:33.644 --> 00:04:36.608
I'm just so physically fit that I can't actually sweat myself.

00:04:36.608 --> 00:04:38.319
They have to put fake sweat on me.

00:04:38.319 --> 00:04:39.277
(directer) Right here!

00:04:39.277 --> 00:04:40.369

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:41.962

Stupid!
