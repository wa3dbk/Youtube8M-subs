-I'm not racist; I have, like, two black friends.

00:00:03.541 --> 00:00:05.177
-Shut up!

00:00:05.177 --> 00:00:07.761
-I'm gonna be late for my flight if I don't go right now.

00:00:07.761 --> 00:00:09.958
-All right, have fun in France, man.

00:00:09.958 --> 00:00:10.708
-Oh, by the way,

00:00:10.708 --> 00:00:12.608
my French cousin's staying over while I'm gone.

00:00:12.608 --> 00:00:13.458
-What?

00:00:13.458 --> 00:00:15.641
-Yeah, his name's Pierre. Bye!

00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:22.944
-[gruff voice]: 'Sup, brother?

00:00:22.944 --> 00:00:24.182
-Pierre?

00:00:24.182 --> 00:00:26.432
-The one and only, brother.

00:00:26.432 --> 00:00:28.617
-You don't look very French.

00:00:28.617 --> 00:00:31.057
-You gettin' racist on me, brother?

00:00:31.057 --> 00:00:33.823
-No, no, I guess I've just never seen

00:00:33.823 --> 00:00:35.689
a real French person before.

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:37.823
-Ha-ha, well, we're a fun bunch.

00:00:37.823 --> 00:00:39.448
Up high!

00:00:39.448 --> 00:00:41.307
Down low.

00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:46.780
Uh... uh... we should go inside like right now, brother.

00:00:48.888 --> 00:00:50.755
-We got you now.

00:00:53.108 --> 00:00:55.880
-(Pierre) Macho, macho man

00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:00.005
I want to be... [Nyan Cat ringtone plays]

00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:00.813
-Hello?

00:01:00.813 --> 00:01:01.755
-Hey man, how's Pierre?

00:01:01.755 --> 00:01:04.730
-Uh, he looks and talks like Hulk Hogan.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.188
-Well, duh, they all do.

00:01:06.188 --> 00:01:08.646
Have you never seen a real French person before?

00:01:08.646 --> 00:01:11.105
-Well, I guess not,

00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:13.438
but, okay, not that there's anything wrong with it,

00:01:13.438 --> 00:01:15.896
but is Pierre gay?

00:01:15.896 --> 00:01:18.620
-Anthony, not all French men are gay.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.921
That sounds a little bit racist.

00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:22.593
-Okay, well, earlier today,

00:01:22.593 --> 00:01:26.168
he was doing some really questionable things.

00:01:26.168 --> 00:01:27.161
This is the living room,

00:01:27.161 --> 00:01:28.564
and I'll show you--

00:01:29.595 --> 00:01:31.555
Why are you holding my hand?

00:01:31.555 --> 00:01:33.320
-Why would I not?

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.510
-Not gay!

00:01:40.495 --> 00:01:41.355
-What?

00:01:41.355 --> 00:01:42.677
-Not gay!

00:01:43.846 --> 00:01:45.463
-What are you doing?

00:01:46.447 --> 00:01:48.182
-Looking at gay porn.

00:01:48.182 --> 00:01:51.191
-Not g-- okay, that might be a little gay.

00:01:51.191 --> 00:01:53.066
-Anthony, you can't be so racist.

00:01:53.066 --> 00:01:54.816
Just because his culture is different

00:01:54.816 --> 00:01:58.358
it doesn't mean you can spread lies about his sexual orientation.

00:01:58.358 --> 00:02:00.358
-He was looking at gay porn.

00:02:00.358 --> 00:02:03.031
-And who doesn't from time to time?

00:02:03.031 --> 00:02:04.316
-True.

00:02:04.316 --> 00:02:05.736
-Dude, I gotta go.

00:02:05.736 --> 00:02:08.082
I've been looking for French fries for the past five hours

00:02:08.082 --> 00:02:09.667
and I can't find them anywhere.

00:02:09.667 --> 00:02:12.747
-(Pierre) I want to be... [knock on door]

00:02:15.563 --> 00:02:17.391
-(Anthony) Hey Pierre, are these your friends?

00:02:17.391 --> 00:02:18.917
They look like Richard Simmons.

00:02:20.532 --> 00:02:23.473
-You idiot, that's the Italian mafia.

00:02:23.473 --> 00:02:24.848
-What the hell are they doing here?

00:02:24.848 --> 00:02:27.653
-I have a lot of gambling debt.

00:02:27.653 --> 00:02:31.515
I just can't say no to naked Twister.

00:02:31.515 --> 00:02:35.365
-Okay, it's time to eat s--t and die, sillies!

00:02:35.365 --> 00:02:36.247
-Yeah!

00:02:37.185 --> 00:02:40.114
You've messed with the wrong Italians, Pierre.

00:02:40.114 --> 00:02:42.394
-I'm so scared right now.

00:02:42.394 --> 00:02:43.489
Hold me.

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:44.406
-What? No.

00:02:44.406 --> 00:02:46.573
-There you are, you little silly,

00:02:46.573 --> 00:02:48.489
now it's time to die!

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.864
-Any last words, you cute little butt-heads?

00:02:51.864 --> 00:02:54.754
-Yeah, why are you guys acting like Richard Simmons?

00:02:54.754 --> 00:02:57.950
-Uh, oh no he did not just say that.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.004
-What the hell, man?

00:02:59.004 --> 00:03:00.813
All Italians are like that.

00:03:00.813 --> 00:03:02.213
-[stammers]: But, I thought they were like,

00:03:02.213 --> 00:03:04.528
"It's a spicy meat-a-ball-a."

00:03:04.528 --> 00:03:08.770
-Oh! I can't listen to this racist little prick anymore.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.355
-Enjoy being racist!

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:14.520
And gay!

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.645
-You're gay? Eww!

00:03:18.645 --> 00:03:20.395
-Well, that was a quick flight.

00:03:20.395 --> 00:03:23.328
Oh, I'd like you guys to meet my new friends from Japan.

00:03:23.328 --> 00:03:25.351
[rock and roll music plays]

00:03:25.351 --> 00:03:26.620
-Oh great, let me guess,

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.721
all Japanese people look and dress like Elvis, right?

00:03:30.721 --> 00:03:34.120
-Uh, no. We just got back from an Elvis convention.

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.701

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:39.890
