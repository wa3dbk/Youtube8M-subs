How to make a baby footprint plaque
&gt;&gt;How to make a footprint plaque

00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:08.360
This project can be done at any age even when
your baby is very small.

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.770
You may find it easier to do this when your
baby is lying down, with the plate tilted

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:16.560
almost verticle.
Otherwise you'll need someone to hold your

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.130
baby for you.
You will need

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.520
Extra-light, white, air-drdy clay
A rolling pin

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:30.400
A round bowl, at least 5 1/2 inches or 14
cms in diameter

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:36.470
A knife
A plate or other firm, portable surface

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:42.020
A drinking straw
A lenght of ribbon measuring between 27 1/2

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:49.890
and 40 inches or 70 and 100 cms long
Step 1

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.850
Remove the clay from its package and place
it on a clean, flat work surface.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:02.590
Using the rolling pin roll the clay out so
it's approximately 1/4 inch or 5mm thick

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.560
Step 2
Place the bowl upside down on the clay and

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.870
cut around it with a knife to make a perfect
circle.

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:20.100
Remove the excess and lift the bowl off. Put
the clay circle on a plate or other firm surface.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.249
Step 3
Gently push your baby's feet into the clay

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:29.600
one at a time.
Be sure to get an imprint of each toe and

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.250
make sure that the feet imprints are even
and level.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:39.760
If you don't get a clear imprint on the first
attempt, reroll the clay and start again.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.839
Step 4
Once you have a clear, imprint, put the clay

00:01:44.839 --> 00:01:50.210
back on the clean, flat work surface.
Make two holes in the top of the plaque with

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.749
a drinking straw.
Ensure the holes are leveled and centered

00:01:54.749 --> 00:02:00.000
and then leave the clay to dry.
Step 5

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.899
When the clay is dry, cut a piece of ribbon,
thread it through the holes to make a loop

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:11.029
and finish with a bow.
Your plaque is now ready to hang on the wall.

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:16.900
Once dry, you can also paint or decorate your
plaque in colors or patterns.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.270
Acrylic or poster paints will work well.
