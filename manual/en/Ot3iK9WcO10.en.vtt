00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:04.080
"You've never curled before?"

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:04.640
"No!"

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:13.580
One of my favorite writers is Ernest Hemingway. He has said, "When you stop doing things for fun, you might as well be dead."

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.540
I'm always the one who likes to mix things up, and I think that's one of the reasons I like Milwaukee so much

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.100
is that it gives me the ability to do that.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.980
Well the fall had to happen sometime!

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.600
"Are you okay?"

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:24.500
Yeah, I'm good!

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.340
Everyone calls me Lo, but then they'll be like, "Oh, Lo with the fro!"

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.640
That was like, my freshman go-to.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.400
And, now people think it's cute to mix up fro and Lo and make it Fro-Lo,

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.940
which is something that I want to die.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.120
I actually love having an internship in Milwaukee. I wake up every day like,

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.600
"Oh my gosh, I can't wait to go to my job." Or like, "I'm so excited."

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:59.880
We have the Marquette Explorers blog. It just talks about Milwaukee and then We Are Marquette.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:05.940
People who are prospective students looking at Marquette, can kind of see what's going on on campus.

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:13.800
Today, we'll be heading out to probably the East Side, blog about a few things, find some cool spots.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.720
I grew up in like Fort Wayne, Indiana which is 5 and a half hours away from Milwaukee.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.400
The culture of the town was very, like conservative. Everyone's born there, raised there, they stay there.

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.260
I'm definitely not one for any of that. So, I was like, "I need to get out as soon as I could."

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.960
"Like you just can't get any better than like this."

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.260
Day Milwaukee's very different because it's very like relaxing and very chill, like just go with the flow.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.780
Night Milwaukee has a much different vibe. I feel like it comes alive at night.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.200
I am getting ready to go to a concert at Turner Hall.

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.780
"We're turning on to the street right now."

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.240
"Oh my god, today I went curling and I wiped out."

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.400
Spending the summer here in Milwaukee, seeing how many concerts there were, doing Summerfest, all that stuff...

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.820
I was like, "Okay, like, this is a thing that I need to make regular happen."

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.860
I mean, I fell in love with the city.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.740
It's like one of those weird things where like, Milwaukee loves youâ€“and like, you will love Milwaukee back.
