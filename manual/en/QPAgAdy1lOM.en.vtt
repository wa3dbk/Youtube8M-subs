Hi, Guys, and Welcome to Studio Knit.

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:10.170
This weekend, I had the pleasure of attending
Stitches West, the Knitting and Crochet Expo

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:11.190
of the Year.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:19.410
It was located in sunny California in the
Bay Area’s Santa Clara Convention Center.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:28.730
I put on my boots and headed out to bring
you my top ten favorite finds at the Expo.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.680
Links to all my favorite finds are in the
description below.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:41.590
In Yarn Trends, I found that the Ombre Yarns
are really prevalent now.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:46.790
The gorgeous colors transitioning one to the
next knit up beautifully.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.480
Also, neon!

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:55.070
Neon yarns are really vibrant and bright and
are great for young people.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.780
Two, yarn bowls!

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:05.030
These gorgeous ceramic bowls hold your yarn
and there are actually slots so it can hold

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.030
your yarn while its on display.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:12.460
Three, glass knitting needles.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.210
These are flame-worked glass knitting needles.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.390
Absolutely a piece of art.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.540
Four, celebrity StevenBe.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.750
There is never a dull moment when Steven is
in the room.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.270
His bright energy carries through the room
as he share his passion for everything fiber

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.270
arts.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:47.110
Five, my favorite local yarn store, ImagiKnit
in San Francisco.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.630
I was so excited to see them there.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:56.540
It’s great that we can order yarn from virtually
anywhere around the world, but there’s nothing

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.970
like your local yarn store.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.080
The personal touch, and most importantly,
supporting their business.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.950
Six, crafting cruises.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.510
Who knew?

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:15.170
There are crafting cruises full of knitters
and crocheters going to exotic locations over

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.650
the world on a monthly basis.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.180
Gotta check that out.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:28.190
Seven, the upcoming Knit and Crochet Show,
put on by The Knitting Guild Association.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:31.290
This was a great opportunity for me to speak
with them one-on-one.

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:36.400
I wasn’t sure if was worth my time to travel
to New Hampshire this summer.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.480
But, after talking to the vivacious Sadie,
I absolutely am planning on going and I hope

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.470
to see a lot of you there!

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.060
Food Trucks are all the rage in California
and now we have a Yarn Truck!

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:56.310
This Yarnover Truck is based in Southern California
and they took the truck up north so that they

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.349
could visit us at the Expo.

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:00.150
They said it took quite awhile.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:07.450
It’s a really large truck equipped with
gorgeous yarns that are available to you wherever

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.500
they go.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.819
Nine, knitting books.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.200
There were so many amazing books that were
on display.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.170
I chose just one.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.640
This book is called Pop Knitting.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:28.690
The colorful, bold designs definitely caught
my eye and I hope it will revolutionize my

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.380
knitting.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.989
And lastly, number Ten is the Mother Bear
Project.

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.700
I was so excited to learn about this nonprofit.

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.959
I got my kit and am really excited to knit
up my World War II era pattern of a bear and

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:46.270
hand it back to them.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:53.330
They will give it to a wonderful child in
an emerging nation in Africa.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:56.870
I will be able to spread a little bit of extra
love to them.

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.610
Really exciting.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.050
Thank you for watching Studio Knit and I hope
you enjoyed some of my top ten favorite finds

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.340
just as much as I did.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.739
This is a new channel, so please subscribe.

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:16.570
I am overwhelmed and overjoyed at the number
of subscribers that I’ve received in such

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.070
a short amount of time.

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.580
I really hope to add you and get to know you.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.050
Bye!
