00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.150
I have to confess that I've somewhat wilfully
ignored much of what is on TV for the last

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:18.110
decade, that is to say, I own a TV, but much
of what I watch is thanks to DVDs or the snippets

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.590
I inevitably see now and then.

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.270
As such I've lost touch on a pivotal annual
classic that is the inevitable re-run of the

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.290
Peanuts shows and movies.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.090
I go in to this review with the assumption
that you have grown up with or know about

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.590
this cartoon world to some degree.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.210
Beeline Interactive arguably succeeded in
converting the Smurfs in to a profitable time

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.620
waster, even despite some controversies and
now they've tried their hand at applying the

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.650
same system of Farmville-style freemium gameplay
to the Peanuts franchise in Snoopy's Street

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:48.650
Fair.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:53.181
Charlie Brown is in the unenviable position
of needing to fund a trip to New York, as

00:00:53.181 --> 00:00:57.690
well as a bunch of uniforms, for his baseball
team and so with the aid of his friends and

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.079
faithful companion, he starts up a Street
Fair.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.439
Aside from the usual visual touches, players
can spend cash on stalls that earn money and

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.810
experience while also occasionally dispensing
additional bonuses like clothing for Snoopy

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.950
or collectable cards.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.689
It is these collectables, along with a handful
of unlockable mini-games, that help to motivate

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:20.960
players to grow their fair to larger and larger
proportions, but the pacing is (as it is with

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.299
many of these titles) woefully slow and tied
to the many timers that require hours of waiting

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:27.880
to progress.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.829
As a neat bonus players can visit the fairs
set up by friends and even help them out by

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:36.619
performing tasks such as jumping in to piles
of leaves with Snoopy to earn bonus points,

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.270
but the limited interaction makes this a primarily
single-player experience.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:44.640
This is a shame as the addition of so many
stalls and games could have led to clever

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.679
innovations such as customized playgrounds
that encourage people to enjoy each other's

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:53.920
fairs, but Snoopy's Street Fair never aspires
to be anything more than the standard freemium

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.329
game we've seen too many times already.

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.969
It should be said that it's well worth picking
up the game if only because it's free and

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:04.079
because nostalgic fans of the series have
a chance to unlock classic strips as well

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.910
as play around with Snoopy himself, but aside
from this novelty it's strictly a game for

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:17.719
fans of the genre.
