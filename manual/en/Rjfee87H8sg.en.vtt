00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:14.990
Hi, I am Eugenie. 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:16.930
Today I am making ttokbokki. 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.330
This spicy snack is the most popular street food in Korea,

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:39.110
I used to eat a lot of ttokbokki after school when I was small.

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.290
In a pan, add all the ingredients for sauce: 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:44.210
garlic, 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.130
red pepper flakes, 

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.630
light brown sugar, 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.630
soy sauce, 

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.950
corn syrup, 

00:00:51.950 --> 00:01:00.160
white cooking alcohol, today I used Korean Mihyang.

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:07.580
and Korean red pepper paste. 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:15.930
Then finally pour in anchovy stock.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.240
Over medium high heat, 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.450
heat the sauce for 3 minutes, stirring occasionally.

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:32.080
Add in rice cakes, 

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.370
onion, 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.700
and fish cakes. 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.120
Then simmer for about 10 minutes, 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:47.950
or until the sauce is reduced in half.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.540
Taste to see if you like. 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.170
and add ketchup or more red pepper paste, 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:57.080
sugar, 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:03.000
or corn syrup as desired.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.920
Finally add in green onion 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.910
and hard-boiled eggs 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:21.040
and simmer for 2 more minutes.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.960
Voila!

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:27.660
Chewy ricecake in spicy red pepper sauce. 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:31.490
Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and serve.

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.790
It’s sweet, savory, and spicy all at once.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.290
Bon appetit!

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:52.130
It’s spicy. Hahah..

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.040
Today it was ddokbokki.

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.330

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:02.280
