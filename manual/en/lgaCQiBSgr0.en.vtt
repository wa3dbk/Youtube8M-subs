Hi im Natalie Rydstrom and welcome to Euro

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.050
Joining us now to help us find the best available
value for the match is Mike Richardson, sports

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.050

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:32.110
Mike welcome
Playing on Wednesday is Arsenal vs Manchester

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.110
United.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.880
Two teams that disappointed last weekend.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.271
Firstly Arsenal lost to Liverpool a whopping
5-1, and Man U drew to bottom of the league

00:00:39.271 --> 00:00:41.560
Fulham 2 all at home!

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:45.370
Looking at the 3 way line, Arsenal are priced
at 2.2 with Paddy Power, Man U are priced

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.840
at 3.75 with Bet365 and the draw at 3.5 both
with Bet365.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.289
So good value in the winners market, if I
had to chose it would be Arsenal to win, but

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.510
I'm just so undecided because if their weekends
performance.

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:16.640
Mike what are your thoughts?

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:30.900
Looking at the goal totals, both teams have
scored over 40 goals this season, can you

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.950
see this match going over 2.5 at 1.8? (under
2)

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.560
Im siding with the gunners to win this, and
my best value bet is Arsenal -1 on the Asian

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.540
handicap line at a nice 3.1.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:02:10.289
Can you see the gunners winning by 1 goal
or more?

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:37.940
What bets are you going for in this match
If you had 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:43.910
to pick on?

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:50.110
That wrap things up for are match preview,
Mike thanks for joining us.
