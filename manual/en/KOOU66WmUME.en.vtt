00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.900
Set a character name.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.440
MIA

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.120
Yeah~

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.500
Game starts with MIA.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:17.900
oh~

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.220
Find an empty pouch.

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:30.360
You acquired a pouch (strength+4)

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.700
&lt;Park Quest1&gt;
&lt;Find hidden cosmetics to fill the pouch&gt;

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:42.060
Wow~

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.620
You acquired Louis Angel shadow. (strength+1)

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.400
Your physical strength is deteriorated, so you’ll be moved to a place close to the town.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.380
You acquired false lashes (Confidence+1)

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.080
You acquired a cushion foundation (Confidence+2)

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.100
You used up your strength, so take a rest.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.780
Uh…?

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.040
What…?

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:31.720
You acquired Louise Angel set. (Strength+12)

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:33.800
Hehehe~

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.520
hehe~

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.020
Your strength is grown, so it will be speeded up temporarily.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.360
The pouch is full.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.820
&lt;You completed Park Quest 1&gt;
You earned a mirror as a reward. (Confidence+5)

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:49.420
Yeah~

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:53.420
Mia~

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.300
I’ll be there in five minutes~

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:55.800
Huh~!

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.640
See you there~

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.460
Huh~!

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.260
&lt;Park Quest2&gt;
&lt;Make a daily makeup that looks natural as if you didn’t apply anything on&gt;

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.560
Don’t apply high coverage B.B cream on the whole face

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.320
But put it mostly around the eyes, both cheeks, nose and lip.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.520
Not to make the color makeup strong on the face,

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.100
I’ll first apply tint to make the face lively.

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.820
&lt;Be careful of tint night and day haha&gt;

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.780
I’ll mix it with B.B to make the color natural.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:23.800
Reapply it on lip.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.480
Because I’m trying to do naked face makeup that looks so natural,

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.160
I’ll put it on cheeks that it will look like your own color.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.640
’ll use powder on some parts

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.000
To make soft and moistureless skin.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.040
Your brows shouldn’t be like Monna Lisa even you’re so busy.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.120
Fill the empty gaps roughly.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.460
I’m using contouring color on eyes and nose to contour.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.220
Tight line the eyes with a gel liner

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:01.700
But don’t extend the line.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.620
The point of natural makeup is lashes.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.040
Apply it finely that it won’t get massed.

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.540
&lt;You completed Park Quest 2&gt;
You earned casual look as a reward (Confidence+10)

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.040
Yeah~

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.720
Wow~

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.880
Brother~

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.860
He’s here.

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:24.160
I’ll be going.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.760
Bye~

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.060
Oh my~ I’m marrying in about an hour~

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.560
You should catch the bouquet. Come~

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.060
Huh~~!

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.180
Street Quest 1
Finish Wedding Guest Makeup

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.920
Use cushion to apply foundation.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:10.900
Apply it once more on cheeks where you could see some flaws.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:15.560
Apply highlighter where you should volumize.

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.200
Use brown liner to make the eyes deep and profound.

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:28.920
Apply peach shadow on the lid.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.360
Use the same color on cheeks to make natural atmosphere.

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.560
Put gold pearl shadow on the tip of the finger to put it on the under and inner corner.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:53.360
Use brush pen liner to make clear eyes

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.460
And make it sharp on inner corner and wing.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.200
Put it on the empty parts by dotting As if connecting them.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:10.460
I’m going to put natural looking falsies.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.980
Curl the lashes and apply mascara.

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.340
Apply coral orange color lipstick on the whole lip.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.080
Apply light pink color lipstick on the inner corner.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.400
&lt;You completed Park Quest 1&gt;
You earned suit look as a reward. (Confidence+10)

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.900
Yeah~

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.080
Huh~~!

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:02.960
&lt;Street Quest 2 will be continued or maybe not haha&gt;
