00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.929
Hey guys Beau HD here and today I want to do
something a little bit new and talk

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:04.210
about

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.600
Apple Samsung and Motorola all in one video

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.690
starting with the all new Samsung level
headphones. Now if you guys follow me on Google+

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.320
you might remember my post about Samsung's new professional headphones

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.500
and boy do they look sexy. Now Samsung
tomorrow recently wrote an article on

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.029
their website detailing 7 features of
the Samsung

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.600
level headphones. But what's cool about these
headphones is that they have 50 mm bio-

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.760
cellulose drivers equipped with neodymium
magnets

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:33.000
major 30 percent stronger than regular
magnets and thus can send the sound from

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.760
the source with little delay

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.200
producing a much clearer and sharper
sound. What's also different about these

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.290
headphones is that they have active noise
cancellation technology

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.950
with a specially designed equalizer
circuit to maintain the original sound

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.300
of the audio you're playing

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.000
even when the active noise cancellation
is activated. Now since these headphones are

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.969
specialized for mobile devices

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.329
the level headphones not only accept
phone calls but they also feature a

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:57.550
noise reduction and echo cancellation

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:00.700
feature that isolates the ambient noise on
the person side

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.000
thus preventing the caller's voice to echo.
So it sounds like phone calls will be crystal

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.600
clear along with text messages since
these headphones have a text-to-speech

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.990
voice guidance service

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.049
that informs the user on the arrival of text
messages along with incoming alarms and

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:15.189
other notifications.

00:01:15.189 --> 00:01:18.700
On top of all that these headphones have
NFC to pair with your smartphone

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.009
and they have touch controls on the side to
control your music playback.

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.430
So I'm really pumped of these headphones they
seem to pack a ton of high quality

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:26.740
components and features.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.579
I just hope you know and it cost me a
fortune even though I feel like they

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:30.450
probably will.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.700
Now just within the last several days we got
some all new info about the Moto 360 --

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.430
the premium rounded SmartWatch by
Motorola that runs Google's all new

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.079
Android Wear software

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.430
designed specifically for smart watches.
Now the Moto 360 is easily the most premium

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.140
and high quality SmartWatch

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.509
announced to date, which is why it has become
so incredibly popular.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.100
But what we didn't know until now was how
much is was going to cost because the price

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.250
is very important especially for a
product that has yet to convince the

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.000
consumer

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.300
that it is necessary. I mean wearable tech
has not really exactly caught on.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.000
But the latest report says that the Moto 360 will cost right around two hundred and

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.360
forty nine dollars

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.500
which is less than the Samsung Galaxy Gear 2 and
about the same price as the Pebble

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:11.190
Steel.

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:15.190
Motorola has taken to Google+ to clear up
the rumors by saying the listed price is

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.700
for tax purposes only

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.520
and that the $249 price tag might not be the
actual price.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.400
But they didn't reveal how the pricing
would change which makes me believe that

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.730
this might actually be the official
price tag. Now the last story worth

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.340
talking about

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.100
has to do with Apple and Liquidmetal.
According to recent reports, Apple and the

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.000
company Liquidmetal have entered a deal
to extend an exclusive license to use

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.080
the exotic metal

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.800
in consumer products through February of 2015. Now
up until now Apple has only use Liquidmetal's

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.100
special alloy to make its SIM card ejector tools

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:48.800
But it's very possible that is about to change.
In 2012, the inventor and CEO of Liquidmetal

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:52.100
said that Apple was two to four years
away from mass producing this high

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.319
quality alloy

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.440
for large-scale projects that may
include it being used as a main material

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.019
for the iPhone and iPad.

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:02.900
But what's cool about this liquid metal is that it is
an amorphous non-crystalline material

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.980
that is 2.5 times stronger than titanium
alloy

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:09.970
and 1.5 times harder than stainless
steel found in many portable electronic

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:10.720
devices.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.000
So if Apple uses this technology in their
upcoming devices it looks like they're

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.780
well-designed quality devices will only
get better.

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.330
But out of those three tech news stories
I talked about, let me know which device

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.810
you are looking forward to the most.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.620
Is it the Samsung level headphones, the Moto 360 SmartWatch,

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.300
or is it an upcoming device made by
Apple that uses the all new liquid metal

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:29.959
alloy?
