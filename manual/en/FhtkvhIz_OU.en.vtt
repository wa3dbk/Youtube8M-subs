00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:11.230
My name is Dameon Adams.&gt;&gt;My name is Aretha
Adams.&gt;&gt;I met my wife at a adult game night.

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.660
Where you have a bunch of the old school 1980s
or before games.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.070
Uno, Connect&gt;&gt;Jinga&gt;&gt;Connect Four, Jinga.

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.360
She came to the table with some lame, corny
dude.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.790
And&gt;&gt; [LAUGH].

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:27.480
I just, I knew that he couldn't possibly be
her boyfriend.

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.160
I saw him and thought to myself, oh my gosh
he's so handsome, why am I here with this

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.250
guy? [LAUGH] We dated about six months and
it didn't take me along time at all to decide

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.150
that she was going to be my wife.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:48.840
[MUSIC] Aw [MUSIC] We tried for the first
eight months of our marriage.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.329
And then month eight we found out we were
pregnant.

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:55.850
I was 38 at the time.

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.930
I believe.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:57.930
37.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.350
37 so my mom's been waiting for a very long
time.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.880
To have grandchildren.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.059
We knew we couldn't just tell our parents,
hey I'm pregnant.

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:06.780
It has to totally be ours.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.960
So we wanted to make it as special for them
as well as for ourselves so we have some sort

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.430
of video for our children.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.280
We brainstormed, then tried to come up with
so many different scenarios that would be,

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.850
you know, exciting for them and unexpected.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.310
I wanted to center it around a delivery.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.159
Of a special package.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:32.930
[MUSIC] They knew that I was in a photography
class, so that was kind of the foundation

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:33.930
for th surprise.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.730
Let's do something with photography because
we wanted to get them in the same room to

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.730
watch something.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:43.780
We're just like, hey, Damian had to do this
final project and he's so proud of it.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.310
And he worked so hard, I want you guys to
see it.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.950
So it took us about ten minutes to actually
get them quiet.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.540
We sat down and had them watch it.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.189
Are you tired of waiting for your deliveries
all day?

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.700
Are you sick of the long lines?

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.420
Are there people who do that?

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.650
It could make you wanna scream.

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:18.359
[UNKNOWN] In the ground to our grand opening
in McKinney.

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:24.189
We've [INAUDIBLE] time any time.

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.609
We work seven days a week for you.

00:02:26.609 --> 00:02:29.689
[LAUGH] Our customer service reps are available
24 hours a day.

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:30.689
Friends always choose us to deliver their
precious cargo.

00:02:30.689 --> 00:02:31.689
[INAUDIBLE] [MUSIC] We went to UPS, FedEx.

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:32.689
[LAUGH] Even the post office.

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:33.689
They said they can deliver our package in
January.

00:02:33.689 --> 00:02:34.689
but with this company we got our package in
December.

00:02:34.689 --> 00:02:35.870
I think it sounded like a brother.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:36.980
That's great, honey.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.430
Why is it so important that these packages
be delivered in December?

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.709
Because we are.

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:45.999
That's right.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:47.139
Pregnant.

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.430
Oh, listen.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.719
Listen, listen.

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:56.290
[CROSSTALK] It was crazy.

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:04.870
My mom was so excited her ring flew off her
finger and hit me in the head.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.699
Ack, right.

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:09.120
Aah!

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:14.290
[LAUGH] [CROSSTALK] Once we said we were pregnant,
we knew it would be screaming.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:15.290
Yeah.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.040
And jubilation, so we paused the video and
said hey, you've gotta wait.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.040
You've gotta sit down.

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.040
The video's not over.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.010
[CROSSTALK] We're sitting down.

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.120
[MUSIC] But wait, family.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.749
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

00:03:26.749 --> 00:03:27.799
Wait, wait.

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:29.379
That's not it.

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.480
We're not just pregnant.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.209
We're pregnant with.

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:39.959
Twins!

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.569
It was like instant happiness.

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:53.469
His mom was just like, I knew it, I knew it,
I knew it.

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:58.280
We were blessed with two beautiful little
girls, Ava and Zoe.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:59.419
They're six months now.

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:00.479
They are so sweet.

00:04:00.479 --> 00:04:02.199
I call them my sweet girls.

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:05.439
It's a happy moment in your life.

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:09.040
And to capture it on video and make it yours,.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.150
Make it original, get your family involved.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:14.139
It's something that you'll always remember.

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:18.880
Not only is it something special for you and
your family, but it's special for the babies.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.410
Because they're gonna see it.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.400
They're gonna see everybody's happiness to
know that they were going to come into the

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:23.560
world.
