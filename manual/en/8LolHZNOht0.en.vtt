Hello I am Mark Blocker on behalf of Expert
Village. In this segment we're going to cover

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:13.120
removing the plug wires, Part two. Prior to
removing the wires on this particular plug

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:17.700
wire design and valve cover, the wires go
down through the valve cover. They seal with

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.920
a rubber grommet at the end and they seal
with another rubber grommet and contact on

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.900
the inside about four inches down the valve
cover. So if they've been on there for a long

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:33.579
time they have a tendency to dry rot and dry
out and they could become hard or brittle.

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.010
So first you want to twist the wire just a
little bit back and forth to break it free.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.500
Then just slowly try and keep it even pressure
and pull the wire straight up until it disconnects

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:51.670
and pull it out and lay it aside. Just repeat
that procedure for the next cylinder. Pull

00:00:51.670 --> 00:01:00.139
it out, lay it aside. And remember if there
is any question in your mind about the order

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:03.729
of how they go back or whether you will be
able to do it just take a ballpoint pen and

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:08.119
number them. And look on the intake and verify
your cylinder numbers. You could even take

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.200
a piece of paper and jot down little notes
if this is number one over here, to yourself

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:20.240
so you can go back and verify that you have
got the plug wires correct. After removing

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:24.271
the last one we have got this little clip
that is attached to the valve cover and it

00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:31.550
is attached with a standard ten millimeter
nut. So by removing this nut, this clip assembly

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.399
will come off and we can leave our whole plug
wiring harness for the spark plugs off to

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.020
one side and out of the way. To remove the
bracket and clip assembly you just simply

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:46.820
need to remove that bolt. This plastic clip
does clip onto this and can be removed by

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.770
clip but from my experience in older vehicles,
the plastic because of the heat of the engine

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.270
has a tendency to deteriorate and many times
it won't flex freely. It doesn't have that

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:07.290
elastic or flexibility that it did when it
was new and quite often you'll break the plastic

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.630
clips. So I always just unbolt them and then
you can just bolt them right back on and prevent

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:23.440
any damage. So by removing the one bolt and
then I put the bolt back in the hole again

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:31.140
so it doesn't get lost. That leaves the spark
plug wiring harness completely free and I

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.420
can just lay it off to the side and out of
the way. And that completes the accessibility

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.840
that gives me complete accessibility to remove
the valve cover. Everything else is out of

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.340
the way that would prevent me from removing
it and taking it off the car and replacing

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.980
the gasket. Please watch our next segment
on "Removing the Valve Cover".
