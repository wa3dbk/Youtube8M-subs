00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:04.559
How do we know the cameras aren’t faulty?

00:00:04.559 --> 00:00:09.520
Victoria has one of the world’s most thorough
speed camera testing programs.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.930
Regular testing and maintenance of speed cameras
ensures the system remains reliable,

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.240
accurate and fair.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.289
Camera systems are tested to ensure wiring
and electronics are in good condition.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.069
They also receive regular maintenance to ensure
they are in proper working order to detect

00:00:27.069 --> 00:00:28.069
the correct speed.

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:35.320
The testing, maintenance and operation of
all fixed and mobile cameras in Victoria is

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.840
carried out by highly trained staff.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.250
Every day, camera systems are checked.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.740
Every month, most cameras undergo general
maintenance and sensor checks.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:54.350
Every quarter, speed accuracy and reliability
checks are carried out.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:01:03.970
And every year, each camera is certified by
an independent tester.

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:09.240
Before any new camera site is commissioned
it undergoes stringent testing called

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.750
Site Acceptance Testing.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.250
This includes physical, administrative, image
and computer based assessments, to ensure

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.140
the camera can operate accurately and reliably
at each location.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.370
It’s also important to know that any infringements
recorded while a camera is undergoing maintenance

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.549
or servicing are automatically deleted.

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.710
If the camera is down for repairs you won’t
be fined.
