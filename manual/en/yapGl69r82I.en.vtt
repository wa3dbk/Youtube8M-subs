00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:06.670
this is a fun experiment with water. for doing
this you require half a liter plastic bottle,

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:13.670
a stiff straw, rubber glue, scissors and a
flexi tube. this is a 5cm long stiff plastic

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:21.710
straw. make a hole near the base of the bottle
and press fit the straw. now apply rubber

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.710
glue to the joint to seal completely. then
make a small hole in the lid of the bottle

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:38.450
and press fit a flexi tube into it. tightly
fit the tube in the lid. this is the lid and

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.670
the flexi tube. now shut the straw at the
base and fill the bottle completely with water

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:00.940
and then screw on the lid with the flexi tube.
now place the other end of the flexi tube

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:11.690
in a jar filled with water and remove your
finger from the straw. now lift the jar and

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.690
by syphon the water will enter the bottle.
and as the straw end is open the water will

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.070
flow out, create a partial vacuum and water
will empty out from the jar completely. its

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.560
a very nice way of producing simple vacuum.
the water will continue to flow out. instead

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.920
of plain water you can take colored water.
if you lift the jar once again the colored

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:56.920
water will go up the flexi tube, enter the
bottle and because the water is flowing out,

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:06.259
so the water will be sucked in through the
flexi tube continuously until the jar on the

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:10.149
right side is drained out.
