00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.000
-Hi, Feliciano. How are you?
-Good.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.680
-Nice to meet you.
-Me too.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.960
-Where to?
-To Roland Garros.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.640
What does 50 mean for you?

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.560
-50?
-The 50th Grand Slam tournament

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.320
you're doing in a row.

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.600
-This Roland Garros makes 50?
-Exactly.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.440
-It's a good number.
-It's fantastic!

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.960
-I heard something absolutery incredible about you.
-What?

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.360
You did like actor in a Spanish soap opera...

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:42.920
It was a very short thing.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.480
And?

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.520
I realised I'd be an actor
when I finish my tennis career.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.160
-Sure? You don't expect to...
-No.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.320
I heard a quite funny nickname

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.200
which is pretty flattering.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.480
"The ATP playboy."

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.400
-No!
-Yeah, I promise!

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.440
Talking about playboy, what about bringing
another one in the car?

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.720
His name is Adriano and he's a DJ.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:17.560
You two guys are going to participate
to the original soundtrack

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.440
of "Road to Roland Garros".

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.960
-How are you?
-Adriano.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.640
-Hi, Adriano, how are you?
-Hi, Guillaume.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.360
Security...

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.840
A little click is better than a big accident.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.680
-You understand?
-Yes.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.960
-Little click, big accident.
-Yes, I understand.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.680
-You speak French?
-A little bit.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.560
So I'm here to...
wake you up, guys, a little bit.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.160
I will ask you to snap fingers
and clap.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.520
Come on, guys, be active this morning

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.320
Let's move

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.720
-Last thing, we're going to make a little sefie...
-Sure!

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.320
So we have a little souvenir.
