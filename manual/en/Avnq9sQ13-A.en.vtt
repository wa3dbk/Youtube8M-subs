Welcome from AC News, 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
let's see today's trailer

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:17.000
and cinema news is coming up!

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
David Fincher convinced screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
to write a remake of the classic story by Jules Verne: 20.000 Leagues Under The Sea.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Before today Fincher never worked with the same writer for more than once.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The screenplay should have been adapted by

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Scott Z. Burns, Micheal Chabon, Justin Marks, Bill Marsilii and Randall Wallace,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
but Walker made his appearing because Fincher wanted him.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Walker is best known as the writer of the classic

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
serial killer Seven and also Panic Room.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
It's interesting that he accepted a similar project,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
respect to all his previous darker works.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Last year 20th Century Fox made the debut for Scrat's Continental Crack Up,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
an animated short that serves as the pre-sequel for the animation

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Ice Age: Continental Drift, that will be out 13th July 2012.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The short story that appeared in the first three Ice Age

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
is Scrat's research of the important nut.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
For who hasn't seen the cartoon it may seem unimportant as a story,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
but it's maybe the funniest scene of the movie.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
This time the quest for the damned nut will create a cataclysm

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
which will trigger the adventures of the other characters, Mannie, Sid and Diego.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
The movie is directed by Steve Martino and Mike Thurmier.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000
That's all for today,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
see you soon from AC News!
