00:00:01.967 --> 00:00:05.100
The President:
As I've said before, my top
priority as President is doing

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.967
everything we need to do to
make sure that we're growing our

00:00:08.967 --> 00:00:12.934
economy and that we're
strengthening our middle class.

00:00:12.934 --> 00:00:15.500
And as I said in my State of
the Union address last month,

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.734
every day we should be asking
ourselves three questions.

00:00:19.734 --> 00:00:22.266
One -- how do we make
sure America is a magnet

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.633
for good jobs?

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:26.767
Number two -- how do we equip
people with the skills they need

00:00:26.767 --> 00:00:27.900
to get those jobs?

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.767
And number three -- how do
we make sure that hard work

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:35.166
actually pays off
in a decent living?

00:00:35.166 --> 00:00:37.467
These are the challenges that
I've instructed my team here

00:00:37.467 --> 00:00:41.033
at the White House and in my
entire Cabinet to focus on.

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:44.000
And a position that's
instrumental to tackling these

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.133
challenges is having an
outstanding Secretary of Labor.

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:52.800
So I want to begin by thanking
Hilda Solis and her entire team --

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:07.266
(applause)

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:10.000
-- including Acting
Secretary Seth Harris --

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:17.133
(applause)

00:01:17.133 --> 00:01:19.200
-- for the outstanding work that
they've been doing over the past

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.033
four years.

00:01:21.033 --> 00:01:23.734
Their efforts at the Department
of Labor have given more young

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:26.967
people a chance to
earn new skills,

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:30.166
more returning vets the
chance to find a job.

00:01:30.166 --> 00:01:33.667
They've looked out for worker
safety from construction sites

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:35.233
to coal mines.

00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:38.100
They've stood up for
workers' rights to organize,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.000
women's rights to get
paid equally for the

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.734
work that they do.

00:01:43.734 --> 00:01:46.700
They've done an extraordinary
job fighting on behalf of

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.934
working families
across the board.

00:01:48.934 --> 00:01:51.767
And today, I'm proud to nominate
a leader to carry on those

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:56.667
efforts as America's next
Secretary of Labor -- Tom Perez.

00:01:56.667 --> 00:02:12.533
(applause)

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:15.233
Like so many Americans, Tom
knows what it's like to climb

00:02:15.233 --> 00:02:17.266
the ladder of opportunity.

00:02:17.266 --> 00:02:20.166
He is the son of
Dominican immigrants.

00:02:20.166 --> 00:02:23.166
He helped pay his way through
college as a garbage collector

00:02:23.166 --> 00:02:25.433
and working at a warehouse.

00:02:25.433 --> 00:02:28.567
He went on to become the
first lawyer in his family.

00:02:28.567 --> 00:02:31.166
So his story reminds us
of this country's promise,

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:33.033
that if you're
willing to work hard,

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:35.767
it doesn't matter who you
are, where you come from,

00:02:35.767 --> 00:02:39.100
what your last name is --
you can make it if you try.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.367
And Tom has made protecting that
promise -- for everybody -- the

00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:45.100
cause of his life.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:49.767
As a civil rights attorney, an
aide to Senator Ted Kennedy,

00:02:49.767 --> 00:02:53.533
a member of the Montgomery,
Maryland County Council,

00:02:53.533 --> 00:02:56.166
Tom fought for a level playing
field where hard work and

00:02:56.166 --> 00:03:00.066
responsibility are rewarded and
working families can get ahead.

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:02.433
And this is not the first time
that he's chosen to be a labor

00:03:02.433 --> 00:03:03.700
secretary, either.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.600
We've got here today
Governor Martin O'Malley,

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.000
and Martin appointed Tom
as Secretary of Maryland's

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.734
Department of Labor, where he
helped implement the country's

00:03:14.734 --> 00:03:18.567
first statewide living-wage law,
because he understood that a

00:03:18.567 --> 00:03:22.400
minimum wage should be a
wage that you can live on.

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:24.533
In his current role as
the head of the U.S.

00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:26.867
Justice Department's
Civil Rights Division,

00:03:26.867 --> 00:03:30.433
Tom has fought to open pathways
into the workforce for everyone

00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:33.700
willing to contribute, including
people with disabilities,

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.266
LGBT Americans, and immigrants.

00:03:36.266 --> 00:03:39.567
And he has helped settle some of
the largest cases ever on behalf

00:03:39.567 --> 00:03:44.700
of families targeted by
unfair mortgage lending.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.700
Now, while he's tackled
plenty of tough issues,

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:50.667
Tom has also spent a career
as a consensus-builder.

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:53.467
He's worked with CEOs, he's
worked with labor leaders.

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:57.700
He's worked at federal, state,
and local government levels.

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:01.367
And throughout, he understands
that our economy works best when

00:04:01.367 --> 00:04:03.834
the middle class and those
working to get into the middle

00:04:03.834 --> 00:04:07.767
class have the security
they need on the job,

00:04:07.767 --> 00:04:10.266
a democratic voice
in the workplace,

00:04:10.266 --> 00:04:12.567
everybody playing by
the same set of rules.

00:04:12.567 --> 00:04:15.467
So Tom's knowledge and
experience will make him

00:04:15.467 --> 00:04:18.233
an outstanding
Secretary of Labor.

00:04:18.233 --> 00:04:19.700
And there's plenty
of work to do.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.367
We're going to have to work very
hard to make sure that folks

00:04:24.367 --> 00:04:27.066
find jobs with good
wages and good benefits.

00:04:27.066 --> 00:04:29.500
We've got to make sure that our
veterans who are returning home

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:33.300
from Iraq and Afghanistan have
a chance to put their incredible

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.900
skills and leadership
to work at home.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.467
We need to build an immigration
system that works for every

00:04:38.467 --> 00:04:41.600
employee and every family
and every business.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.066
I'm confident that Tom is going
to be able to work to promote

00:04:45.066 --> 00:04:47.967
economic growth, but
also make sure that that

00:04:47.967 --> 00:04:49.734
growth is broad-based.

00:04:49.734 --> 00:04:52.333
And he's going to be an
integral part of our overall

00:04:52.333 --> 00:04:53.567
economic team.

00:04:53.567 --> 00:04:57.467
So these are just a few of the
many challenges working families

00:04:57.467 --> 00:05:00.533
out there are facing and
where they need an advocate,

00:05:00.533 --> 00:05:02.934
and Tom is the right
person for that job.

00:05:02.934 --> 00:05:07.000
So I hope that the Senate will
act swiftly to confirm Tom so

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.166
we can work together to
address all these concerns.

00:05:11.166 --> 00:05:16.000
I want to thank not only Tom
but his wonderful family for

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.300
agreeing to take
on this new role.

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.266
I just heard that Tom has
been coaching basketball

00:05:21.266 --> 00:05:23.734
and baseball.

00:05:23.734 --> 00:05:25.500
He doesn't claim to
be a great coach --

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.900
(laughter)

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:30.934
-- but he brings passion to it.

00:05:30.934 --> 00:05:35.266
He may end up missing a few of
the games over the next several

00:05:35.266 --> 00:05:38.200
months, but it's going
to be for a good cause.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.700
And I appreciate his family
being willing to make these

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:42.166
sacrifices as well.

00:05:42.166 --> 00:05:46.400
So with that, I would like to
introduce my nominee to be our

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.200
next Secretary of Labor, give
him a chance to say a few words.

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.166
And, again, I'd urge the
Senate to confirm him as

00:05:53.166 --> 00:05:54.300
quickly as possible.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:55.433
Mr. Tom Perez.

00:05:55.433 --> 00:05:59.967
(applause)

00:05:59.967 --> 00:06:00.800
Mr. Perez:
Thank you.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:19.266
(applause)

00:06:19.266 --> 00:06:20.633
Thank you very much.

00:06:20.633 --> 00:06:23.834
Thank you, Mr. President,
for your confidence in me.

00:06:23.834 --> 00:06:31.333
(speaking in Spanish)

00:06:31.333 --> 00:06:35.767
It is a remarkably humbling
and exciting phenomenon to

00:06:35.767 --> 00:06:37.200
be here today.

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.367
My parents taught my four
siblings and me to work hard,

00:06:40.367 --> 00:06:43.467
to give back to our community,
and to make sure that the ladder

00:06:43.467 --> 00:06:47.233
of opportunity was there
for those coming after us.

00:06:47.233 --> 00:06:50.700
Over my career, I've learned
that true progress is possible

00:06:50.700 --> 00:06:54.266
if you keep an open mind,
listen to all sides,

00:06:54.266 --> 00:06:56.100
and focus on results.

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.500
I look forward to taking these
lessons with me, if confirmed,

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:03.066
to my new role as Secretary
of the Department of Labor.

00:07:03.066 --> 00:07:06.066
As you well know, our nation
still faces critical economic

00:07:06.066 --> 00:07:10.400
challenges, and the Department's
mission is as important as ever.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.800
I am confident that together
with our partners in organized

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:17.266
labor, the business community,
grassroots communities,

00:07:17.266 --> 00:07:20.066
Republicans, Democrats,
and independents alike,

00:07:20.066 --> 00:07:23.867
we can keep making progress
for all working families.

00:07:23.867 --> 00:07:27.834
In the coming weeks, as the
confirmation process unfolds,

00:07:27.834 --> 00:07:30.467
I look forward to meeting with
senators of both parties to

00:07:30.467 --> 00:07:34.000
discuss the Labor Department's
key role -- protecting and

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.967
growing the middle class.

00:07:35.967 --> 00:07:39.100
I'll close again, Mr. President,
by thanking you once again for

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:41.400
this tremendous opportunity.

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:49.333
(speaking in Spanish)

00:07:49.333 --> 00:07:52.066
I look forward to this
opportunity to continue

00:07:52.066 --> 00:07:53.500
serving our nation.

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:54.600
Thank you so much.

00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:57.133
(applause)
