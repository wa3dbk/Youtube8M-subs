00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.400
Welcome to Plum Landing!

00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:10.833
Hello, Blorb.

00:00:10.833 --> 00:00:12.767
Hello, Blorbians.

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:14.800
Hello, my fellow Blorbians.

00:00:16.933 --> 00:00:18.833
Friends from Blorb, hello!

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:20.967
Here's another Plum post
from Earth.

00:00:20.967 --> 00:00:23.067
Today, the desert.

00:00:23.067 --> 00:00:24.700
Like most Blorbians,

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.133
I used to think deserts were
just blazing hot sand dunes,

00:00:27.133 --> 00:00:29.133
completely dry
and pretty much dead.

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:32.200
But now I know the truth!

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.700
First of all, there's a lot
of desert on Earth.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.700
If you smooshed all the land
into one spot,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.133
this is how much desert.

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:43.300
So because you find deserts
everywhere,

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.533
from the tops of mountains
all the way down to Antarctica,

00:00:46.533 --> 00:00:48.133
guess what?

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:49.700
They're not all alike!

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.967
Some deserts, like the ones in
Australia, Africa and the U.S.,

00:00:53.967 --> 00:00:55.567
are hot.

00:00:55.567 --> 00:00:58.567
Others, like Antarctica and
the Gobi Desert in Mongolia,

00:00:58.567 --> 00:01:00.267
are cold.

00:01:00.267 --> 00:01:03.833
And really, even the hot deserts
can get cold at night.

00:01:03.833 --> 00:01:06.000
Now, I know what you're
thinking, my Blorbian friends.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.133
You're thinking,

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:09.233
"If some deserts are hot
and some are cold,

00:01:09.233 --> 00:01:11.000
what makes them all deserts?"

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.800
Fantastic question,
and here's the answer.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.767
Deserts are places that get
very little rainfall.

00:01:17.767 --> 00:01:20.300
But-- and this is
the amazing part--

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:24.100
where there's even the teensiest
bit of water, there's life.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.467
So deserts aren't dead at all.

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:28.100
There's plenty of life,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.333
though sometimes,
you have to look for it.

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:33.600
I sent my five earthlings
to the Australian desert,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.667
and they came back with
a gazillion animal pictures!

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:38.733
Well, 47.

00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:41.433
Anyway, they found lots
of small animals:

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:45.333
frogs, ants, spiders
and bilbies,

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:49.367
and even some big ones like
emus, kangaroos and camels.

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:51.633
All of these animals
have an adaptation,

00:01:51.633 --> 00:01:53.567
a special part of their body

00:01:53.567 --> 00:01:56.300
that makes it easier for them
to find or store liquids.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.500
Want to see my favorite
of all adaptation?

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.867
Watch this!

00:01:59.867 --> 00:02:01.933
The thorny devil.

00:02:01.933 --> 00:02:04.033
He soaks up water with his skin,

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:06.867
then rolls it off his back
into his mouth.

00:02:06.867 --> 00:02:09.733
As Oliver would say, "Awesome!"

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:11.400
So that's all for now.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.100
From beautiful, splendiferous
planet Earth,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.267
this is Plum signing off.
