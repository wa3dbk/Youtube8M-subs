00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
We all feel in control of our actions and thoughts.

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.580
Its what defines us.

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:06.860
But as biology and technology begin to intertwine,

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.420
the question remains:

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.040
Could your brain be hacked?

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:12.720
The truth is the brain is an electrical device,

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.380
and because of this we can interface it to our own electronic devices.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.860
In fact hundreds of thousands of people are already taking advantages of this

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.100
with cochlear implants.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.300
A type of hearing aid that mimics sound to the brain through electrical impulses.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:27.980
However, electricity isn't exactly precise.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.460
It ends up spreading signals across many neurons in the brain.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.580
And in the case of hearing, it can make the signal muddy or blurry.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:37.600
To solve this problem, researchers have found a way to use light,

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.920
which you can aim and is much more precise,

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.980
to stimulate the desired part of the brain.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.840
And its this light that may be the key to very specific control

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.840
over the brain.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.680
But first these cells must somehow  learn how to use light

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.820
as an input source.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.140
As crazy as it may seem, a harmless, non-reproducing virus is used to insert genes into the desired neurons or brain cells.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.700
These genes are taken from other organisms that use light to survive

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.620
such as algae.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.620
Surprisingly, we use the same genetic and cellular mechanisms as them,

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:09.140
so if you take DNA from one and insert it in another, it still works.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.040
These genes encode for proteins that allow the neurons or brain cells to act as a solar cell.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:20.940
As a result, they react to incoming light and convert it to an electrical signal, while cells without the new DNA remain unreactive.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.480
All we need now is an optical source to shine light on these neurons when we want them activated.

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:30.740
Create this set up within the reward systems of the brain and you could make someone happy with the push of a button.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.400
Stick it into the motor cortex and you could control parts of movement.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.680
And this is exactly what scientists have done.

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.420
This mouse has fibre optic cables wired into its right motor cortex, which controls movement to the left.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.960
As soon as the light is shone into its altered solar panel neurons,

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.080
it cannot help but run to the left.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.500
Its thoughts and actions have been hacked.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:54.080
So what happens when we begin to stick technology into our brains?

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:01.360
On the one hand, it may open the door to managing physically debilitating diseases, personality disorders or even conditions such as depression.

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:03.600
Turn on or off the necessary cells,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:04.520
and voila.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.820
Heck, the average person may be able to integrate this technology in order to augment their vision,

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.380
or play video games in their mind.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.560
And as we begin to understand the intricacies of the brain which regions specifically control which actions and thoughts,

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.360
this technology will bear even more significance.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.620
However, the ethical concerns and risks lurk quietly around the corner.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.120
So knowing your brain could be hacked,

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.080
would you want this technolgy in your brain?

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:33.060
Don't forget, AsapSCIENCE now has t-shirts in both white and black.
