00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:02.200
This message is brought to you

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.934
by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

00:00:04.934 --> 00:00:10.567
[music]

00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:15.300
Fruits and vegetables-
So fresh, so colorful,

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.600
so delicious and healthy.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.000
We can all be healthier
and improve our diets by

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.967
eating more fruits
and vegetables.

00:00:21.967 --> 00:00:23.867
As with any food product,
you have to be careful in

00:00:23.867 --> 00:00:26.600
how you handle and
prepare what you eat.

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.600
It's as easy as washing
your hands before touching

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.600
fresh fruits
and vegetables.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.333
Growers and processors are
responsible for preventing

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:37.533
bacteria in the soil or
water from contaminating

00:00:37.533 --> 00:00:39.266
fresh fruits and
vegetables where they are

00:00:39.266 --> 00:00:41.166
grown or processed.

00:00:41.166 --> 00:00:43.834
With fresh-cut produce,
like bagged salads or cut

00:00:43.834 --> 00:00:46.367
fruit, make sure it's
refrigerated or surrounded

00:00:46.367 --> 00:00:48.734
by ice.

00:00:48.734 --> 00:00:51.033
And, don't buy bruised
or damaged fruit.

00:00:51.033 --> 00:00:52.900
It's a great place for
bacteria to hide and

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.467
spread rapidly to the
rest of the fruit.

00:00:57.467 --> 00:00:59.133
While shopping and
when checking out,

00:00:59.133 --> 00:01:01.066
keep your fresh fruits and
vegetables separate from

00:01:01.066 --> 00:01:03.266
meat, poultry and seafood.

00:01:03.266 --> 00:01:07.300
...And make sure you're
in the right line.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.767
At home, store fruits and
vegetables that require

00:01:09.767 --> 00:01:11.800
refrigeration
immediately in the

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:15.066
refrigerator-especially
anything that's pre-cut or

00:01:15.066 --> 00:01:19.567
peeled. Use a thermometer
to ensure that food in

00:01:19.567 --> 00:01:22.700
your refrigerator stays at
40 degrees Fahrenheit or

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.533
below.

00:01:24.533 --> 00:01:26.300
We all know that we need
to wash our hands after

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.300
handling raw meat and we
should also wash our hands

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.033
after handling
produce too.

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:34.700
Cut away damaged or
bruised areas on fresh

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.667
fruits and vegetables
before preparing or

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:38.000
eating.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.066
And make sure you wash
the produce before you eat

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:42.667
it-even if you
plan to peel it.

00:01:42.667 --> 00:01:45.300
If it's something firm
like a melon or cucumber,

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.367
use a produce brush.

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:50.367
No need to use soap or any
kind of produce wash-plain

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:54.400
running water is fine.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.433
For precut, bagged items,
look on the package-if

00:01:57.433 --> 00:01:59.166
they are labeled
"pre-washed" and "ready to

00:01:59.166 --> 00:02:05.500
eat" there's no need
for additional washing.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.433
If you're eating fruits
and vegetables raw,

00:02:07.433 --> 00:02:10.200
keep them separate from
foods such as raw meat,

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.300
poultry or seafood-and the
utensils used to prepare

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.500
them.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.133
This will help avoid
cross contamination.

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:19.233
Use separate cutting
boards for meats and

00:02:19.233 --> 00:02:22.734
produce as well as for
raw and cooked foods.

00:02:22.734 --> 00:02:24.734
And finally, wash
cutting boards,

00:02:24.734 --> 00:02:27.867
utensils and counter tops
with hot water and soap

00:02:27.867 --> 00:02:30.066
between the time you
prepare raw meats,

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:32.600
seafood and poultry and
any produce that will be

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:35.767
not be cooked.

00:02:35.767 --> 00:02:38.066
For plastic or other
non-porous cutting boards,

00:02:38.066 --> 00:02:39.500
run them through the
dishwasher when you're

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.166
done.

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:45.233
Nothing like a glass of
orange juice to get your

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:46.667
day started.

00:02:46.667 --> 00:02:48.500
Most of the juices
sold in the U.S.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.133
are pasteurized or
otherwise treated to kill

00:02:51.133 --> 00:02:52.633
harmful bacteria.

00:02:52.633 --> 00:02:54.967
But, if you enjoy buying
fresh-squeezed juice like

00:02:54.967 --> 00:02:57.433
I do, you should know
that untreated fruit and

00:02:57.433 --> 00:03:00.633
vegetable juices may
contain harmful bacteria.

00:03:00.633 --> 00:03:03.800
Some stores, cider mills
or markets sell packages

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.367
or containers of fresh
squeezed juice that have

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:08.900
not been pasteurized or
treated to kill harmful

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.734
bacteria.

00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:13.233
If you are at risk for
foodborne illness like the

00:03:13.233 --> 00:03:15.367
young, the elderly, or
people with weakened

00:03:15.367 --> 00:03:18.166
immune systems, it is
advisable to look for a

00:03:18.166 --> 00:03:20.467
warning label
on the package.

00:03:20.467 --> 00:03:22.633
Juices that are fresh
squeezed and sold by the

00:03:22.633 --> 00:03:25.500
glass may not be
pasteurized or treated and

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.100
do not require
a warning label.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.166
While normally safe,
if you are at risk for

00:03:30.166 --> 00:03:32.166
foodborne illness,
you should not drink

00:03:32.166 --> 00:03:34.533
unprocessed juices.

00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:37.100
Keeping these common sense
tips in mind will not only

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.200
improve your diet, but
also help keep you safe

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.100
from any foodborne illness
possibly associated with

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:46.133
fresh fruits,
vegetables and juices.
