00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.500
Hi, I am Raadhika. Let's talk about increasing metabolic rate just through diet can actually help us lose weight quickly and steadily. 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.550
The metabolic rate is the rate at which the body burns calories, that is, the food we eat, to produce energy. 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.289
Simply put, we eat to live.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:25.999
Some foods can help increase our body's metabolic rate...

00:00:25.999 --> 00:00:27.899
...by making the body work harder to process them. 

00:00:27.899 --> 00:00:33.700
The  harder the body works, the more energy is produced.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.460
That means that even as we eat, 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.870
we lose weight. 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.450
But to really lose weight and feel good, 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.450
we need to burn fat.

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:51.820
This is best done on a low carb - high fibre diet.

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.900
This is best done on a low carb - high fibre diet. 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.090
This way, our body will burn fat as it won't have enough carbs to turn into energy. 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.160
So now lets look at what to eat to boost metabolism:

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.990
almonds,

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.060
apples,

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.580
pears, kidney beans, chickpeas,

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.439
cinammon,

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.930
coffee, black &amp; green tea

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.070
grapefruit,

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.090
turkey,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.030
oats, tofu,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.220
water,

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.130
all foods to increase metabolism.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.720
They are the same foods that help you burn body fat.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.280
i was for example that which raises the
metabolism rate

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:29.869
Almonds for example, have fatty acids which raises the metabolism rate. 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:31.580
Apples, pears, all beans are so high in fibre...

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:36.540
that the effort taken to process them, increases the metabolic rate.

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.929
The caffeine in coffee, black and green teas...

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:42.290
...helps increase metabolism...

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.950
...but you don't want to overdo it. 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.420
Very important, but often forgotten is water.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:55.420
It can increase the body's fat burning ability by 30% and flush out the toxins...

00:01:58.060 --> 00:01:59.920
Then there are fats...

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.550
...that help burn fats by increasing metabolism.

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:05.740
No, that's not an error but it's true.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.939
Virgin coconut oil is a saturated fat 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:11.870
but it is heart healthy. 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.970
Taken as part of a low carb diet...

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.700
...it has the amazing ability...to up your energy levels

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.949
and rev up metabolism. 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:27.949
But for VCO to weave its magic and enable weight loss, polyunsaturated fats have to be cut out completely from the foods we eat. It's also great for 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:34.660
healthy hair, nails and for beating acne. 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:44.119
Other ways to increase metabolism, exercise. If you aren't into the really heavy stuff, try yoga and walking. 

00:02:44.119 --> 00:02:50.539
The Dukan diet, which is a low carb diet includes a 20 minute walk everyday for this very reason.

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:52.329
You'll be burning calories,

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:53.849
losing weight, and feeling more energized...

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.989
...at the same time.

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.669
