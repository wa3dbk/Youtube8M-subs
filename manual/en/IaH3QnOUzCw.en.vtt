The backcombing method, getting dreads using
the backcombing method, you definitely need

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.380
a little bit of length.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:18.150
It's recommended that you have between 6 to
12 inches and it's best used on textures that

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.220
are a little bit smoother, a little bit softer.

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:28.429
You may want to try doing the backcombing
method with a tighter curl or a coarser texture,

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:34.130
but it's mainly used by those that have a
softer texture of hair,the hair that doesn't

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:35.710
lock as quickly.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:45.040
And so the process is one that you take small
sections, preferably about one to an inch

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:55.370
and a half sectioning, and each section you
take, you backcomb it.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.990
Mostly with a brush because you definitely
want to get your backcombing stiff, tight,

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.510
and a little bit frizzy.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.530
The frizziness and the loose hairs will kind
of help mold it and allow you to do your palm

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.990
rolling, to get that shape that you want.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.740
You use your brush and do your backcombing
method, nice and tight, small strokes.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.899
And then once you get your backcombing in,
your hair will probably be about, in terms

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:28.450
of the look of the length it'll look a little
shorter, because you just backcombed a lot

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.909
of your length into the dread.

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:38.299
And then you take your dread wax at that point
and use just a little bit from the root all

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:40.340
the way to the ends and then you start palm
rolling.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.159
And you palm roll and you palm roll that whole
backcombed dread, until it gets nice and smooth,

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.939
and gets a nice shape that you want and it
sticks and it stays.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.439
Once you get your full head done, you have
just done a full head of the backcombing method

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.449
to get your instant dreadlocks.
