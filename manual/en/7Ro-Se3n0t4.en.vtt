00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.900
Michael: Fuck!

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.820
Holy shit are you kidding me?

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:11.500
Hit the little fucking shit bird!

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.680
Fucking god damn. Holy hell

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:17.720
Get off the bottom you little prick so I can murder you!

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:23.380
Oh god oh god oh GOD, shit on my ass! Shit on my excrement.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.180
*Panicked whining*

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.020
No no no no no no! FUCK!

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.700
You fuckin' fuck!

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.340
I can't even get to the fucking bottom score on the highscore.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.020
God DAMMIT! Run towards the fuckin' gas you assholes!

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.620
How did I- ?

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.520
How did that not kill him?

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.260
How did all that fucking poison not fucking kill him?!

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.840
There's like 9000 fuckin' mushrooms on my goddamn screen now.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.180
He's in my fuckin' safe zone!

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.840
Jesus Christ! The whole fucking centipede is down here.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.500
Oh my god oh my god NO! GET THE HELL OUT OF THE WAY!

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.100
Once that thing gets down here you are fucked.

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.260
There's nothing you can do 'cause you can't shoot bullets outta your asshole.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.640
There is one fuckin' thing.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.240
There is two fuckin' things.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.220
There's two fuckin' things...

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.980
OH MY GOD THERE'S STILL TWO THINGS!

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.000
They're multiplying like little shitheads!

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.120
Mother fucker!

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.240
Shoot the fucking orange things!

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.920
It takes me an hour and a half to fuckin' shoot through the mushrooms to get to the goddamn thing!

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.500
You can only have one bullet on the fuckin' screen at a time

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.700
so if you shoot one up through an empty space and it doesn't hit anything

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:19.900
you are fucked.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.600
The guys right in front of you will tear your goddamn head off.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.140
Ohhh I'm gonna get fuckin' shit on here.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.780
Get ready for some shit stew.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.100
Servin' it up fresh!

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:29.440
*Punches desk* FUCK!

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.300
Ohhp!

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:31.260
I spilled my drink.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:32.160
Gavin clean that up

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.280
.....

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:34.840
GAVIN CLEAN IT UP!

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.520
...

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.040
Gavin: *sheepishly* O-Ok Michael.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:38.380
Michael: FUCKIN' SHIT!

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:41.460
I am getting progressively worse, holy crap.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.340
These things move like schlongs

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.180
they're unpredictable.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.840
I don't know which way they're gonna fuckin' bend

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.100
they're like curved dicks.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.720
Fuckin'

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.940
shit!

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.340
He ran right through the fuckin' pesticide at the top!

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.700
Alright uhhhhh.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.140
Stay over there. Stay over there

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.120
Stay over THERE!

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:56.900
Holy CRAP!

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.900
Hooly helll

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.940
Oh my god how did I make it out of that?

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.080
How the f-*grunts*!

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.940
*Groan*

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.440
Jesus Christ!

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.100
God!

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.980
Damn!

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.760
What the hell do you do there?

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.300
Is there-? Is There like a button I'm missing?

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.060
Can I shoot sideways? Or like backwards or something?

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.740
Or j- I'll just fucking fly right into that guy.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.240
Why not?

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.080
FFFFUCKIN' WHORE!

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.980
I can't-

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:16.740
This is bullshit.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:18.300
Mother fucker.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.820
Mother.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.600
Fucker.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.300
Alright so that was EVOLVED default

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.420
lets try Throttle Monkey just for shits and giggles.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.240
Oh yeah this is fuckin' fine.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.420
This is- this is great.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.860
How the hell am I supposed to play this?

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:29.880
Like, is this a fuckin' real thing?

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:31.800
Can people actually beat this fuckin' thing?

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.980
There's no fuckin' strategy for this.

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:38.040
It's just go ape shit with the analog stick and hope to Christ one of these things don't hit you

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.300
but they always fucking do.

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:40.000
There's one guy left.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.960
You mother

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.860
fucker.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.720
Hit the fuckin' thing come on!

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.200
And then I fuckin' shoot that

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:46.280
then that guy comes down

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.840
there's a spider

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:47.860
there's more guys

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.960
that guy fuckin' eats me

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.980
and then there's more guys

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.760
then the spider fuckin' eats me and I reset and I fuckin' start over again

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.120
and then there's more guys!

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.780
...

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.520
Nope! Fuckin' died that time too!

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.280
I-I think I  beat a lev- nope nevermind.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.440
So the tactic for this is just stand in one spot

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.260
and just hold down the fuckin' button. I guess?

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.240
And just hope they run into it and if they don't you're totally fucked in the butthole.

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.240
Get him get him get him

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.920
get him

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.440
get him!

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:11.900
There was ONE GUY!

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.360
I'm just fuckin' the sticks!

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:14.600
Im just spinning them around!

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.580
How do you beat this?

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.300
Like how do you fucking beat this?

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:19.540
How does someone sit here and play THIS?

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:22.320
This is not fucking physically possible!

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.860
This is inhuman what is happening right now!

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.020
I can't even see what the fuck is happening

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.180
let alone avoid it and shoot the guys.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.220
LOOK AT IT!

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.500
LOOK AT WHAT THE HELL IS ON MY SCREEN!

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.340
Get this last guy.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:34.580
Get the last dude!

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.480
If you don't get the last guy there's like 900 more in like half a fuckin' second!

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.100
They fuck like rabbits and just roll out and fuck the shit out of your earholes!

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:43.820
Sometimes I don't even realize

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:46.420
like I've lost all 3 lives and started over

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:48.720
because I die so fucking fast

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:50.100
and the game just restarts.

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.820
*Controller hits the floor*

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:51.320
I-

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.300
The fucking spiders fucked me so many goddamn times

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.200
I think they probably laid about 40 thousand goddamn eggs inside my fuckin' brain.

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.280
Where is my battery?

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.160
...

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:02.680
Where's my controller?!

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:04.940
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHERE THE HELL IT IS

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:07.180
I THREW MY CONTROLLER AND I CAN'T FUCKIN' FIND IT!

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:08.620
It's gone.

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:09.900
I have the fuckin' battery.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.760
I guess that's it!

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.740
I guess I'm done playing fucking Centipede

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.020
or Millipede or whatever

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.920
because all I have is a fucking BATTERY!
