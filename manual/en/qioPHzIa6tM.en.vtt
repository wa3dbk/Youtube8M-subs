00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.259
I'm just going to tell you a little bit about
my background. I have a very large family

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:13.639
of 17 kids in my family. My Mom and my Dad
had five of their own and then adopted 12

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:21.089
kids after me. And so it was actually when
my parents divorced that I was like 10 or

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:27.669
11 and my Mom remarried to a gentleman who
was Cambodian French, really great guy. But

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:33.550
they started foster caring a lot of kids and
most of the children that are adopted in my

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.590
family are from African American descent.
So they're black. And that's a lot of kids

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.300
to have to send to the barber. So some of
us older kids like myself and some of my older

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.640
siblings, we would go to the different hairdressers
and barbers and learn the techniques to be

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:56.860
able to take them home with us and we basically
self taught just by watching here and there

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:03.170
and throughout the years we've been able to
save our parents a ton of money by learning

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:08.780
some of the tricks and the techniques for
black hair. And so some of you guys may be

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.420
saying why is this white girl teaching us
about cornrows and extensions and so basically

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:18.100
just wanted to give you guys a little background
on me and my family. And so I'm actually the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.069
minority in my family. And so I'm really grateful
to share some of the techniques with you guys

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:28.710
today. Really quick we talked a little bit
about lotion. It's important that your hair,

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.270
when you're prepping your hair, that you,
before you get going on something that's going

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.139
to stay in for sometimes a month at a time
or sometimes longer, you're going to want

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:41.399
to make sure your scalp and everything is
lotioned. But before you lotion make sure

00:01:41.399 --> 00:01:46.659
you wash and you really, really take good
care of the scalp and wash your hair sometimes

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:52.259
one to two times with your black products.
You're not going to want to wash your hair

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.490
with shampoo that's made for a white girl.
Don't do that. That's going to dry out your

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.509
hair. So there's special products out there.
Shampoos and whatnot that are perfect for

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:04.679
hair like Ashley's. And so let's get going.
Let's get started with our hairstyle.
