AMANDA CLAIRE: Okay so, the logic of the bass
buttons is really not too difficult to grasp.

00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:11.410
Looks like a lot of buttons but here's the
key. The buttons are arranged in lines like

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.699
this, in this direction okay. So you can see
there's a line, there's a line, there's a

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:23.769
line, and those lines go by fifths. So if
you understand the concept of a fifth, right.

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:29.699
It's just, you know, it's five, you know,
whole steps away. So in a C chord, right,

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:40.059
the fifth away from the C is the G, it's the
fifth whole step away, so, they go by fifths,

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:49.079
right. So if this is the C, right, C chord,
right. That's going to apply to this whole

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.989
line, and I'll tell you how they're broken
up. The next set over is going to be G because

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:04.470
G is a fifth away, then, the next set away
from that is going to be--let's see what is

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.190
it? It's going to be a D, right, 'cause that's
the next set away, so, it goes on fifths,

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:19.410
right, C, G, D, right, the other side of the
C will be an F, okay. Now, the other way they're

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:27.070
arranged is--so let's just take the--this
line, that's C, okay. We've got a, we've got,

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.540
kind of, what's called the bass note, or the
root note, in this row. The one right next

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:41.070
to it, here, makes the major chord. The one--the
third one away, actually, makes the minor

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:51.030
chord, the next one down makes the seventh,
and the final one down is the diminished chord.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.020
So they're all in a line, right. So, if this
is C, and actually, a line of the accordions,

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.990
they have a little rhinestone, or a little
dimple, or a little bump there, so you can

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.850
feel where the C is, middle C. This will be
the C root, then the major, the minor, the

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:13.060
seventh, and the diminished, okay. This line,
a fifth away, this is going to be the G root,

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.790
the G major, minor, seventh and diminished.
And then, this one up here is the third right,

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.810
so, if this is the C, the third note in the
C chord is in E right so, okay. But you know,

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.420
I don't use those a lot, some people do. So
that's really it, they go in fifths and lines

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:37.670
this way, and then, within each line, you've
got the root, the major, the minor, the seventh

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.390
and the diminished.
