Hi, this is Stephanie Manley with copykat.com.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.699
Today I'm going to show you
how to make freezer biscuits.

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.220
I am sure just like you I've walked through
the freezer section and found large packages

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:31.800
of biscuits that all you did
was have to cook them and you could have biscuits

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.800
whenever you wanted.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.420
Well, you know what?

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.420
We can make this at home.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.430
I'm going to show you how to
make these biscuits.

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.550
We're going to go ahead and mix up our biscuit
dough here.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.120
Then, we are
going to cut them all out.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.649
Then, we're going to take them and freeze
them.

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.870
Then, whenever we get ready we can just take
a couple out of the package

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.270
and cook those whenever we like.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.090
Why don't I go ahead and get started with
that.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.309
In here I have four cups of
flour.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.290
I'm going to add three teaspoons of baking
powder to this.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:13.560
Then, I'm
going to go ahead and add one teaspoon of

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.080
salt.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:16.590
Okay.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.299
Then, I'm going to do something a little exciting
here.

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.860
I am going to use
butter in my biscuits.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.330
Let me go ahead and show you this neat trick
for

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.860
helping to get the butter into the biscuits.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.050
Some people like to use
shortening, but I really like to go ahead

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:37.050
and use butter.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.989
I think it has a
much better flavor.

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:43.670
I'm going to take this and I'm going to stick
this in a plastic bag here.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.729
Some of you may or may not have a rolling
pin.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:48.980
But, we all have a can.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.950
What
I'm going to do is I'm just going to take

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:56.010
this butter and flatten it out.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:09.060
I've gotten the butter all nice and flattened
out.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.090
Now I'm going to go
ahead and add it into my mixture here.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:14.940
You're probably wondering why I did
that.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.480
It is going to make it much easier to go ahead
and blend in this

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.250
butter into this mixture now that it's all
nice and flattened out.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.250
It's a
larger surface area.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.750
Let me go ahead and take my pastry blender
here and work this in.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.150
If you
don't have a pastry blender you can use a

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:37.150
fork.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.150
You can use your hands.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.970
It's going to take just a couple of minutes
to get this all nice and

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:41.970
blended.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.780
Now that I have all of the butter incorporated
in here it looks almost like

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.780
sand.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.819
There are little bits of butter that are about
pea sized.

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:50.140
That's just
fine.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:52.940
I'm going to go ahead and add my milk in.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:59.450
I don't know if you knew this,
but sometimes depending upon how humid it

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.700
is your batter may take just a
little bit less or a little bit more milk.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.620
I'm going to go ahead and start
with one and a quarter cup.

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.340
I may need to add just a little bit more.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.680
I'm
going to stir this in, and then we're going

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.720
to roll out these biscuits.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.100
We're not going to pop them into the oven.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.770
We're actually going to pop them
in our freezer instead.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.130
Okay.

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:32.170
I've just poured this dough out on my board.

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.520
I've just kind of pushed
it out to where it's about one half an inch.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.520
All right.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:41.040
Now I'm going to go
ahead and take my biscuit cutter and cut these

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.350
rounds.

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:50.420
I'm going to just
put them on my cookie sheet.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:54.480
You should get about 12 two, two and a half
inch size biscuits here.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:00.200
I'm going to put them in the freezer.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:08.950
After I cut these biscuits out I placed them
in the freezer for a couple of

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.950
hours.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.810
You can see they're nice and hard right now.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.530
Now all I need to do is
go ahead and put them in my bag.

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:25.949
When you get ready to cook these biscuits
put them at 475 degrees for about 8 to 10

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:26.949
minutes.

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:35.680
You will have wonderful
golden brown biscuits.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:37.379
We just made our freezer biscuits.

00:04:37.379 --> 00:04:39.390
They were really
easy to do.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.979
Now you can have hot biscuits any time you
like.

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:44.409
