Welcome to How To Cook That I am Ann Reardon

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.840
Today I am going to show you how to make a
chocolate bridge, this one is the Sydney Harbour

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.730
Bridge but you can use the same method to
make whatever bridge you would like to make.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:16.170
I made this one for the Weekend Sunrise which
is a TV show here in Sydney, and of course

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.500
you can use the Surprise Cakes app like I
did to add a fireworks show to your bridge

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.500
too.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.420
Lots of you asked can you show us how to make
the bridge as well, so here it is...

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.270
Firstly print out a picture of your bridge
and then cover it in non-stick baking paper.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.520
Place some chocolate in a piping bag and for
the main parts of the bridge use a flat piping

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.940
tip and pipe that main structural support
bit.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.000
Slide the baking paper up and repeat that
a second time for the other side of the bridge

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
structure.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.230
And you can print out this particular one
for the sydney harbour bridge from the website

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.100
in the size I am using I'll put that on the
website howtocookthat.net and I'll put a link

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.260
to that description just below this video.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.261
Squeeze all that chocolate into a new piping
bag and cut off a small amount, check you

00:01:07.261 --> 00:01:13.110
can get a smooth line from it, if not cut
a tiny bit more off and check again.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.210
Take your bag of chocolate and pipe the detailed
parts of the bridge.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.700
Carefully making sure they are as straight
as you can get them and then repeat that on

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.999
the other half as well.

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:28.609
You can use either use tempered chocolate
or you can use compound chocolate for this.

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:33.889
Today I am using compound because the bridge
has to survive under the heat of the TV lights

00:01:33.889 --> 00:01:37.200
and compound chocolate has a higher melting
point.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.929
To make the towers that support the bridge
at each end make a lego version each tower

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.119
and make that in the correct size for your
bridge.

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.829
Then stick that onto a lego base and build
walls up around it.

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:53.649
You'll notice on mine I used the smooth tiles
on top that it will have the smooth edge.

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:59.750
Heat some reusable food grade molding gel
in the microwave and then more it over your

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:01.389
lego prototype.

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:03.549
Tap it on the bench to get rid of any bubbles.

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.280
Now this gel takes quite a while to cool down
and set, I put it in the fridge and it still

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.110
took a couple of hours.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.090
Once it is set you can just pull the lego
walls off.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:17.700
Then loosen each edge and push the lego out
and now you have a mold for the end of your

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.470
bridge.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.960
Fill the mold with white chocolate give it
a tap to get any air bubbles.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.100
You can see this is buldging out slightly
on the sides and I don't mind that shape for

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.640
my bridge, if you want your perfectly straight
then just build some lego walls around it

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.880
to support it.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.250
Once it is set push it out of the mold, then
make another one so you have one for each

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.250
end.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.170
Now to make our road.

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.780
I am making this fairly thick as it needs
to support the weight of the bridge without

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:46.780
breaking.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:50.260
Spread it out smoothly and let it start to
set.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.060
Then take a ruler and trim it straight making
sure it is the right width to fit on your

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.060
bridge towers.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.230
If you are not sure make it narrower than
you think because you don't want to put it

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.590
all together and then it not fit.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.370
Then place another sheet of baking paper over
the top and something heavy to keep it from

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.090
curling up because chocolate tends to curl
as it sets.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:16.220
Top make the across parts of the bridge draw
two lines on baking paper the width of the

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.680
road that you've just done and then put that
over the template.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:25.840
Pipe a box with a criss cross in the middle
and then pipe more boxes but leave them open

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.000
on one side because we are going to join them
up tot he ones that we have already done.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.120
To put the bridge together take one side and
pipe some chocolate across at the road level

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:38.060
and add the road on top.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.980
Next on the lower level add one of the criss
crossed boxes at a time following the curve

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.990
of the bridge around as you go.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:51.700
Once you've done that then repeat that for
the top of the bridge as well.

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:57.370
Once that is completed then carefully add
more chocolate along the road, around the

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:04.670
top and the middle then quickly add the other
side of the bridge quickly before that sets

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.650
and then line that up straight..

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.390
Cover a cake board in foil and then using
either white chocolate coloured with oil based

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:18.850
food colouring or blue candy melts cover the
entire board in a thin layer.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:23.310
Use a palette knife and run it back and forth
from one side to side to create that rippled

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.130
water effect across the board.

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:31.410
Use your template to measure how far apart
the land needs to be and add some dark green

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.820
chocolate.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:37.900
Followed by some lighter green on top.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.561
Before it sets take a knife or a fork and
gently poke it into the chocolate and quickly

00:04:41.561 --> 00:04:47.750
pull up to create some texture sort of grass
or bush effect onto your chocolate . Once

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.120
that is set add your bridge towers and then
use the template to get them in the correct

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:56.880
position make sure they are the right distance
apart and on the right angle and use some

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.410
melted chocolate to secure them in place.

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.150
Then finally and very carefully add the delicate
bridge on top.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.740
If you need to transport it the keep the bridge
part off and flat and seperate in an esky

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:13.130
until you get to your location.

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.320

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:28.240
And I'll put all of those links in the description

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.200
phones and ipads where the annotations don't
work yet.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.080
If you make a chocolate bridge make sure you
take a photo for me and you can upload it

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:38.830
in the comments section on the website.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:41.419
Have a great week and I'll see you Friday
