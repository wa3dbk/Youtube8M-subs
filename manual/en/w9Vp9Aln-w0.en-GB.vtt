00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hi ladies! Today I'm going to show you how I created this nail art

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.000
that I called Rainbow Beams

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.000
It isn't a complicated nail art

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.000
but you'll need a bit of time and patience to create it

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.000
I'm going to show you the nail polishes I used

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:25.000
but, of course, you can use any neon polish you already have in your stash

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.000
I used Orly Dayglow as a base

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.000
Then I picked Orly Glowstick as a yellow neon polish

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.000
The orange is Orly Melt Your Popsicle

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:48.000
Then, Orly Beach Cruiser, a beautiful highlighter pink

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.000
I've already cut the striping tape so that I can work more easily and fastly

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.000
Then Orly Skinny Dip - all these products are from Feel The Vibe Collection

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.000
And finally Inocos Verde Txaran, a neon green

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:03.000
I also used a foundation sponge, this one is by ELF and is very cheap

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.000
I also used Seche Vite, probably the most known fast drying top coat in the nail polish world

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.000
Of course, I also used striping tape

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.000
and tweezers

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.000
I cut all the pieces of striping tape that I needed before creating my gradient

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:32.000
Now I'm going to create a simple neon gradient on my nails

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.000
My white base is already done and dried

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:42.000
so I can start applying my neon polishes directly on the sponge

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.000
In my opinion, this is the best and easiest method to create a nice gradient

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.000
I apply a generous quantity of all the nail polishes on the sponge

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:00.000
and then I press the sponge on my nails, covering the entire surface

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.000
and the first coat of gradient is done

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.000
Since I want a brighter and more intense result, I do a second coat

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:20.000
Again, I apply all the neon polishes on the sponge and I push it on my nails

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:28.000
Now that I have on my nails a bright and nice rainbow gradient

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:33.000
I can apply a coat of Seche Vite so that my nail polish can dry sooner

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:41.000
and I can proceed to the following step of my nail art

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:53.000
When I'm happy with the result, I push the pieces of striping tape on my nails

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:47.366
With my tweezer, I apply five pieces of striping tape, I can replace them if I'm not satisfied

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:00.000
and then I apply one generous coat of the black polish I chose

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:10.000
that's Orly Liquid Vinyl in this case but, again, you can use the black polish you prefer

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:22.000
I immediately remove all the pieces of striping tape as fast as I can with the help of my tweezers

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:30.000
For my ring finger - the last one in this case - I repeat all the previous steps

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:40.000
I apply five pieces of striping tape with my tweezers and press them on my nails once I'm satisfied

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:50.000
And then I apply one generous coat of Liquid Vinyl

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.000
Now I can remove the striping tape and apply a final coat of Seche Vite

00:03:55.100 --> 00:04:00.000
As a final touch, I do my clean-up

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.000
And that's the final result! I really love it and hope you'll like it too

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.000
Talk to you soon and thank you for watching!
