00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:01.981
DADDY TROY: Welcome back to Gear Daddy. I’m
your host Daddy Troy and today we’re here

00:00:01.981 --> 00:00:06.770
with Gary from Once Upon a Child. It’s a
kid and baby clothing, toy and furniture resale

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.840
shop. It’s a great value for new and veteran
parents. Today’s episode is the first of

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.660
a two part series. Today we’re going to
talk about stuff that you can find at Once

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.580
Upon a Child and next week we’re going to
talk about the buy back process in which you

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.150
as a dad can bring your stuff here and sell
it back to these guys.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:42.390
GARY: Once Upon a Child is a baby resale store.
We purchase items from our customers then

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.440
we turn around, make sure they’re clean
and resell them.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.329
DADDY TROY: Let’s walk around and you can
show us the store a little bit.

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.760
So here we are in kids clothes. You sell both
girls and boys clothes.

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.710
GARY: We go all the way from newborn to size
14.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.470
DADDY TROY: New parents may not know what
size 14 means.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.290
GARY: The child’s going to be somewhere
between 8 and 10 years old.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.040
DADDY TROY: Do you sell more girls clothes
or boys clothes.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.520
GARY: Always girls clothes. Everyone always
wants the girls to look nice and cute. Boys

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.649
are a little rough on their clothes.

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.670
DADDY TROY: This is a true story. This week
I was going to go buy my kid Jenga. I walked

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.110
in the store and there it is. I got a great
deal on this. Tell us about your toy selection.

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.140
GARY: We’re going to keep the toys age appropriate.
Up to about 8 or 9 years old. We don’t get

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:22.259
into the computer games.

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:35.049
DADDY TROY: As I was looking around I saw
some of the more popular games like Operation.

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:36.539
What other games do you see?

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:41.899
GARY: All the old classics like Twister, Candy
Land, Chutes and Ladders and also some new

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:43.939
games like V-Tech and Leap Frog.

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.579
DADDY TROY: A stroller is one of those big
ticket items that can cost a parent between

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:50.909
50 and 200 dollars but you guys sell used
strollers for a fraction of the cost.

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.689
GARY: Correct. We carry all the name brands
like Graco, Fisher Price, Cosco, Evenflow.

00:01:55.689 --> 00:01:56.719
We even carry Prego.

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.270
DADDY TROY: One of the biggest expenses when
setting up your nursery is going to be the

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:08.379
crib and you sell both new and used cribs.
GARY: New cribs will range anywhere from $150

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:13.260
to $500. If you want a used crib we have those
available. They’re going to come in somewhere

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.872
a little less than half or half of the cost
you would pay for a new one.

00:02:16.872 --> 00:02:19.830
DADDY TROY: So there’s a real savings there.
Do you sell used mattresses?

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.319
GARY: No we don’t do used mattresses.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.240
DADDY TROY: I think most moms and dads don’t
want a used mattress anyway.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.890
GARY: We’re very concerned about recall
items. We keep tabs on CPSC. Any time that

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.489
they issue a recall item we’re aware of
it immediately.

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:35.099
DADDY TROY: And CPSC stands for Consumer Product
Safety Commission?

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.420
GARY: If there’s a problem with a crib we
don’t purchase the crib. If we have one

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.219
on our floor we take it off immediately.

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:43.790
DADDY TROY: There are things you don’t sell
used. Carseats?

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.269
GARY: No we don’t do the used carseats.
There are about 5 million on recall and has

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:50.540
it ever been in a wreck?

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.480
DADDY TROY: What about used diaper pails?

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.280
GARY: We do used diaper pails. We make sure
they’re cleaned up. We don’t get them

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.560
in mid use.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.650
DADDY TROY: How about used cloth diapers?

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.739
GARY: We do. There’s actually a demand for
them.

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:11.659
DADDY TROY: That’s really interesting. Thanks
so much for showing us around. Next week we’re

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:15.909
coming back to Once Upon a Child to look at
the buy back process in which all you dads

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:19.349
out there that want to reclaim that room that
once was yours and get all that baby stuff

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:22.950
out of there can come here and make some dough.
See you next time on Gear Daddy and all week

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.479
long at DadLabs.com.
