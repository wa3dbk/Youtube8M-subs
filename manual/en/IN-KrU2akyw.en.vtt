00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:08.260
This is going to be an instructional video
on how to mix a Semco Injection Kit.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.590
If your
Semkit doesn’t already come with the dasher

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:20.090
rod inserted you want to remove the cap and
insert the dasher rod into the cartridge and

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.910
screw it into the mixing wheel that’s inside
the cartridge.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.760
You want to make sure you don’t over tighten
the dasher rod in the mixing wheel just make

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.920
sure it’s in there snug.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.090
The first thing you want to do is you want
to pull the dasher rod and the mixing wheel

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.860
all the way to the top of the cartridge and
then take your ramrod, insert it into the

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.239
dasher rod and you’re going to put pressure
on this piston which will open the valve at

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:56.680
the bottom of the dasher rod allowing the
catalyst to go into the base material.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:01.670
Sometimes it takes quite a bit of force to
get that piston to move initially.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.390
You may have to actually hit it to get that
piston moving.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:17.580
For the best results, move the dasher rod
down a little bit so you can spread the catalyst

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.020
out inside the base material.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:26.469
Once you have it all the way, all the catalyst
into the base material, you can remove the

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:35.929
dasher rod, I mean, remove the base, the ramrod
and then start mixing with the dasher rod

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:40.259
in a clockwise motion.

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:47.600
You want to move the mixing wheel up and down
the cartridge as you continue to mix in a

00:01:47.600 --> 00:02:04.919
clockwise motion.

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:12.160
In most materials, you may have to mix the
base and the catalyst up to 50 to 75 strokes

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:21.260
up and down to get a to get a thorough mix.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:29.730
Once you believe the material is mixed inside
the cartridge, push the dasher rod all the

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:42.210
way to the bottom of the plunger and grip
down by the mixing wheel so you can unscrew

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.260
the dasher rod.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:51.680
One thing I want to mention is, when you’re
mixing the material you want to make sure

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.750
that you keep the end cap on the cartridge
and your hand on the end cap, or you can keep

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.480
it up against the table.

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:06.040
This is going to make sure that you don’t
push the plunger out the backside of the cartridge.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:19.900
Again, once you have it thoroughly mixed you
can insert a dispensing nozzle and then you

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.330
can remove your cap and the cartridge is ready
to dispense.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:37.900
You can actually use a dasher rod to push
it out if you don’t have another gun.
