00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:06.820
Alright. Now you're ready to learn the lift
up. I want to go over the hands again really

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:12.269
quick. If you're hooping to the left, your
first hand will be your right hand. If you're

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:17.820
hooping to the right, your first hand will
be your left hand. The lift up that we're

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.331
learning now, will be using our first hand.
For me, that's my right hand. The movement

00:00:23.331 --> 00:00:27.199
of the hand will be somewhat like you have
something gross on the back of your hand that

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:31.310
you're wiping off on your hip, all the way
up to the front of your body. It goes like

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:40.420
this. Straight up into the lift up. Once again,
from your back, slide across your hip, lift

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:46.769
the arm straight up You can see when I do
that, my elbow leaves until I extend the arm

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.940
up. Alright. Now, let's go over how to get
into that. You're going to take your hoop,

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.329
give it a spin. I'm going to take my first
hand or right hand, and I'm going to place

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:06.210
it on the small of my back. Just like that.
You can see how the hoop is traveling over

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.310
my hand. You need to keep your hand in really
tight to your waist, so that your hand becomes

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:20.450
one with the weight, allowing the hoop just
to travel freely over it. The point at which

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:27.850
you can pick the hoop up is the point that
the hoop connects with your hand. Close your

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:36.250
eyes for a minute and just feel that hoop
rolling over your hand. Try to get into a

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:43.270
rhythm. The next time the hoop presses against
your hand, just like I demonstrated earlier,

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:52.999
you are going to lift straight up and into
lasso. Once again, I'm going to take the hoop,

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:59.609
place it on the waist, give it a whirl, take
my first hand or my right hand and place it

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:09.200
on my back. I just want to get really comfortable
with the hoop traveling over that hand. The

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:17.510
next time I feel that hoop go across my hand,
I'm going to lift straight up and into lasso.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.640
It's really important when you lift the hand
up to lift the hand straight up. Once again,

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:34.439
do it from this direction. Watch how my hand
just lifts straight up in front of me. Alright.

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.920
If you're facing forward and doing that, it's
going to happen pretty quickly. There is a

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:46.760
way to slow this move down just a little bit,
and that is when the hoop hits that hand,

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:55.739
when I start to lift not before, I am going
to slowly turn. That will float the hoop up.

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:05.860
Once again. Right hand on the back. When the
hoop hits that hand, Iâ€™m going to slowly

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:13.540
turn lifting the hoop up into lasso. That's
our first hand coming up to the lift up.
