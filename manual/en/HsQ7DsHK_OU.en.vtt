00:00:13.024 --> 00:00:32.625
Q: Many people think he will avoid your attacks and counter you.

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:38.905
A: It won’t work that easily.

00:00:38.905 --> 00:00:50.028
Q: Kyotaro is very confident though.

00:00:50.028 --> 00:01:11.020
A: He will know better when he first steps in the ring with me.

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:25.598
Q: He said your defense is still too weak.

00:01:25.598 --> 00:01:42.566
A: That’s why I have a surprise for him.

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:54.773
Q: My defense is now such that it won’t be so easy.

00:01:54.773 --> 00:02:42.559
A: Everyone has said similar things about him before getting beaten.

00:02:42.559 --> 00:03:39.344
Q: That is why I am not looking down on him, and I believe he is a great fight. I am confident with my improvements. I will use a new and safer approach just for him.

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:55.902
Q: What did you think of the Badr vs Semmy fight?

00:03:55.902 --> 00:04:38.426
A: I thought he would win as he did. Hari is aggressive, and Semmy is not that sort of fighter.

00:04:38.426 --> 00:04:54.045
Q: Do you expect to fight Hari again?

00:04:54.045 --> 00:05:12.444
A: Of course, and I will win again.

00:05:12.444 --> 00:05:20.338
Q: In the WGP?

00:05:20.338 --> 00:05:32.291
A: I’m not sure, perhaps next year?

00:05:32.291 --> 00:05:42.184
Q: Do you have a message for the fans?

00:05:42.184 --> 00:05:47.664
A: Thank you for supporting me again. There are fans that come to see me fight all over Japan, and even come to Korea. I appreciate their support a lot.

00:05:47.664 --> 00:07:14.801
Thank you and I will do my very best.
