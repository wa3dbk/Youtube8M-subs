00:00:03.779 --> 00:00:06.970
How to Get Your Home Ready for a Dog.

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:10.990
Pet-proofing your house won't just protect
your possessions from becoming chew toys—it

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:13.740
could save your dog's life.

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:22.420
You will need A dog crate A dog who's ready
to move in And dog manuals Pet repellent Electrical

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.800
cord covers Baby gates and a dog bed or towels
for bedding.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.910
Step 1.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.599
Get rid of any electrical cords within your
dog's reach.

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.340
Dogs love to chew, and power cords can seriously
hurt them.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:42.060
You can purchase a pet repellent spray or
electrical cord covers to discourage chewing.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.539
Either way, it's important to make sure that
cords are not left unprotected.

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:48.539
Step 2.

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.929
A variety of common flowers and plants can
make your dog seriously ill if eaten.

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:59.149
Before taking your dog home, remove all dangerous
plants from your house!

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:05.430
Books and websites about dog care offer lists
of plants that can be hazardous to dogs.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.430
Step 3.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:10.430
Your dog might love having the run of your
yard, but make sure to keep him out of the

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:11.430
garden.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.329
If you are using an electric fence or dog
run to keep your pet in the yard, make sure

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.659
that garden areas are out of his reach.

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:18.980
Step 4.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.930
Go easy on the lawn treatments—any kind
of yard chemicals such as pesticides or fertilizers

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.380
can make your dog sick, especially with repeated
exposure.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.930
Step 5.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.789
Cover your garbage, especially in kitchen
and bathroom areas.

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:39.250
Use trash containers with secure lids, or
keep your trash in a closed cabinet.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.200
And while you're at it, make a habit of putting
the toilet lid down so your dog drinks from

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.540
his clean water bowl.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.450
If your dog is especially adventurous, you
may want to use a cabinet lock to keep him

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.420
out of the garbage.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.120
Step 6.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.039
Some common foods can be poisonous or nauseating
to dogs.

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:01.460
Be especially careful to prevent your pooch
from eating foods containing onions, garlic,

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:02.960
fruit, or chocolate.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.969
Don't give your dog meat scraps with bones
attached—the bones can splinter and hurt

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:09.330
your dog.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.330
Step 7.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.120
Keep your house clean.

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.970
Plastic wrappers, hairclips, needles, coins,
small toys, and plastic bags are among the

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.349
many household items that could harm your
dog when they are left in his reach.

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:23.510
Step 8.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.260
Watch out for chemicals.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.580
Keep bathroom and garage doors closed, and
secure all cleaners and medications.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.290
Consider purchasing baby gates to keep your
dog from wandering into areas of your house

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.650
that are off-limits.

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.280
Step 9.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.819
Purchase your pup a dog crate with a cozy
dog bed (or a pile of towels) in it.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:47.720
This will give your dog a place where he can
sleep at night and rest undisturbed during

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.840
the day.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.840
Step 10.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.720
Splurge on a few toys for Fido, but make sure
that they don't have any small pieces he could

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.940
accidentally swallow.

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:01.830
Did you know Chewing on safe dog toys is actually
good for your pet's health—they can help

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.980
to keep teeth clean and relieve the pain that
puppies feel while teething.
