Hey, guys,
Chef Mark here.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.267
Today, I'm gonna make for you
a lemon pepper shrimp.

00:00:04.267 --> 00:00:07.133
Gotta grab the shrimp first and there's
a lot of different choices here.

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:09.233
But if we're gonna do a hot
cooked shrimp dish,

00:00:09.233 --> 00:00:11.800
I will definitely want to make sure
that you get the raw stuff.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:14.400
These are peeled and deveined,
and I don't have to do anything with 'em.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.333
No muss, no fuss,
just thaw 'em out and ready to go.

00:00:18.333 --> 00:00:20.367
So the lemon pepper stir fry,
we're gonna do this.

00:00:20.367 --> 00:00:23.533
I need some peppers here so I'm gonna
grab a variety of peppers.

00:00:23.533 --> 00:00:26.700
I've got green, red, yellow,
there's orange also.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.900
Don't use just the green.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.133
You need definitely a contrast
of the sweet ones in here as well.

00:00:32.133 --> 00:00:34.533
Okay, one more item to grab
for our lemon pepper shrimp

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:35.733
which would be...

00:00:35.733 --> 00:00:37.567
That's right, lemon pepper seasoning.

00:00:37.567 --> 00:00:39.633
It's the only seasoning
we're gonna use for this.

00:00:39.633 --> 00:00:42.233
With some really good technique and
we're gonna be awesome for this one.

00:00:42.233 --> 00:00:44.767
So let's go put this together.

00:00:44.767 --> 00:00:47.000
All right, so we're ready to put this
lemon pepper shrimp together,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.800
so first thing I need to do
is I got a little bit of oil heating up here

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.567
and I've got this,
I'm carefully watching this.

00:00:52.567 --> 00:00:54.267
I want to make sure that
when you do it,

00:00:54.267 --> 00:00:56.367
you do your shrimp first,
then heat up your oil.

00:00:56.367 --> 00:00:59.000
You're watching one thing at a time
so you can concentrate on--

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.633
on the oil because we're gettin' it
to 350 degrees.

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:03.367
I'm gonna take two eggs here.

00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:05.933
This is a little batter that we're gonna
make for our shrimp.

00:01:05.933 --> 00:01:10.233
I'm gonna add a half a cup
of corn starch

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:11.800
after I've beaten this
a little bit.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.767
Just to loosen it up.

00:01:13.767 --> 00:01:14.933
Half a cup of corn starch.

00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:18.867
This is gonna make a nice crispy batter
on the top of that shrimp.

00:01:18.867 --> 00:01:22.600
You want to whisk this in,
make sure it's nice and coated.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.667
All the cornstarch
is dissolved nice.

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:30.233
And then, once you get that
all mixed in,

00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:34.467
we're gonna take our shrimp
and just simply coat those shrimp

00:01:34.467 --> 00:01:36.200
in that cornstarch.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.233
We purposely made that slurry
a little bit thick

00:01:39.233 --> 00:01:42.933
so it's gonna make a really nice coating
on that shrimp there.

00:01:46.067 --> 00:01:48.500
So now, we're gonna
turn our attention to the oil,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.000
and I have a candy thermometer
in here and it's 350 degrees.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.933
You're gonna leave your heat
about medium,

00:01:53.933 --> 00:01:56.133
and you're gonna adjust the heat
as you put your shrimp in.

00:01:56.133 --> 00:01:58.467
'cause it's gonna start
to cool it down a little bit.

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:00.833
So 350 degrees is where I'm at,

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:03.467
and you're gonna do this
in two batches.

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:07.567
Take each shrimp,
drop it in individually into the oil,

00:02:10.667 --> 00:02:14.100
Half the shrimp go in,
about a minute per side.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.333
It's gonna get really nice and crisp
and then we're gonna drain it

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:19.000
on a couple paper towels
to the side.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.267
All right, so we're removing
the last batch of shrimp here

00:02:23.267 --> 00:02:26.667
and what I'm lookin' for is this to get
really nice and brown on the outside.

00:02:26.667 --> 00:02:29.867
And like I said, we're cookin'
at 350 degrees, so

00:02:29.867 --> 00:02:33.867
we're using thawed shrimp,
so a minute per side is plenty enough

00:02:33.867 --> 00:02:37.633
to get the shrimp up to that 140 degrees
where we like our shrimp to be.

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:39.833
And now what I'm gonna do,

00:02:39.833 --> 00:02:43.033
I like to take my oil
and drain that out

00:02:43.033 --> 00:02:45.033
and just be careful about this,
and you could--

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:47.800
this is something you could do
a couple minutes ahead of time

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.800
and leave your shrimp.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.200
Drain that off.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.167
Let the pan cool down
a little bit.

00:02:54.167 --> 00:02:56.100
I'm gonna wipe
the inside out,

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:01.533
just in case I have any little bits of that
cornstarch that fell off on the bottom.

00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:02.900
So let's put this thing together.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.867
So I've got a pan here.

00:03:04.867 --> 00:03:07.600
I'm gonna go on
about medium high heat.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.200
I'm gonna save
that tablespoon of oil.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.400
We're gonna add that now.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.700
And we're gonna wait for that
to faintly smoke.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.433
So once we get that
up to temp,

00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:20.200
we're gonna add
all our peppers at once.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.967
We hear that nice sizzle.

00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:23.833
And we're gonna let this cook
for maybe

00:03:23.833 --> 00:03:25.767
two, three, four minutes.

00:03:25.767 --> 00:03:29.433
Just to make sure that that gets
nice and crisp tender.

00:03:35.833 --> 00:03:37.967
All right, so my peppers
are just about done.

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:40.500
I've got a good bit of caramelization
which I really love,

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.833
helps to bring out
some of those good flavors in it.

00:03:42.833 --> 00:03:45.467
And now, I'm gonna add
my shrimp back in.

00:03:45.467 --> 00:03:47.033
All of those at once.

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:50.567
And I've got 1 1/2 teaspoons
of that lemon pepper seasoning.

00:03:50.567 --> 00:03:52.733
You want to make sure
you sprinkle that on there.

00:03:52.733 --> 00:03:54.800
Give it a little toss.

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.433
Or a little stir, if you don't feel like
tossing it up in the air.

00:03:58.433 --> 00:03:59.800
One and a half teaspoons.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.533
That's all the seasoning
we're gonna use for this.

00:04:02.533 --> 00:04:05.100
And at this point,
all we're gonna do is mix this up,

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:09.000
toss it together,
warm the shrimp back through.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.667
We've got enough color,
enough flavor in it already.

00:04:11.667 --> 00:04:14.067
You toss that together.

00:04:14.067 --> 00:04:16.867
And all that's left to do
is plate this thing.

00:04:16.867 --> 00:04:18.967
We're gonna move
all of this to a plate.

00:04:18.967 --> 00:04:21.533
You're gonna serve this
with a bowl of rice.

00:04:21.533 --> 00:04:23.333
Eat it just as is.

00:04:23.333 --> 00:04:25.867
And you know what,
now that you know the secrets of this,

00:04:25.867 --> 00:04:27.867
there's no reason ever
to order any of this out.

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:30.667
You can make this all at home
and it's gonna be fantastic.
