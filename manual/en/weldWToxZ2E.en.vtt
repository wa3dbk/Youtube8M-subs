00:00:01.145 --> 00:00:02.416
- [Gamer] Hey, kids.

00:00:02.416 --> 00:00:05.445
Today, I'm playing Happy Wheels.

00:00:05.445 --> 00:00:09.612
And, apparently, there's a
meth addict on the cover there.

00:00:10.586 --> 00:00:13.426
I don't know what that's about.

00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:14.283
Alright.

00:00:14.283 --> 00:00:17.029
Oh, I remember this guy.

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.561
Alright, whoa.

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:20.126
Whoa! (breaking glass)

00:00:20.126 --> 00:00:21.192
Steady. Whoa.

00:00:21.192 --> 00:00:23.568
There shouldn't be glass on that road.

00:00:23.568 --> 00:00:28.354
Alright, just peddling my
bicycle with my son on the back.

00:00:28.354 --> 00:00:30.271
Oh! Oh my goodness! Oh!

00:00:31.514 --> 00:00:33.048
I was just decapitated.

00:00:33.048 --> 00:00:35.912
Now, almost every
appendage from my body is.

00:00:35.912 --> 00:00:37.709
Okay, let's start again.

00:00:37.709 --> 00:00:38.647
Let's try this again.

00:00:38.647 --> 00:00:40.615
Alright, peddling up.

00:00:40.615 --> 00:00:43.713
Whoa! (breaking glass)

00:00:43.713 --> 00:00:45.313
Someone needs to move that glass.

00:00:45.313 --> 00:00:48.164
(explosion)
Oh! Wow!

00:00:48.164 --> 00:00:49.006
That wasn't good.

00:00:49.006 --> 00:00:52.412
Let's see if I can get a
little bit farther this time.

00:00:52.412 --> 00:00:54.484
And someone should just
get rid of that glass

00:00:54.484 --> 00:00:57.299
because my tires could pop.

00:00:57.299 --> 00:00:59.726
I could cut myself badly.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:01.778
Anything could happen.

00:01:01.778 --> 00:01:03.638
Alright, here we go. Oh!

00:01:03.638 --> 00:01:06.978
My head is still attached
somehow to my body.

00:01:06.978 --> 00:01:09.336
That's really gross.

00:01:09.336 --> 00:01:11.836
Jeez, they make these so hard.

00:01:13.634 --> 00:01:14.467
Let's try this one.

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:16.217
Awesome Ball Thrower.

00:01:17.112 --> 00:01:18.818
Well, there's nothing awesome about that

00:01:18.818 --> 00:01:21.517
(victorious trumpets play) Whoa!

00:01:21.517 --> 00:01:23.682
What kinda game is this?

00:01:23.682 --> 00:01:27.021
I thought I was just supposed
to toss a ball around.

00:01:27.021 --> 00:01:30.509
Instead it's like some
scene out of the movie Saw.

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.256
My goodness.

00:01:32.256 --> 00:01:33.089
Alright, here we go.

00:01:33.089 --> 00:01:33.922
This is nice.

00:01:33.922 --> 00:01:36.014
Oh, sorry sir, didn't mean to

00:01:36.014 --> 00:01:37.356
(explosion)
Oh!

00:01:37.356 --> 00:01:38.859
What just happened?

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:41.859
Is that some type of harpoon device?

00:01:43.016 --> 00:01:45.188
I don't know if I like that.

00:01:45.188 --> 00:01:46.814
Let's try Awesome Ride.

00:01:46.814 --> 00:01:47.668
That'll be fun.

00:01:47.668 --> 00:01:48.684
(victorious trumpets play)

00:01:48.684 --> 00:01:49.840
Whoa!

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:51.111
What kinda ride is that?

00:01:51.111 --> 00:01:53.361
It's certainly not awesome.

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:57.484
Should be called the Sudden Death Ride.

00:01:57.484 --> 00:01:58.538
Oh, what is?

00:01:58.538 --> 00:02:01.309
This is some new kind of
fangled future device.

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:02.970
(explosion)
What? Oh!

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:06.020
Well, maybe if I just get the hang of it.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.270
That was weird.

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:10.759
Alright, Awesome bike.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:11.917
Here we, whoa!

00:02:11.917 --> 00:02:15.261
I've never seen a
bicycle like this before.

00:02:15.261 --> 00:02:18.236
Hopefully I'll be able
to stay on it this time.

00:02:18.236 --> 00:02:19.944
Alright. Oh!

00:02:19.944 --> 00:02:21.747
(victorious trumpets play)
Oh!

00:02:21.747 --> 00:02:24.191
I won while at the same time losing

00:02:24.191 --> 00:02:27.068
because my torso was cut in half.

00:02:27.068 --> 00:02:31.741
Let's see if I can do this
and staying in one piece.

00:02:31.741 --> 00:02:33.589
Alright, come on. (crashing)

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:34.547
Whoa!

00:02:34.547 --> 00:02:37.949
Stay on the ball!
(victorious trumpets play)

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.157
Darn it. Once again I've died.

00:02:40.157 --> 00:02:41.824
Let's try a new one.

00:02:43.322 --> 00:02:45.255
Awesome win sounds cool.

00:02:45.255 --> 00:02:46.503
- [Booming Male Voice] All are dead!

00:02:46.503 --> 00:02:47.426
- [Gamer] Whoa!

00:02:47.426 --> 00:02:48.494
That's a lot of dead bodies.

00:02:48.494 --> 00:02:49.713
I don't even wanna play that.

00:02:49.713 --> 00:02:51.330
That does not sound good.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:53.413
Let's try something else.

00:02:55.902 --> 00:02:56.735
Oh, here we go.

00:02:56.735 --> 00:02:58.997
I look like someone who frequents Walmart.

00:02:58.997 --> 00:03:01.048
Okay. Here we go.

00:03:01.048 --> 00:03:04.329
She's probably on her way
to get some more insulin.

00:03:04.329 --> 00:03:06.169
I would imagine.

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:10.354
Wow, she would take first
prize at the County Faire

00:03:10.354 --> 00:03:12.923
if you catch my drift.
(laughs boisterously)

00:03:12.923 --> 00:03:13.973
No, I'm just kidding.

00:03:13.973 --> 00:03:15.819
Diabetes is a serious disease

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.624
and you should have regular diet and that.

00:03:18.624 --> 00:03:19.526
Is that Mayonnaise?

00:03:19.526 --> 00:03:20.678
Is she trying to get Mayonnaise?

00:03:20.678 --> 00:03:23.564
I don't know what the
object of this game is.

00:03:23.564 --> 00:03:26.527
Oh, all of her groceries are out now.

00:03:26.527 --> 00:03:28.730
Now, I'm in a freefall. Whoa!

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:30.487
Oh, and I died.

00:03:30.487 --> 00:03:33.280
Alright, come on! You can do it!

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.754
Come on Bertha.

00:03:34.754 --> 00:03:37.030
Alright, here we go.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.161
Yeah, she's chasing after that Coca-Cola.

00:03:41.161 --> 00:03:43.635
Alright, whoa, this is so weird.

00:03:43.635 --> 00:03:45.085
(victorious trumpets play)

00:03:45.085 --> 00:03:47.134
I made it, yay!

00:03:47.134 --> 00:03:49.551
And she's still in one piece.

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:53.101
I wonder if that's cuz she
has a lower center of gravity.

00:03:53.101 --> 00:03:53.934
Who knows?

00:03:54.906 --> 00:03:57.239
But, let's see how many. Oh!

00:03:58.456 --> 00:04:00.404
There goes her arm.

00:04:00.404 --> 00:04:01.237
So, I wonder though.

00:04:01.237 --> 00:04:04.140
I wonder if she lost a
limb because of the game

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:05.991
or because of her type two diabetes.

00:04:05.991 --> 00:04:07.709
I'm not sure.

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.038
But, did she win?

00:04:09.038 --> 00:04:10.217
No, her head's off.

00:04:10.217 --> 00:04:11.741
That's not a good look for her.

00:04:11.741 --> 00:04:14.272
(alternative rock music)

00:04:14.272 --> 00:04:16.939
Alright, let's try another game.

00:04:20.062 --> 00:04:21.312
Blade Rider II!

00:04:22.225 --> 00:04:23.597
With real A.I.!

00:04:23.597 --> 00:04:24.764
Alright. Whoa!

00:04:25.643 --> 00:04:27.476
A second ago she was.

00:04:27.476 --> 00:04:29.386
Wow, she has quite, whoa!

00:04:29.386 --> 00:04:31.955
Why is she hurting me with an ax?

00:04:31.955 --> 00:04:33.744
That wasn't nice.

00:04:33.744 --> 00:04:35.166
One minute she's grocery shopping

00:04:35.166 --> 00:04:37.494
and now she's an ax-wielding murderer?

00:04:37.494 --> 00:04:40.013
Whoa! Is those, those meat cleavers?

00:04:40.013 --> 00:04:41.302
What is going on?

00:04:41.302 --> 00:04:44.543
Why does everybody wanna kill me?

00:04:44.543 --> 00:04:47.986
Alright, now there's a
black man with a machete.

00:04:47.986 --> 00:04:49.754
Sir, please, I have no beef with you.

00:04:49.754 --> 00:04:51.754
Ow! Why did you stab me?

00:04:52.772 --> 00:04:54.468
And why are you able to fly

00:04:54.468 --> 00:04:58.042
as if you're Harry
Potter playing quidditch?

00:04:58.042 --> 00:05:00.430
What is going on? Oh!

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:04.658
He's completely impaled my
body and will not let it go.

00:05:04.658 --> 00:05:07.755
Sir, I think you've done as
much damage as you're gonna do.

00:05:07.755 --> 00:05:09.472
Please, let me go.

00:05:09.472 --> 00:05:12.935
Let go of me! Will you get off of me!

00:05:12.935 --> 00:05:15.915
I'm trying to complete the course.

00:05:15.915 --> 00:05:16.748
What are you doing?

00:05:16.748 --> 00:05:18.233
Oh, and then he drags me down

00:05:18.233 --> 00:05:19.581
into the Nether regions of Hell.

00:05:19.581 --> 00:05:21.951
That's very nice. Okay.

00:05:21.951 --> 00:05:24.034
Let's try Subway Rampage.

00:05:26.755 --> 00:05:27.922
Alright, okay,

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.287
apparently I'm a horrible train conductor

00:05:31.287 --> 00:05:32.120
who's busy texting.

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:32.953
(explosion and screams)

00:05:32.953 --> 00:05:34.238
Oh!

00:05:34.238 --> 00:05:36.145
You should get off your cell phone, sir.

00:05:36.145 --> 00:05:39.093
You are causing multiple fatalities.

00:05:39.093 --> 00:05:40.829
Wait, wait a sec.

00:05:40.829 --> 00:05:42.608
This cannot be based on reality,

00:05:42.608 --> 00:05:44.282
because there's no way a Metro train

00:05:44.282 --> 00:05:48.699
would be able to go through
an entire building like that.

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:49.981
Whoa!

00:05:49.981 --> 00:05:52.481
I just took out a gas station!

00:05:53.425 --> 00:05:55.136
Now, McDonalds?

00:05:55.136 --> 00:05:57.582
(victorious trumpets play)
Well, McDonalds will kill you.

00:05:57.582 --> 00:05:59.082
Oh, my. Did I win?

00:06:01.411 --> 00:06:03.982
You'd think you'd lose
killing that many people,

00:06:03.982 --> 00:06:04.916
but I guess not.

00:06:04.916 --> 00:06:08.147
Anyway, if you kids have liked
me playing all these strange,

00:06:08.147 --> 00:06:11.879
hyper-violent video games,
be sure and like this video.

00:06:11.879 --> 00:06:14.104
And if you haven't
subscribed to the channel,

00:06:14.104 --> 00:06:15.714
well, you probably should,

00:06:15.714 --> 00:06:18.334
because there's plenty
more where that came from.

00:06:18.334 --> 00:06:22.501
I'm Grandpa Lemon, and I'll
see you kids (cartoon snoring)

00:06:33.012 --> 00:06:37.179
(excited screaming and
talking over each other)
