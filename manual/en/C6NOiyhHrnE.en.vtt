00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.020
Hello my name is Jeff with BioRelief.com and
here to show you the UriTravel disposable

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.140
toilet.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.250
This comes in a three pack and as you can
see this is a very compact device.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:14.349
This is something that can be used in a car
boat or a plane, and it is small enough t

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:16.309
be stored in a glove box.

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.820
Tucked up underneath here is a collection
bag that can hold 1500 milliliters thats about

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:23.820
50 ounces.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.030
The nice thing about this is this is something
that can be continued to be reused until it

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.030
is full.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:31.490
Now this is nothing you want to continue to
reuse over a couple days, but over the course

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:33.760
of the day you can continue to reuse it until
it is full.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:39.760
It has a unisex adaptor on the top of it so
it can be used by men and women.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.190
This is the same manufacture that came up
with the Uriwell personal toilet that we also

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.190
offer.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.710
So what happens here is that once the crystals
are released that are contained in the cap

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.739
here by this button that you press to release
them it turns any liquid into an odorless

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.199
safe solid in about twenty seconds . So this
can be disposed of into any trash can.

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:05.810
It doesn’t really matter when you release
the crystals you can do it beforehand or after.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:10.270
Here I will show an example of pouring water
what we use at we use for this experiment

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:16.360
into the bag, and on the back side here it
does tell me how much I have in there.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.930
Now there about 450 milliliters . I’ll then
press the top shut, it is spill proof and

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.800
release the crystals by pressing the button.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:29.810
Now in the matter of about 20 seconds this
will turn into an odorless safe solid.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.049
Again until it is completely full you can
continue to reuse it.

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:36.510
Already this is becoming solid as it is.

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:44.830
You can take the top off and see where the
crystals were stored, and it’s already solid

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.830
in there.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.700
I can continue to add to this and it will
continue to turn into a solid until it is

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.939
full.

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.549
AS I mentioned this is safe to dispose of
in any trash can, dumpster or wherever this

00:01:58.549 --> 00:01:59.549
is waste.

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:03.500
It is something you want to have in your car,
your truck , boat or plane because you never

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.500
know when.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.700
Again with one snap shut it is odorless, and
it becomes a solid.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:14.670
So it is something that you can lay down without
worrying of anything spilling out.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.840
It is the UriTravel Personal Toilet and you
can find it at BioRelief.com.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:19.459
Thank you
