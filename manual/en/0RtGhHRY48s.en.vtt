How to Trim a Christmas Tree.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.270
Tired of having a sad little tree straight
out of A Charlie Brown Christmas?

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.210
This season, make yours look like a mini-version
of the one in Rockefeller Center.

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:22.860
You will need A tree skirt A Christmas tree
(real or fake) Lights Garland or tinsel Ornaments

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:28.000
A tree topper Popcorn and/or cranberry strings
(optional) (optional) (optional) and gingerbread

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.650
men (optional) (optional) (optional).

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.940
Step 1.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.469
Spread out a tree skirt.

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.230
Not only do presents look more festive under
the tree on a tree skirt, but it will catch

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.250
pine needles, making cleanup a breeze.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.520
Step 2.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.690
Plump up the branches.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.200
When a tree is packed for transport--or, if
it’s artificial, put in a box--the branches

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.130
and needles can get scrunched up.

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:51.020
Fluff them out by rubbing your hands against
the grain of the needles.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:55.760
If your tree is real, water it every day to
prevent it from drying out.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.970
The average Christmas tree can drink several
quarts of water in an hour.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:00.970
Step 3.

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:04.489
Test the lights by plugging them into an outlet
before you string them on the tree.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.360
You don’t want to have to take them off
again due to one bad bulb, and you want to

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.369
ensure that they’ll remain cool to the touch.

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.470
To make tree trimming more fun, use it as
an excuse for a party.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.470
Ask guests to bring a Christmas ornament.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:18.860
Step 4.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.750
String the lights by starting at the top and
winding them around the tree in a spiral until

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:23.890
you reach the bottom.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:29.960
To determine the ideal number of lights, multiply
the tree’s height and width (at its widest)

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.000
and then double it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.920
For instance, if the tree is 6 feet tall and
4 feet wide, 6 x 4 = 24 X 2 = 48, so you need

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.020
48 lights.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.210
Step 5.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.210
Put on the garland.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.710
Start in the back of the tree at the bottom
and work your way up and around.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.150
Step 6.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.049
Hang the ornaments, placing larger ones towards
the bottom of the tree and the heaviest ones

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:55.320
on the thickest branches.

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.430
A good yardstick is six ornaments for every
6” of height.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.430
Step 7.

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:03.630
Add the tree topper, usually a star or an
angel.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:09.860
Strings of popcorn or cranberry and homemade
gingerbread men add a personal touch.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.869
Step 8.

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.879
Stand back and make sure there are no bare
spots, and that the ornaments are evenly distributed.

00:02:14.879 --> 00:02:20.700
Did you know The idea of decorating trees
in December precedes the birth of Christ by

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.869
centuries; it was originally a pagan ritual
to celebrate the winter solstice.
