00:00:16.399 --> 00:00:19.880
Set number 71001

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.479
and is recommended for ages 5 and up.

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:23.570
So I'm taking it there is a mini-figure inside of 16, but we don't know exactly what mini-fig we're getting

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.720
So I'm taking it there is a mini-figure inside of 16, but we don't know exactly what mini-fig we're getting

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.989
So I'm taking it there is a mini-figure inside of 16, but we don't know exactly what mini-fig we're getting

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:32.920
until we open up the pack.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.920
Let's reveal the contents shall we.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.240
Okay,

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.800
I see some interesting pieces.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.470
Let's see what we got here.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.180
So we get to make one of sixteen of these.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.540
Let's see which one I'm going to make.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:09.810
I see all kinds of various parts and such.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.840
I see all kinds of various parts and such.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.840
I see all kinds of various parts and such.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.010
It would help if I put the cape on.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.400
It would help if I put the cape on.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:51.400
I'll just probably end up taking it off anyways.

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:25.039
Put him on his stand.

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:27.260
Well, we get the

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.839

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:33.019
Roman Commander!

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:34.799
I like the print work, it is reflective.

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:38.199
I like the print work, it is reflective.

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:41.829
I like the face expression.

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:45.469
Headgear.

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:46.779
Sward.

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:49.559
Dark red cape.

00:02:49.559 --> 00:02:52.239
Terrific mini-fig!

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.179
So this is

00:02:55.179 --> 00:03:02.179
