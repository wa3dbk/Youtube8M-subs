00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.640
Welcome to PingSkills lessons, we are doing
to talk about the basic serve today.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:12.370
Now this is one of the most important things
you must learn because every rally starts

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:13.480
with a serve.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.540
So it's really important to get this right.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:22.040
Now Alois is go through the very basics here
with you so take note and enjoy.

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.610
Thanks Jeff, the serve to start off with need
to be kept really simple.

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:36.350
To start off with all you need focus on is
to get them to be able to hit the ball with

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.350
a hit bounce on your side bounce on their
side.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:38.350
Hit, bounce, bounce.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:39.350
If you actually say those words to the kids
to start off with you will find they will

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.329
be able to pick that up a lot easier.

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:43.620
So it's hit, bounce, bounce.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.390
And it doesn't need any more complicated than
that.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:56.780
The things to really focus on are getting
kids to get the bat and ball nice and close

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.510
together, about that far apart so there isn't
much margin of error and then all their focusing

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.580
on is the hit.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.960
So it's just hit, bounce, bounce.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.950
And that's the basic serve.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.030
As I said don't make it any more complicated,
keep it as simple as possible.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.299
Okay once the player can do the hit, bounce,
bounce the next level to focus on is to make

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.200
sure that their hitting that ball from behind
the line of the table.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:33.147
One of the rules of serving so in a real game
you hit the ball from over the line it's the

00:01:33.147 --> 00:01:34.147
other persons point.

00:01:34.147 --> 00:01:37.170
So now we want to get the kids to focus on
being behind the line.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.200
So from here the next level is hit, bounce,
bounce behind the line.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.020
Hit, bounce, bounce.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.850
Hit, bounce, bounce.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:57.060
Again keeping it simple and just giving them
one simple level at a time to work on.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.183
So behind the line hit, bounce, bounce.

00:01:59.183 --> 00:02:04.299
The next level of serving is to get the players
to be able to hold the ball correctly and

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.819
also throw the ball up again another rule
of serving in table tennis.

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:14.938
So what we are going to focus on now is to
hold the ball on a tray, tray being their

00:02:14.938 --> 00:02:15.938
hand.

00:02:15.938 --> 00:02:18.590
The next thing is to get them throw the ball
up and hit the ball forward.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:27.640
So we are going to get them to practice throwing
the ball up and catching it to start of with

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.220
on a tray and then we can get them to throw
the ball up hit the ball forward.

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.700
Throw the ball up hit the ball forward.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.180
Throw the ball up hit the ball forward.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.099
You will find that with a lot of the players
to start of with their bat will go up as they

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:51.010
throw the ball up . Which leads to the ball
bouncing very high on the serve.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.010
So what you can do is just get them to focus
on their bat staying still while their right

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.069
hand or the ball hand goes up.

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.209
So up and forward.

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:05.519
That gets you a nice low serve over the net.

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.500
