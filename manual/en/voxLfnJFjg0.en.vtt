00:00:00.309 --> 00:00:03.330
This is part two of the Adirondack chair build.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.540
If you missed part one.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.950
You can click right over here.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.810
So far we have covered the arm rests, the
seat frames and the seat slats.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:14.380
Moving on I’m now going to cut the back
slats, the ones that will run vertically,

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.340
to rough length on the miter saw.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.369
I need 7 back slats.

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.880
I’m going to edge glue two 1x4 pieces together
and then rip these down to the width that

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:39.100
I want later.

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.870
While those are drying in the clamps I’ll
go back to the miter saw and cut two back

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.050
frame pieces.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:46.830
These will get a radius cut into them to accept
the back slats

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.990
Now a quick google search for “How to figure
the radius of an arc” will yield 7 million

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.220
760,000 thousand search results.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.800
Any number of those will provide a calculator
and do the dirty work for you.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.430
So I’ll mark the center of my board.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.040
Then measure two inches up from the center.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.729
From that cross point I’ll measure 20 and
one eighth inches perpendicular to the board.

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.299
Look at me using all these big words, I so
learneded.

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.970
In case you haven’t noticed, this doesn’t
have to be perfect or exact.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.830
In fact, you could hand draw this if you wanted
or break out an oversized compass and make

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:19.890
it perfect.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.999
Just for the sake of variety, I’m using
the band saw.

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:25.450
The jigsaw would be completely acceptable.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.890
Again with the obvious.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:39.869
I’m going to smooth out the band saw blade
marks at the drill press.

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.179
Those are done and I’ll set those aside
and go back to the miter saw and cut these

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:57.200
back legs.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.770
The front legs are next and I’ll switch
to the table saw miter gauge to cut them both

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.429
at the same time.

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:18.459
I’m going to make some tapered cuts in all
four legs.

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.959
No scientific measurements here, simply what
feels right.

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:42.299
Then connect those two marks and line the
boards up on the tapering jig.

00:02:42.299 --> 00:03:07.319
Same process for the back legs.

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.739
Remember those back slats in the clamps?

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:10.790
Those are dry.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.900
Lets take them out and rip them to width on
the table saw.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:21.129
I’ll get three back slats out of each of
the two glue ups about 2 and a quarter inches

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.129
wide.

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.709
I’ll rip that last one out of a 1x4 and
the off cut piece will be used later in the

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:27.709
project.

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:37.180
I have figured this all out to have very little
waste.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.049
I forgot to round over the edges of the arm
rests when I rounded over the edges of the

00:03:41.049 --> 00:03:51.560
seat slats, so I’ll do that now before I
start assembly.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:04:00.999
I have set up two stop blocks on the drill
press.

00:04:00.999 --> 00:04:05.939
Because these screws are so close to the edge
I think it’s imperative to predrill these

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:17.130
holes.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.400
One of the drills is set up with a countersink
bit and the other with the bit I will need

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:50.720
to drive the screws
Ahh, we are making good progress.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.389

Until then.
