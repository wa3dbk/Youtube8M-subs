00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:02.740
Welcome back to another cooking video, I’m
Chef Devaux and today I’m going to teach

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:05.319
you how to make a Tunado Roll.

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.750
Tunado is a clever combination of the words
Tuna-Unagi and Avocado and it was coined up

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:12.639
by someone on the Facebook page.

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.340
If you also want to help name a roll or sushi
roll or something I created in the future

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.150
then head over to the Facebook page and like
it so you can get updates.

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.599
You can do so right now by clicking on the
top left corner of your screen or in the description

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:25.599
below.

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:30.539
Now let’s move on and make this Tunado Roll
which is just an awesome creation, it’s

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.220
got delicious stuff inside like Unagi Tuna
and avocado.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:35.960
I mean what could go wrong?

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.600
It’s covered in delicious crunchy batter
of Tempura and fried to a crisp.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.150
Okay so let’s get cooking—let’s go!

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:51.190
You take an Unagi fish, this is roasted eel
and just cut it in half length wise.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.080
You get these like this, they’re frozen
and cooked like this in Japan and they’re

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:56.120
shipped around the world.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.070
I am just going to need half of it.

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.820
If you need more information about it click
on the link on the top left corner of your

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:03.820
screen.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:06.640
I’m going to begin slicing, the first cut
is just to get the right angle, and then you

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.530
continue cutting the sashimi slices of Unagi.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:17.429
Now you cut at a 45-degree angle to the board
and a 45-degree to the actual piece to get

00:01:17.429 --> 00:01:19.189
this angular cut like this.

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:25.039
It’s very difficult to cut because it’s
a very slippery slimy eel, but it’s so delicious

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:26.600
it’s amazing.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.670
Alright, so cut the entire Unagi piece or
whatever you need and put it in the fridge

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.729
until you need it.

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:35.540
Now I’m moving on to the roll.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.159
You take half a sheet of Nori and you place
a piece of tuna strip like this next to it

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.799
and just cut it to size.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:51.880
Then I’m going to put the strip onto my
Nori like this and now you take those Unagi

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.210
slices you cut before and you put them onto
your tuna piece.

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.670
I am just going to take one and a half, so
I’m going to take one and cut this in half

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:03.509
so I don’t have any waste.

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.720
I’m just going to put that there, and I’m
going to turn this around so I have the wider

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.110
edge against the end so it has uniform density
throughout the roll.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.480
You don’t want to have a lump in the middle
or anything like that.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.030
Okay now I’m going to take some Masago which
is season Capelin Fish Roe and just place

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.030
it across like this.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.810
If you want to know more about Masago click
on the link on the top left corner of your

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.060
screen right now.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:41.320
And I am just adding a slice of avocado, and
two slices of paprika or red bell pepper.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:47.170
Now to roll it, just bring it over and curl
it over the ingredients and tightly press

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:53.150
in with your fingers then continue to roll
forwards until you get close to the end.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.220
Once you get close to the end you take some
more of that Masago and just place it on the

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.120
end, it won’t completely seal it but it
will add some moisture and that will help

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.620
the Nori close together better.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.700
I’m just going to roll it and rest it over
that seal.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.170
While it’s resting I’m going to just cut
the edges off, because I don’t want the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:16.630
Tempura batter to get into a crevice then
have a big lump of uncooked Tempura batter.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:21.230
So I’m cutting the edges off the roll so
I have a flush surface all the way around

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:27.441
that the batter can just evenly cover and
there is no crevices for it to get in.

00:03:27.441 --> 00:03:29.370
Alright, so just put this to one side.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.180
Now to make the Tempura batter mix.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.060
First we’re going to do a liquid mix and
you’re going to put this into the fridge

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.950
and leave it overnight, so technically you
should do this a day before just to cool down.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:45.010
The first thing you add is 110-grams of water
or 110-milliliters and then you add 20-grams

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.080
of vodka.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.960
Now what the vodka does is it lowers the boiling
point of the mixture and it creates a bigger

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:53.290
reaction in the deep fryer.

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.220
That’s how you get more puffiness out of
it.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:03.530
Once you’ve added that you add 30-grams
of sake.

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:09.920
Sake is a sweet Japanese rice wine and it
also has a little bit of alcohol content which

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.440
also lowers the boiling point of the mixture.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:17.789
Once you’ve done that, you mix it all together
and you leave it in the fridge to cool down

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.159
overnight.

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:26.750
Now I’m going to take some Tempura batter
mix which I also left in the fridge to cool

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.680
down overnight and then I’m just going to
place it into a bowl.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:35.789
Now Tempura batter mix is very simple, it’s
just rice flour, flour, and baking powder,

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.990
but its just must easier to buy in a mix than
it is to make it yourself because you get

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.990
the same results.

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:46.580
I’m going to add the liquid into it, you
want to have a ratio of 100-grams of Tempura

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.539
batter mixed to 125-grams of liquid mix.

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:55.690
You want to softly mix it together, you don’t
want to get rid of all the clumps, you want

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.360
to have a couple clumps that will blow up
and do some interesting things in the deep

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:00.360
fryer.

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:04.430
If you want to get the same Tempura batter
mix then click on the top left corner of your

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.539
screen to get that.

00:05:06.539 --> 00:05:11.729
Once the batter is mixed up just like this,
now you take your roll and you place it in

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.199
and you get it nice and evenly covered.

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.180
Chopsticks are great for this because it doesn’t
get bogged down.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:23.979
Place it in a deep fryer at 190-Celsius and
cook it for 45 seconds to a minute.

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:29.569
You just want to get it so it’s nice and
crispy all the way around and just slightly

00:05:29.569 --> 00:05:30.680
warm on the inside.

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:36.830
I’m just going to pull it out, place it
on some paper towels and I suggest you move

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.840
over once in a while because moisture can
get in between the food and the paper towel

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.530
and make it a bit soggy, so keep it moving.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:59.370
Alright I’m going to cut off the edges just
for a nice presentation, and then I’m going

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:02.569
to cut this roll into three parts.

00:06:02.569 --> 00:06:11.154
There we go, put this to one side to plate
it up.

00:06:11.154 --> 00:06:19.630
I’m just going to do a very simple presentation
with some shredded Daikon, and then I’m

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:29.180
going to put the three pieces of Tunado roll
, followed by a little bit of pickled ginger,

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:34.270
and just like you would with your sushi dish
a little bit of wasabi, and maybe have a little

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.229
plate of soy just to dip it in.

00:06:37.229 --> 00:06:44.830
You know what would go great on this, some
teriyaki sauce, look at that beautiful teriyaki

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.130
sauce, that’s just amazing stuff.

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:50.360

00:06:53.639 --> 00:06:55.939
that amazing teriyaki.

00:06:55.939 --> 00:07:06.830
Okay, so I guess I will try it.

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:11.300
That’s just amazing, that’s all I have
to say about it.

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.820
It’s delicious, you have to give this a
try at home, you won’t be disappointed.

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:20.449
