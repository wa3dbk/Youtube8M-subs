Welcome everyone to AC News,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Let's see today's trailer cinema news is coming up!

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
The 10th of May the new brilliant production by Tim Burton comes out, Frankenweenie.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Burton goes back to his dark roots with an animation from one of his short-films of 1984,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
black and white and with strange design figures, all round and with eye rings.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
The plot is about a kid who loves very much his dog and

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
when this one dies he tries to bring him back to life, and succeeds.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Director Kathryn Bigelow and the screenwriter Mark Boal

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
have been very elusive about their new project, finally with the title Zero Dark Thirty,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
on the Navy SEAL Six operation to kill Bin Laden.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.000
At this time we know that shooting is taking place in India, reported in The Times Of India.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Probably security measures have obligated Bigelow to shoot in India instead of Pakistan.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
In the cast Jessica Chastain, Chris Pratt, Joel Edgerton, Jennifer Ehle and Fares Fares.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
That's all for today,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
