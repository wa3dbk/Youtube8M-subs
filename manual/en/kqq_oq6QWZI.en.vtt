[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.660
Hey, guys, my name
is Tim Schmoyer.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.190
And just like we
do every Thursday,

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:07.890
I'm going to take a question
from one of you guys

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.682
and do my best to answer
it to help you out

00:00:09.682 --> 00:00:11.140
with the audiences
and the channels

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:12.690
that you are growing
here on YouTube.

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.110
This question is from
ChristineDoesDrama on Twitter,

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.909
and she tweeted
me and asked this.

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:18.450
You probably get
this question a lot,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.630
but is it true that
you can use 30 seconds

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:23.180
of any song in
your YouTube video?

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:24.980
Christine, I know
that is a common thing

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:27.200
that a lot of people talk
and believe to be true.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.710
But it is absolutely
100% percent not true.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.640
Whoever tells you
that is clearly not

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.500
familiar with copyright law,
and you could definitely

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.220
get into trouble
even just for using

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.960
one second of a
copyrighted music

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.040
or sound effect or anything that
doesn't actually belong to you.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:44.539
However, instead
of just leaving you

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:46.240
hanging with that
big disappointment,

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.450
someone from the video
creators community here,

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.340
B. Chambers from the Alloy
Seven Video YouTube channel,

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.960
is here with us to tell you
how you can use copyrighted

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:00.592
content, whether it's music
or gaming footage or movie

00:01:00.592 --> 00:01:02.800
clips, whatever the case
may be, how you can actually

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.700
use those legally and be in the
clear on your YouTube channel.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:07.780
Here he is.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.160
Hey, what's up, fellow creators?

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.560
My name is B. Chambers
from Alloy Seven Video.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.170
And I'm mostly known for
doing gaming reviews, gaming

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.410
editorials, and also
tutorials for people

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:19.450
on how to run a gaming
channel here on YouTube.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.620
So the first step in
monetizing the videos

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.880
that you create that
use material that's

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:26.450
copyrighted by someone
else is very simply

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.690
to determine who the
copyright owner is.

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.570
And in the realm of
games, movies, and TV,

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:32.790
that's usually pretty easy.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.490
With games it's usually
the game's developer

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.490
or the game's publisher
that owns the copyright.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.540
When it's not, usually
a Google search

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.960
will figure that out for
you, or even Wikipedia.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.505
I've also done some
legwork on alloyseven.com.

00:01:44.505 --> 00:01:47.740
I'll have a link to the specific
page in the video description

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.690
that shows you all of
the copyright owners

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.030
that I reached out to and
what their answers were.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:54.530
When it comes to
movies and TV shows,

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.250
it's usually very easy
to determine that.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.190
Because the people that own
the movie or the TV show,

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.760
it's found on their website.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.367
When you step into
the realm of music,

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:03.950
it gets a little bit
more complicated.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.190
And this is actually
why I don't recommend

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.330
trying to use other
people's copyrighted

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:09.550
music in your videos.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.550
Let's say a bunch of artists
came together and made the song

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.650
that you're trying
to use in your video.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.670
Who owns the copyright?

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.844
Is it the record label?

00:02:16.844 --> 00:02:19.010
Both artists may come from
a different record label.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.500
Do the writers,
do the composers,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.050
do the people performing
the song own the rights?

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.692
A lot of times that's nigh
impossible to determine.

00:02:25.692 --> 00:02:27.150
And to take it a
step further, when

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.190
you start talking about content
ID matches, take for instance

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.240
the album that I put
out about two years ago.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.810
Even if I gave you written
permission today signed by me

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.920
that said you could use every
song on my album in your video,

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.290
I can guarantee you that
you would get a content ID

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.700
match from cdbaby.com.

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:46.470
That's who I went through
to publish and to distribute

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.190
my album.

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:49.064
You'd have permission
from me, but then you'd

00:02:49.064 --> 00:02:51.374
still have to deal with CD
Baby in your back end, which

00:02:51.374 --> 00:02:53.040
means you'd have to
get in touch with me

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.581
and then get me to
deal with CD Baby.

00:02:54.581 --> 00:02:55.370
It's a pain.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:57.230
So unless you're
just really brave

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.980
or for whatever reason
just can't get away

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:00.939
from using somebody's
music in your video,

00:03:00.939 --> 00:03:02.730
I'd recommend that you
just leave it alone.

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.640
OK, now that you've determined
who the copyright owner is,

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.230
the second step-- and I'll
admit that this second step is

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.697
more related to
gaming video creators

00:03:10.697 --> 00:03:12.280
than anyone else--
but the second step

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.000
is to go to the copyright
owner's website,

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.750
look to see if they have a
terms of use that gives you

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.680
permission to make and
monetize YouTube videos.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.620
A great example of
this is Microsoft

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.790
and Activision Blizzard.

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:25.642
Microsoft, in their
terms of use online,

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:27.975
gives you permission to make
videos using their content,

00:03:27.975 --> 00:03:29.890
as long as they're
not offensive,

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.880
but not to monetize the content.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.950
Activision Blizzard's
website, on the other hand,

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.950
gives you permission not
only to make the videos

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.060
but also to monetize them.

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.907
So if you're a gaming
video creator that's

00:03:38.907 --> 00:03:41.240
trying to do something with
an Activision Blizzard game,

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.090
your work's done.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:43.090
It's right there online.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.720
I actually have
links where you can

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.070
find that on the
alloyseven.com website.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.737
But look around.

00:03:48.737 --> 00:03:50.944
If you've found a game that
maybe isn't on my website

00:03:50.944 --> 00:03:52.550
that you want to
use, see if there's

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:55.390
a terms of use out there
that answers the mail.

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:58.180
OK, so you've determined
who your copyright owner is.

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:00.010
And in step two,
let's say you were not

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.160
able to find any terms
of use that give you

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.660
the permission you
were looking for.

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.510
Your third step in
that case is going

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.750
to be to find the best way to
contact the copyright owner.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.000
And this is usually going
to be through their website.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.499
They'll either have
an email address

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:13.665
to their PR or legal teams.

00:04:13.665 --> 00:04:15.290
That's the one you'll
want to look for.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.140
Or they'll have an
online form that you

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:20.079
can fill out and direct
to their legal or PR team.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.560
Or maybe it's just
a generic form

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.310
that you fill out
and send off to them.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.260
And that's usually what
happens in the gaming world.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.050
I've found that with
movies and TV shows,

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.070
say like Universal Studios--
if you go to Universal Studios,

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:33.150
they actually have a website
dedicated to people like us

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:36.225
who are trying to use their
footage for commercial means.

00:04:36.225 --> 00:04:38.270
And you'd sign up
on that website.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:40.470
You'd fill out the
necessary forms, get access.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.950
And it's almost like
an Amazon shopping

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:44.390
cart where you go
in and pick, I'd

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.125
like to get permission to
use Jaws footage in my video.

00:04:47.125 --> 00:04:48.175
And you'd check out.

00:04:48.175 --> 00:04:50.050
And that's where I start
talking about things

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.160
like it may cost money.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:53.160
I've not going all the
way through that process,

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.744
so I don't know if it
costs or how much it costs.

00:04:55.744 --> 00:04:57.910
But that's the way a lot
of the movie studios do it.

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:59.534
And once you have
all that knocked out,

00:04:59.534 --> 00:05:02.510
your next step is to actually
contact your copyright

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:05.736
owner via email, via the
online form, or via the a

00:05:05.736 --> 00:05:08.780
la carte shopping line
on universalstudios.com,

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.600
and tell them that you'd like
to use footage in your videos

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:14.240
to put on YouTube
and potentially

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.320
to monetize that video using
YouTube's partner program.

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:21.280
I will have a link where you can
find the email that I actually

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.090
use to reach out to
copyright owners.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.800
It's been very successful
over the course of time

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.870
that I've been using it.

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.740
And you can take that email, and
you can slice it and dice it.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:32.750
Do whatever you
need to do with it

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.610
to make it appropriate
to the person

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:36.720
that you're requesting
a copyright from.

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:39.050
OK, brief side note,
understand that most

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:41.230
of what I've been talking
about here thus far

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:44.180
centers around asking
copyright owners for permission

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.520
to use their
materials via email.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:49.260
Understand that YouTube's
automated system will not

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:51.950
accept an email as
proof of permission

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:55.540
should you get a content ID
match or a copyright strike.

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:57.500
So here's what I suggest you do.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.430
When you request permission
from the copyright owners,

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:02.510
ask them to do
one of two things.

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.920
One, to post the permission
on their websites.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.870
Get them to put something
in a public space

00:06:07.870 --> 00:06:10.120
that YouTube's system
can go out and search

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.020
and say, Roger that, good to go.

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:17.010
Or ask them to send you actual
signed documentation via email.

00:06:17.010 --> 00:06:20.090
Having not gone through the
process with movie production

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.580
companies, I'm going to assume
that a la carte shopping

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:25.820
line that I was telling
you about probably

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:28.007
doles out some type
of documentation.

00:06:28.007 --> 00:06:30.590
For those of you out there who
have been through that process,

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:32.910
be sure to leave us some
commentary in the comments

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.030
section confirming
or denying that.

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.820
OK, and the fifth and
final step is follow up.

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:40.250
I think a lot of you are
going to be surprised

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.610
by just how responsive
some of these companies

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.790
that you reach out to are.

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:44.530
I know I was.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.930
Getting emails from
people at Square Enix

00:06:46.930 --> 00:06:50.670
and a lot of the big name
game producing companies out

00:06:50.670 --> 00:06:51.796
there was a surprise to me.

00:06:51.796 --> 00:06:54.295
But every once in awhile, you're
going to run into a company

00:06:54.295 --> 00:06:56.235
where they either don't
get right back to you,

00:06:56.235 --> 00:06:57.810
or they'll get back
to you and say, hey,

00:06:57.810 --> 00:06:58.620
we need more information.

00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:00.286
And when you give
them that information,

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:01.640
they may not get back to you.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.840
So the next thing to
do is just simple,

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.850
good old-fashioned follow up
via email or via the online form

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.272
that they have available to you.

00:07:09.272 --> 00:07:10.730
And that's pretty
much it, friends.

00:07:10.730 --> 00:07:13.270
That's how I usually
walk people through how

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.630
to monetize their channels.

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:17.027
Again, I mostly focus
on the gaming world.

00:07:17.027 --> 00:07:19.360
If any of you guys out there
have questions specifically

00:07:19.360 --> 00:07:22.030
about gaming or any of the other
stuff that I've talked about

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:23.730
today, feel free to hit me up.

00:07:23.730 --> 00:07:26.470
I want to thank Tim Schmoyer
for giving me the opportunity

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:29.320
to come here to the
video creators community

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:30.730
and give you this information.

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:34.340
I pray that you find it oh
so useful in your endeavors

00:07:34.340 --> 00:07:34.840
out there.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:38.210
But I'd like, before I let you
go, to ask you all a question.

00:07:38.210 --> 00:07:42.300
Are any of you out there having
success getting permission

00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:45.010
from copyright owners and
monetizing your channels

00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:48.170
using methods different
from what I've shown here?

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:50.220
If so, I would very
much appreciate it

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.070
if you would write in the
comments section the steps

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:56.790
that you've used to reach
this conclusion successfully.

00:07:56.790 --> 00:07:59.580
Hopefully we'll see you guys
on the next Alloy Seven video

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:02.310
and especially on the
next video creators show.

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:04.200
Until then, until
[INAUDIBLE], this

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.250
is BC from A7 Video signing off.

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.850
Peace and godspeed.
