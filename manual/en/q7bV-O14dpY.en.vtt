00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.550
Hey, check it out.  
XFX is jumping into 

00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:03.660
the PSU market place. 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.330
And they're doing 
it with a bang. 

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.630
Stay tuned because 
I'm going to tell you 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.630
all about this new 850 Watt, 
black edition PSU from XFX.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:10.700
Stay tuned. 

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:27.510
Alright. So, you're looking at the 
XFX XPS 850W BER PSU.

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:28.710
I don't know why they 
give it such a long name,

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.510
but that's what it is. 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.530
It's a black edition. 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:32.060
It's their first PSU 
to come to market. 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.990
And let me tell you, 
it's incredible. 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.220
I've been reading independent reviews 
from a bunch of different people

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.610
and everyone says 
the same thing. 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.790
Absolutely incredible. 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.390
So, let's get right into it. 
I just want you guys to know, 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.220
XFX have obviously been 
making motherboards, 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.430
and video graphics cards. 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.660
And they recently got 
into ATI graphics cards 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.050
and now they're doing 
power supplies. 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.940
So they are expanding. 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.010
But that doesn't mean 
they're trying to 

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.180
produce whatever they can 
and put their name on it.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.930
This is an extremely high 
quality product. 

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.670
It's got some impressive specs. 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.110
And even more, the independent 
tests that I was reading

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.170
all through the roof reviews.
They're very, very happy. 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.900
So, real quick, it's called the 
XPS 850W BES Black Edition. 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:12.120
So, it's a really 
weird name. 

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.530
They could have just 
called it, the 850 Black. 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.830
Or something.  
Or the... whatever. 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.450
Anything except for, 
eight, nine digits. 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.560
I  mean, come on. 
Really? 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.560
850 Watt. 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.630
It is 80 PLUS Silver Certified. 
Let's see. 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.580
Where does it say that?
BAM! Right there. 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.920
PLUS Silver and it's not 
just barely scraping by

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.110
it's actually doing a really 
good job at getting there.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:35.940
It's going to above 
89 percent efficiency

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.140
at 50 percent load. 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.230
And it's staying very, very 
close to the high 80s.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.340
As a matter of fact, 
86 percent at a fifth load.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.600
And 86 percent at 100 percent load, 
which is where they test.

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:50.420
They test at fifth, 
half, and full load. 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.240
That's how they test 
for Silver Certification.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.320
And they passed by a 
percentage point ahead. 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.510
Which is, usually they 
pass by a smidgen. 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.400
These guys are killing it. 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.990
Very efficient. 
Single Rail design. 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.220
Seventy amps on that rail, 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:04.920
so it's going to power just about any 
SLI or Crossfire set up you want. 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.380
It is modular. 
It's not fully modular. 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.260
You do have a pretty thick 
ponytail right here. 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.460
And while we're here, might as well 
show you what you get with it.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.270
So here's your main ponytail. 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:16.890
This is what's not going to 
be modular, obviously.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.890
And you're going to be getting a 
24 Pin motherboard connector,

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:22.840
with a breakaway four 
to make it a 20. 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.400
You have a PCI Express. 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.210
This is a six plus two. 
So it can either be 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.320
a six or an eight pin. 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:31.850
OK, I'll move that over. 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:36.540
This is your EPS 12 Volt,  
8 Pin, right there. 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.970
And, in case you don't have 
an eight pin motherboard, 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.090
you get the four and 
four, to make two. 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.690
So that's a little bit odd, 
in their selection of 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:46.900
giving you two EPS.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.200
They could have given you 
one that breaks in half. 

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:50.060
But, whatever, 
still all good. 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.940
And then finally, 
your second PCI E.

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:54.420
Which is a six and breaks 
up into two. 

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:56.230
That means you can run just 
about any video card,

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.600
modern video card, 
right out of the box, 

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.780
with two six pins or two eight 
pins, up to two eight pins, 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.710
just with what comes 
off of this main ponytail.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.650
You'll also notice that 
all in here, 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.050
these are all your 
modular ports. 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:11.350
Now, this is a single rail design. 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.480
So it doesn't really matter 
where you plug in, what.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.100
It's all getting its power from the 
same place, from that single rail.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.640
So that's really, really good. 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:20.450
Also, unfortunately  
you can't see it. 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.730
But, if you were to look 
in here, you would see

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:24.540
that this is loaded 
with good stuff. 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.970
You have solid polymer capacitors in 
there, they're going to  last forever. 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:30.900
You have a DC to DC 
voltage regulator. 

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.640
So that's going to regular your 
voltage before it gets transformed. 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.930
You have a lot of incredibly 
good hardware. 

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.860
It's very efficient. 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:41.760
It's also got incredible voltage 
regulation, between one percent.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:44.140
Around one percent 
voltage regulation.

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.640
So if you hook up to a oscilloscope, 
it's going to give you 

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:48.460
about one percent 
variation in voltage. 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.840
It's going to give you a graph that's 
going to be like a straight line.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.770
Now, I got some really good 
benchmarks, or reviews

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:56.310
from jonnyguru.com. 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:58.570
So if you want to check 
out actual charts 

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.600
that is where you're going 
to go as far as that goes. 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:04.380
So voltage regulation is 
very good on this board. 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.540
And of course, efficiency is good 
because it is Silver Certified. 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:10.000
So that's all very, 
very good news. 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.420
That's the important kind of stuff
that you want for gaming rigs. 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.360
That's the important stuff you, kind 
of, want for overclocking set ups. 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.500
You want to have clean 
power making its way. 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:20.320
Now, as far as the 
modular stuff goes, 

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.050
you've got quite a bit 
of modular cables. 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.230
And I will go ahead 
and tell you that, A, 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.650
you get a really cool 
Play Hard, XFX bag 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.780
to hold the leftovers that 
you're not going to use.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:32.110
And that everything 
is very nicely sleeved. 

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:34.290
And it looks really, 
really good. 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:36.750
So, you have lots 
of good stuff. 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.750
You have 11 Molex 
connectors in total. 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.120
Some of them are 
different from others. 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.470
Like, here's three in one. 

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:43.860
So if you've got three hard 
drives, you can use this one. 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.650
This one, on the other hand, 
only has two Molex connectors

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:49.020
per PSU mount connector.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:51.380
So, pretty much, if you 
only have two hard drives

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:52.590
you can bring out the 
one that has two. 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.720
If you have three or four, you can 
bring out the ones that have four.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.260
You're going to get 11 
in total though. 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:58.020
That's more than enough 
for most hard drives. 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:00.110
Also on here you have 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.660
eight Molex connectors in total. 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.250
So here are your Molexes. 

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.360
This one happens to have 
three Molex connectors.

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:09.350
But you're going to 
get eight in total. 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.970
Also, 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:14.320
here are your graphics cards. 

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.360
Let's see, where are 
your graphics cards. 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:18.920
Too many cables... 
Oh, here they are! 

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:20.770
Oh no, those are the main ones...
Here we go!

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:21.940
Graphics cards. 

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:26.210
So, PCI Express, again these are 
six with a breakaway to two.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.530
This is a straight up eight that 
goes into the back of the PSU.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:30.890
And on the other end, 
you have a six plus two 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:32.060
to give you a total of eight. 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:35.080
And if you want to use these, 
you have two of these extra.

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:36.890
So remember, you have 
two already over here 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.960
and you get two more. 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.940
And it's going to let you do Crossfire 
and SLI with no problem. 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:44.830
And also, while we're here, 
somewhere in here 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:48.360
is two floppy disc drive cables.

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.570
And I don't know... 
Oh, here they are!

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:52.080
Here we go, the most 
useless cable ever. 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:53.980
But, it's here in 
case you want it. 

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:56.620
So if you have a floppy array, 
and you're using some

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.670
big floppies, you can 
definitely do that. 

00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:02.900
Now, I also want to mention, kind of, 
the design of this thing is really cool. 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.620
135 mm fan. 
 

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:07.810
Very, very quiet 135 mm 
fan, I might add. 

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.650
It is ball bearing. 

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.050
You're barely ever 
going to hear it. 

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.140
It is kind of bright looking, 
with that yellow. 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.530
But, it still looks kind of cool 
and, very, very quiet. 

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.310
No matter how hot it gets, it's 
going to stay very, very quiet. 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:22.260
Again, it's not going to go up, 
even if you heat up the room. 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.700
From the reviews I've read, 
it's just consistently silent. 

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:26.950
Very, very quiet.  

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.440
So, I mean, it's very quiet. 

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.020
It's got excellent voltage regulation.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.730
It's got awesome efficiency. 

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:34.710
Everything is really, really good 
on this power supply. 

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.680
You're getting 70 Amps 
on the 12 Volt rail. 

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.090
If you want to zoom in over here so 
you can see what you're getting. 

00:06:40.290 --> 00:06:45.950
3.3 Volt and 5 Volt voltage regulation 
is excellent within one percent.

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:47.670
So is the +12, it's 
just slightly over. 

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.240
840 Watts on the 12 Volts. 
70 Amps. 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.890
Basically, all the good 
video cards right now.

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:55.610
You can do two GTX 285s. 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.490
You can do anything you want, 
it's all going to work on here. 

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:02.620
So, I'm very, very pleased 
to say that XFX 

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.400
brought a really nice 
PSU to market. 

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.960
This is their first time 
with a new product. 

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:11.350
They had a lot of stuff to worry about,
marketing and making it work right. 

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:13.350
But they didn't just come out 
with a product that works

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:14.790
or barely works in SLI. 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:17.620
This is an enthusiast 
grade product. 

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:18.920
It's up there with 
PC Power and Cooling 

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:20.120
and with Corsair. 

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:22.120
It's definitely top notch stuff. 

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:23.330
It's not anywhere in the middle. 

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:24.820
This is just really high end stuff. 

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.230
As far as looks go, some 
people might not like it. 

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:28.390
I think it's pretty cool. 

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:30.440
And it is Black Edition, 
so that's pretty cool. 

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:31.550
So I think it's a great product. 

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:34.150
