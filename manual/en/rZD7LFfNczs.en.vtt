00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.350
LG’s New Wacky AKA Smartphones Come with
Personality and Googly Eyes

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.230
Over the next few years LG plans to unveil
devices that can bend, fold and roll-up, but

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.580
in the meantime the company has something
else to show us.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:21.080
LG launched AKA on Tuesday, revealing a set
of mid-range phones with built-in cartoonish

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.080
personalities.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.020
LG calls its new device the world’s first
“character” in a smartphone.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:33.390
To be specific, there are four characters,
each tied to a color: Eggy (yellow), Wooky

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.700
(white), Soul (Blue) and YoYo (pink).

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.239
Switching your phone’s personality is as
easy as swapping out the back cover, thanks

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.230
to a chip embedded in each rear panel.

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:51.100
The new phones also come with a set of sliding
cases, which leave the top quarter of the

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.100
display uncovered.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.489
That’s where you’ll see those googly eyes
show up, giving your phone a bit of personality

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.469
even when it’s idle.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.670
Shake the device and its eyes will tear up.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.020
Plug in headphones and your phone will do
the same.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:11.450
Of course, that space also shows incoming
notifications, so it serves a real purpose

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.070
as well.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:20.030
When it comes to hardware, the AKA is decidedly
less impressive, sporting a 5-inch HD IPS

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:29.299
display, an 8-megapixel rear camera, a 2.1-megapixel
front-facing camera, a 1.2GHz quad-core processor,

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:39.890
a removable 2,610mAh battery, 1.5GB of RAM,
16GB of storage with microSD support and NFC.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.500
It runs Android 4.4 KitKat with a heavy dose
of LG software on top.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:53.710
For now AKA is limited to South Korea, where
you can buy one for 500,000 won (roughly $456).

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:59.229
It’s possible these new smartphones will
hit the U.S. and other markets eventually,

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.869
but until then check out LG’s bizarre promotional
video below for more info.
