00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:05.440
Hi.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:06.440
I'm Edward Hayes.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.920
I'm a hairstylist at Andrew Jose Hair salon
in London.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.080
This is how to use hair rollers.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.880
Basically, there's certain amount of features
that have to be taken into account.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.770
The size of the hair rollers you're using,
for one is a major, because the size of the

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:27.180
rollers you use is dependent on how tight
the curl you want.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.170
And also another thing you have to take into
account is the clips that you may have to

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.470
use to hold them in the hair.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.909
Another thing is the product that you're going
to be using.

00:00:36.909 --> 00:00:39.890
I'm going to be using the JLife Booster.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:42.280
That's going to give me a bit of hold.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:46.730
So, I'm just going to apply this now and I'll
show you how to apply the rollers in the hair.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.379
So bear it in mind when you use this size
roller, that's the size of the section you

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:52.379
take.

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.390
So you need to pull on it.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.890
Get a lot of tension.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.570
Run the velcro roller up to the tips.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.970
As you get there just bend -- hold the top
-- bend it outwards and roll the roller in.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.730
As you do so, try and generally stay simple.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.180
And you hold it.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.330
Now this is where you don't have to use the
hairpin but it's better just to give it a

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.550
bit more hold so the rollers don't fall off
your head.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:30.170
Okay, and just roll it up the hair so you're
smoothing it up.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:38.030
So the tips, bend the tips in.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.710
Try and be as smooth with the way you're rolling
the hair as possible and just try and be really

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:44.710
tight.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.241
The tighter you get it, the more volume you're
going to get also at the root.

00:01:48.241 --> 00:01:53.890
I would actually say after using the booster,
I would be putting a bit of hairspray.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.210
I'm actually going to put this under a hood
dryer.

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.440
But you, yourself, you can just walk around
your house with this on your head for about

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.220
twenty minutes, just letting it to set and
cooling the hair.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.480
Okay, if you don't have a heater at home,
you can just use a hair dryer, focusing on

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.340
each section for around a minute with the
hot heat and then reversing it to the cold

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.340
heat after.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.390
Or if not, just walk around with the rollers
in your hair for twenty to twenty-five minutes.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.390
Try and be very careful when you're removing
the net from the hair, the reason being it

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:28.260
grips onto the hair.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.260
You don't actually have to use a net.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.270
It's just nice if you have one at home.

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:32.569
You can even use a bandana.

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.400
It's a very soft hair set with the velcro
rollers, as you can see.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:43.720
Just a very subtle curl but a lot of height,
a lot more fuller, thicker hair.
