00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.000
Lovely lady on the bus

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
ooh, baby

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Lovely lady on the bus

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
ooh, baby

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
The doors are opening

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I'm quickly getting on

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Instantly I'm surrounded

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
by that very special bus odor

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.000
I stamp my ticket

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.500
and sense without looking up

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.000
you're seated right there in the third row

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.500
Already 17 weeks

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
- I've counted them -

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
you're part of my morning routine

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
And sometimes I think

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
â€žWhy all this agony?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Just say it to her face!"

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.000
Lovely lady on the bus

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
ooh, baby

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Life without you is just a pain

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Lovely lady on the bus

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
ooh, baby

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Give me just one sign and I'm yours

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Always immersed in reading

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.000
that's how you spend your journey

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.800
I hope in vain

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:09.000
you catch my eye

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
You just give me the cold shoulder

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.500
but I still catch fire

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.000
because you are racy, twenty and fancy

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.000
Your stop is getting closer

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.000
I know time is running out

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
You part, and leave me stunned

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Until the next stop,

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.000
because there's a goddess waiting there

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:49.000
she comes and buys her lucky ticket

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Lovely lady on the bus

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:56.000
ooh, baby

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
Life without you is just a pain

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
Lovely lady on the bus

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.000
ooh, baby

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Give me just one sign and I'm yours

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Lovely ladies on the bus, yeah

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000

Lovely ladies on the bus, yeah

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.500
LOVELY LADIES ON THE BUS!

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.000
ooh, babies

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000
life without you'd be just a pain

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:03.000
Lovely ladies on the bus

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000
