00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.300
So when we first found
out that we were

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.090
pregnant, we were excited.

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:09.960
We just couldn't wait to find
out if we're having a boy or

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.900
girl, or to plan on a nursery
and all that stuff.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.580
Heather Fiore was born
with a heart defect.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.380
As a precaution, when she was
pregnant, her doctors

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.660
requested a level
two ultrasound.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.940
We went, not expecting
to find out anything.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.240
She just wanted to make sure
everything was OK.

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.520
The baby, I was assuming, going
to be perfectly healthy,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.100
have a low chance
to have a heart

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:33.780
condition similar to Heather's.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.180
The radiologist at first didn't
quite know what she was

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.230
looking at, and that's what they
called in Dr. Wright to

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.640
come and confirm
the diagnosis.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.220
Ethan had truncus arteriosus
with an

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:46.470
interrupted aortic arch.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.860
 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.670
Ethan required surgery almost
immediately after he was born.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.080
Thankfully, for babies with
similar heart conditions to

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.450
Ethan's, Sutter Children's
Center Sacramento provides

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.840
lifesaving treatments with a
family-centered approach.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.300
Without a doubt, hearing that
your child has a congenital

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.180
heart defect is devastating
to a family.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.390
Much of my job is not just
taking care of the child, but

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.060
also taking care of the parents
as best I can as well.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.350
We have an amazing heart team.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.810
Never really wanted to meet
them, but so blessed

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:29.660
that we have them.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.110
We can call Dr. Wright any time,
Nicole, Dr. Nasirov.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.620
We have their direct numbers.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.680
They're just an amazing group.

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.250
We truly have a family of
providers here at our program,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.260
and the family even begins when
families come to visit

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:49.200
the hospital in advance of their
child's surgical care.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.360
We have a wonderful Child Life
Program that guides the family

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.600
through the steps of what their
child will go through,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.080
but also, I think, very
tenderly prepare the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.390
children for that.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.950
In addition, I think the nurses,
the special physicians

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.716
that we have surround these
children and their families

00:02:05.716 --> 00:02:08.120
with world class care.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.630
I think in addition to this
excellent family of providers,

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.170
the statistics that our program
puts forward are

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.570
exceptional as well.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.010
The outcome of our surgeries,
and Dr. Nasirov's and our

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.130
team's hand are among the
top in the nation.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.750
Our statistics, in terms of
length of stay in the hospital

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.760
following surgery, far exceeds
the national norm.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.890
Our rate of infection is
incredibly low, and I really

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:39.450
credit that to, again,
the team approach

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.920
that our program provides.

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.820
Today, 10-years-old and three
surgeries later, Ethan is

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.840
leading a healthy
and active life.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.900
For fun, I like to roller skate,
skateboard, ride my

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:56.640
bike and scooter.

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.870
Watching him now, after the
multiple surgeries that he's

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.430
been through, I don't think
anyone would ever know that he

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.760
even has a heart condition.

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.530
He's so active and aware,
and he enjoys life.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.690
Don't give up.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.770
Stay strong.

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:11.740
He made it.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.380
He did it.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.060
It was a long fight,
but we did it.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:18.700
of the greatest rewards that
I have in the privilege of

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.830
taking care of these children is
truly the relationship that

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.000
we develop, both with the
child and the family.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.322
And the greatest reward
is seeing them

00:03:28.322 --> 00:03:29.572
continue to do well.

00:03:29.572 --> 00:03:32.130
 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:34.600
That is probably one of the
richest rewards of my job.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:44.630
