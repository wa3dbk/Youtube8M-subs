Hey dudes and dudettes.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:03.820
I'm Hilah and you're watching Hilah Cooking.

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.330
Today
I'm going to show you how to make a frittata

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:08.460
which is kind of like an
omelet but flat and filled with more vegetables

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.499
and very, very delicious.

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:14.259
Have you ever noticed how pinata rhymes with
frittata even though they're

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.860
two different languages but they are kind
of the same thing because with a

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.170
pinata you have paper mache and with a frittata
you have eggs?

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:22.439
And instead
of candy inside it you have vegetables inside

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.439
it.

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:25.820
So it's like a pinata
filled with vegetables and eggs.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:26.820
Let's get too it.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:28.859
All righty might dogs.

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.430
I'm going to do today some zucchini and mushrooms.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:35.860
You can do whatever you want but kind of the
deal is you want to have an

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.610
equal volume of eggs to vegetables.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.340
And that's kind of how it differs from
an omelet.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:43.320
And if you want to learn how to make an omelet
I made a video on

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.530
that too.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.640
Okay, so first things . . . That cracked stupid.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.109
I'm going to beat these
eggs together.

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.460
And you can do, I'm going to do four because
it's only going

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.469
to be two of us eating this lovely thing.

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.520
But you could do up to six eggs
at once if you're feeding a crowd.

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.680
Okay.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.440
And wow, I've got really messy hands.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.900
So, I'll beat these up and I've got
some parmesan cheese and some fresh parsley.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.630
You could use dill or cilantro
or whatever you have around but I'm going

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.060
to mix those in to the eggs too.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.570
And a little pepper.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.130
And a little salt.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.490
Okay, we are ready to cook.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.790
So,
we've got our pan heating up here and about

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.930
a tablespoon and a half of
butter, if it'll ever get the hell.

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.650
Okay, swirl this around.

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:47.650
Butter
fingers.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:02:01.210
Okay, and I'll add our vegetables.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:06.850
And maybe saute these for about
five minutes until they get a little bit softened.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:07.870
Whatever.

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:16.349
I can do that with these because they're about
the same density I guess.

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:19.370
But if you were doing onions, probably want
to put the onions in before the

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.709
softer things.

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:23.700
Or you could even do broccoli but again put
that in before

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:26.319
you put in something like mushrooms because
it's softer.

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:29.870
Or greens, you
could also use some spinach or some chard.

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.280
Whatever, that's the beauty of
it.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.359
Okay, so these are all getting really soft
and nice.

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:41.239
I'm going to turn the
heat down to low and take this time to spread

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:48.819
it out all evenly so that in
our finished thing you know, it's pretty even.

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.629
Okay, mix up our little
eggies again a little bit.

00:02:54.629 --> 00:03:02.950
And then pour that just, just right on top
like

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.730
that and if you've got any uneven spots, which
I don't because I'm perfect,

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.379
just kind of roll your skillet around to smooth
it out.

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:12.379
Okay.

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.489
Any little weird guys popping up.

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.239
Okay.

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:22.069
Now at the very beginning you want
to, you know you can do this a little bit

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:25.139
to get that runny egg under
there.

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:30.351
But after like the first I don't know 60 seconds
or so, you kind of

00:03:30.351 --> 00:03:31.939
want to just leave it alone.

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:37.510
All right so this is getting pretty well set
around the edges and even the top is pretty

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.510
good.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:40.520
I'm going to turn my broiler on because that's
how we're going to finish

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:44.299
it, and just let this sit over low heat for
a few minutes while the broiler

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:45.861
preheats, and then we'll finish cooking it.

00:03:45.861 --> 00:03:48.410
And then we'll eat the shit out
of it.

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:53.810
All right let's set that under the broiler
for a couple of minutes.

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.010
See you
later.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.220
All right, perfecto.

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:02.569
Okay, so you don't really want to leave it
in

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.840
there until it's brown or anything.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:07.769
Just until it's cooked and puffed
unless you like crusty egg stuff.

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.829
So first we'll kind of make sure it's
loose around the edges and then we'll cut

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:16.350
a wedge.

00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:22.640
Oh man, I love that.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:28.340
Oh dude, I'm going to eat this whole thing
real fast.

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.670
Okay, well that's how you make a frittata.

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:31.800
I hope you try it.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.512
It's also one
of the recipes that I put in my Learn to Cook

00:04:34.512 --> 00:04:36.870
Book because it is something
that's really easy to make.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.420
If you're intimidated by omelets, start out
with this.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.030
You really shouldn't be intimidated by omelets
but whatever it's

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:45.930
your deal.

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:56.730
Okay, thanks for watching.

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:02.120
Frittata, pinata.

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.820
Okay.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:15.620
See you later, bye.
