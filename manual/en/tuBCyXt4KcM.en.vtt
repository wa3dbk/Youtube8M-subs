00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:04.700
Hi I'm Kelly with Expert Village. I am going
to show you some tricks and techniques when

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.309
cantering and loping my horse. The next thing
I am going to show you is some techniques

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:13.440
that you can use when you are steering your
horse at the canter. Let me move her up into

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.689
a canter. Now when your steering, of course
you want to look where you want to go, so

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.310
your just going to open your inside rein a
little bit, back toward your hip, look where

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:34.930
you want to go, keep using outside leg. Again,
you will just keep using your outside hand

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.950
 , look where you want to go, keep our shoulders
nice and square, you're keep applying outside

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:45.700
leg pressure, keep her forward momentum going,
keep your head up, keep on looking in the

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.251
direction you want to go, keep your shoulders
square. Now if I want to change direction,

00:00:52.251 --> 00:01:04.250
I'm going to the other way, ask her for the
opposite lead, so again, I'm steering her

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.380
to the right, so I am opening up my right
rein, looking where I want to go, applying

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:22.180
outside leg pressure, keeping my head up looking
in the direction I'm going,

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:39.810
go back to the left, and
back to the right, she is doing a little bit

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:51.690
of a flying lead change which is when your
horse will change their lead. So we are just

00:01:51.690 --> 00:02:01.930
doing simple changes with her, so this is
a really easy way to get your horse more balanced,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:15.090
teach your horse how to steer and teach your
horse how to pick up the right lead. Whoa.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:26.560
So that's how you want to steer your horse
at the canter.
