00:00:05.565 --> 00:00:12.752
History is a knowledge of the past based on testimony; written testimony, oral testimony, and physical testimony.  

00:00:13.052 --> 00:00:16.271
This is how we know anything happened historically.  

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:27.266
For example: in 1927 did Charles Lindberg cross the Atlantic in a solo flight? You weren’t there, so how do you know that happened?  Testimony.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:32.737
In 1945 was the first atomic bomb dropped on Hiroshima?  

00:00:33.263 --> 00:00:39.969
We know that through physical testimony, oral testimony and exhibits, photographs, everything of the event.

00:00:40.463 --> 00:00:41.230
Another one. 

00:00:41.935 --> 00:00:46.289
In 1969, did Neil Armstrong walk on the moon?

00:00:46.928 --> 00:00:51.640
The only way you can know there is to examine the testimony; the evidence.

00:00:51.906 --> 00:00:54.147
Was Jesus Christ raised from the dead?

00:00:54.616 --> 00:00:57.963
You must examine that historically through testimony.

00:00:58.508 --> 00:01:07.289
On September 11, 2001, did some radical terrorists fly planes into the Twin Towers and destroy them?

00:01:07.898 --> 00:01:12.931
Now you weren’t there probably so how do you know that happened?  Through testimony. 

00:01:13.128 --> 00:01:16.456
Did Jesus Christ claim to be the Son of God?  

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.387
Did George Washington become president of the United States?  

00:01:21.923 --> 00:01:25.380
The only way we know those things is through testimony.

00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:30.803
Now, I define history as a knowledge of the past based upon testimony.  

00:01:31.311 --> 00:01:35.130
The question is, is your testimony reliable?

00:01:35.597 --> 00:01:41.231
Is it trustworthy? People lie. People cheat. People deceive. People have false memory. 

00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:49.254
Is your testimony reliable, because every definition has a weakness and for my definition, is your testimony reliable?

00:01:49.545 --> 00:01:52.061
Now when it comes to investigating Christianity, 

00:01:52.247 --> 00:01:59.298
 I stated it before, Christianity is a knowledge of the past based on testimony.   

00:01:59.523 --> 00:02:04.576
Mainly the scriptures, the Bible, what people refer to as the Word of God.  

00:02:04.857 --> 00:02:08.690
The question is, is that testimony reliable?  

00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:13.609
Under investigation, can you come to a reasonable conclusion …

00:02:14.034 --> 00:02:21.239
Yes I can trust the testimony about the Christian faith, about the New Testament, about the Old Testament.  

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:30.226
This is what I want to look at in a number of segments.  What is the testimony, and is it reliable?  Is it accurate?  Is it trustworthy?
