00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:10.720
-Hello, how are you doing?
-Good, thanks.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.800
Nice to meet you. Guillaume.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:14.720
-Where do you want to go?
-To my hotel, please.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.000
If you could play a match against any player
of the history, who would it be?

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:24.800
I would love to play against Monica Seles
cause she's been my idol growing up.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.840
I started playing tennis because of her.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.400
She comes from Serbia, they showed her matches
and I loved her style.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.440
It is thanks to Mrs Seles that you started tennis?

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.160
-Yes.
-When did you start?

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.280
There was a commercial for a tennis court

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.400
so I wrote down the number. I was less than 5.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.760
I told my mum I wanted to play tennis
and she was like "you should go to ballet".

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.720
"No, I really want tennis."
For my 5th birthday I got a small tennis racket

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.200
and that's how it started.

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.520
What is your favorite line of your favorite movie?

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.400
I would say the one from "Marygold Hotel":

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.000
"Everything will work out in the end
and if it hasn't worked out, it's not the end."

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.760
Do you remember
the emotion you felt

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.320
when you won Roland Garros in 2008?

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.520
I remember trying to climb the fence 
to reach my family

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:27.440
and the 1st person I hugged was my brother.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.760
It was an amazing moment.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.800
And when the national anthem came on
I was really trying hard not to cry.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:42.200
I had tears in my eyes.
It's something that will be with me forever.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.120
Choose a thing in the funny box.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.760
I would never ever go for blond hair.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.360
Actually not too bad.
A little bit Marilyn Monroe style.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.720
-I wish you all the best.
-Thank you.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.960
-Many thanks.
-See you.
