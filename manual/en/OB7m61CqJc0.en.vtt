00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.000
Summoners! Friday has arrived.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.000
I'm guessing you're ready for some League of Legends fan creations!

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.000
If not, pause the video.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.000
Ready now? Good.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.000
Here's the thread everyone's been talking about!

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.000
Footman is a My Little Ponies fan, and so are a lot of people

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.000
The challenge is to make champions into ponies. Very surprising.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The thread is enormous, there are 230 impressive entries. 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.000
I learned what a Cutie Mark is! It's a pony tramp stamp.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.000
So my childhood turned into Urgot. That's awesome.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.000
We see art on paper, but what about paper art?

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.000
Armorbreak makes orgigami video game characters!

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:59.000
I can't wrap a present correctly, and he can do this?

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.000
Challenge accepted!

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.000
Look I made Anivia!

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.000
:(

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.000
The beat drops, and BOOM!

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:13.000
Dance Master Phreak earned his title from the Patch Previews, but summoners wanted more.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.000
On the site UglyDance, you can make him boogie

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.000
He looks good in a pink flannel shirt.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.000
Do you remember that Dance contest we had in January? 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.000
We promised a video of dancing Rioters.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.000
Do you know how hard it is to get Rioters away from their work to dance?

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.000
It's like wrangling cats who have meetings to go to.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.000
Click here to see the video and contest winners!

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.000

Does anyone thumbs-up anymore? I'm a dork, I do it a lot.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.000
So thumbs up!

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.000
Boogie down!

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.000
And we'll see you next week!
