Hey, it's Marie Forleo and you are watching
MarieTV, the place to be if you want to create

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.420
a business and life you love and I bet you
you do. Today's question, it comes from Julia

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.910
and she writes, "Hi Marie, I don't dream really
big about my company development. I don't

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.390
want a Porsche or to hire people or to be
the chief general manager person. I'm interested

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.570
in a life with a really good, steady income,
bit of a paradox when having a company, and

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.500
doing what I like to do on my own while still
having enough time for people I care about.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.910
So in general, is not having a plan for a
big business with 20+ workers a really bad

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.350
thing? Regards from Poland, smiley face, Julia."

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.050
Julia, I absolutely love this question because
it gives me a chance to talk about something

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.050
I don't get a chance to talk about nearly
enough: not giving a flying fudge about what

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.340
other people think about how you should live
your life or build your business. Nor should

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:14.090
you be spending any of your precious life
energy trying to conform to some made up standard

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.520
about how big you should dream.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.310
Now, back in the day we were all taught that
we should get a good job, we should get a

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.830
family, a house, have some security, and play
it safe. That was the old American dream.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.410
Really, the old should. But these days it's
really starting to feel like dreaming big

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:35.280
is the new should, that somehow if you're
not dreaming big you probably have small dream

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.120
shame. That if you don't dream really, really
huge, somehow you're not ambitious enough,

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.530
you're not smart enough, and you're not valuable
enough in this world.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.530
This idea is totally and absolutely not true.
Small dream shame is total BS and for so many

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:58.370
people, dreaming big is actually crushing
their soul. You wanna know who's not a victim

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.130
of small dream shame? My parents.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.070
My parents moved out to Vegas from New Jersey
and I recently went out there for a weekend

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:09.670
visit. Now, their Vegas is not the Vegas that
most people think of. So they're not living

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.800
in some penthouse in the Mandalay Bay. They
would never, ever want that. They live in

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.040
a quiet little residential neighborhood, their
house is so simple, their life is so simple,

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.660
and they absolutely love it that way.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:28.530
They have no desire to eat at fancy places
like Nobu. You wanna know what their favorite

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:34.720
place in Vegas? It's a tiny little casino
that has an amazing buffet and 3 people can

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.450
eat for 20 bucks. Yes, 20 bucks. And they
told me this probably about 6 times, it got

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.920
them so excited, and it got me excited for
them.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.290
Now, world travel? Traveling around the world?
No interest at all. They do not wanna be high

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.070
rollers. They don't even gamble. You wanna
hear this one? They got themselves their own

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:59.000
slot machine and they filled it up with their
own change so they could win what they already

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.630
have. Now, some people may say, "Oh, that
sounds crazy." I think it sounds amazing.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:09.290
They are so happy. They're not living small,
they're living large and it's so inspiring

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:09.970
to me.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.910
I'm also inspired by this, even if it sounds
a little morbid. In The Top Five Regrets of

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.430
the Dying, author Bronnie Ware discovered
this: "The number one regret of the dying

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.950
is wishing they had the courage to live the
life they wanted to live, not the one others

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:25.430
had expected of them."

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.030
The bottom line is that we have to think and
dream independently. Each of us comes to earth

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:35.850
with our own unique assignment and each of
our dreams, no matter the size or scope, is

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.209
valuable and perfect exactly as is.

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:44.550
So let's land this plane on a tweetable.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.480
"Your dream doesn't have to be BIG to be perfect."

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.200
That was my A to your Q, Julia. Hope it helps.
Now I would love to hear from you. This is

00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:01.130
an awesome opportunity to let your dream freak
flag fly. I don't care what size you've got,

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:06.040
I wanna hear about it. So whether your dreams
are tiny small or whether you've kinda got

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.430
average sized dreams, or whether you have
huge dreams, size doesn't matter. It's all

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:13.130
about how you use it.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.190
Step one in making any dream come true is
you've got to articulate what that dream is.

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:22.660
You've got to name it to claim it and I want
you to start naming and claiming your dream

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:27.780
in the comments below. Now, as always, the
best discussions happen after the episode
