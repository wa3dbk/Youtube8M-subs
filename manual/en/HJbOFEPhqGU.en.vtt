00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.469
Hi everybody

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:13.570
Gary Douglas founder of Access yet again

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.099
Okay so today’s bleep of consciousness is

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:19.000
Do you want to change your money flows?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.989
Okay so one of the most important things

00:00:20.989 --> 00:00:23.070
I read all kinds of books

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.890
I went to seminar after seminar

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.119
Trying to figure out how to have money

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.529
One of the things that I discovered

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.150
Is you need to tithe to the church of you

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.500
It’s not about not tithing to your church

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.550
If you want to do that

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:38.730
Not a problem

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.940
But you want to tithe ten percent

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.350
Of every penny that comes

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:45.070
Into your life into the church of you

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.070
What you’re doing is you’re

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.160
Telling the universe that you deserve money

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.540
When you pay you first

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:53.570
When you put that ten percent away for you

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:56.010
What you will create in your life

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.230
Is more money coming in

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:59.030
How does that work?

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.981
Well if you go, “Okay I’m going to pay
all my bills first”

00:01:01.981 --> 00:01:03.770
And you pay all your bills

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.019
Usually what happens is you get more bills

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.689
Is that really what you want?

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:07.689
More bills?

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:08.689
Or would you like to have more money?

00:01:08.689 --> 00:01:10.469
So you start paying you the ten percent

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:13.140
It may mean you have to adjust for a few months

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.250
Like stretching bills out before you get used
to it

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.350
But I can guarantee you

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.420
If you will do this tithing to the church
of you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.320
Ten percent of ever dollar that comes into
your life

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.070
Ten percent of the gross not the net

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.170
Don’t try to weasel

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.460
If you will do this

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.070
In six months your whole financial universe
will have turned around

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:35.810
It’s really important to do this

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:37.110
From the point of view that you’re actually

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.340
Doing this as an honoring of you

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.280
Not because I tell you to do it

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.280
I tried that

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.979
Doing it because other people told me

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.110
But then as soon as I got into some kind of
financial bind

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:48.110
I’d spend the money

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.720
Then I’d go, “Ah I have no money again”

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.770
Well when you get to this thing of

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.630
Putting that ten percent away

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.200
There will come a time when you will have

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.380
A certain amount of money

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.420
And each of us has our own certain amount
of money

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.250
That once we have that we will no longer think
about money

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.579
We will have a security

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.729
And the point of view that we have money

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.640
What’s better?

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.739
To have money?

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.909
Or to spend money?

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.159
To have money means you always have something
to spend

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.319
To spend money means you have nothing left

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.319
So choose

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:23.040
It’s your choice
