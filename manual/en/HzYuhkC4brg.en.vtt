Hi guys. I'm Alex. Thanks for clicking, and
welcome to this lesson on spelling rules for

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:14.339
the third person present simple. In English,
the third person is very special in the present

00:00:14.339 --> 00:00:21.339
simple because, well, the verb is different
than when you say "I", "you", "we", or "they".

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:28.430
For example, if we look at the verb "start",
we say, "I start" in the present simple, "you

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:33.680
start" in the present simple, and then we
say "we start" and "they start". However,

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:42.208
for the third person, which is "he", "she",
or "it", we say, "he starts", "she starts",

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:49.200
"it starts". Okay. Today we're going to look
at some spelling rules for this third person

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.760
S. Now, those of you who have been studying
English for a while know that we usually add

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.610
an "s" or an "es" or an "ies" to the end of
a verb when we're writing it in the third

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.530
person. So today, we're going to look at these
rules. And if you're wondering, well, "When

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.610
do I add "es"" "When do I add just "s"", this
is what this lesson is for. We're not going

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.960
to focus so much on the pronunciation part
of it. That will be saved for another lesson.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.950
Today, I just want to look at the written
part and tell you how to write these things.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:33.706
So No. 1, we have four verbs. We have "start",
"stand", "work", "read". In the first person

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.049
we say: "I start"; "I stand"; "I work"; "I
read"; but in the third person, as most of

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:49.049
you likely know, we have to say: "starts",
"stands", "works", "reads", right? So for

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:58.229
most verbs in the English language, we just
add "s" to the ends of the base form of the

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:14.620
verb. So I'm just going to write that here.
Add "s" at the end of most verbs. Okay? Now,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:19.390
I don't want to give you a rule that says,
"at the end of all consonants", or "at the

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.459
end of all vowels", because it's not true.
So that's why I said at the end of "most"

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:31.130
verbs we just add "s".
Now, we have No. 2. We have, "catch", "smash",

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:38.130
"pass", "fix", "buzz". To these five verbs,
we actually have to add "es". So we say, "he"

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:51.076
or "she" or "it catches." "He" or "she" or
"it smashes." "He" or "she" or "it passes,

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.200
fixes, and buzzes." So we add "es". So what's
the rule here? Well, if you look at the end

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:07.858
of each verb, we have "ch", "sh", "s", "x",
"z". Any time -- any verb that ends in "ch",

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:15.860
"sh", "s", "x", or "z" -- or "zed", depending
on if you're British or American -- just add

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:45.053
"es". So the rule is: Add "es" to verbs that
end with "ch", "sh", "s", "x", or "z" or "zed".

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:52.269
Okay, now let's look at another list of verbs,
and these are verbs that end in "y". And we

00:03:52.590 --> 00:04:00.864
actually have two categories of them. We have
No. 3, No. 4, "study", "hurry", "carry", "stay",

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.311
"enjoy", "decay". Now, all these verbs end
in "y", but they do have a difference for

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:14.530
each category. In this one -- "study", "hurry",
"carry" -- each verb actually ends in a consonant

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:25.966
plus a "y". So "d", "r", and "r" again are
consonants. So when we have a consonant +

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:37.481
"y" you must change the "y" to "i" and add
"es". So we have "studies", "hurries", and

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:44.789
"carries". And I apologize -- basically, all
you have to do -- imagine this is not here,

00:04:45.460 --> 00:05:01.794
right? Erase the "y"; add "ies". So the rule
is: We add -- sorry -- we remove "y" and add

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:26.646
"ies" when the verb ends with a consonant
+ "y". Okay. And this should give you an idea

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:33.029
about what the rule is for the next one.
So here, we have three verbs that end in "y",

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:43.268
but they end in a vowel + "y" -- vowel, "a-o-a".
So when you have this, simply add "s". So

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:53.003
we have: "stays", "enjoys", "decays". So the
rule for this -- unlike the consonant + "y"

00:05:53.169 --> 00:06:14.832
-- is: Add "s" when the verb ends with a vowel
+ "y". That's it.

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:20.485
Okay, guys. If you'd like to test your understanding
