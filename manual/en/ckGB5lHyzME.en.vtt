00:00:16.722 --> 00:00:19.745
So I'm here today to encourage
you to think about New York City,

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:22.420
and not just as one
of humanity's greatest achievements,

00:00:22.444 --> 00:00:23.913
but as home to native wildlife

00:00:23.937 --> 00:00:26.775
that are subject to a grand
evolutionary experiment.

00:00:27.295 --> 00:00:30.483
So take this forested hillside
in Northern Manhattan, for example.

00:00:30.507 --> 00:00:32.659
This is one of the last areas
left in the city

00:00:32.683 --> 00:00:35.494
where there's clean spring water
seeping out of the ground.

00:00:35.518 --> 00:00:38.114
You could drink this
out of your hands and you'd be OK.

00:00:38.138 --> 00:00:40.043
These tiny little areas of seeping water

00:00:40.067 --> 00:00:42.984
contain huge populations
of northern dusky salamanders.

00:00:43.008 --> 00:00:45.991
These guys were common in the city
maybe 60 years ago,

00:00:46.015 --> 00:00:48.367
but now they're just stuck
on this single hillside

00:00:48.391 --> 00:00:50.493
and a few places in Staten Island.

00:00:53.247 --> 00:00:56.919
Not only do they suffer the indignity
of being stuck on this hillside,

00:00:56.943 --> 00:00:59.047
but we divided the hillside in two

00:00:59.071 --> 00:01:00.448
on two different occasions

00:01:00.472 --> 00:01:03.324
with bridges crossing
from the Bronx into Manhattan.

00:01:03.348 --> 00:01:05.958
But they're still there,
on either side of the bridges,

00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:09.045
where you see the red arrows --
about 180th Street, 167th Street.

00:01:09.069 --> 00:01:12.046
My lab has found that if you just take
a few segments of DNA

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.045
from salamanders in those two locations,

00:01:14.069 --> 00:01:16.556
you can tell which side
of the bridge they came from.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.668
We built this single piece
of infrastructure

00:01:18.692 --> 00:01:20.976
that's changed their evolutionary history.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.542
We can go study these guys,
we just go to the hillside

00:01:23.566 --> 00:01:26.571
we know where they are,
we flip over rocks so we can catch them.

00:01:26.595 --> 00:01:29.339
There are a lot of other things
in New York City, though,

00:01:29.363 --> 00:01:32.323
that are not that easy to capture,
such as this guy, a coyote.

00:01:32.347 --> 00:01:35.598
We caught him on an automatic camera trap
in an undisclosed location;

00:01:35.622 --> 00:01:37.455
I'm not allowed to talk about it yet.

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:40.165
But they're moving into New York City
for the first time.

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.198
They're very flexible,
intelligent animals.

00:01:42.222 --> 00:01:45.233
This is one of this year's pups
checking out one of our cameras.

00:01:45.257 --> 00:01:48.230
And my colleagues and I
are very interested in understanding

00:01:48.254 --> 00:01:50.423
how they're going to spread
through the area,

00:01:50.447 --> 00:01:53.082
how they're going to survive here
and maybe even thrive.

00:01:53.106 --> 00:01:55.684
And they're probably coming
to a neighborhood near you,

00:01:55.708 --> 00:01:57.119
if they're not already there.

00:01:57.489 --> 00:02:00.417
Some things are too fast
to be caught by hand.

00:02:00.441 --> 00:02:02.223
We can't pick them up on the cameras,

00:02:02.247 --> 00:02:04.834
so we set up traps
around New York City and the parks.

00:02:04.858 --> 00:02:07.065
This is one of our most common activities.

00:02:07.089 --> 00:02:09.175
Here's some of my students
and collaborators

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.736
getting the traps out and ready.

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:13.907
This guy, we catch in almost
every forested area in New York City.

00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:15.557
This is the white-footed mouse --

00:02:15.581 --> 00:02:18.200
not the mouse you find
running around your apartment.

00:02:18.224 --> 00:02:21.367
This is a native species,
been here long before humans.

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:23.289
You find them in forests and meadows.

00:02:23.313 --> 00:02:26.414
Because they're so common
in forested areas in the city,

00:02:26.438 --> 00:02:30.113
we're using them as a model
to understand how species are adapting

00:02:30.137 --> 00:02:31.374
to urban environments.

00:02:31.993 --> 00:02:34.430
So if you think back 400 years ago,

00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:38.305
the five boroughs would've been covered
in forests and other types of vegetation.

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:41.007
This mouse would've been everywhere
[in] huge populations

00:02:41.031 --> 00:02:43.809
that showed few genetic differences
across the landscape.

00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:45.791
But if you look at the situation today,

00:02:45.815 --> 00:02:49.625
they're just stuck in these little islands
of forest scattered around the city.

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:53.306
Just using 18 short segments of DNA,
we can pretty much take a mouse

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:56.278
somebody could give us a mouse,
not tell us where it was from,

00:02:56.302 --> 00:02:58.453
and we could determine
what park it came from.

00:02:58.477 --> 00:03:00.201
That's how different they've become.

00:03:00.225 --> 00:03:02.240
You'll notice in the middle
of this figure,

00:03:02.264 --> 00:03:03.850
there are some mixed-up colors.

00:03:03.874 --> 00:03:07.275
There are a few parks in the city
that are still connected to each other

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:10.028
with strips of forest,
so the mice can run back and forth

00:03:10.052 --> 00:03:12.630
and spread their genes,
so they don't become different.

00:03:12.654 --> 00:03:16.050
But throughout the city, they're mostly
becoming different in the parks.

00:03:16.074 --> 00:03:18.979
So I'm telling you they're different,
but what does that mean?

00:03:19.003 --> 00:03:20.726
What's changing about their biology?

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.965
To answer this question,

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:25.011
we're sequencing thousands
of genes from our city mice

00:03:25.035 --> 00:03:28.672
and comparing those to thousands
of genes from the country mice,

00:03:28.696 --> 00:03:30.785
so, their ancestors
outside of New York City

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:33.881
in these big, more wilderness areas.

00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:37.903
Now, genes are short segments of DNA
that code for amino acids.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:41.006
And amino acids are
the building blocks of proteins.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.258
If a single base pair changes in a gene,

00:03:43.282 --> 00:03:45.148
you can get a different amino acid,

00:03:45.172 --> 00:03:48.106
which will then change the shape
and structure of the protein.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.210
If you change the structure of a protein,

00:03:50.234 --> 00:03:53.601
you often change something
about what it does in the organism.

00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:57.839
Now if that change leads to a longer
life or more babies for a mouse,

00:03:57.863 --> 00:04:00.170
something evolutionary
biologists call fitness,

00:04:00.194 --> 00:04:02.909
then that single base-pair change
will spread quickly

00:04:02.933 --> 00:04:04.186
in an urban population.

00:04:04.586 --> 00:04:06.840
So this crazy figure
is called a Manhattan plot,

00:04:06.864 --> 00:04:08.976
because it kind of looks like a skyline.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.976
Each dot represents one gene,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.285
and the higher the dot is in the plot,

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:15.930
the more different it is
between city and country mice.

00:04:15.954 --> 00:04:19.322
The ones kind of at the tips
of the skyscrapers are the most different,

00:04:19.346 --> 00:04:21.147
especially those above the red line.

00:04:21.171 --> 00:04:24.861
And these genes encode for things
like immune response to disease,

00:04:24.885 --> 00:04:28.160
because there might be more disease
in very dense, urban populations;

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:30.565
metabolism, how the mice use energy;

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:31.867
and heavy-metal tolerance.

00:04:31.891 --> 00:04:33.295
You guys can probably predict

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:35.739
that New York City soils
are pretty contaminated

00:04:35.763 --> 00:04:38.223
with lead and chromium
and that sort of thing.

00:04:38.247 --> 00:04:40.239
And now our hard work is really starting.

00:04:40.263 --> 00:04:43.119
We're going back into the wilds
of New York City parks,

00:04:43.143 --> 00:04:45.263
following the lives of individual mice

00:04:45.287 --> 00:04:48.245
and seeing exactly
what these genes are doing for them.

00:04:48.269 --> 00:04:52.109
And I would encourage you guys
to try to look at your parks in a new way.

00:04:52.133 --> 00:04:54.227
I'm not going to be
the next Charles Darwin,

00:04:54.251 --> 00:04:57.006
but one of you guys might be,
so just keep your eyes open.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.181
Thank you.

00:04:58.205 --> 00:05:00.672
(Applause)
