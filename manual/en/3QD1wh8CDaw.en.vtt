00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:11.720
Linda Brzustowicz: Schizophrenia is a very
serious mental illness.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.200
It affects about 1% of the population worldwide
and one of the interesting things about it

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.550
is that it doesn't show a lot of variation
from one country to another, to different

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.800
racial groups, different ethnicities, so it's
a real serious problem, like many groups,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.369
we started focusing on a particular gene,
so we've got a sample of families that are

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:38.120
collaborator in Canada has collected Dr. Anne
Bassett, and using these families we've identified

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.850
a particular gene, it's called NOS1AP, that
seems to have a very important role in increasing

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.280
risk in these families.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.670
Other people have looked in other families,
other collections or other populations, and

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.339
as is typical for our field, there are mixed
results.

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.739
So, there are several studies where people
find that this gene looks important in other

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.379
populations and there are a couple of samples
where people don't find any evidence for this

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.379
gene.

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:07.980
For example, we've identified one sample where
if you just look at a sample by itself, you

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.180
actually don't see any evidence that this
gene is increasing risk.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.340
But if you the start to look at the interaction
of this gene with another gene on a different

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.850
chromosome, all of a sudden you see that the
interaction is important and does act to increase

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:20.850
risk.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.240
So what we've basically done most recently
is we've taken our set of families, these

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.149
Canadian families, and we've actually genotyped
them at a million snips, single-nucleotide

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.140
polymorphisms across the whole genome and
what we've started to do now is look for evidence

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:44.499
of interaction between our first gene NOS1AP
and other genes that are in other areas of

00:01:44.499 --> 00:01:49.509
the genome, that we have statistical reason
to believe that there's another gene involved

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.530
there, and what we've started to find out
is really very, very interesting, we're identifying

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:00.030
a set of additional genes, so we currently
have five other genes, all of which are in

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:03.439
biological pathways which interact with the
first gene.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.450
So these are our second set of genes that
we're pulling out that have strong statistical

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.610
support that they're also increasing risk
for schizophrenia and it just so happens when

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.600
we look at which genes are supportive, that
they're biologically very closely tied to

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.470
that first gene, which is what you would expect.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.831
So we're actually very encouraged that our
method is working, and we're hoping that we

00:02:25.831 --> 00:02:30.630
will be able to expand this to other data
sets and not just do this on our Canadian

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.459
samples, but do it on groups from other backgrounds.

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.629
So I think there are a few different things
that hopefully this understanding will help

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:38.629
with.

00:02:38.629 --> 00:02:44.180
So, first off, there's a big push right now
to this concept of personalized medicine,

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.489
and this idea that certain people respond
better to different drugs than other people

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:54.230
do, and can we understand the underlying genetics
that causes one person to benefit from a given

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.269
treatment more than another, so I think in
terms of modeling, whose more likely to benefit

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:03.629
from a given therapeutic intervention, looking
at multiple genes to try to determine that,

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:08.060
is going to give us a better fit and then
hopefully better therapeutic outcomes.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:14.560
A second potential benefit from this is that
we might start to identify additional potential

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.060
targets for pharmacologic intervention, so
many of the medications are used for schizophrenia

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:24.439
right now, are from a relatively limited class
of drugs.

00:03:24.439 --> 00:03:29.650
They target some but not all of the symptoms
of the illness, so one of the hopes is that

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.689
if we identify more of the underlying biology
that's going wrong in this ills, we might

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:37.190
be able to come up with some better ideas
for how to treat it.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.360
A third area that this might be useful for
is that we know that schizophrenia is not

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.120
an entirely genetic disorder, so if you look
for example at identical twins, it's not the

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.250
case that every pair of identical twins will
both have the illness.

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:55.700
You certainly find about half the time, one
twin has it, the other twin doesn't, so there's

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.140
something besides genes that are important
in the illness.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:04.810
If we can identify what really causes someone
to have the genetic risk factors, then that

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.810
might make it easier for us to figure out
what are the specific environmental factors

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:12.469
that cause somebody to get the illness or
not get the illness, and that may actually

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:17.200
be an easier avenue of intervention, to actually
prevent people from getting whatever environmental

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.989
exposure it is that triggers the disease.

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.570
That's probably going to be easier than doing
something like gene therapy, to actually fix

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.440
the underlying genetic defects.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.890
It's a big puzzle and the analogy I like to
use is to say it's like a jigsaw puzzle, and

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.850
when doing a jigsaw puzzle once you have some
of the pieces in place, it gets easier to

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:38.270
put the subsequent pieces in place, and there's
nothing wrong when you're doing a jigsaw puzzle

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.720
with starting with the easy stuff like doing
the edges first, so I think in terms of going

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.690
after genes that have a big effect on a given
sample, and then trying to see what genes

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.720
interact with those, it is very analogous
to, you start out with a corner, then you

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:55.360
do the edge, and then probably environmental
factors are going to be filling in the middle

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.360
of the picture.
