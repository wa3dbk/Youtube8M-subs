David Kadavy: Hi!

00:00:01.049 --> 00:00:03.749
This is David Kadavy with Kadavy.net and today
I am going to show you how to transfer your

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:08.220
iTunes library from one computer to another,
without losing your song ratings or your play

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.220
counts.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:12.640
These can be very valuable when it comes to
actually navigating your music on the computer.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:17.310
There's a number of ways to actually get the
physical files to a new computer, but retaining

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:23.990
play counts and song ratings requires a little
bit of hacking.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.189
First, we're on our old computer.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.349
We are going to to go to our iTunes Menu,
File &gt; Library &gt; Export Library.

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:33.410
This is going to create an XML file.

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:38.079
I am just going to export this to my desktop
and this is going to have all this information

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.879
in there about my play counts and my song
ratings.

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.290
Now you're going to want to transfer the actual
files over to the new computer.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.469
There's a number of different ways to do this.

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:50.699
Probably the best way is with an external
hard drive.

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:55.530
I am not personally going to go through all
the details of that right now, but to find

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.699
out where your music is in your old computer,
just go to your iTunes library, right-click

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:08.640
on a song, go "Show in Finder" or if you're
on a Windows machine it will say something

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.870
else obviously, and you'll see where your
files are.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.890
Go back through the directory structure a
little bit, and then you'll see the root folder

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.470
that holds all of your iTunes media.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.700
So this folder right here that says "iTunes
Media," is a folder that I would want to transfer

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.210
to my new computer, and I'll meet you over
there in a second.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.300
OK, here I am over on my new computer.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.300
It looks oddly similar, doesn't it?

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.590
Anyway, I've got an empty iTunes library.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:40.560
I've got my XML file, library.xml over here,
and I have got my iTunes media file here on

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.560
my Desktop.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.500
The first thing I want to do is going to iTunes
&gt; Preferences &gt; Advanced.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:53.390
Make sure this copy files to "iTunes Media"
folder, when adding the library, is selected.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.990
It is, that is good.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.650
Now, this "iTunes media" folder has a space
in the name of it, that's just going to complicate

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.720
things.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.320
Let's just change the name to just "iTunesmusic,"
with no space.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:16.500
Now, we're going to open up the library.xml
file.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.570
Look in here, you're going to see, this says,
"Music folder," string file.

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.560
This is the file path of where the music folder
was on my old computer.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.730
Now, if you're doing this, you're probably
doing this from a Windows to a Mac, so it

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:38.560
probably says "C:\".

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.050
Watch out for those back slashes, when we
change this file path.

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.720
What we're going to do is define the file
path of our new music folder.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.340
I'm going to right click and say, "Get info."

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:56.010
You can see the user is guest desktop, and
then of course, it's iTunes music.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.540
What we're going to do is do a find change
and, if you're going to a Mac, make sure you

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.290
remember this "file://".

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.620
We're going to do a find change.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:14.980
We're going to find everything that says this,
and we're going to copy it.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:22.340
Go to edit, find, find, and paste that in
there.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:31.000
That's command V, open Apple V, replace with,
now we're going to type in our new file path.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:41.490
"File://Users/", with capitalized, "Guest/",
capitalized, which you probably have a different

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:42.490
user name.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:49.790
"Desktop/", capitalized, and another forward
slash, "iTunesmusic/", and then one final

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:50.790
forward slash.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:54.709
We're going to do replace all.

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:06.370
That is going to change, automagically, everything
in our whole library.xml that says that.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.410
Now, we're going to save that library.xml
file.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:16.129
All right, now I'm going to actually import
this library, using this XML file.

00:04:16.129 --> 00:04:19.810
I go to File &gt; Library &gt; Import playlist.

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.479
Find my library.xml file.

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:26.740
Wait a little and it will automatically import
my library.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.639
Now, while I'm waiting for that, I'll tell
you that you can also find written instructions

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:37.190
on this at Kadavy.net, on my post "Transfer
your iTunes library from one computer to another.:

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.680
If you wanted to find this, you could just
search for "Transfer iTunes Kadavy."

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.879
Also, I have the link in the sidebar.

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:47.139
It's finally done transferring.

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:49.729
You can see now that I've got all my song
ratings on here.

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.099
I started with a dummy library, I would have
play counts on there.

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:57.009
If you're wondering why I have so many ones
and twos in my libraries, it's because I organize

00:04:57.009 --> 00:05:00.310
it using a mood based iTunes rating system.

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.539
You can also find that on Kadavy.net, by searching
for "Mood based Kadavy," or I have the link

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:06.779
in the sidebar for that.

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:11.449
Anyway, I hope this helps you transfer your
iTunes library from one computer to another.

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.330
You can save all your song ratings, your play
counts, and even your play lists, as well.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.729
