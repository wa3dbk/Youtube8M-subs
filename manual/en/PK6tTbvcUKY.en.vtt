00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.450
We’re in the large object store of the National
Maritime Museum, and at the moment we’re

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.380
preparing some objects from the Titanic movie.

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.710
These costumes are here as part of the Australian
National Maritime Museum’s, Remembering

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:29.170
Titanic 100 Years Exhibition, and as a vintage
fashion enthusiast, I have to say it’s extremely

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:30.920
exciting for me.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.559
The authenticity and level of detail is quite
extraordinary.

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.120
The designer, Deborah Scott, actually won
an Oscar for them.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:44.350
She used both original patterns from the era,
she used original gowns which are seen in

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.650
some of the scenes in the movie, and you can
even see on some of the dresses here, for

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:56.550
example, this one with Margaret Brown, she’s
used beadwork from the period as an applique,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:02.750
actually worked into her design.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:09.570
The costumes have arrived in quite good condition,
but what we required to do, is to build up

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.770
the size of the mannequins to fit the costumes.

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:20.960
In the case of Molly, we’ve had to enlarge
the mannequin and create the silhouette of

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.320
the era.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.070
Well Titanic era fashion has come to really
represent the years between 1908 and the beginning

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.400
of the First World War; in other words, the
latter part of the Edwardian era.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.709
Specifically, obviously, it refers to the
fashions of 1912 when the Titanic sank, and

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:46.910
I have to say that as a Titanic historian,
as a fashion enthusiast, and as someone who

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.721
appreciates this long lost world of the Belle
Époque, I have to say this exhibition is

00:01:52.721 --> 00:01:53.719
an absolute must see.
