00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:08.610
Cells- The fundamental Unit of life If you
remember, in our previous session we have

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.420
seen the basic difference between a living
and a non- living thing and some of the characteristics

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:16.160
shown by living organisms.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:25.750
So today we will be looking at the 1st characteristic
in detail i.e the composition of an organism

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:33.000
The trees in the forest the fish in the riverthe
birds in the sky the worm in the soilthe tiger

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:42.730
in the jungle the cactus in the desert your
class mate in fact any living thing on this

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.629
planet is made up of cells which are known
to be the building blocks of a living thing.

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.459
Many many cells come together to form a living
organism.

00:00:54.459 --> 00:01:00.809
Besides this, some organisms like bacteria
are made up of only one cell.

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.810
One celled organism is all together an individual
itself which can perform all the functions

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.950
like any other multi-cellular organism.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:17.360
Every living being performs various functions
during its entire lifespan like respiration,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:25.079
digestion, excretion, reproduction etc. the
body has specific organs to carry out these

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.460
functions.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.860
These organs are made up of various types
of tissues; and tissues are nothing but a

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:32.460
group of cells.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.130
So in short we can say that the human body
is composed of many cells.Just as bricks form

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.950
the important part of a building, cells make
up an organism.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:53.390
So we can say that cells are the basic fundamental
unit of life.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:58.469
In 1665, Robert Hooke discovered cells.

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:06.039
He observed dead cells within the cork of
the bark of a tree using an old basic microscope.

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:11.900
He observed empty spaces contained by a wall
and named them cells because they resembled

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.830
small compartments.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.700
So we can say that what Robert Hooke observed
looked something similar to a honeycomb structure.

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:25.260
We shall take a look at some features of a
cell.

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.269
So lets get started.

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:31.099
No. of cells:
Based on the no. of cells an organism can

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.200
either be unicellular or multi cellular.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:53.650
As the word suggests Uni- is one 
cell and multi is many cells.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.720
Shape of a cell:
Cells are of various shapes.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.879
Majority of them are round, spherical and
elongated.

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:04.150
But you know what gives a cell its shape..???

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:11.060
Just like a room gets its shape from its walls
a cell gets its shape from a cell membrane

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:13.790
which is the outer covering of the cell.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:20.490
Soooo talking about shape of cells u know
a unicellular organism named amoeba has no

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:26.300
definite shape it is irregular and it keeps
changing its shape.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:30.319
In multi-cellular organisms, cells are of
different shapes.

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.579
Like for eg.

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:39.560
A nerve cell is long and branched in structure
while a red blood cell (rbc) is spherical

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.269
and concave.

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.620
Size of a cell:

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:48.709
Cells are very tiny in size and are not visible
by the eye.

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.569
Hence to view them we use a microscope which
is an instrument that magnifies and enlarges

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:56.510
the image of a cell.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:04.120
So did you all know that A smallest cell is
0.1 to 0.5 micrometer which is of a bacteria

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:14.489
while the largest cell is 170 mm x 130 mm
in size which is the egg of an ostrich.

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:20.880
You must know that the Size of a cell is based
on the function it performs and not on the

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.880
size of an organism.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:22.880
sooo..

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:23.880
The nerve cell in an elephant and a rat will
be of the same size.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.850
A cell has many parts and it contains components
which help in the proper functioning of the

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:26.850
cell.

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.150
We will have a look at them in detail in our
next video.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.160
Till then why dont you all try a small exercise

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.160
Exercise: try listing all the various types
of cells found in a human.

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:37.580
Until now we have been saying that biology
is all about study of life but life is composed

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:42.420
of many many cells which come together to
form a living organism.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:49.440
Our planet consists of a vast number of creatures;
some may be formed of just one cell like we

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:56.560
have seen in an amoeba while others are multi-cellular
No of cells can vary depending on the size

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:07.670
of an organism an elephant will obviously
have more no of cells compared to a rat but

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:11.300
the size of a cell will remain the same as
we have seen previously.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.850
Also cells have a property of regeneration.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:19.650
Imagine you have got a wound on your knee
and your skin cells are damaged.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.810
But your body has a tendency to regenerate
those cells on its own.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:46.190
This is 
the most fascinating property 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.100
of cells.

00:05:50.100 --> 00:06:10.280
So till 
the 

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.240
next video follow your curiosity.
