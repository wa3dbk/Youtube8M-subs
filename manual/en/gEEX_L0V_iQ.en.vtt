00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.450
I’m going to show you how to do a provisional
cast on, which is how we start knitting the

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.830
toe-up sock.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.270
The provisional cast on starts the sock here.

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:25.169
Which is a very different place to start socks
from knitting cuff down.

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:28.660
There are several different ways of doing
provisional cast on, this one happens to be

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:30.779
my favorite.

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.629
To do this you need yarn in a color that is
different from the sock yarn you’re going

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:40.760
to use, and you need a crochet hook.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.300
For this pattern that I’m using here, for
the worsted weight socks, I’m going to use

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.960
a size H crochet hook.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.260
And if you are using a different pattern,
you want to start by chaining with the crochet

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.879
hook, you want to chain several more chains
than you need for the cast on.

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:12.370
You want some extra chain hanging off on both
sides.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:14.550
So I believe that I have enough here.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:30.110
Okay, you want to break the yarn and pull
that through.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.500
And make note of where your slip knot was.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.390
I always tie a little knot in the slip knot
end.

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.170
Because you’re eventually going to pull
the provisional cast on out and have a bunch

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.800
of live stitches, and you want to start pulling
off from the end where the slip knot is NOT.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.450
That make sense?

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.070
I want to start pulling from this end.

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.561
So, first thing I want to do is to take a
look at the crochet chain.

00:01:57.561 --> 00:02:02.570
And you look at the crochet chain, and it’s
a series of “V”s, all lined up.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.690
That’s what we’re used to seeing.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.850
We’re actually going to work on the back
of the crochet chain, where it’s a series

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.110
of bumps, down the middle.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:18.371
You want to take one of your needles, starting
off with one, and your sock yarn, and you

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:26.700
want to put your needle in to one of those
bumps.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:36.340
Attach your yarn and pull it through, go into
the next one.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.440
Pull it through.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.781
And this is the start of the provisional cast
on.

00:02:41.781 --> 00:02:49.880
You want to continue doing this until you
have as many stitches on the needle as the

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:57.560
pattern calls for.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.340
One hint – is when you do this, you put
the needle in – try not to split the yarn

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.010
when you do this, it will make it easier when
you pull the cast on out.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.100
Wrap the needle, put a lot of pressure on
the working yarn, that will make it easier

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.130
to pull through.

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:22.209
You continue this all the way across.

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:29.180
And that’s the provisional cast on, and
we will move on to the toe in the next video.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.290
