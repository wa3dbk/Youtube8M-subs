00:00:00.317 --> 00:00:01.298
Ximena: Hi!

00:00:01.298 --> 00:00:02.598
Roxanna: We're Rainy Day Dreamers.

00:00:02.598 --> 00:00:06.514
Parris: And we were over at our mailbox picking up mail and we actually found a mysterious

00:00:06.514 --> 00:00:13.269
box we wanted to show you before we opened it up - something weird.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:25.379
Parris: Normally we get letters and lots of times we get Rainbow Loom bands from people. This

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:31.029
time, we got an envelope that said "The Clues" and so we thought, well, who is this from? So we

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.516
took a look at the box. Who is this from?

00:00:34.516 --> 00:00:35.951
Roxanna: Mommy and Gracie!

00:00:35.951 --> 00:00:41.921
Parris: From the Mommy and Gracie Show! They sent us a domestic box of mystery with some

00:00:41.921 --> 00:00:50.172
clues. So, we are supposed to read these clues, I think, to figure out what's in the box with your

00:00:50.172 --> 00:00:51.776
help. You guys ready for this?

00:00:51.776 --> 00:00:52.213
Ximena: Yeah.

00:00:52.213 --> 00:00:52.632
Roxanna: Yeah.

00:00:52.632 --> 00:01:05.977
Parris: Okay. The clues. Now, not that heavy. Doesn't make noises - if that helps. Okay.

00:01:05.977 --> 00:01:11.761
From the official desk of the Mommy and Gracie Show - okay. Why don't we take turns

00:01:11.761 --> 00:01:13.610
reading? I'll read a couple of lines, then you, okay?

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:14.649
Roxanna: Okay.

00:01:14.649 --> 00:01:18.939
Parris: Dear Rainy Day Dreamers, here's a little holiday surprise. Follow the clues, if you're

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:20.659
wise.

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:21.903
Want to do the next one?

00:01:21.903 --> 00:01:27.219
Roxanna: What hides in the box is a mystery. Will there be four, two, five, or three?

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:30.468
Parris: Are the numbers important? Okay, the next two.

00:01:30.468 --> 00:01:36.889
Ximena: Although it is cute, it is not a real hue. Real ones can be taught to speak on cue.

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:43.812
Parris: Although it is cute, this is not its real hue. H-U-E like color. Real ones can be taught to

00:01:43.812 --> 00:01:45.290
speak on cue.

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.906
Let's read some more clues. I'll do the next one.

00:01:49.906 --> 00:01:56.943
It was popular in the not-so-distant past. We wonder, can its new popularity last?

00:01:56.943 --> 00:02:02.366
So I'm thinking it's got to be a toy kind of thing. It used to be popular and then it wasn't. Now

00:02:02.366 --> 00:02:04.567
it's popular again. Okay.

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:13.860
Roxanna: From all of the videos popping up on YouTube, we'd say this furry cutie's future looks

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.405
good.

00:02:14.405 --> 00:02:19.897
Parris: Furry cutie. You have an idea? Well, let's read on. At that point, I thought I knew what it

00:02:19.897 --> 00:02:21.378
was, too, but let's read on.

00:02:21.378 --> 00:02:28.655
Ximena: Everybody who gets one is clueless as well. It's the very mystery that makes them sell.

00:02:28.655 --> 00:02:30.886
Parris: You were going to say that makes them all smell. I know you were.

00:02:30.886 --> 00:02:32.528
Ximena: No. That makes them all sell.

00:02:32.528 --> 00:02:36.656
Parris: That makes them sell. So, everyone who gets one is clueless. Everyone who gets this toy

00:02:36.656 --> 00:02:40.063
is clueless about it. This is a good next line.

00:02:40.063 --> 00:02:45.760
Are you still totally stumped? Would it help if you knew that there could be a runt?

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.917
Roxanna: What's a runt?

00:02:46.917 --> 00:02:53.086
Parris: Runt is like when a dog has puppies and there's one that's smaller than the rest and it

00:02:53.086 --> 00:02:56.725
sometimes has a hard time surviving because it can't get in there to feed with the other ones. So

00:02:56.725 --> 00:02:59.049
the runt is the tiny baby one.

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.069
Ximena: Like our dog?

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:06.812
Parris: Yeah, our dog may have been a runt. But, no, he's not in there. All right - do we have

00:03:06.812 --> 00:03:07.624
any ideas so far?

00:03:07.624 --> 00:03:12.441
Roxanna: I don't know. If you took away the furry part, I would have thought a parrot.

00:03:12.441 --> 00:03:16.646
Parris: Parrot because of the sound of the talking, yes.

00:03:16.646 --> 00:03:18.763
Ximena: After the third clue - can I say what I thought it was?

00:03:18.763 --> 00:03:19.189
Parris: Sure.

00:03:19.189 --> 00:03:20.543
Ximena: I thought it might have been a Furby.

00:03:20.543 --> 00:03:26.545
Parris: That's what I thought. I thought a Furby, too, because it's not - it can be taught to speak

00:03:26.545 --> 00:03:32.104
on cue - remember the Furbies? They learned to speak in English and Furbish. Used to be

00:03:32.104 --> 00:03:39.896
popular but it's not popular again now very much. And why would we be clueless? And what

00:03:39.896 --> 00:03:45.606
about a runt? The runt could be the Furbling, maybe?

00:03:45.606 --> 00:03:52.202
Okay. We need your help with this - there's a few more clues here, but if you've got an idea

00:03:52.202 --> 00:03:57.511
already, feel free to help us out down below in the comments if you would put a hashtag and then

00:03:57.511 --> 00:04:02.706
whatever you think it would be. Maybe we'll be able to find out from our subscribers. That

00:04:02.706 --> 00:04:06.910
would be very helpful because we only have a few days to figure this out. Then, we have to open

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.152
up the box so we've got to get the answer for this. All right, there's a few more clues here. It's

00:04:11.152 --> 00:04:12.020
your turn here.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:19.266
Roxanna: Although they are said to be enemies in life, they sit side by side on store shelves and

00:04:19.266 --> 00:04:20.330
play nice.

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:31.199
Parris: Enemies in life. That makes me think of the mongoose and the rattlesnake. Okay, you all

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.313
wouldn't think of that. They sit on - okay. Here you go, these two.

00:04:35.313 --> 00:04:42.870
Ximena: Well, that's it for now for the clues from us two. Still lost? Go check out our YouTube

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:44.007
for a clue.

00:04:44.007 --> 00:04:51.384
Parris: So, this is something that they've reviewed or talked about. We need to study their old

00:04:51.384 --> 00:04:54.998
videos, apparently. They've been doing YouTube for what, like, two years or something? Oh,

00:04:54.998 --> 00:04:59.702
they must have a lot of videos. And then, they signed it, "Hugs, Mommy and Gracie".

00:04:59.702 --> 00:05:03.236
So that's nice of them to send us something.

00:05:03.236 --> 00:05:04.792
Ximena: Yeah.

00:05:04.792 --> 00:05:07.464
Roxanna: I'm totally stumped.

00:05:07.464 --> 00:05:08.491
Parris: You know, the only thing to do -

00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:09.465
Ximena: What?

00:05:09.465 --> 00:05:10.463
Roxanna: Go on YouTube?

00:05:10.463 --> 00:05:15.829
Parris: Send them something and make them guess what it is with clues. Good plan?

00:05:15.829 --> 00:05:17.024
Ximena: Yeah.

00:05:17.024 --> 00:05:21.161
Parris: That's what we're going to do. So, same challenge to Mommy and Gracie. We'll have a

00:05:21.161 --> 00:05:26.908
package for them to open up, see if they can figure out what it is with some mysterious clues.

00:05:26.908 --> 00:05:35.439
But I have no idea what this is. If it's not a Furby or a - oh man, they like these - we did the

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:40.676
Digibirds and I know they've done some other kind of bird - live, little birds or something.

00:05:40.676 --> 00:05:43.986
Roxanna: How about we all look back into the Way Back History?

00:05:43.986 --> 00:05:47.750
Parris: Yeah, we'd better go and check out their channel and take a look. So, again, if you've

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:53.699
got advice for us, please. If you're a Mommy and Gracie aficionado, you've watched all their

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.886
videos since they've started, maybe you know the answer to this so please give us some - at least

00:05:57.886 --> 00:06:01.976
give us a hint if you don't want to give us the answer with a hashtag down below. But if you

00:06:01.976 --> 00:06:05.428
want to tell us what you think the answer is, that's great, too. We need help, don't we, guys?

00:06:05.428 --> 00:06:06.043
Ximena: Yeah.

00:06:06.043 --> 00:06:09.949
Parris: Okay. They gave us just a few days to figure this out so we will be back in a few days

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:14.114
with our best guess. We'll open up the box and see if we got it right.

00:06:14.114 --> 00:06:22.453
