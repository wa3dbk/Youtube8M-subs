00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.310
aspirin no this why doesn't God I want

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.939
I get that he keeps you alive according
to this crazy guys you're about to find

00:01:22.939 --> 00:01:23.610
out in a

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.409
not necessarily but why does he want you
to be in pain while the latest thanks

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:28.430
but you're the first but

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.229
so last time that he got bitten but

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.640
he refused any type of medical attention
and as a result he died but

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:40.750
after he not been so many times and
survived I don't blame them for thinking

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:41.619
it would be okay

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.409
yeah I know I get it right and he thinks
a while y'all were

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.350
helping with the spaces that are
anywhere from nine times except for the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:49.630
one time we lost a finger

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.430
I would call that right about there okay
but he decide to keep going

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.119
and that's why I time I read apparently
got in step up to the plate maybe was

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.930
busy was gonna sandwich or something

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.590
and i lo and behold the you know what
happens when a poisonous snake bite you

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:05.850
you know I you die and I bet you

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.179
that his last thoughts were not God why
have you forsaken me

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.180
I bet you you've bought what did I do
wrong

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.660
that I wasn't pure enough for got that's
probably the case but the thing that I

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:17.819
worry about is that

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.440
obviously the sends the wrong message to
people that believe in his religion

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.700
you should immediately seek medical
attention if you get bitten by states

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.319
make you should seek medical attention
if you have any type

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:32.330
illness that requires medical attention
you oftentimes you hear stories about

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.370
some of these you know what your
religious people this is not a blanket

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:37.959
statement about all religious people

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.980
but those who don't believe in medical
attention right their child will get

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:44.120
sick with cancer in the refuse
chemotherapy and stuff like that

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.580
its unbelievably unacceptable that's
child abuse

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.000
you absolutely need to get help
immediately

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.459
but this guy actually got arrested back
in 2008 because he had 74 snakes in his

00:02:55.459 --> 00:02:56.170
home

00:02:56.170 --> 00:03:00.989
she spent and and you know he's got his
family at home

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.409
en banc is a third-generation serpent
handler

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.800
okay or was a third-generation certain
handler

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.360
and he had wanted to pass on the trade
to is adult son

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.260
little coding okay well Cody K

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.450
believe me not something you want to go
from pops okay

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.019
I N you see the result of that now look
some people might think we should have

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.129
more sympathy tourism

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.420
years pass away to be honest with you I
don't have much

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.959
I have some sympathy looking comes from
a family that practice this for a very

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.959
long time again he's a third generation
circuit handler so he grew up in that

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:36.750
environment

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.640
I don't think he knew better he got
bitten several times prior to this

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:41.310
incident

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.590
and nothing happened to him so he
probably thought it would be fine I have

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.860
some sympathy for him and his family so
I do too I'm not heartless but at the

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.879
same time

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:52.010

do it and sometimes what a poisonous

snake bites you you know I

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.870
and as i mean you've got it has to do
with science so stop it

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.590

whenever somebody dies you feel bad I do

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.169
