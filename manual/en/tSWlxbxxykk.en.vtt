Hmm, I can’t decide? Is it refreshing to
see a Bible based movie where the controversy

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.720
ISN’T about religion? You’re watching
Beyond The Trailer’s review of

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:11.720
Exodus Gods and Kings...

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.720
Since the beginning of film itself, the ancient egyptians
have been portrayed as white. Elizabeth Taylor

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:57.979
famously played Cleopatra, while Charlton
Heston and Yul Brynner - half Russian and

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:03.100
half Mongolian - played Moses and Rameses
in The Ten Commandments. And no one said anything.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.100
In fact, those films are highly regarded - as
they should be, quality films whose casting

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.570
choices were a product of their times. But
what times do we live in currently? There

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.520
has now been much debate as to what Ancient
Egyptians actually looked like, and many point

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.259
to the way in which they depicted themselves
- as having dark skin. Yet still, the only

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:27.469
mainstream portrayal of dark skinned Ancient
Egyptians was in the music video for Michael

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:32.789
Jackson’s Remember the Time. Even 1999’s
reboot of The Mummy franchise featured South

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.119
African actor Arnold Vosloo - of Dutch and
German descent - as well as Israeli actor

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.930
Oded Fehr. Now Ridley Scott, the director
of Hollywood’s latest telling of The Ten

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.429
Commandments, argues that he couldn’t get
the necessary funding for this kind of blockbuster

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:51.909
with “Mohamed So-and-So” in the lead role.
But is he simply in...de-nile? Since when

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:56.609
does Joel Edgerton sell tickets? And John
Turturro and Sigourney Weaver as the Pharaoh

00:01:56.609 --> 00:02:02.320
and his Queen? Look, keep Christian Bale,
but why not reach out to the many actors working

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.570
TODAY in Bollywood, the Middle East and Egypt
itself? Or find an undiscovered talent? Barkhad

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.129
Abdi was a Somali immigrant working as a limo
driver in Minneapolis when Paul Greengrass

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:18.230
decided he wanted to cast authentic Somali
pirates in Captain Phillips. Abdi went on

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:23.290
to get an Oscar nomination! This is the question
many moviegoers are asking, and it might be

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.480
one that Hollywood will have to consider if
those moviegoers stay home. But will they

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.900
stay home? Exodus Gods and Kings has suddenly
found itself as a litmus test for where we

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.540
stand today on the Hollywood tradition of
whitewashing. And while some people are definitely

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.489
upset by white actors in the lead roles standing
next to actors of color used as extras, the

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.879
combination of Scott and Bale in a visual
effects heavy blockbuster might be too hard

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:52.599
to resist. And maybe, just maybe, Fox is betting
- hoping - that those upset by the casting

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.840
in Exodus the vocal MINORITY, and the majority
still doesn’t care. So while we won’t

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.159
know if moviegoers care until the box office
numbers start coming in, right now? Let’s

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.840
see if Exodus Gods and Kings is even a movie
worth arguing about at all...
