00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
One morning in August 2010, federal agents
stormed the home of Clara and Josefina,

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:23.230
two sisters raising their three small children together.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.230
The agents handcuffed Clara in front of the
kids, then loaded them into separate vehicles.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.859
When Josefina got home from work later that morning,

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:42.859
she was arrested by Immigration and Customs
Enforcement, ICE, at her door.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.250
While in custody, the two moms found out that
they’d been the victims of a botched drug bust.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:08.520
The federal agents found no drugs, and CPS
found no evidence of maltreatment.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.250
But, because the sisters are undocumented immigrants, 
ICE kept them in detention for four months.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.650
For those four months, the mothers had no
contact with their children, two of whom are

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.180
US citizens. &nbsp;

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.550
Then, without notice, ICE dropped the two
mothers at the U.S.-Mexico border.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.430
They had little idea where their children
were, except that they had been put into foster care,

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.370
with strangers.&nbsp;

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:40.630
Under the Obama administration, a record-breaking
400,000 people were deported last year.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.780
These families have seen first-hand how immigration
enforcement can tear children from their parents.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.300
Because they’re locked up, the foster care
process moves forward without them.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:57.560
It effectively puts borders on parenthood
itself.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.560
The Applied Research Center’s groundbreaking
new report, “Shattered Families,”

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.480
is the first national study to explore how
children whose parents are detained and deported

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:09.489
are placed in foster care.

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.409
Over the last year, ARC surveyed foster care
agencies and child welfare lawyers in communities

00:02:14.409 --> 00:02:15.450
across the U.S.,

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:22.450
and interviewed hundreds of caseworkers, policymakers,
judges, attorneys, and foreign consulates,

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.069
as well as mothers and fathers who are held
in detention centers or who’ve been deported.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.730
ARC estimates that well over
5,000 children currently in foster care

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.599
are threatened with extended or permanent
separation when their parents are detained

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:38.499
or deported.

00:02:38.499 --> 00:02:45.049
If immigration and child welfare policy doesn’t
change, another 15,000 may follow in the next

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:47.409
five years.

00:02:47.409 --> 00:02:52.439
As one child welfare attorney told us, “once
parents are deported, they’re treated like

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:54.189
they fall off the face of the earth.”

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.189
This is a growing problem because the federal
government now requires

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.340
most local law enforcement to check immigration
status.&nbsp;

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:06.129
A routine traffic stop can lead to unimaginable
consequences.

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:10.909
Mothers that ARC spoke to in detention told
us about calling the police on an abusive partner,

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:14.290
only to find themselves having their own status
checked.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:19.329
Once detained,&nbsp;most parents were completely
excluded from decisions about the well-being

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.109
of their children.

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:26.689
One parental rights advocate told us about
a mother that couldn’t be found for seven months,

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:32.249
because ICE had transferred her from New York
to Pennsylvania to Arizona without informing

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:34.060
anyone.

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:41.029
ARC also found that many CPS systems and Child
Protective Courts are biased against reuniting children

00:03:41.029 --> 00:03:46.159
with their own parents in another country,
or with an undocumented family member in the U.S.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:48.560
So the children stay in foster care.

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.139
This goes against clear research that children
are better off with their own families

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:58.659
and it also violates CPS’ federal mandate
to reunite families.&nbsp;

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.989
And Clara and Josefina?

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:08.989
After more than a year without seeing their
three kids, their family was reunited in Mexico.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.730
But everything isn’t back to normal.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.210
Josefina's son was only 9 months when ICE
kicked down the door.

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:29.110
He’s now almost two years old; he’s spent
more of his life in foster care than with

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.360
his own mother.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:34.730
In some ways, they are among the lucky ones.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.890
Over 5,000 children with detained or deported
parents are currently in the foster care system.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.190
Many will never see their birth-mother or
father again.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.470
And unless something is done, thousands more
will follow.
