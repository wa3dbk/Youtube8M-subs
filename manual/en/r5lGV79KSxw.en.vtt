00:00:07.656 --> 00:00:09.962
Welcome to the Speedmaster
Video Manual.

00:00:10.452 --> 00:00:12.893
Positioned on the side of the watch
is the crown,

00:00:13.013 --> 00:00:16.067
which is used for setting the time
and winding the watch.

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:18.292
A single full winding per day

00:00:18.412 --> 00:00:21.161
is all that's needed
for the watch to function properly.

00:00:21.281 --> 00:00:22.423
To wind the watch,

00:00:22.543 --> 00:00:25.229
turn the crown forward
until it stops.

00:00:28.037 --> 00:00:29.205
To set the time,

00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:32.241
pull the crown out one click
to its furthest position.

00:00:33.612 --> 00:00:35.709
Turn the crown forward or backward

00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.869
to move the hour and minute hands
to the desired time.

00:00:42.315 --> 00:00:44.004
When the settings are completed,

00:00:44.124 --> 00:00:46.372
make sure
the crown is in position 1.

00:00:49.154 --> 00:00:51.678
The chronograph is used
for measuring time periods

00:00:51.798 --> 00:00:53.305
of up to 12 hours.

00:00:54.602 --> 00:00:56.393
To start or stop timing,

00:00:56.513 --> 00:00:59.150
press the upper pusher
located at 2 o'clock.

00:01:08.704 --> 00:01:10.415
To reset the chronograph hands,

00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:13.025
press the lower pusher
located at 4 o'clock.

00:01:21.271 --> 00:01:23.461
For ease of reading
in low-light conditions,

00:01:23.581 --> 00:01:25.527
the watch's hands
and applied indexes

00:01:25.647 --> 00:01:27.185
are coated with Super-LumiNova

00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:29.063
which emits a green light.

00:01:35.949 --> 00:01:37.694
The average speed of a moving object

00:01:37.814 --> 00:01:39.592
can be measured with
your Speedmaster

00:01:39.712 --> 00:01:41.548
by using the
central chronograph hand

00:01:41.668 --> 00:01:44.078
in conjunction with the
watch's tachymetric scale.

00:01:44.624 --> 00:01:46.366
For example the speed of a car

00:01:46.486 --> 00:01:49.269
can be measured
over a set distance of 1 kilometre.

00:01:49.963 --> 00:01:52.414
Press the upper pusher
located at 2 o'clock

00:01:52.534 --> 00:01:54.021
to start the measurement.

00:01:55.485 --> 00:01:58.082
When the car has reached
a distance of 1 kilometre,

00:01:58.202 --> 00:02:00.538
press the pusher again
to stop the measurement,

00:02:00.658 --> 00:02:02.962
and read the value
on the bezel's scale.

00:02:05.086 --> 00:02:08.209
In our case the car has covered
the distance in 30 seconds.

00:02:08.522 --> 00:02:09.419
Therefore

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.227
it's traveling at an average speed
of 120 kilometres per hour.

00:02:16.871 --> 00:02:18.759
Thank you
for watching this video manual.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:21.088
We hope
you enjoy your Speedmaster.
