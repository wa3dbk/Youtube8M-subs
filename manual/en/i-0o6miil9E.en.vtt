bjbj j{pQ This really isn t a dead cat on
a pole. It s actually a microphone. We ll

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:15.780
show you how to use it more on this episode
of tips and tracks. So this is a boom microphone.

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:21.359
The primary component of this is the actual
boom pole itself which is attached to the

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:25.849
rest of the microphone. We ll take off the
wind screen here so we can see our different

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:32.790
components. The technical term for this is
a windscreen, although it s sometimes referred

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:38.650
to jokingly as a dead cat, dead muskrat, what
have you. This one has kind of a furry covering

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:46.980
on it but there s others that are just foam.
The actual structure here is called a zeppelin.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.830
What you do with this is attach a microphone
right in the middle. We re using a shotgun

00:00:52.830 --> 00:01:00.570
here. This is the most typical type of microphone
that gets used in a boom mic. They are shotgun

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.420
because they re directional. They don t pick
up any sound from longer distances. They re

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:13.149
simply very directional microphones and a
good choice for using on a boom pole because

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:20.340
you re trying to get the sound from a specific
person or location. The idea is you d hold

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:38.630
it over your head like so and be able to aim
the microphone over your subject. 

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.889
This one uses just a regular XLR connection
and then there s an XLR cable here at the

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:51.090
bottom. We ve strung this through already
ourselves. You could use a wireless mic too

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.939
if you want it. Inside the actual zeppelin
is a shock mount which is where we have attached

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:03.219
this particular microphone. So as far as connecting
this microphone to your camcorder or other

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:09.049
audio recorder it s basically just using an
XLR connection or an adapter. You can also

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:14.810
use a field audio mixer but don t forget to
use headphones, particularly with an extension

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.799
cable so you can make sure that whatever you
re aiming the microphone at is what you actually

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:30.909
intended to record. 

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:38.120
The main way to support a boom pole is over
your shoulders. This will give your arm muscles

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.280
a break although after a while, even though
the pole itself is light and the microphone

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.530
doesn t weigh very much, it ll feel heavy
in a few minutes. The best way to use a boom

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.640
pole is to get as close as you possibly can
to your subject without actually getting part

00:02:53.640 --> 00:03:00.219
of the boom into the scene. The best way to
accomplish this is overhead but then sometimes

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:06.269
depending upon how the shot is composed you
might have better luck going from underneath

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.790
but then you probably want to crouch down
a little bit so that your body weight is supported

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.939
better. Another important point is that like
any object that s subjected to light a boom

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:22.129
will cast shadows, so it s really important
to keep in touch with your camera operator

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.730
to make sure that no shadows are being cast
that will show up on your video. So proper

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:26.730
use of a boom pole will give you some of the
best sound that you can acquire. It does require

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:27.730
some upper body strength but the results are
well worth it. [End of Audio] Using a Boom
