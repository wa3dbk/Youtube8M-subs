00:00:01.068 --> 00:00:03.303
IN THE ANGELES CREST
NATIONAL FOREST,

00:00:03.337 --> 00:00:06.707
A PLACE WHERE I CAN FIND
AN ANIMAL AND SLAY IT

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.109
AND SKIN IT
AND THEN DEVOUR IT.

00:00:09.142 --> 00:00:10.611
AND I'M HERE UNDER COVER
OF DARKNESS

00:00:10.644 --> 00:00:11.945
BECAUSE THERE SIMPLY
WASN'T TIME

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:13.947
TO ARRANGE
FOR THE NECESSARY PERMITS,

00:00:13.981 --> 00:00:16.550
AND SO WE'RE--
WE'RE JUST DOING IT THIS WAY.

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:18.151
I'M ACCOMPANIED
BY MY FATHER-IN-LAW,

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:20.120
JACK WALTHALL,
WHO BROUGHT ALONG THE RIFLE

00:00:20.153 --> 00:00:23.056
AND THE HUNTING SMARTS AND ALSO
THE RUGGED INDIVIDUALISM

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.291
OF A BYGONE ERA, RIGHT?

00:00:24.324 --> 00:00:25.459
- HELLO.
- VERY GOOD.

00:00:25.492 --> 00:00:27.060
NOW, JACK, YOU HAD A VERY

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:30.664
INTERESTING AND SORT OF
CLEVER-SOUNDING HUNTING PLOY.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:32.165
YOU CARE TO SHARE THAT WITH US?
- OH.

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:34.701
WELL, IT'S NOT REALLY
MY IDEA, FORREST.

00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:38.138
IT'S S.O.P.--IT'S STANDARD
OPERATING...SOMETHING ELSE.

00:00:38.172 --> 00:00:39.206
- UH, RIGHT.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.041
- IT'S DOE'S SCENT.

00:00:41.074 --> 00:00:44.645
IT'S ESTRUS URINE OF A DOE.

00:00:44.678 --> 00:00:47.347
NOW, THIS WILL ATTRACT A BUCK,
AND THEN ALL YOU NEED TO DO

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:49.316
IS FIRE A BULLET OFF
AT HIS VITAL ORGANS,

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:52.019
AND YOU'RE IN BUSINESS.
- YES, GOOD. OKAY.

00:00:52.052 --> 00:00:54.188
VERY GOOD.
THAT'S PRETTY INGENIOUS.

00:00:54.221 --> 00:00:55.889
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE,
BUT I'M ABOUT TO TAKE IT

00:00:55.923 --> 00:00:57.891
A BIG STEP FORWARD.

00:00:57.925 --> 00:01:00.594
JOSH, WILL YOU PLEASE BRING
THE DOE-COY OUT HERE, WON'T YOU?

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:02.229
- OKAY.
- I HAPPENED TO BE IN POSSESSION

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:05.098
OF A NONRETURNABLE
$4,000 SEX DOLL,

00:01:05.132 --> 00:01:08.068
AND I WAS EAGER TO FIND
ALTERNATE USES FOR HER.

00:01:08.068 --> 00:01:10.070
HER SPECIFIC TALENT SEEMED
PERFECT FOR TONIGHT'S MISSION.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.371
- WHAT IS THAT?

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:13.106
IT LOOKS LIKE
A BEAUTIFUL DEAD LADY.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:17.077
- YES, WELL, ON ANY OTHER NIGHT,
PERHAPS, BUT TONIGHT SHE IS

00:01:17.077 --> 00:01:20.681
THE SEXIEST DOE IN ALL
OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

00:01:20.714 --> 00:01:22.182
OH, THAT LOOKS GREAT!

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:23.750
THAT'S EVEN BETTER THAN
I THOUGHT IT WOULD LOOK.

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:24.852
- I'VE SEEN WORSE IN BARS,
I'LL TELL YOU.

00:01:24.885 --> 00:01:26.119
- [laughs]
- YOU HAVE?

00:01:26.153 --> 00:01:27.454
- THAT'S FANTASTIC.

00:01:27.487 --> 00:01:29.189
HEY, COME AND GET HER,
ALL YOU BUCKS!

00:01:29.223 --> 00:01:31.458
TRUST ME, SHE'S NO PRUDE!
[laughter]

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.527
- SHE'S INTO WHATEVER
YOU'RE INTO!

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.295
[laughter]
- THAT'S GREAT.

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:36.597
HEY, JOSH, YOU BROUGHT
THE BOLT CUTTERS, RIGHT?

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.698
- YEAH, YEAH.
- OKAY, GOOD.

00:01:37.731 --> 00:01:39.733
IN TRUTH, THE IDEA OF A FIREARM

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.935
IN THE HANDS
OF A 75-YEAR-OLD MAN

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:43.804
IN LOW-VISIBILITY CONDITIONS

00:01:43.837 --> 00:01:46.306
MADE ME TERRIBLY NERVOUS,
BUT I WAS DETERMINED

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.909
TO CARRY ON FOR THE SAKE
OF HUMAN UNDERSTANDING.

00:01:48.942 --> 00:01:50.611
WELL, IT DOES SEEM
A LITTLE BIT CRUEL

00:01:50.644 --> 00:01:52.446
TO GET THE BUCKS' HOPES UP
LIKE THIS, YOU KNOW?

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.248
THEY THINK THEY'RE GONNA GET
SOME ACTION, RIGHT?

00:01:54.281 --> 00:01:56.383
[chuckles]
BUT WHEN YOU'RE HUNTING,

00:01:56.416 --> 00:01:57.951
YOU USE EVERY TOOL
AT YOUR DISPOSAL, RIGHT?

00:01:57.985 --> 00:01:59.920
WHETHER IT'S A GUN
OR A SUPERIOR INTELLECT.

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:02.489
NOW, MY QUESTION IS,
WHERE THE BEST PLACE--

00:02:02.523 --> 00:02:03.724
[tiger roars]
OH!

00:02:03.757 --> 00:02:05.092
[all screaming, tiger roaring]

00:02:05.125 --> 00:02:06.159
- WHAT THE HECK?
- MR. MACNEIL!

00:02:06.193 --> 00:02:07.761
[screaming, animals roaring]

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.796
- WHAT'S HAPPENED?
MR. MACNEIL!

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:11.765
- HE'S EATING ME!

00:02:11.798 --> 00:02:14.301
[screams]
[animals screeching]

00:02:14.334 --> 00:02:16.570
- MR. MACNEIL, WHERE ARE YOU?
- FORREST, WHERE ARE YOU?

00:02:16.603 --> 00:02:18.739
- THE TIGER IS ATTACKING ME!

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:21.275
THIS IS A GOD DAMN TIGER!
- I GOT HIM! I GOT HIM!

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:22.609
- HE'S OVER THERE!
- OH, GOD!

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:24.111
- OH, MY [bleep] GOD!

00:02:24.144 --> 00:02:25.646
[tiger growls]
- THERE'S A [bleep] TIGER!

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:27.514
- ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
- NO!

00:02:27.548 --> 00:02:29.149
- WHAT CAN WE DO TO HELP?

00:02:29.183 --> 00:02:30.317
- SHOOT THE TIGER!
- OH.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.085
STAND BACK.
- [screams]
