Astronomers using ESO\rquote
s world-leading HARPS instrument have discovered

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.320
a planetary system containing at least five
planets, orbiting the Sun-like star HD 10180.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.320
The researchers also believe the system has
two other planets, one of which would have

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.980
the lowe
st mass ever found, making the system similar

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:28.000
to our own Solar System in terms of the number
of planets. Furthermore, the scientists find

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.759
that the location of the planets follows a
regular pattern, as also seen in our own Solar

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:35.130

planet orbiting in 2200 days. The other, having
a mass of only about 1.4 times that of the

Earth would be the least massive exoplanet
ever discovered. This suspect

so it is likely to be very hot. One \lquote

\par }{\cf1
\par }{\cf1 The newly discovered Solar System

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:07.460
is unique in several respects. First of all,
with at least five Neptune-

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.670
like planets lying within a distance equivalent
to the orbit of Mars, this system is more

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.880
populated than our own Solar System in its
inner region, and has many more massive planets

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:25.390
there. Furthermore, the system probably has
no Jupiter-like gas giant. In

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:30.780
addition, all the planets seem to have almost
circular orbits. Dynamical studies of the

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.990
new system reveal complex interactions between
planets and give us insights into its long-term

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:38.500
evolution.
\par }{\cf1

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.850
\par }{\cf1 Using the new discovery as well
as data for other planetary systems, the astronomers

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.880
discovered that the locations of the planets
seem to follow a regular pattern \emdash similar

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.870
to the \ldblquote Titius-Bode\rdblquote
law that exists in our Solar System. This

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.620
could be a general signature of how planetary
systems form.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:03.230
\par }{\cf1
\par }{\cf1 Another important result is that

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.040
all very massive planetary systems are found
around massive and metal-rich stars, while

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:15.450
the four lowest-mass systems are found around
lower-mass and metal-poor stars. These properties

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.450
confirm current theore
tical models.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:22.370
\par There is no doubt that this remarkable
discovery highlights the fact that we are

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.340
now entering a new era in exoplanet science:
the study of complex planetary systems and

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.650
not just of individual planets!!
