Hi I’m Cheryl with Expert Village. And today
we’re going to make homemade brown sugar.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.530
Now I got this idea to make homemade brown
sugar last week when I went to make some cookies

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.030
and I was out of brown sugar and I didn’t
want to have to get in my car, go to the grocery

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:17.640
store and get brown sugar. So, I read that
you can make your own and it’s so easy.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.540
What you need to make homemade brown sugar
is plain white sugar and molasses, now the

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:30.180
ratio that I found that works great is two
cups of white sugar to one-third cup of molasses.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:32.880
And you’re going to need a kitchen aid as
well, and you want to make sure that on the

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.620
kitchen aid that use this attachment here
which is called the paddle attachment. So

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.170
what we’re going to do is we’re going
to take our sugar and we’re going to put

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:47.060
it in the bowl, just like that, and then we’re
going to add our one-third cup molasses, pour

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.520
it all the way in. And a good idea is to use
a spatula, that way you can get all the molasses

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.440
out of the container there. So we’re going
to go ahead and do that, and we’re going

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.460
to set that in, and then we’re going to
go ahead and put it on medium speed. And you

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:10.399
want to let it go for about four minutes,
and if you notice when you’re doing it,

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:13.760
you may get a little bit of molasses on the
side of the bowl. You can just go ahead and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.969
stop it and then just scrape it down and we’re
almost done here, this is looking great. And

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:27.140
go ahead and just keep it on medium speed
and you’ll never have to buy brown sugar

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:35.340
again. And if you get any of the molasses
sticking on the side of the bowl, just give

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:42.189
it a nice scrape. Scrape that down and this
is coming along, this just looks gorgeous

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:46.679
look at the color of that, this is so much
fun. Now there’s different kinds of brown

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:51.360
sugar, this is kind of a medium brown sugar,
some recipes will call for a darker brown

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.590
sugar. You can make it, adjust your recipe
just a little bit, I used a third of a cup

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.090
molasses, you can use just a little bit more
to give it a darker color and if you want

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.639
it even lighter, just add a little bit less
molasses. I find the brown sugar is so good

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:10.420
in your coffee, you can use it in barbeque
sauces, dressings, it’s so versatile and

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:18.200
it’s so great to say that you made it yourself.
Thanks so much for watching this is Cheryl

your own homemade brown sugar.
