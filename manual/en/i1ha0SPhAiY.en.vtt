Hi, we are at the Aquatics Palace again. Women are competing here today in 10m platform diving.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:28.500
Unfortunately, Yulia Timoshinina didn’t qualify for the final. But lets go to the pool anyway, to support our Ukrainian friend, and ask the visitors who they are supporting today.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.200
Who are you going to support today?

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.600
Russia of course. We know we didn’t qualify, but anyway.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:40.880
Russia

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.980
And have you heard that Russia is not competing today?

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.820
Everyone.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.940
Can you show us how you support our divers?

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.480
How will you be supporting divers today?

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.460
Loud.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.280
And I guess you will keep silent?

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:58.740
That’s the way I support.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.640
Is Russia competing in the final?

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:02.780
Answer my question first, and I will answer yours.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:03.480
For real?

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.980
Yes.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.440
I don’t know, we will be supporting very well and loud.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.080
Who will you be supporting?

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:14.400
The best of the best.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.980
Decent choice, thanks a lot. See you inside.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:27.420

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:33.780
