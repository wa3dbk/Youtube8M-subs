Hello and welcome to The Vegan Corner.

00:00:03.994 --> 00:00:08.703
Are you ready? You should be, because today
we have the recipe for something I really love:

00:00:08.713 --> 00:00:09.623
Hummus!

00:00:09.633 --> 00:00:14.120
This incredibly flavoursome spread or dip,
depending on how you live life,

00:00:14.173 --> 00:00:16.617
might look like an easy recipe.
And it is!

00:00:16.627 --> 00:00:19.897
But only if you know the exact
proportions of the ingredients.

00:00:19.907 --> 00:00:22.105
If you've tried to make
hummus in the past,

00:00:22.115 --> 00:00:25.105
count how many times
there was something slightly off.

00:00:25.115 --> 00:00:29.290
Whether it was too much garlic,
a lack of acidity, or the wrong taste.

00:00:29.372 --> 00:00:33.815
Well, today we want to break the curse
by offering you our recipe for hummus,

00:00:33.877 --> 00:00:36.867
and in the meantime,
we are also going to make it low fat,

00:00:36.877 --> 00:00:38.506
which never hurts, right?

00:00:38.516 --> 00:00:41.810
The ingredient list is
in the description below the video.

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.297
The recipe is pretty simple:

00:00:43.307 --> 00:00:47.476
place all the ingredients into a food
processor and blitz for roughly 3 minutes

00:00:47.486 --> 00:00:50.212
or until the hummus
is as smooth as you desire.

00:00:50.222 --> 00:00:53.071
If the blades don't catch
all the ingredients at first,

00:00:53.081 --> 00:00:56.801
simply scrape the sides of the container
with a spatula and blitz again.

00:00:56.811 --> 00:00:58.930
There are a few things
I'd like to mention.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.940
First, the garlic:
start with a small quantity!

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:04.874
Remember that you can always add,
but you can't remove it.

00:01:04.884 --> 00:01:08.289
So add, blend, taste
and add more if desired.

00:01:08.412 --> 00:01:11.597
Now, hummus is a preparation
that contains chickpeas,

00:01:11.607 --> 00:01:14.685
so you'll probably be surprised
to hear that a good hummus

00:01:14.695 --> 00:01:17.924
contains only 30 to 40 percent chickpeas.

00:01:18.018 --> 00:01:21.568
This is exactly why most fat-free hummus
you'll stumble upon

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:22.908
are weird-tasting,

00:01:22.918 --> 00:01:26.507
because if you completely remove
the oil and the tahini from the equation,

00:01:26.517 --> 00:01:28.275
you distort the proportions

00:01:28.285 --> 00:01:33.027
and you will also obviously end up
with a sour-tasting chickpeas-based puree.

00:01:33.162 --> 00:01:35.977
The tahini is also
a fundamental piece of the puzzle

00:01:35.987 --> 00:01:38.752
as its nutty flavour
really makes a difference.

00:01:38.762 --> 00:01:41.382
For this reason we didn't
completely remove it,

00:01:41.392 --> 00:01:46.300
but simply diminished it's quantity as much
as possible to still obtain a great final dish.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:49.435
This makes our hummus
not a completely fat free version,

00:01:49.445 --> 00:01:52.479
but simply a low fat one,
which has a third of the fat

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:55.987
of any other reduced fat hummus
I've ever seen on the market.

00:01:55.997 --> 00:01:59.031
Of course you are free to cut down
the tahini even more if you wish,

00:01:59.041 --> 00:02:01.917
but do so knowing that
the more you lower its quantity,

00:02:01.927 --> 00:02:04.007
the more you compromise
the final flavour.

00:02:04.017 --> 00:02:09.021
The oil, which generally accounts for another
30 percent of the weight of store-bought hummus,

00:02:09.031 --> 00:02:12.533
has been completely removed
and replaced with soft tofu,

00:02:12.586 --> 00:02:16.951
which has very little taste,
very little fat and a lot of creaminess.

00:02:17.063 --> 00:02:19.513
Our final note is a bit of a salty one.

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:21.902
The quantity of salt
mentioned in the ingredients

00:02:21.912 --> 00:02:25.137
is to obtain a hummus
that tastes like the store-bought one,

00:02:25.147 --> 00:02:30.447
but I recommend you add it a little at the time
until you reach the right level of savouriness.

00:02:30.615 --> 00:02:34.809
And the hummus is ready. Wasn't it one
of the easiest recipes you've ever seen?

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.061
If, for any reason, you believe
that there is still room for improvement,

00:02:38.071 --> 00:02:40.504
then you now you have
a recipe to start from!

00:02:40.514 --> 00:02:44.124
But it did take me 86 attempts
to perfect this recipe,

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:46.751
so remember that when
you are about to deface it.

00:02:46.761 --> 00:02:50.823
If you enjoyed this recipe, please don't forget
to give it a thumbs up before moving on,

00:02:50.833 --> 00:02:54.315
and if you have any question or concern,

00:02:54.325 --> 00:02:58.175
Many thanks for watching
and I hope to see you for our next video.
