00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.760
Preserve your travel memories forever in stylish
coin bezels as jewelry, key chains and more.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:20.560
Learn how to measure your foreign currency
accurately to find the perfect bezel for you

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.770
coin using this guide from Esslinger-dot-com.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.890
Be aware that just knowing what type of coin
you have is not a guarantee for finding the

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.090
right sized bezel. Not all coins are minted
completely identically so you should always

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.420
measure your coin before ordering a bezel.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.980
You will need:
A digital gauge

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.739
A piece of paper

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.070
Start by taking the coin you wish to place
in a coin bezel and laying it out flat on

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.749
your work surface.

00:00:54.749 --> 00:00:59.640
You will use your digital gauge to first measure
the diameter of your coin. Set your gauge

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.820
to millimeters and holding it over the coin,
open the jaws of the gauge wider than the

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.750
coin.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.710
Close the jaws of your gauge until they grip
either side of the coin, as close to the diameter

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:17.710
as you get. Record the measurement.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:25.590
Repeat this process and measure the diameter
of the coin at least two more times so you

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:32.280
can be sure you have an accurate diameter
measurement. If the coin's edges are worn

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.280
down, you should be extra sure to take multiple
measurements and get an average diameter.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.910
Once you have a solid diameter measurement,
pick up the coin and hold it between your

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.680
fingers like this so you can measure the thickness.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.840
Take your digital gauge in your free hand
and open the jaws wider than the thickness

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.530
of the coin.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.100
Position the open jaws of the gauge on either
side of the coin and close them until the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:12.100
gauge grips the coin securely. Record the
thickness.

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.859
With both the diameter and thickness measurements
recorded you can order a bezel that will fit

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:34.340
your coin by comparing your measurements to
a sizing chart.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.319

bezel, check out this guide. Or, to learn
