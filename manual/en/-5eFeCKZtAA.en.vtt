00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:06.240
Hi! My name is Mike Lumley. On behalf of Expert
Village, I'm here to teach you pitching. Okay,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.740
now we're moving ourselves around. We're going
to move ourselves now to 3rd base. What I

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.670
would challenge the left handers to do is
kind of look like they're looking at mirror

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:22.759
right now as this was a first base move. What
we're going to do here is we're going to work

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:29.489
on our angles here. I've got a line that's
approximately 45 degrees, which is technically

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:35.020
not a rule in the rule book. There is no such
thing as 45 degree angle, but you'll often

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:42.600
get many umpires that say anyone pass 45.
In a sense, it's a bit of judgment with the

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:49.480
rule. The rule is on momentum, so if I momentum
is carrying myself towards home, I can't throw

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.840
back to 3rd base or vice versa on the other
side. With 1st base I can't go home and then

00:00:55.840 --> 00:01:02.230
pick to 1st base. I'm going to give you 3
levels of this pickoff, and they're more of

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.979
a setup, and there's a couple different phases.
The first part I'm going to work on is just

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:15.450
basic straight on and give you head movement,
that type of thing. As a pitcher, normally

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:21.360
when I'm pitching home I watch my base runners
as long as I can. Last minute, I pick up the

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:30.850
plate. I'm not sure exactly what it is, but
there's this big thought that was are deceiving

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:38.810
a runner by giving a big look home or almost
I call it, it's a big fake home. What we're

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:45.270
trying to do here, is the first one, which
I'll call our C-move, is that we're going

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.479
to look away early. When I pick, I'm going
to step directly at 3rd base and then I'm

00:01:52.479 --> 00:02:02.170
going to look away early. Big fake, step,
and throw. Every time I want to make sure

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:09.229
when I finish, I'm just going to come and
walk myself right to back. If you watch here

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.650
on our balance point, the same thing exactly
as we were. Another crucial reason why we

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.870
work on our balance stage. We here right in
the balance stage, look away, some back, and

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:20.239
throw.
