00:00:01.999 --> 00:00:05.918
I knew this lad that was a right little urchin he just didn't get it at school

00:00:05.918 --> 00:00:10.083
He was always bunking off and walked out of school with no qualifications at all

00:00:10.083 --> 00:00:14.167
He could have gone either way luckily he found carp fishing

00:00:14.167 --> 00:00:19.626
Carp fishing saved me I was that boy and I've always recognised that

00:00:19.626 --> 00:00:24.959
I've had a great life out of carp fishing and I'm now in a position where I can put something back

00:00:24.959 --> 00:00:29.083
So an idea that I've had for a few years finally came to fruition

00:00:30.584 --> 00:00:32.667
The Nashional Carp Academy

00:00:35.792 --> 00:00:38.751
What is the Nashional Carp Academy?

00:00:38.751 --> 00:00:43.417
It involves combining two vocational qualifications in a unique way

00:00:43.417 --> 00:00:47.209
It is something that has never been done before as far as I know

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:52.417
The students study BTEC fish husbandry and BTEC business

00:00:52.417 --> 00:00:59.125
That way they are learning about practical skills maintaining the bankside

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:02.709
and also the business side of fishing

00:01:02.709 --> 00:01:09.626
So anything from marketing to finance to how to run the warehouse successfully

00:01:09.626 --> 00:01:10.626
That sort of thing..

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.209
Today we are down at Bayeswater fishery near Chelmsford in Essex I'm down here with a group of kids from a local academy

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:24.876
which is one of our local schools in Essex called Greensward Academy

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:28.417
I've been working with the group of kids for approximately the last 10 months

00:01:28.417 --> 00:01:32.876
going into school and involving them in what we do at Nash

00:01:32.876 --> 00:01:35.834
A working day or a working week

00:01:35.834 --> 00:01:38.501
and getting involved with what they are doing with regards to some of their subjects

00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:40.417
Their English their maths and science

00:01:40.417 --> 00:01:43.459
Today is basically the end of year end of term

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:47.751
Its the summer holidays so we have all met up and we are going on our first night fishing session

00:01:47.751 --> 00:01:55.584
Basically a bit of a jolly they have worked hard all year so its nice to get out on the bank and spend a bit of time catching fish

00:01:57.584 --> 00:02:02.501
My name is Henry Sadler and we are here today for a night session

00:02:02.501 --> 00:02:05.876
Are you enjoying the course?

00:02:05.876 --> 00:02:10.918
I thought it was going to be just another normal lesson

00:02:10.918 --> 00:02:15.167
but when I started getting into it I enjoyed it a lot

00:02:15.167 --> 00:02:20.083
Some parts are harder in class but some are quite easy

00:02:20.083 --> 00:02:27.083
Alan has helped us a lot giving us notebooks and Powerpoint presentations since he has been doing that for us it has been a lot easier

00:02:27.584 --> 00:02:30.751
So it's more than just going fishing?

00:02:30.751 --> 00:02:35.292
I really do believe it teaches more than just how to cast how to catch fish

00:02:35.292 --> 00:02:40.501
It teaches you about the countryside the wildlife habitats ecosystems

00:02:40.501 --> 00:02:44.459
It teaches you about respect for not only those but to respect other anglers

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:51.792
It teaches you that you don't drop litter you just don't do it but we live in a world and a country where it is common

00:02:52.584 --> 00:02:54.918
You see anglers won't do that

00:02:54.918 --> 00:03:05.667
As much as it teaches you about angling it also teaches you about life you form friendships in fishing and I think its a great sport pastime

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:10.000
whatever you want to call it where people come together with the same goal of enjoying themselves on the bank

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:17.417
Its nice to see kids that hadn't experienced that in such a short space of time become what I would class as anglers

00:03:28.751 --> 00:03:30.792
What do you like about the course?

00:03:31.083 --> 00:03:35.542
I think its good doing stuff like this on a nice day

00:03:35.542 --> 00:03:37.501
to come down to Bayeswater fishery

00:03:37.501 --> 00:03:45.042
We go out fishing every Friday I suppose it's better than being at school

00:03:45.042 --> 00:03:51.250
On a Monday we learn about the business side of fishing but yeah its good

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:53.292
Learning how to run your own fishery

00:03:53.292 --> 00:03:59.751
I wasn't an angler myself when I first started but as soon as I started I just wanted to go out and fish really

00:03:59.751 --> 00:04:02.375
Its a hobby now I love doing it

00:04:03.542 --> 00:04:07.417
Do you go fishing in your spare time now?

00:04:07.417 --> 00:04:14.959
Most weekends I do I normally go with my older brother its become quite a big competition between us two now

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:21.417
Since this course started he has been really jealous that I have got to be part of the Nashional Academy

00:04:21.918 --> 00:04:24.209
What have you learned?

00:04:24.209 --> 00:04:26.792
I've learned how to cast accurately

00:04:26.792 --> 00:04:28.751
From rigs to watercraft

00:04:28.751 --> 00:04:33.709
Everything really the basics how to make our own bait

00:04:33.709 --> 00:04:36.667
Also we've been to Shuttleworth college

00:04:36.667 --> 00:04:42.000
We've been to colleges and trade shows learning how it actually really is

00:04:42.918 --> 00:04:46.083
...and your favourite moment?

00:04:46.083 --> 00:04:55.667
Probably the first time I went actually I think we went down to Birketts Hall fishery and it was one of the first matches I'd ever done and I won it

00:04:55.667 --> 00:04:57.334
It was just a good experience really

00:04:57.334 --> 00:05:00.876
My favourite time is when we went to the office lake at Nash

00:05:01.501 --> 00:05:03.999
What about PB's?

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:06.999
17lb 8oz that was a nice mirror

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:08.876
23lb 8oz

00:05:09.209 --> 00:05:11.209
Mine is 17lb 8oz

00:05:11.209 --> 00:05:14.918
I didn't catch mine on the course but mine is 18lb

00:05:14.918 --> 00:05:20.250
I'm trying to catch a 20 and I annoyed my brother when I caught the 17lb 8oz

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.626
and he's gone out and caught a 22lb 6oz so now I've got to try and beat him

00:05:28.667 --> 00:05:30.999
Do you have a dream job in fishing?

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:32.709
I'd probably say design

00:05:32.709 --> 00:05:34.709
Mine would be product design too

00:05:34.709 --> 00:05:36.709
Mine would probably be the same as well

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:37.584
All three product design?

00:05:37.584 --> 00:05:38.042
Yeah

00:05:38.042 --> 00:05:38.667
I love it

00:05:38.667 --> 00:05:39.584
Do you like it?

00:05:39.584 --> 00:05:40.626
Yeah I love it

00:05:40.626 --> 00:05:41.542
What do you like about it?

00:05:45.083 --> 00:05:52.626
It has been very rewarding personally to see the difference that it has made to a lot of these kid's lives particularly within school

00:05:52.626 --> 00:06:00.667
You've got numerous students who have been fairly disengaged with the traditional educational process

00:06:00.667 --> 00:06:04.417
I feel that this course has helped to reintegrate them to a certain extent

00:06:04.417 --> 00:06:13.918
Its kept them out of trouble in school and out of school they have now got a
worthwhile interest rather than just messing around on the computer all day

00:06:13.918 --> 00:06:17.000
they are out on the bank fishing every weekend which is great

00:06:17.834 --> 00:06:21.751
and this is a lovely 17lb 8oz linear that we've just caught

00:06:23.709 --> 00:06:24.876
Pukka!

00:06:25.459 --> 00:06:31.417
They have done exceptionally well they have done all their work they have passed this year which is really important

00:06:31.417 --> 00:06:35.375
and it has been so nice to see the change in them

00:06:35.375 --> 00:06:39.334
I met the kids back in September and they had held a rod but they weren't anglers

00:06:39.334 --> 00:06:43.667
and to see them now 10 months down the line its just brilliant

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:46.876
Carp fishing is a great sport

00:06:46.876 --> 00:06:53.125
It gets kids out and respecting the countryside and nature most importantly it keeps them out of trouble and off the streets

00:06:53.125 --> 00:06:58.417
It can only be good for the youngsters their families and society as a whole
