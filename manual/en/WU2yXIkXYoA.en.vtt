Peaceful streams, tranquil waterfalls and

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.440
greenery take center stage as you wander through
the Kubota Gardens and forget the worries

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.640
of everyday life.\par
Located in Seattle\rquote s Rainier Beach

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.369
neighborhood, the Kubota Garden features 20
acres of eye pleasing scenery and a history

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.130
more than 85 years old.\par
Fujitaro Kubota was one of the first Japanese

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.820
American landscapers and is credited with
bringing Japanese style gardening to the Northwest.\par

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.000
In 1927, he purchased 5 acres of property
and the Kubota Garden came to life.\par

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.300
Now a historical landmark, the garden is entered
through a bronze gate which offers a glimpse

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.941
of the sights you are about to encounter.\par
Throughout the garden, you\rquote ll see of

00:00:50.941 --> 00:00:55.969
a multitude of plants and several stopping
points including the Traditional Japanese

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.469
Garden.\par
Mary Anne Parmeter is on the Board of Directors

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:04.830
of the Kubota Garden Foundation.\par
The foundation, along with the city of Seattle\rquote

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.860
s Parks and Recreation Department, work together
to keep the garden in its natural state of

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:15.970
beauty, so the public can enjoy it year-round.\par
Again, very traditional with the pond, the

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:25.119
stone bridge, the pruned pines, enclosed,
and um, I think it\rquote s very peaceful,

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.179
tranquil here.\par
It\rquote s also a very hopeful place because

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:35.569
the Kubota\rquote s were interned for four
years at Minidoka during the Second World

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:41.940
War and yet they still had the courage and
vision to return here and continue to build

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.560
the garden. And after mister Kubota\rquote
s death, the family very much wanted it to

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.360
be a public garden. So today everyone in the
city can visit.\par

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.069
There are many trails throughout the garden
including wide paved paths offering grand

00:01:57.069 --> 00:02:01.679
views and narrow stone steps crowded by massive
green foliage.\par

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:07.600
The plants and trees, like the 32-foot long
Weeping Blue Atlas Cedar, are an incredible

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.200
sight. But some of the structures throughout
the garden, like the Moon Bridge, are designed

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.340
to capture your attention as well.\par
A moon bridge, ah, is supposed to remind you

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.140
of the difficulties of living a good life.
If you try to cross the Moon Bridge, you find

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.840
that walking up is hard and walking down is
hard. So it\rquote s hard to live a good life

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:37.640
all the time, but you can.\par
In 1962, the Kubota family built the mountainside

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:42.780
in time for the World\rquote s Fair.\par
It features waterfalls, reflecting pools and

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:51.070
more than 400 tons of stone to offer visitors
a snapshot of Japanese mountain scenery.\par

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:55.460
People of all ages love to wander through
the Kubota Garden. There is no fee to enter

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:59.550
and free guided tours are available for groups
of 8 or more.\par

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:03.360
As Mary Anne explains, there\rquote s something
at the garden for everyone.\par

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:09.260
It\rquote s unique because it\rquote s both
Eastern and Western and when people come here

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:17.050
they really enjoy the energy of the Western
garden and the beauty of the Eastern parts.\par

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:23.231
This is the Kubota Garden and it\rquote s
a lot more than just a pretty place. I hope

00:03:23.231 --> 00:03:24.660
you can come and visit soon.\par
