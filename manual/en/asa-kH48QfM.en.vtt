00:00:04.607 --> 00:00:10.011
We're an academic institution that has an obligation to leave this a better world than it was,

00:00:10.011 --> 00:00:15.085
or at least give our kids who come through here a chance to understand

00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:21.024
where we've been, where we are, and where we can go.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.970
A library is the heart of any great university.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.937
Students couldn't do what they have to do without it, and faculty they couldn't do what they have to do without it.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.029
Every time we drive in to State College, you get excited. I mean it's just a neat place.

00:00:41.029 --> 00:00:44.115
And the library is about the neatest place on campus.

00:00:46.038 --> 00:00:49.387
It's incumbent upon all of us to make sure that we continue to move up the ladder,

00:00:49.387 --> 00:00:54.059
and make Penn State a great university. And that all begins with a great library.

00:01:06.748 --> 00:01:11.057
I think it symbolizes where knowledge has been, and where it's headed to, in the future.

00:01:11.057 --> 00:01:16.125
You can go and look at the rare collections, where you have to turn the pages of the books really gently.

00:01:16.125 --> 00:01:23.065
And then you can go and watch a DVD or something, so it bridges the old way of learning and the new way, in a sense.

00:01:25.095 --> 00:01:31.078
The library is really useful, I know that some of the students work on special projects that are housed in the library.

00:01:31.078 --> 00:01:35.458
Depending on what fields they're in, certain scholars have utilized special collections because it had

00:01:35.458 --> 00:01:38.122
a lot of primary materials that have helped advance the research.

00:01:38.122 --> 00:01:44.020
We had an art student who came in, who wanted to make drawings of the sculptures that we have here,

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.991
so there's all kinds of ways in which students utilize these resources.

00:01:49.714 --> 00:01:54.039
As a business major, particularly a finance major, I do a lot of researching companies,

00:01:54.039 --> 00:02:00.014
and the databases that the library subscribes to are things that I would have to pay to get a research report for,

00:02:00.014 --> 00:02:05.142
so it's certainly something that you can get nowhere else on campus.

00:02:06.018 --> 00:02:09.949
This room in particular has added to my research and my teaching,

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:14.953
because it gives my access to materials beyond the specifics of my dissertation.

00:02:14.953 --> 00:02:20.860
We have a set of slave shackles that are part of this room, and any student in African American lit

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.128
has read about slavery, but to see the slave shackles is just a really moving experience.

00:02:27.035 --> 00:02:30.066
The Penn State library has been a great resource for me over the past three years,

00:02:30.066 --> 00:02:34.841
and I feel like every year that I'm here I found out something new that the library has to offer

00:02:34.841 --> 00:02:40.078
that I didn't know was here before, and I'm just looking forward to using it as I enter my senior year.

00:02:44.077 --> 00:02:50.141
The library is at the center of the student academic experience, and the library is tied

00:02:50.141 --> 00:02:55.082
to everything that students need to succeed academically here at Penn State.

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:07.120
From the liberal arts, to the sciences, to the humanities, to technology, the library benefits everyone on campus.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.065
I have never seen a library that was as concerned with students as this one is.

00:03:12.157 --> 00:03:17.034
What makes this library different is that it connects very closely with the faculty, and indeed the students.

00:03:17.034 --> 00:03:21.945
You walk in the library during finals week, and you cannot find a spare seat.

00:03:24.175 --> 00:03:29.046
So even as things move online, students need more and more spaces to connect with each other,

00:03:29.046 --> 00:03:33.116
to have places where they can find great information, and that's what the library is all about.

00:03:34.192 --> 00:03:36.183
It's kind of the jewel in the rown of Penn State.

00:03:38.152 --> 00:03:44.029
You absolutely cannot get a competitive degree out of a school that doesn't have the resources we now have.

00:03:45.567 --> 00:03:52.938
That's the difference the library makes. You either can do this, or you're not in the major leagues. We are in the major leagues.

00:03:58.399 --> 00:04:07.947
There are 94,000 students who use it. There are 38 Penn State libraries on 24 campuses throughout the commonwealth,

00:04:07.947 --> 00:04:10.121
to me that is an extraordinary service.

00:04:10.121 --> 00:04:16.056
We have two kinds of libraries, we have a physical library that houses collections, and people and services,

00:04:16.056 --> 00:04:21.029
but we also have a virtual library. We offer tens of thousands of things online.

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:26.169
I have many fond memories of getting lost in the stacks, and those "Aha!" moments when you've found

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:30.980
the exact reference in the exact book that you needed to make the point that you needed to make,

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:32.951
and that was a great feeling.

00:04:32.951 --> 00:04:40.952
In my field of English, the library is essential. It's a huge draw for a potential undergradauate

00:04:40.952 --> 00:04:48.055
or graduate student, to know that they will have access to just about any material they could possibly imagine needing.

00:04:49.531 --> 00:04:52.018
There's a lot of intellectual energy in this building.

00:04:56.648 --> 00:05:00.970
Penn State's library is really distinguished by a forward vision.

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:07.085
We're really looking toward the future here, how knowledge is  being packaged differently,

00:05:07.085 --> 00:05:14.117
how students need to access resources differently, and I think that we're really on the cutting edge.

00:05:16.532 --> 00:05:20.633
The knowledge commons is a suite of services that involves

00:05:20.633 --> 00:05:25.730
media, technology, library resources, and appropriate physical spaces.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:33.070
This was an effort to begin to redefine some of the library's public spaces to better meet the needs of today's students.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:40.128
We're also looking at our commonwealth campus libraries to see what kinds of commons environments we can establish there.

00:05:40.128 --> 00:05:49.093
I love the idea of this knowledge commons, and I'm thrilled to be able to be a part of making that work for future students,

00:05:49.093 --> 00:05:52.088
I think it's gonna be a very important part of this university.

00:05:52.088 --> 00:05:57.027
We're moving forward, we're moving forward in very exciting ways, and we can't stop now.

00:06:04.718 --> 00:06:08.880
The heart and soul of the university is a library.
Absolutely.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.710
And we have a great library right now, but we have got to continue to make it better and better,

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.213
so that we have the greatest library.

00:06:18.213 --> 00:06:27.088
There's an opportunity for Penn State to grow even greater, but clearly that's going to require a major commitment,

00:06:27.088 --> 00:06:29.994
from the Penn State community.

00:06:29.994 --> 00:06:38.768
Everyone may have a different idea of what makes you feel good about a gift, but for me, it's being able to see and

00:06:38.768 --> 00:06:46.299
experience something that I've contributed to, and know that it's really helping students of the future.

00:06:46.299 --> 00:06:52.001
We need to be keepers of history to understand the future, and how to deal with it.

00:06:52.001 --> 00:06:55.750
That takes money. It takes lots of money.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:02.191
We are well in the top ten libraries of the country in terms of what we're spending on our resources.

00:07:02.191 --> 00:07:07.087
We're competing in very elite company. And the money has to come from somewhere.

00:07:07.087 --> 00:07:15.025
Philanthropy can make all of the difference between a good library and a great library.

00:07:17.195 --> 00:07:22.535
We're one of the great universities in the country, and in the world, and if we're gonna continue

00:07:22.535 --> 00:07:28.041
you'd better, we need some of you folks out there who's got a couple extra bucks in your pocket.

00:07:28.041 --> 00:07:30.117
Come on, give it to the library.
