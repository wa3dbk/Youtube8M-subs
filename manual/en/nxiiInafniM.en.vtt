00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.550
 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:09.550
 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.389
hello namaste

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:17.570
salaam alaikum sat sri akal welcome to
another session

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.830
of Be Fit Be Cool campaign by AAPI

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.960
American Association of physicians of
Indian origin

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.360
log into the Facebook page of the AAPI
will you find

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:30.450
lot of information that is good for your
health

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.820
so today we gonna make egg and lettuce sandwich

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:37.840
today I would use iceberg lettuce you
know these are very very juicy

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.450
and a best to use in salads according
to me and

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.940
make the spread for the sandwich I'm
going to use some boiled chick peas and

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.430
garlic

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.160
first I'm going to put this in a 
blender and make it into a paste

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.790
that you can add hung yogurt you
know into this

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.300
and make a nice spread you know this is
lot better than using manues

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.990
and a this is very tasty and  very
nutritious also

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.500
you know we're going to make this spread by mixing this

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.610
chick peas and garlic in this

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.369
you are gonna add little bit of salt little bit of pepper powder

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.630
and hung yougurt this is even better
if you are using low-fat yogurt

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.790
to make your hung yogurt now the
spread is all ready

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.850
to make this sandwhich I'm going to use a
whole wheat bread and

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.650
with the egg and lettuce you don't need
to add any of the dressings or anything

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.770
just make sure you give a very good
coating of this chick pea and garlic

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.360
 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.760
spread WOW !!! this looks lot but this
is what is going to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.850
make it very tasty and wonderful

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.960
it's a low-fat yogurt

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.260
with chickpea good lot amount of proteins in
it

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:50.830
and along with this whole wheat
bread and

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.850
using whole wheat bread is lot better
than other

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.799
you know regular bread
because the whole wheat bread has lot

00:01:57.799 --> 00:01:58.490
more fiber

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.290
and as you all know the fiber is very
good for our bowl system and very

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:03.810
soothing

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.470
now the spread is all done all I'm
going to do is this

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.019
you know just put in some egg

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.920
I love egg you know for morning if you
give me

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.170
egg weather it is scrambled whether it is

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.999
you know boiled egg anyway I love it for
breakfast you need good amount of protein

00:02:22.999 --> 00:02:26.329
so make this egg sandwich and have it for
breakfast also

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:30.299
it will taste fantastic I'm going to just
sprinkle a little bit of salt for

00:02:30.299 --> 00:02:34.359
salt for the egg then some crushed pepper

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:38.689
that's it and now even if you want you
can also add some

00:02:38.689 --> 00:02:41.840
spring onion on it if you had lot this
lettuce

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.879
this sandwhich is going to
be very nice and juicy

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.269
and put on the slice of bread and look
at this

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:51.909
isn't this really good you need to take
a bread knife

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:56.459
and that's it and check this out

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:03.459
you know the egg and all the bread mmm!!!

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:10.730
just too good you know well only thing i forgot

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:14.110
you can squeeze in little bit of lime juice because

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.230
I can add little bit of sourness to this

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.660
because the yogurt i thought it will be sour it is not that sour

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:27.660
so little bit of sourness would be very
good mmm !!!

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.920
just awesome mmm!!

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.570
 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:44.100
once again let me tell you just because
this is tasty

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.630
