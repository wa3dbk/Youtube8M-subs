00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.900
Hello dear ones!

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.000
This is Monika Romer from the Encaustic Academie which is based in Weilheim Teck (Germany).

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.900
And today I'm going to introduce you to the Encaustic painting.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.820
And this is what you need for it.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.080
An iron. But I call it painting iron because it is something very special.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.680
You only use it for the Encaustic painting.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.580
We also need wax colors.

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:30.360
These are Encaustic bee wax colors.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.180
A painting cardboard. This one also is an Encaustic cardboard.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.780
Some scribbling papers.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.180
And a paper towel.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:41.920
Now I'm going to show how it works.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:46.340
I'm melting the wax colors.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.500
Just as you like it.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.320
Blue is pretty. Green and blue always matches.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.400
Adding a little bit of yellow.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.700
Now I'm not going to push.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:06.560
Just slowly pull it over the cardboard.
Without pressure.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.060
It's awesome how it melts into eachother.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.340
You could never achieve this result 
with a common brush.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.520
It fascinates me everytime.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.480
I also need some red.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.640
I also like purple.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:27.440
And now I'm excited for how it's going to change again.

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.780
Very gentle.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.740
Amazing!

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.940
Beautiful how it blends and melts into eachtother.

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.600
That's great! It just really fascinates me.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.520
One edge is still empty 
so I'm going to take a little bit of purple.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.940
Now I paint over it again.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.200
Awesome!

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.800
Now you can see the beautiful structures 
I painted with the iron.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.860
Nothing else is needed!

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.540
That's not enough yet though!

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.940
I still want some more.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.300
Every now and then you need to clean the iron 
with the paper towel.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:19.680
And now I'm going to paint with the edge of the iron.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.040
I place it here.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.920
Up and down movements.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.100
It's looking good!

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.900
It's like a surprise when all the beautiful 
structures appear!

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:40.060
And a bit bigger moves.

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:44.460
Isn't this great!

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.760
You won't be able to do this with a brush in this short period of time.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:53.360
Now I'm softly pushing. We are going to see what kind of structure will appear then.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.900
A beautiful structure!

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.060
Taking some more color.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.860
You can change it anytime.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.540
Now I'm going to make a wave.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:11.320
Awesome!

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.460
I'm very pleased with it now and 
I'm going to leave it like that.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.020
See how great it has become!

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:27.440
I will glue the painting to a black cardboard and then hang it onto my wall.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.240
That's how fast it goes!

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.540
I hope you enjoyed it!

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.780
Thanks for watching and soon I will show you something else.

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.160
Bye!
