Hello, today I am making easy chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream cake.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.770
First, line with a plastic sheet on the bottom of a plate 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.910
and arrange a ring over it. 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.210
Then put a plastic cake ring in the mold. 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.200
In a bowl, add in 3 tablespoons of softened unsalted butter, 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.620
1/3 cup of light brown sugar, 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.320
1/8 teaspoon of salt, 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.820
and 1/4 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:53.250
and whisk until homogeneously combined. 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.460
Add in 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour and mix. 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:04.030
Sift flour if you take it out of a tightly packed bag. 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.950
And finally fold in 1/4 cup of mini semi-sweet chocolate chips.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.440
This is eggless cookie dough.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.770
Roll the dough into a thin rope. 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.570
And cut and form a ball. 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.870
Repeat with only half of the dough. 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:35.070
The remaining half will be used later.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:44.200
Now whip 1 cup of heavy cream until stiff. 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.570
Add in 7 tablespoons of sweetened condensed milk 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:56.770
and 1 teaspoon of pure vanilla extract and delicately fold until combined. 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.910
I don’t add in cookie dough chunks now 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:06.000
because with a lot of frozen cookie dough, I cannot cut the cake cleanly. 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.190
Arrange the balls of chocolate chip cookie dough on the bottom of the ring. 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:15.280
And fill the mold with the batter only half full. 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.100
Then sprinkle with 3 tablespoons of cookie crumbs. 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.500
Any cookies are okay. Just avoid overly sweet cookies. 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.000
I have a few cookie recipes in separate videos. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.400
And pour the remaining batter in the mold 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.900
and clean the top with an off-set spatula. 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.900
Then freeze overnight.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.200
Out of freezer, remove the ring. 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.240
Roll out chocolate chip cookie dough and cut with the ring. 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.750
Cover the cake with the round cookie dough 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:02.030
and turn it upside down. 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:03.750
Sprinkle with cookie crumbs 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:15.820
and decorate with chocolate chip cookie dough.

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.750
Voila.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:24.250
Homemade eggless chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream cake. 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:34.860
If you are making ice cream, why don’t you turn it into a festive ice cream cake? It takes only a little more effort.

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.240
Bon appetit.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:45.070
I love beautiful vanilla ice cream with cookies crumbs and chunky chocolate chip cookie dough.

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:50.950
