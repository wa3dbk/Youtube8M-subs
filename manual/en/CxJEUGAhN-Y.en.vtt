00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.680
Don't Eat Breakfast if I want to know How
to Lose Weight?

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:11.259
I thought breakfast was supposed to be the
most important meal of the day.

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:16.640
It is supposed to be the meal that kick starts
your body's fat burning engine and gets you

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.310
ready for the day ahead.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.210
How to Lose Weight -- Don't Start With Breakfast

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.500
Contrary to popular belief, eating in the
morning is the worst time to start shoveling

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.500
down food.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.750
When you wake up, your body is already in
an intense detox mode, ridding itself of endotoxins

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.860
and digestive waste from the previous evening's
meal (gross, I know).

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.239
But if you want to know why and how to lose
weight, read on.

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:37.500
Around mid-morning, when digestion is fully
completed and your stomach is basically empty,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.890
the survival mechanism known as the fight-or-flight
reaction to stress is triggered.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.100
It is at this point that your body is maximizing
its capacity for generating energy, being

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.199
alert, resisting fatigue and resisting stress.

00:00:45.199 --> 00:00:48.920
This survival mode is controlled by a part
of the nervous system known as the sympathetic

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.920
nervous system.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.200
While your body is in this gear, is is in
its most energy-producing phase.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.569
And most of the energy comes from fat burning.

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:59.629
And guess when all that happens?

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:02.399
Yep, when you do not eat the typical morning
meal.

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:06.521
If you are like most of us, you eat a breakfast
of a bagel, cereal, egg and bacon, just to

00:01:06.521 --> 00:01:07.570
name a few.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:13.160
This may taste good and stop you stomach from
growling, but you'll most likely shut down

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.160
this energy-producing system.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.050
You may even feel sleepy, slow and less resistant
to fatigue and stress.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:18.050
Sound familiar?

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.880
Eating breakfast is inhibiting your body's
idea of how to lose weight

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.990
Instead of spending energy and burning fat,
your body will be more geared toward storing

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.080
energy and gaining fat.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.020
Your body's natural detox will be inhibited,
and the overall metabolic stress will increase.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.080
This causes the toxins to accumulate in the
liver, giving your body another substantial

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:37.080
reason to gain fat.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.080
The effects of morning meals often lead to
energy crashes during the daytime hours, typically

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:39.710
when you're working, bringing frequent cravings
for substances like sweets, coffee and tobacco.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.300
Eating at the wrong time severely interrupts
the body's ability to be in tune with the

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.300
circadian clock.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.780
The human body has never adapted to such interruptions.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.550
Any interruptions in the cycle may lead to
sleepiness during the day, followed by sleeping

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:49.550
disorders at night.

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:51.970
If you're noticing signs at either time, it
may be time to check your morning meals.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.830
Morning meals must be carefully designed not
to suppress the SNS and its highly energetic

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:55.830
state.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:56.830
Now, before there is a major uproar, you CAN
eat in the morning and it still can be beneficial

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.000
in a strategy of How to Lose Weight.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.627
Limit morning food to fruit, small amounts
of light protein foods, such as poached or

00:01:59.627 --> 00:02:01.050
boiled egg, plain yogurt (not the pre-mixed
stuff, which is the equivalent of eating a

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:02.050
donut) or white cheese.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:03.550
How to Lose Weight if you're an athlete

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.550
Things are a little different if you an athlete.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.289
If you are someone who exercises in the morning,
breakfast becomes your post-exercise recovery

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.289
meal.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:11.610
For this, you should consume small amounts
of carbs and protein.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.060
Try yogurt and a banana, eggs plus a bowl
of oatmeal.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.860
When finished working out, an insulin spike
is necessary to effectively finalize the anabolic

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.910
actions of growth hormone and insulin like
growth factor 1 after exercise.

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:26.940
For the meals following, minimizing carb intake
while applying small protein every couple

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.940
of hours.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.180
This will assist with protein synthesis in
muscle tissue, promoting that lasting anabolic

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:32.220
effect that we long for.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.380
And that is how to lose weight when you're
exercising.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:39.310
Breakfast isn't the most important meal of
the day if you're an athlete.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.690
It's your post exercise recovery meals and
when you eat that makes what you eat matter.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.530
