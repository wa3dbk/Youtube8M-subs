00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.450
Hi this is Sage Kimble and I'm the Mad
Stamper.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.600
I've got some important news for you

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:10.459
about the ten Stampin!Up colors that
are retiring.

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:13.929
I'm going to give you a rundown on the colors
that are going away.

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:18.789
So from the Brights Collection, we're
losing Regal Rose.

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.480
That's not bad; just one.

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.330
The Subtles Collection we're losing four;

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.009
Certainly Celery,

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.689
Bashful Blue,

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.500
Baja Breeze,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.900
and Pretty In Pink.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.930
The Regals Collection is also losing
four;

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:42.530
Riding Hood Red,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.850
Not Quite Navy,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.390
More Mustard,

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.950
Bravo Burgundy.

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.100
And the Neutrals are only losing one, and
that's River Rock.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.300
So here's the ten colors that are
retiring.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.000
If you're like me, you probably see some
of your favorite colors in this selection.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.640
I know I get very attached to some and
use them over and over. Others I'm happy

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.910
to see go

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.570
and make room for some of the returning
In Colors that are being added to the

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.120
collections.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.950
You want to be sure to order any of
the retiring color products you want as

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.270
soon as possible

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.700
as they're only available while supplies
last.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.420
Are there colors of card stock that you
just can't live without?

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.750
Are there any pads that you've been
thinking of ordering, but haven't done it

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.970
yet?

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.650
And what about refills? Now this is the
way to go

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.610
especially with retiring ink pads.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.550
Because these will make your ink pads
last so much longer.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:53.510
Whey they start getting dry, you just add
some more ink to them.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.930
Don't forget about embellishments

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.420
like ribbons,

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.280
buttons,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.240
and brads.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.570
Be sure you stock up on retiring
products while you still can.

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.690
Order them from my online Stampin!Up 
store
