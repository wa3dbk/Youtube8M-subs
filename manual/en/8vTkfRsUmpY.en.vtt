My love, let us see if the rose

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:36.800
Who this morning unfurled her purple dress to the Sun,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:52.600
Has lost by this evening the folds of her purple dress,

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.480
And her complexion is so like yours.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:27.440
Alas! See how quickly, my love, she has scattered her beauty around.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:36.240
O Nature, cruel stepmother,

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:43.840
That such a flower only lasts from morning to night.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:41.080
So if you believe me, my love,

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:54.440
While your age blossoms In its new greenery,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:03.040
Gather, gather your youth:

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.920
As you too, like this flower,

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.080
Will fade away.
