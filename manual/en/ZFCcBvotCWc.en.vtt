00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.460
Hi, welcome to Down to Earth!

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.600
My name is Rachel...

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.740
And today, we're going to do a really delicious sugar-free cookie.

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.700
It's made with lemons and cashews and coconut.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.180
I love this recipe because I eat only sugar-free food...

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.980
And sometimes I'm desperate for a sweet treat...

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.000
And I can make it in just five minutes.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Ok, let's get started!

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Alright, so we'll add our cashew nuts.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.700
Then our coconut...

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.300
Then our coconut oil...

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.800
It's going to make the cookie nice and sticky...

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.360
So it will all stick together...

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.500
Our lemon zest...

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.000
Some nice color in there...

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.180
And finally, the lemon juice.

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.620
I like to hold a little of the lemon juice back.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.120
Just so I can taste it at the end, and adjust it to my palate.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.600
Now we're going to add a little bit of Stevia...

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.360
Stevia is a sweet substance that has no sugar in it.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.500
And it's really great for... healthy eating.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.400
So I like to add three big ones to begin with...

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.700
And then I adjust it to taste a bit later on...

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.000
Ok, let's blend.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.500
[Blending Sound]

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.760
We need to make sure that its got a nice sticky consistency...

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.700
Yes, perfect.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.700
So it will make a nice cookie.

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.500
Now just have a little taste...

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.260
See if I want to add the rest of my lemon juice.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.000
Or any more Stevia...

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.740
Mix in anything that's left over on the sides...

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.900
And give it one last little mix.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.700

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.600
Once the dough is blended, we'll roll it into some nice little cookies.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.800
I like to take kind of a "Golf Ball" shape.

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.020
Just into the palm of my hand.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.500
And fashion it into a nice little round ball.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.500
It's really cool...

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.080
But what I like to do the most...

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.720
Since we live here in Hawaii...

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.660
And it's so warm...

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.040
I like to just pop the cookies into the freezer...

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:09.300
And it's going to firm them up...

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.760
I've just lined this plate here with plastic...

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.040
And it's going to stop the cookie from sticking...

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.360
Alright, let's pop them in the freezer.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.500
[Music Playing]

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:24.160
Ok, it's been a few minutes.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.600
And our cookies should be nice and cool...

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.300
So let's have a look...

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.680
Here they are...

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.880
Nine delicious little lemon cashew sugar-free cookies.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.660
I hope that you enjoy these as much as I do.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:42.300
