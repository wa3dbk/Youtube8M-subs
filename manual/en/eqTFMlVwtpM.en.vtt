00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:10.820
You can use the ViewCube and SteeringWheels to navigate in a 3D scene,
such as changing your point of view, zooming, panning, and so on.

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:17.880
These two tools appear as overlays in the viewport 
and can be used to navigate in a variety of ways.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:27.800
In its simplest form, you can use the ViewCube to orbit around a
horizontal plane by clicking and dragging the compass-like gizmo.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:37.520
You can also use this tool to switch from one viewpoint to another,
such as viewing the scene from the Left, Front, or Top.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:42.050
At any time, you can go back to the original view by clicking Home.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.030
You can also orbit freely around the scene by 
clicking and dragging a corner of the ViewCube.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.600
However, this method may roll the view to an unwanted extent.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:01.840
If this happens, you can right-click the ViewCube to access its
configuration dialog, and then choose the Keep Scene Upright option.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:08.850
From that point on, orbiting using ViewCube
prevents the ground from rotating vertically.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:18.930
If you adjust a view to your liking you can right-click to set that
viewpoint as a "Home" view so you can come back to it at any time.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:29.430
The ViewCube can be deactivated in the Viewport
Configuration dialog, under the ViewCube tab.

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:36.870
Like the ViewCube, SteeringWheel is also a viewport 
navigation tool that displays as a viewport overlay.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.020
It can be toggled on or off using Shift+W.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.880
The SteeringWheel gizmo follows the movement of the cursor.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:53.880
You can use it to zoom in by placing the Zoom label
on a given object, then clicking and dragging.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.730
You can also use its Center function 
to frame an object in the viewport.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:10.360
Once an object is centered, you can orbit around it 
using the Orbit tool, which is similar to the
functionality found in ViewCube and discussed earlier.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.220
The Orbit tool lets you move around a static point in space.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.170
Conversely, the Look function keeps your position static
as your "eyes" look around the scene.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:33.790
The Pan and Up/Down features move both your position
and the target you are looking at.

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.940
The Walk feature is an interactive method 
to move and look around the scene.

00:02:39.403 --> 00:02:43.050
This is done with an initial click and drag.

00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:50.174
The further you drag the mouse the faster 
you move forward, back, left, or right.

00:02:51.520 --> 00:03:00.230
You can also raise your eye level and position using the Shift key.
This is the same as using the Up/Down feature.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.510
The default SteeringWheel tool is called the Full Navigation wheel.

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:11.970
Its outer ring displays what is known as an Object wheel, 
while the inner ring is known as a Building wheel.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:26.970
You can display individual rings by selecting them in 
the SteeringWheels menu from the bottom right corner link.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:32.890
You can also display mini-wheels by choosing them in the menu.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:44.830
Mini-wheels do not have a menu link. 
To revert to a full-size wheel, you need to specify it 
in the Views menu, under Views &gt; SteeringWheels.
