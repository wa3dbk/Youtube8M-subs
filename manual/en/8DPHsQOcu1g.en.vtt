00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.950
The moon tonight is the color of sweet honey

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.600
This fifth night I light incense

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.470
The name I’d written dances across my parchment

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.210
This secret held in my fingertips

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:19.970
Melts like a dream

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:23.280
Locked away deep like snow

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:27.480
I’ll try and change the world’s inclinations just a little

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:31.250
This secret a princess just can’t keep

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:38.660
A red romance, or perhaps a yellow jinx

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:46.230
A mysterious charm wavering amidst an orange flame..

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.770
When I pour this red romance over the blue scattered across midnight

00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:01.180
It’ll turn violet, my mysterious charm

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.940
Tonight, the moon at eleven-point-three

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.650
With desire, I glance toward the waxing moon

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.470
Mixing a spell with ginger and thyme

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.180
This secret held in my fingertips

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.990
Melts like a dream

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:23.520
Locked away deep like snow

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.410
I’ll try and change the world’s inclinations just a little

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.450
This secret a princess just can’t keep

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.790
It starts white

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:38.000
(Eleven, One, Two, Three)
It starts white

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:38.500
(Eleven, One, Two, Three)

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.520
I’ll start with white, a page of the moon
(Eleven, One, Two, Three)

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.290
I’ll start with white, a page of the moon

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:46.040
(Eleven, One, Two, Three)
I’ll start with white, a page of the moon

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.150
It starts white
(Eleven, One, Two, Three)

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:49.940
It starts white

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.490
(Eleven, One, Two, Three)
It starts white

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.270
It starts white...
(Eleven, One, Two, Three)

00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:00.740
It starts white...

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.530
In drifts the scent of melancholic morning

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:08.480
The flame atop this candle is fading

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.440
My burning emotions a house for dolls

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.660
God?

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:16.180
Looks just like a donkey’s ear to me

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.500
Saying “I love you, my love” to someone

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.510
Is just the teasing fancy of a faerie

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.440
This “happy end” is but an eight-lettered excuse

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:28.620
God?

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:31.200
Today I escape again

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:35.000
Those slippers racing down the stairs are magical

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.660
Or for her, sleeping amidst the thorns, it’s lyrical

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.410
But none of those scripts are of this world

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:46.120
Only princesses get those roles

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:49.920
Inside these pastel colored sweets

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:53.610
It’s just like a labyrinth made of mirrors

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.450
Behind the doors of this dreamy room

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.190
God, you’ve done me an awful sabotage

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:04.930
The magnetic nights cycle through

00:05:04.930 --> 00:05:08.710
In serious pain, the flame atop this candle

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:12.430
My burning emotions a scribbled flower garden

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.650
God?

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:16.190
Looks just like a donkey’s ear to me

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:19.940
On the last page for “Peace and Harmony”

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:21.360
A trashy kiss

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.700
NO! I don’t need that!

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:27.430
With wet fingertips I extinguish today’s charm

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.910
Candle Magic

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.280
“I love you, my love”
