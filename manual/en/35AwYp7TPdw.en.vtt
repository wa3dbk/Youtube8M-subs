[Narrator] Once upon a time, when people still used iPhone,

00:00:07.092 --> 00:00:10.349
there was an office.

00:00:11.297 --> 00:00:15.074
There is a rule in this place:

00:00:15.438 --> 00:00:18.978
You could not arrive at the office after 9, or

00:00:20.036 --> 00:00:23.100
your boss will be super mad......

00:00:24.994 --> 00:00:27.270
[Employee's Thoughts] Oh shit, late again....

00:00:28.412 --> 00:00:31.001
Where is my boss? Where is my boss?

00:00:31.687 --> 00:00:36.304
OK, it seems he is not here

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.795
I am so tired after watching porn over night.......

00:00:43.974 --> 00:00:44.942

Don't you want this job any more?

00:00:50.612 --> 00:00:53.104
I can easily hire another idiot

00:00:56.325 --> 00:00:58.904
[Narrator] When time goes by so quickly......

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:04.669
[Employee's Thoughts] Fucking Sleepy, Fucking Sleepy

00:01:04.948 --> 00:01:08.483
Let's find some documents

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.290
[Narrator] When there is a stock market crash, it means it is now crashing.

00:01:12.431 --> 00:01:15.405
Oh My God! Chinese stock market crashes again.

00:01:16.203 --> 00:01:19.944
But the US market has already raised a lot!

00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:22.172
Why do this to me....

00:01:22.743 --> 00:01:25.902
[Narrator] 3 o'clock again.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.720
[Employee's Thoughts] I am so fucking tired......

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.524
No body here......

00:01:33.675 --> 00:01:35.117
Let's dance!!

00:01:43.802 --> 00:01:44.948

00:01:47.143 --> 00:01:50.202

00:02:06.454 --> 00:02:10.368

00:02:10.785 --> 00:02:12.855
Why does my boss give me job at this moment?

00:02:13.634 --> 00:02:16.146
[Narrator] Now it is the time of night.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.095
[Boss' thoughts] What the fuck is he doing?

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:29.000
Oh Shit! All fucking wrong!

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.323

00:02:44.419 --> 00:02:46.228

00:02:46.821 --> 00:02:49.300
Teachers told us not to fight.

00:02:49.572 --> 00:02:52.140
Wa Da!!

00:03:02.237 --> 00:03:03.122

00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:27.241
Let's stop for a moment. Somebody is coming.

00:03:29.865 --> 00:03:32.502
(Pretend working normally) hay, I have already told you that the sun rises in the east

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.361
Yes, you are damn right.

00:03:35.968 --> 00:03:38.950
It turns out that the sun exactly rises in the east!

00:03:45.256 --> 00:03:49.539
Why? What's happened?

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:55.539
