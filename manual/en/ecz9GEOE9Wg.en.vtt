00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:16.299
Welcome back to the
Cosmic Classroom.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:20.410
Let's now talk about the
life of stars that live

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.810
in,live in pairs,doubles stars.
Alright,or a binary system.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.500
So what happens
to a white dwarf?

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.070
It dies and then what?
You know, it becomes,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.550
it's a white dwarf,and
then what happens to it?

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.700
Do they just sit there?
Well, if the white

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.160
dwarf is isolated,yes it
will just sit there,it will

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.500
cool down and it will
eventually become a

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.320
black dwarf that we
can not see anymore.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.830
Now, if the white
dwarf has a

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.060
a companion then life
is much more interesting.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.380
And, and
more things happen.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.960
So let's look for example
at Sirius and its white

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.870
dwarf companion.
So it's a little thing, it's

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.110
this white dwarf near
this big star, Sirius.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.040
But this white dwarf is
really important in the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.680
life of the system, right?
The companionship

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:19.220
is really important.
So if you have a system

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.460
on which one of the
stars is already a white

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.210
dwarf, and then,and
there's another star.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.970
So there is two stars.
Let's say this is the white

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.390
dwarf, and this is another
rebeller main sequence star

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.930
and their orbiting is shorten
and they are happy

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.799
with their lives together.
But eventually, this star

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.880
here it is in main
sequence will also die.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.240
And as is dies, as all
stars die, they expand they

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.000
become one big thing.
When this star starts to

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.700
expand, its surface gets
close enough to the white

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.670
dwarf, that the white dwarf
starts to steal material from

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.280
the surface of this star.
And that's what this

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.620
drawing is showing you.
That the white dwarf

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.080
companion is
stealing material and

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:12.000
forming an external layer
of Hydrogen around it.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.200
WELL the white dwarf
is really hot, right?

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:18.010
It's the CORE of a star.
So as the Hydrogen heats

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.099
there, and it accumulates
a little bit there, the,the

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:25.709
star comes back to life.
It starts fusing Hydrogen

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.939
into Helium again.
So the star that

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.319
was dead, soon it
comes back to life.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:32.409
There's fusion happening
again, the star will

00:02:32.409 --> 00:02:35.489
shine brightly again.
And it will do that a few

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.519
times, as more and more
fuel is, is falling into the

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.719
surface of the star.
You need to let the fuel

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.709
accumulate a little bit
to be at the right

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:50.629
density and temperature.
But every now and then the star

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:53.689
will burst, will be luminous.
So, nova?

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:57.519
A nova can happen
once or twice or three

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.719
times as material falls
into this white dwarf.

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:06.870
It may be that the white
dwarf steals so much

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.540
material from this
companion star, that, that

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.709
the degeneracy pressure
off this white dwarf

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:19.290
cannot hold it anymore.
Cannot stop gravity anymore.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:23.680
The star collapses,at
once, when degeneracy

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.799
pressure can't hold that.
Collapses, and as it collapses

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:34.879
it explodes as a supernova,
and blows everything away.

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.099
What's left from this kind
of supernova is,nothing.

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:41.079
Not the neutron star,
not the black hole, there

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:45.269
is just nothing there.
But let me qualify it nothing.

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.419
I'm not saying that the
material disappeared.

00:03:47.419 --> 00:03:51.150
I'm just saying that it has
been, becomes dust.

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.930
Alright?
It's spread all around.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.659
When the star explode
it also affects the, the

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:01.950
neighboring star, the one
that was its partner, it

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.529
also blows that star away.
It doesn't make

00:04:04.529 --> 00:04:08.459
that star explode.
But it blows that star

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:11.430
away a lot of the
material from the outers,

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.169
outer parts of that
star will be blown away.

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:16.630
Right?
Because of so much

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:21.639
energy in that explosion.
So, we call supernova,

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:24.860
this final explosion we call
supernova,when this core

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.360
collapses in the whole
thing explodes and nothing

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.350
is left is called a supernova.
Now I need to tell you that

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:37.700
this kind of supernova that
leaves no remains and that

00:04:37.700 --> 00:04:42.561
comes from a binary
system with a white dwarf, its

00:04:42.561 --> 00:04:46.020
called a Supernova Type 1.
I don't understand

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.190
why it's called a
Supernova Type 1.

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.281
Right?
If there are two stars

00:04:52.281 --> 00:04:56.790
and the supernova that
explodes when there is

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:59.850
one big mass of star
exploding, its one big mass

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.610
of star exploding,that is
called a Supernova Type 2.

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:06.660
So if you try to use that
to memorize, do the reverse.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.250
Right?
If there is two stars it's

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:12.180
Supernova 1, if there is one
star is Supernova Type 2.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:14.910
I won't go in the why
it has to do with the

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:16.380
lines the way it was
classified before we

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:20.350
knew what they were.
But that's what it is.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:23.070
So I had a lot of
questions about

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:24.800
how what, why just
binary systems?

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:28.410
Is it possible to have three
or multiple stellar systems.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:31.530
And yes,we can have
multiple stellar systems.

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:35.600
In fact there are a
lot of multiple stellar systems.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.600
In fact there are more
systems with more than one

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:42.360
star than systems with
just one star out there.

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.200
Alright?
So a star like the

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:49.441
sun is less common than
stars that live with

00:05:49.441 --> 00:05:52.610
partners,with other stars.
So there are lots

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:55.880
of those out there.
I have two examples here.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.540
One that you must be
very fam, that you may

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:01.720
be very familiar with,
its Polaris, the north star.

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:05.130
It's not really one star,
its three as you can see.

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:07.670
With your naked eye it's
impossible to see because

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:11.020
the companions are very
bright, very dimmed,and

00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:14.990
very close to the main star.
But it's actually a system

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:20.270
of three stars,Polaris A,
Polaris AB and Polaris B.

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:22.780
Alright?
And here is just a drawing

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:27.740
showing one possible
configuration out of infinite

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:30.520
possible configurations.
There are three stars

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:35.520
here and this little star
is orbiting this one.

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.000
Almost like a moon
orbiting a planet,except

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.650
that it's, there are two
stars and those two stars

00:06:41.650 --> 00:06:43.940
are orbiting each other.
Ok?

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:48.250
And you may have
many stars together.

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:50.610
Alright?
When a supernova happens

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:55.340
all the stars that are around
whether it's 1, 2, or 3

00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:59.310
they will just be sent away.
Most of them will be close

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.470
enough to a supernova that
they won't be able to survive,

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:07.090
they will just be sent away.
And I hope that answers your

00:07:07.090 --> 00:07:10.490
questions and I hope it helped.
I see you next time.
