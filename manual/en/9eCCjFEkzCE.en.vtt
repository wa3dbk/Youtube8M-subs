Hi everyone. I am Gervasio of "Vas A Sonar" and today we will be doing

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.150
a review of a delay pedal by  Earthquaker Devices

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.159
The Disaster Transport Jr. is a digital delay pedal, but with a analog flavor

00:00:29.159 --> 00:00:34.459
It gives you a lot of versatility in terms of the sounds you can get and it is usable in 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.460
a variety of styles. So let's hear how it sounds.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.579
You could hear how the Disaster Transport Jr. sounds. It is really great.

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.810
I recommend it since I have liked it a lot

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.650
I love its simplicity, the analog tones and the sound variability that it can give you

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:19.690
with the tone knob and  the mix knob which is also very interesting. 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.420
I also like the repeats knob that can be taken to 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.510
a very extreme setting. Well, that's all for today. I hope you liked the Disaster Transport Jr.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.150
