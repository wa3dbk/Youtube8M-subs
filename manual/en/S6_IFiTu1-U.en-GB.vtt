00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.939
Over the last year or so, skins for mobile
devices have gained considerable popularity.

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:09.240
In this newly emerging market, one Canadian
manufacturer has risen to considerable acclaim,

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.690
boasting “the most precise fit on earth”.
But just how good are their skins? My name

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.430
is Stephen Potter, and these are the dbrand
skins for the LG G3 and Nexus 4.

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.720
I’m going to be splitting this review into
three parts, based on what I think matters

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.699
most in a skin: Texture, Aesthetics and Protection.
So, let’s start off with texture. Many people

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:38.079
buy skins to increase the grip available on
slippery phones, and I can say that dbrand’s

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.149
carbon fibre patterned skins do an excellent
job of this. It’s still a smooth feeling,

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.979
but it has just enough resistance to reassure
me that I’m not about to drop my phone.

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:50.049
The other material I tried, their “true
colour”, was actually surprisingly smooth

00:00:50.049 --> 00:00:54.409
after I’d read reports of it having a sandpaper
like feel. It’s still got more grip than

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.859
something like aluminium, but might not make
quite as much of a difference. That being

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.670
said, I really did the implementation of the
front skin on the LG G3 – when held in one

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.540
hand for watching video it provides a surface
slightly grippier than glass, and most importantly

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.070
one that won’t collect a multitude of fingerprints.
The one negative thing you will notice when

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.000
using these skins is the slight edge between
them and the body of your phone. It’s not

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.380
that bad in general use, but if you just run
your finger across it, it will feel a bit

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.640
sharp. Now, dbrand have clearly taken this
into consideration: with their skin for the

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.260
G3 they provide two rear skins: a standard
and a precision fit. The standard fit gives

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:34.870
you plenty of flexibility, allowing you to
easily remove the rear cover of the device

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.210
at any point, but it does also mean that the
edges will dig into your hands a bit. This

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.790
alone was enough to lead me to switch to the
precision, which does feel a lot better, but

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.940
in order to remove the rear cover I now have
to go through the process of peeling the edges

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.520
of the skin up: something you really don’t
want to do as it will weaken the adhesive

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.530
there.
The installation of this skin was also fairly

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.700
easy, even with my fairly shaky hands, although
for the LG G3 a hairdryer was required. I’m

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.670
not going to give you any demonstrations of
this here, as dbrand have some of the best

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.840
tutorials on how to do it over on their YouTube
channel. It’s not the simplest of things

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.469
to do, but with a bit of patience almost anybody
should be able to get an almost perfect application.

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:16.099
Moving on to aesthetics. I’d be lying if
I said these skins didn’t look anything

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:19.659
aside from exceptional. Dbrand’s claims
of these having the “most precise fit on

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:23.329
earth” may well be true: the only complaint
I have with the precision of these skins is

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:28.019
to do with the front piece on the G3: it seems
to be a tiny bit too short, letting the original

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.439
colour behind the glass shine through. We’re
talking sub millimetre levels of accuracy

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:36.129
here, and it’s not something I’d normally
notice, but I felt that it was worth mentioning

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:40.920
given what dbrand have been declaring.
One of the things I like the most about the

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.889
Carbon Fibre material is the way it interacts
with light – it gives it an appearance which

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:49.290
reminds me a bit of the cat eye effect on
the back of the Nexus 4. But if carbon fibre’s

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.959
not your cup of tea then feel free to choose
something different. Dbrand’s website offers

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:57.889
one of the best customisation tools I’ve
ever seen, with beautiful renders and plenty

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:02.040
of options, meaning you should be able to
create a design which feels truly personal.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:07.099
Finally, let’s talk about protection. Now,
skins are never going to provide much in the

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.590
way of drop protection, but what they can
protect your device from is scratches and

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.169
other small dents. From the few weeks I’ve
been using these skins, they would appear

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:18.999
to do this very well, and don’t appear to
acquire that much visible damage either. But

00:03:18.999 --> 00:03:23.079
alas, these skins can only protect the areas
of the device that they cover, so any region

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:27.590
which is left uncovered will take just as
much damage as it would without a skin installed.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:31.859
As a result of this, I would only really recommend
skins to people who take good care of their

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:36.069
devices in the first place. In the end, it’s
up to you to decide whether or skins are right

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.760
for you – if you only need minimal protection
from the elements, rarely drop your device

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.169
and don’t want to sacrifice its form for
the sake of a bit of armour, then skins are

00:03:44.169 --> 00:03:48.139
probably for you, but if you aren’t so good
to your devices then a case may well be a

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:52.590
better choice.
Altogether, dbrand provide what may well be

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:57.340
the highest quality skins on the market, and
an excellent overall customer experience to

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:00.540
match. If there’s one thing I’d like to
see from them it would be a greater number

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.609
devices being supported. While dbrand do support
a very decent number of phones, tablets, and

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.459
even a few laptops, there are some devices
that just seem to be missing: you can buy

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:13.409
a skin for the Galaxy S4, but there’s no
option for the Galaxy S5, and you can buy

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:17.840
skins for the iPad 2 and 3, but there’s
no option for either Airs. I can only suspect

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:21.820
that this is due to them not being able to
easily design skins for these devices, but

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.190
I can’t say for sure. But, if a skin is
available for your device, then don’t be

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.850
afraid to order: you will be getting what
may well be the most precise fit on earth.
