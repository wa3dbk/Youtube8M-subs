Hi, I'm Josh from eSpares.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:15.190
A question we often get asked here at eSpares
is how people access and replace the sump

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:16.810
hose on their washing machine.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.840
Now, why would you need to do this?

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.860
Well if the sump hose develops a blockage
it can affect the efficiency of your machine

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.580
and if it gets pierced your machine can actually
develop a leak as well.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.940
So, in this video I'm going to show you how
to access and if necessary replace the sump

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.050
hose on your washing machine.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.900
The procedure I'm going to be using is for
a washing machine without a baseplate and

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.250
it's relatively straight-forward but if your
machine does have a base plate the procedure

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.890
is a little bit different and you can see
me doing that in another eSpares video.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.720
The machine I'm using is an LG W12225 FD and
obviously it's very important that if you

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.940
are replacing the sump hose you do use the
correct spare part for it.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.699
The procedure is largely the same for most
makes and models of washing machine.

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:07.289
It's important to point out that we are actually
going to be turning the machine onto its side

00:01:07.289 --> 00:01:10.090
so we need to make sure that there's no water
left in it.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.350
The way you can do that is by putting the
machine onto a spin and drain cycle.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.160
Then once it's finished, just take the dispenser
drawer out and make sure there's no water

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:28.020
in there as well and then if we open up the
flap at the front, you can empty out any last

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.880
remnants of water in the machine, via the
filter drain hose and you just empty that

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.390
into a cup or a saucepan.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.530
While we're down here it's also worth just
checking the filter for any debris that might

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.170
be collected in there as well.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.310
Okay, so now the machine is empty of any water
I need to disconnect it from the water supply

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.790
and I do this by disconnecting the fill hoses
at the back of the machine and also you need

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:59.330
to unplug it from the mains as well.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:03.220
Once I've done that I just need to lean it
down onto its side.

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:06.860
If it's a particularly heavy machine it might
be a good idea to get someone else to help

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.410
you do it and also if you have a hardwood
or laminate floor, it might also be a good

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.800
idea to get a blanket or just something to
lie the machine down on to protect it.

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:22.980
Okay, so now we've got the machine on its
side, we can see the sump hose here underneath.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.761
You're going to need two tools to do this
procedure: a cross head screw driver; some

00:02:28.761 --> 00:02:32.460
water pump pliers (although you can use maul
grips as well)

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.730
The first thing we're going to do is disconnect
the sump hose from the pump here.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:44.530
And we do that by un-clipping the clip.

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:56.360
Next, we need to undo this clip which holds
the sump hose onto the tub.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:05.310
Now, with that clip loosened you should be
able to pull the sump hose off the tub.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:18.810
Next, you need to unscrew the pressure chamber
that's attaching it to the tub above.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:33.740
The final thing we need to do to free the
sump hose, is to un-clip this clip here.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.880
Now the sump hose is free, we can check for
what's inside.

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.350
Sump hoses do tend to get blocked with things
such as hair grips, bra wires and sometimes

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:45.160
even socks as well.

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.459
As you can see, this sump hose isn't in a
particularly good condition so I'm going to

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.330
replace it with a new one.

00:03:52.330 --> 00:04:04.290
I can just use the old clips to fit the new
one back on.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:05.290
So there we go!

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.760
One new sump hose fitted.

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:10.430
You can find this sump hose and other spare
parts on the eSpares website.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.290
Thanks for watching.
