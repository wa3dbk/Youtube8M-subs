00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:07.860
Out of the sky bleeding with color, particles of sand were

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.280
Falling, fluttering like flower petals,

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.900
Alighting onto the cold fingertips of my outstretched hands

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:21.880
They were what everyone drifting far away had painted

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.180
Each image sways and flickers

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:29.320
Spilling over as it disappears

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:10.160
Someone placed it high up on a shelf I cannot reach

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:24.000
Someone placed it in this room before I knew it…

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:31.260
And that dream, drifting far into the distance,

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.900
As if I had picked it up in my own hands…

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:45.380
The wind dances, and everything feels so far away

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:52.160
When I turn around, it feels as if I’d seen this before

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:59.240
Even if everything else turns to dust, overcoming time

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:06.740
The dream I have yet to see sleeps in a broken box

00:02:49.540 --> 00:03:01.320
I see someone in the mirror and as their shadow lengthens, for just a moment…

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:15.220
Through the sound of the rain, I hear words that I heard once long long ago…

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:22.640
“Dance high into the skies, even if you lose yourself to your own sacrifice”

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:29.600
I cry out, hearing that voice, far in the distance ringing and

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:36.600
Into the dark, blackly woven pit of hell

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:43.860
I leap forward and disappear in the spray

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:11.560
And… the words we exchange….

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:25.480
Shaking me and myself… carry such pain…

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:32.240
The wind dances, and everything feels so far away

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.400
When I turn around, it feels as if I’d seen this before

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:46.100
Even if everything else turns to dust, overcoming time

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:53.680
The dream I have yet to see sleeps in a broken box
