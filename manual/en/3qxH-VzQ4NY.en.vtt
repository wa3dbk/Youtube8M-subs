00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.370
Welcome to Ahmet's kitchen, today we make soft cheese salad

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.790
we need from you:

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:15.790
Iceberg lettuce 1/2, 1/2 Chicorro salad, 2 fresh onions 2 tomatoes, 200g soft cheese

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:20.740
and beans

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:27.550
First we make the sauce

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.550
1 teaspoon salad herbs, then salt

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.910
pepper

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:46.910
Olive oil

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.430
Apple Cider Vinegar

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.350
Lemon juice from half a lemon

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.920
Stir everything

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.920
we let them go now until we have the other cut

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:38.830
we only cut the tomatoes

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.110
that away, down also

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.570
divided into 2

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:52.570
Now I cut the cheese into slices as the tomato

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:05.210
everything palatable

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:12.210
Now all of this can already clean

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:20.540
the beans 300g purely

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:31.459
cut the lettuce

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:44.170
the onion we cut obliquely

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.180
add in here

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.810
cut the lettuce in the middle

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:18.050
so about 1 cm

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:45.640
so ready

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:52.640
Now stir the whole

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:03.160
starting from the bottom, so that the sauce is high

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:12.290
on the plate

00:04:26.189 --> 00:04:33.189
done

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:35.490
so you can serve it

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.259
I wish you a good appetite with soft cheese salad, until next time, Ahmet,

00:04:39.259 --> 00:04:39.659
Bye :)
