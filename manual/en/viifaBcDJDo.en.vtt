00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.980
Now I'm going to show you how to use the Wii
Shop Channel. It's a really cool channel.

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.950
It's where you can buy the virtual console
games, which means you can download the old

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.430
games from the old Nintendo systems. It's
also where you download WiiWare which is stuff

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:21.820
like new channels, like the News Channel or
the Everybody Votes Channel, that kind of

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:28.240
stuff. So the Shop Channel looks like this.
Just click on it and it'll start. You do need

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:35.100
to be connected to the Internet for the Shop
Channel to work. It's going to have to load

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:53.100
because it's connecting to the Internet over
my wireless connection that we setup. Here

00:00:53.100 --> 00:01:00.250
we go. So you see they've got some recommended
titles here, and these are those virtual console

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.729
games I was telling you about that you can
buy. Looks like they've got some info. The

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.209
catalog updated. The virtual console games,
Nintendo, what they've been doing is they've

00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:16.749
been updating it like every week, adding a
couple. So now they've got a good amount,

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:22.880
and they'll be adding more and more. The new
Wii Gifting Option is new. There's also the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.229
Photo Channel's available, the same, and Game-play
video preview is now available. We'll see

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.959
what that says. I believe you need to go to
Nintendo.com, but then you can see all the

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:41.899
different things that are available. So, to
start using the channel you just click on

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:48.479
the 'start shopping' button, and then here
you've got all your options: virtual console

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.689
games; WiiWare; add Wii Points, which I'll
talk about in a separate clip; you've got

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:00.009
your account activity; titles you've downloaded;
and you can change your settings, if you want.

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.749
And just take a quick look at that. You can
set it up so you can accept gifts. You can

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:15.760
remove your account, and you can setup your
My Nintendo settings. So that's the basic

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.209
overview of the Wii Shop Channel.
