00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:06.859
This video is another in the series of Student
Guides for 

00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:09.459
Mesa Community College’s 
Canvas Classrooms.

00:00:09.459 --> 00:00:14.349
This time, we’re going to talk about navigation
inside Canvas.

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:20.240
When you log on to Canvas, the first thing
you see is your Canvas dashboard.

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:24.760
On the left side is a report on Recent Activity
in all of your courses--

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.000
Kind of like the newsfeed you see in Facebook
or other social networking sites.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.329
Everything will be in chronological order
with the most recent at the top.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.770
Your Recent Activity reports will contain
active links, 

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:44.530
so you can go directly to anything listed.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.730
On the right side are three task menus:

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.160
To Do, Coming Up, and Recent Feedback.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.160
The To Do menu lists assignments and tasks
that need to be done right away.

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.550
The Coming Up menu looks ahead a week or so,

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.800
and the Recent Feedback menu lists assignments
that have been recently graded.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.289
At the top of the dashboard are the global
menus,

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:20.289
and we call them global because they are always
visible while you are in Canvas.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.630
Courses and Groups lists all your courses
and groups.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.990
Assignments duplicates the information in
the task menus

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.000
but when you’re inside a course, you can
see this list 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.789
without having to go back to the dashboard.

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:41.970
Grades shows you a quick snapshot of how you’re
doing in each of your classes.

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.330
Calendar shows you all the due dates for all
your Canvas classes at one time.

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:50.780
You can also enter your own appointments and
deadlines,

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:55.630
and each entry is color coded, and you can
uncheck certain classes to look only at the dates

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.800
for that one class.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.800
Click on any assignment listed within your calendar
to go directly  to the instructions for that assignment.

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.860
In the upper right corner of the screen, the
Inbox link takes you to Canvas Conversations,

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.540
the place where you send and receive messages
within the Canvas system.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.550
The number after the inbox shows how many
new messages have arrived 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.920
since the last time you logged in.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.810
In the Canvas Guide on Notifications,

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.100
we show you how to set up Canvas to send copies
of your messages 

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.080
to your personal email outside of Canvas

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.560
or to your Facebook account

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.920
or other places.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.420
Finally, Profile opens the page where you
edit your personal information.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:45.820
Here, you should upload your picture or your
avatar so it will show up

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.000
with your Canvas Conversations and discussion
posts 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.820
and wherever else your name appears in Canvas.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.820
Now, let’s take a look inside a specific
course.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:06.090
The buttons you see on the left all work just
within the course.

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.380
If you click on Grades here,

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:13.330
you see only your grades for this class.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.750
If you click on Assignments,

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.010
you see only the assignments for this specific
class.

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:23.620
But if you click on the global Assignments
button at the top of the page,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.350
you see the assignments for all of your classes
at once.

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.740
Global menus are at the top of the page.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:35.790
Course-specific links are at the left side
of the page.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.880
And notice the navigation or bread crumb trail
just under the global menus.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:46.910
It’ll show you where you’re located in
what course and which tool or specific activity

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:49.010
you’re on at the moment.

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.370
To back, click on the previous item in the
bread crumb trail.

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:01.370
Or, click on the course name to return to
the course homepage.

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:10.459
Or click on the house or the Canvas logo to
go back to the dashboard.

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:15.540
Now you know how to navigate Canvas!

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.489
Please have a look at the other Student Guides
in this series.

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.630
This has been a presentation of the Mesa Community
College.
