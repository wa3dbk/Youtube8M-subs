00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.910
 

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
(Sigh.) My feet look stupid.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.000
Bam! There, you just did it. You had a thought.

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:22.779
You just got a message in your head. No big deal. We get

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:25.869
messages all the time. How can one person

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:28.210
handle that much input? How do we survive it?

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.210
Easy. We survive by filtering.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.670
Air duct repair newsletter? I don't have to open that.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:38.350
Forwarded message. Oh, cheap

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.739
prescriptions. No thanks bro. Or we take cues

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.449
from the packaging based on what we just

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:46.510
know about stuff. Oh, awkward language,

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:48.370
unlikely story, I've heard it a few times,

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.170
about a prince that wants to give me money.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.269
This is not something I need to give my

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.210
credit card number to. Or we know the

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.250
people that it comes from. Ah, that's my

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.470
friend Jane. She tends to go right to

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.479
catastrophe. So whatever she's about to

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:03.970
say is probably about half as bad as it

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.369
sounds. Hmm. I'll just see if they leave a

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.960
message. Ugh, junk mail. We absolutely

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.790
couldn't survive without filtering the

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.890
messages that we get. Think if we had no

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.520
filter. "Wait, what? A special offer just

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.609
for me? Whoa! I can't believe it! Someone

00:01:21.609 --> 00:01:23.920
in the company knows my name! Look at

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.990
these benefits! This must be a

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.259
great offer. Sign me up!" But no. We know

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:30.969
it's not a good deal. It's a generic

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:32.829
offer for a credit card which at twenty

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:34.240
percent interest is just kind of like

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.579
getting robbed. But we dodge that whole mess

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:39.820
because we filter out the message.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.070
We filter all our messages in all the

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.600
places we get them except here. When we

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.549
get messages delivered here, like we do

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.490
all day: "Nobody likes my ideas."

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.560
"I'm just not really good at that. I'm not really good

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.119
at anything." "I've made all the wrong

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.689
choices." We don't filter. We think "it's

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:00.819
all me". If we did that with every

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:03.100
external message we got, if we trusted

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.710
and believed it, we'd shut down. We'd be at

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.539
the mercy of anyone who wants to sell us

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:09.649
anything, extort money from us,

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.390
or give us a bogus picture of us and our

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.879
relationships. So let's not do that

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.989
inside. But our inside might not be as

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:20.090
inside as we think it is. According to

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.129
Roger Nelson &amp; Co our collective brains

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:23.840
can begin to spike random number

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:25.970
generators hours before massive events

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.609
like 911 even begin. Michael Persinger's

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:30.019
research indicates that we may be

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:31.670
smearing each other with our thoughts

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:34.010
across the Earth's electromagnetic field.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.140
And two and a half centuries ago Emanuel

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:37.879
Swedenborg was plugged in enough to

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.099
recite the nuances of the Stockholm fire

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:43.940
250 miles away as it happened. He said

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.650
that our brains are like a radio antenna

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.290
pulling input from more places than you

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.000
would ever believe.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.120
Take what you want to, but maybe our brains aren't like

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.310
a computer synthesizing our thoughts and

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:03.079
feelings based on our own data with our own motives.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
They're an inbox.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
["I'm ugly."]

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
["I'm pathetic."]

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.060
This is not a joke. Some of the brain spam that we get is just annoying, but some of it is

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.819
vicious. And it's hard to figure out.

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.769
We can't see who's giving the messages we get.

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:23.810
We can't go to their website and figure

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:25.940
out their mission statement. But we can

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.760
learn to filter. We can develop a basic

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.069
intelligence about the packaging that ideas

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:34.579
come in, and how we react. I can just

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:36.000
leave you with these thoughts:

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.209
Worry about the future, worry about the way

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:39.739
things will turn out for you, anything

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:42.229
that destroys hope; or anger, fear,

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:45.229
jealousy, any kind of self-hatred â€” in my

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:47.750
experience, if an idea comes into your

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:50.060
head charged with that stuff, it's like

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.609
the plastic window on an envelope.

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:54.290
It's like a generic greeting or your name

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.510
misspelled. It's how you can tell, man.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:59.020
It's junk mail.

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:01.080
