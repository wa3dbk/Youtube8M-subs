00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:07.330
Hi I'm Justin with AmericanMuscle.com, and
I have with me the 1994 Cobra R style wheels,

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:14.570
fitting all 99-04 Mustangs, available in your
choice of either silver, black, chrome, and

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.400
black with a polished lip.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.390
The 99 Cobra R's were all about one thing
-- performance.

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:25.320
Only 250 of these lightweight high horsepower
SN95's were built, and besides their awesome

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:30.130
track worthy performance, included some very
unique styling cues, which feature these aggressive

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:31.859
5 spoke wheels.

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.469
These Cobra R style wheels are cast from lightweight
aluminum so they're not going to be adding

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:37.420
any unwanted weight to your ride.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.809
As for sizing options, we're looking at a
16, 17, and 18 inch diameter, with widths

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.539
ranging from an 8" wide wheel, all the way
up to the very wide 10.5" option.

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.679
Because of the wide range of sizes available,
you can always stick a 10 or 10.5" wheel in

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.729
the rear, and an 8" wheel up front which will
give you that classic muscle car staggered

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.069
fitment.

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:02.670
Besides looking great, this will also allow
you to run some serious rubber in the rear,

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.909
which should definitely help your traction.

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.310
In addition to the staggered possibility,
these Cobra R style wheels are also available

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.850
with the always cool deep dish option, this
sets the face of the wheel further back into

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:18.770
the rim, resulting in a nice big lip, what's
great about this is, you can run a deep dish

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.119
wheel in the back, and a non deep dish wheel
in front for a more dramatic look, or you

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:27.119
can just run deep dish all around for a more
uniform look, it's entirely up to you.

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.509
As you can see our 98 GT right here is sporting
a very stealthy 17" gloss black Cobra R's

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.490
and on the lift behind me our 2000 V6 is equipped
with the 18" chrome version.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.110
Finally our 2000 GT back there on the Dynojet
is equipped with the 16" Cobra R's in silver.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:46.060
If you're interested in picking up a new set
of tires with your wheels, then you should

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.500
definitely check out one of our prebuilt tire
and wheel combinations.

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.249
Here we pair your Cobra style wheels up with
some of the top tires on the market today,

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:56.950
in sizes that are guaranteed to fit your ride
without rubbing, even if you're lowered an

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.009
inch or two.

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:01.670
In addition, you also get to take advantage
of our free shipping and handling, and free

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.829
mounting and balancing.

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.939
Finally, don't forget that all American Muscle
wheels are backed by a lifetime structural

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.230
warranty, and a one year warranty on all finishes.

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:13.269
If you've never installed a set of wheels
and tires before, don't worry it couldn't

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:14.269
be easier.

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.920
All you need is a floor jack, some basic hand
tools, and about an hour's time.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.739
You'll first want to make sure the car is
on level ground, and then crack the lugs loose

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.490
before you get the car in the air.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.970
After that jack the car up, swap the wheels,
and that's it.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.490
So if you're a fan of the aggressive 5 spoke
wheel design that looks right at home here

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:35.650
on the SN95 and on the New Edge Mustang, then
be sure to check out these 95 Cobra R style

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.870
wheels available right here at AmericanMuscle.com
