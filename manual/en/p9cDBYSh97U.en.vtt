00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:11.000
Aria!

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.000
You have come, Phantom...

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I was unable to prevent her death...

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:27.800
Who's there?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Did you come out here to greet me because you wanted to see me?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.500
You're really persistent.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
No matter how many times you visit me, 
I will not give you the treasure of Ereb.

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.500
Well, I'll guess we have to wait and see?

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.500
A meeting with a commander of the Black Mage has been scheduled...

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.500
...here in Ereb.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.800
I am hoping for positive results.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.000
If you keep making depressed expressions, you'll grow old fast.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.500
Your smiling face fits you the best.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.000
Phantom... There is something I want to give you.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Aria...

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.500
If the rumored thief Phantom wants to help Maple World...

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000
...then you are welcome to do so.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.000
But first, tell me what your purpose is?

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.000
Is it... Because of that?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So you wanted to steal something but instead, 
something was stolen from you?

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.300
My friend, let's help each other from now on. 
I expect a lot from you.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
The idea of a thief becoming a hero... Not bad, right?

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.000
The world she loved hasn't disappeared yet.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
To protect Maple World, I will fight!
