00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.300
One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, a la Shmoop.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.859
Nurse Ratched's mental ward: come for the

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:24.400
rest and recuperation, stay for the mind games
and spirit breaking.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.320
It's not a very nice place.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.509
The sheer number of unstable minds on display
brings up the big question:

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:38.729
Who's the looniest toon?
Is it our hero, the man who aims to misbehave,

00:00:38.729 --> 00:00:41.520
McMurphy?

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.820
Well, he has been institutionalized. That's
usually a good sign that something's wrong

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:52.480
upstairs.

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:58.380
He never seems to realize the danger that

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.250
he's in, or the power that Nurse Ratched has
over him...

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:08.280
...even though his arch-nemesis is watching
his every move, he's mostly concerned about

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.420
baseball and women.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.560
That is, until McMurphy tries to strangle

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.060
Ratched to death.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.060
Yeah... that's not gonna get him points on
the sanity scale.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:34.140
But to be fair, he hasn't had an easy go of
it. McMurphy's a bit of a maverick, and he

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.520
can't stand the fact that the world's trying
to squeeze him into a mold.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.460
Maybe all that crazy behavior is just a way
for him to rebel.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.820
So is he really nuts, or is it, like, the
system, man?

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.770
If it is the system, doesn't that mean Nurse
Ratched is the crazy one?

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:58.030
Well, for starters, she's super manipulative,
and her desire for power and control is definitely...

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.280
maniacal.

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:58.360
Sure, she speaks sweetly to everyone... but
she's also hiding some seriously creepy monster

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.049
eyes behind that friendly mask.

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.610
Are we the only ones who get a "serial killer"
vibe when she's around?

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.979
Speaking of serial killing, Ratched drives
two men to suicide and basically murders McMurphy

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:07.869
by ordering a lobotomy.

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.489
How does she react to all of that? With a
big fat "Meh."

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.660
But we'll hold off on saying that she's 100%
certifiable. If McMurphy is a victim of the

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.080
system, Ratched might be a victim, too.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.990
She has her orders, after all.
But wait a sec. If McMurphy and Nurse Ratched

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.300
are both actually sane, then what's really
going on here?

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.920
Maybe we're supposed to see that "crazy" is
all about perspective.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.830
Sure, McMurphy is a little nutty, but his
actions also make us realize how arbitrary

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.440
"sanity" can be...

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:41.170
...especially when the poster child for "having
your ducks in a row" happens to be the murderous,

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.470
mean-spirited, "Ultimate Grinch" Nurse Ratched.

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:50.130
To put it another way: if Ratched is normal,
we might just rather be nuts.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.489
So what do you think?

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.660
Is McMurphy the bonkers one who belongs in
a mental ward...

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.239
...is Nurse Ratched a psycho herself...

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:04.239
...or is crazy just a state of mind?
Shmoop amongst yourselves.
