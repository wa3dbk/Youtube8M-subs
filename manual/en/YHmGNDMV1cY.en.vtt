Hi. It’s Mr. Andersen and this is AP Physics
essentials video 137. It is on stimulated

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.160
emission. Imagine we had a red light, like
this, what kind of photons would it give off?

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.599
It would give off red photons. And in what
direction? They would move in all different

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.359
directions. But would it not be cool if we
could take all of those photons and point

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:30.800
them in the same exact direction? We can.
That is called a red laser. They are all going,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:37.129
what we call coherently, or in the same direction.
And we create that using stimulated emission.

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:42.600
And so if you have an atom at a low energy
level, it can be stimulated. Stimulated means

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.000
it is hit with a photon. And so if we stimulate
that atom it can take the energy of the photon

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.949
and move to a higher energy level. We call
that stimulated absorption. It is absorbing

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.820
the energy of that photon. Now if it falls
back down again it would give off the same

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:03.620
exact photon. And we call that spontaneous
emission. Spontaneous because nothing happened

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.270
to it. It just occurred spontaneously. Now
the probability, without a photon of moving

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:14.410
to a higher energy level are incredibly small
and a really high probability of falling back

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.970
down again. But what would happen if the atom
has already been stimulated. It is at a higher

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:24.460
energy level and it gets stimulated again?
So instead of moving to an even higher energy

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.560
level, watch what happens. One photon comes
in, and in stimulated emission two photons

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.380
come out. And so the energy is used to create
an identical photon. And we call it stimulated

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:41.300
because it was hit by another photon. And
so if we look at this using an energy diagram,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.220
in order for that atom to be excited it has
to get the proper amount of energy. And it

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.880
does that using a corresponding photon. The
wavelength, therefore the frequency of this

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.100
has to match exactly to the energy between
those two energy states. Now as another photon

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.350
comes in, during that emission we are going
to create two identical photons. And now let

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.750
me show you how that plays out if we have
a number of different atoms. So let’s say

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:11.290
one atom is stimulated, gets hit by a photon,
how many is it going to kick off? Two. And

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.970
those are going to go coherent to each other
and that is going to kick off two from each

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.410
of those atoms that it hits. And so you can
see how this is just building on itself. Now

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.390
if we can put these inside a container where
we reflect those photons back and forth, we

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:32.030
use mirrors on either side, then we can start
to build up a laser or this stimulated emission.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.290
So to show you how this occurs we are going
to use a PHET simulation. We are going to

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.290
hit this one atom with different wavelengths
of light. You can see the energy does not

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.940
match up perfectly to jump to the next energy
level. But I can change the wavelength of

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.819
the light. And if I get it the right wavelength
you can see what is happening. Now it is starting

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.890
to jump to the upper level and then it is
falling back down again. You can also see

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.900
these coherent photons. Those photons are
starting to travel next to each other. If

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.110
this is a laser we could put mirrors on either
side. They are going to bounce back and forth.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:03.860
And then the mirror on the right, we could
just decrease the reflectivity a little bit

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.569
and those photons are going to move out and
they are going to move out coherently. And

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:12.680
so did you learn how changes in the energy
levels of atoms is tied to either the absorption

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:30.500
or emission of photons? I hope so. And I hope
that was helpful.
