00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:05.540
ARM designs microprocessors found in all sorts of everyday objects.

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.469
 

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:13.719
Products now span the tiniest sensors to the most powerful computers. We are putting

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.369
ARM microprocessors into all sorts of 
invisible things

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.160
such as consumer electronic products
communication infrastructure

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.410
health care products energy management
products

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.410
and a huge range of different products
to make everyday life better

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.489
we have employees all around the world
with over 30 offices that supply to

00:00:48.489 --> 00:00:49.489
 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.780
the worlds semi conductor industries.
Over 300 semiconductor companies around
the world

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.780
have licensed ARM technology and build
arm-based chips

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.420
ARM and its partners together are perfectly
positioned

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.210
in the technology space

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.140
but the technology space is so
complicated these days

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.670
that no one company do everything on its
own

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:42.030
So it's all about collaboration and partnership

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.350
And over the last two decades this is about
into one of

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:52.350
ARM's core competencies

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.840
we see tremendous opportunities as communications evolve

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:03.130
and advance over the next decade, ARM

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.549
and energy-efficient make that sort of thing, a reality.
