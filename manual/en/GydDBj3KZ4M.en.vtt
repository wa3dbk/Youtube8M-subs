00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.010
One of the more important rudiments that you're
going to study on the drums is called the

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:10.930
double stroke roll.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.799
Really any roll you study and understand is
important but the double stroke is something

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:21.260
that works the muscle in your hands, really
gets your hands moving, especially a round

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:26.000
set of drums, but I'm going to play more on
the snare drum today so you see where you

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.080
start and certain techniques are involved

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.230
Basically the double stroke roll is exactly
what it says where you're getting two strokes

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.620
per hand, right, right, left, left, right,
right, left, left, and you're moving back

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.880
and forth to a tempo that becomes a clean
steady streams of notes.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:48.110
Now to start off a double stroke roll the
way a lot of people begin is basically to

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:54.340
drop their stick and to get a bounce, sometimes
called the double bounce from each stick.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:03.820
So, you drop it let it bounce and pick it
up it up after two.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:09.630
Now with that approach you're going to eventually
hit a wall of how fast and cleanly you can

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:10.630
go.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.120
So, over a period of time you want to try
to work on is called a push-pull or sometime

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:21.710
what I can a throw-pull grip where you're
throwing your arm or the stick at the head

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:27.630
and you're yanking back on the second stroke,
so that your fingers and your arms actually

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.430
have little motion in this.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:41.920
One series of doubles would look something
like this.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.500
As I pick up my arm the throw portion is throwing
the stick at the head and the pull portion

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.640
is yanking the stick back to get that second
stroke.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.920
And hopefully you'll work hard on it to get
it controlled enough where you get two strokes.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:12.110
So, as you speed it up with both hands it
looks and sounds something like this.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:27.940
And that's a good starting point for developing
the double stroke roll.
