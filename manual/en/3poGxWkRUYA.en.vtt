Hi! I'm Louis Ortiz and on behalf of Expert
Village and we are going to show you a basic

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.550
preparation for rice pilaf. I've got some
clarified butter here and I've got just some

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.970
regular sauce pan that I'm going to make the
rice in so I'm going to get some of this clarified

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:29.080
butter just a little bit and ladle just a
dab inside the pot there and I got about a

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:36.420
low flame going on my fire there. So first
off I want to go ahead and throw in the rice

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:46.489
and I'm going to throw this in here dry in
a warm pan with warm clarified butter. I want

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:53.339
to start to stir this around with a wooden
spoon so each individual grain of rice gets

00:00:53.339 --> 00:01:00.209
coated in the clarified butter and that way
it would start to brown a little bit more

00:01:00.209 --> 00:01:06.390
evenly and I want to keep it moving. Because
I don't want any of the rice to get anymore

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.600
done then the other because we want it all
to turn to the same way, same time. I'm just

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:15.000
going to put a little bit more clarified butter
in there. I'm going to throw in some onions,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.859
diced onions and some diced carrots. So I'm
going to go ahead and get all these stirred

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:31.880
around and what is going to happen is some
of the natural sugars out of the carrots and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.880
of the onions are going to come out and there
are going to coat some of that rice along

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:41.920
with the clarified butter that we have. So
there is some really cool vibrant aromas coming

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.380
off of this. We got our clarified butter as
I told you we have started the rice first

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.390
we have this nutty aroma and now you could
smell the residual sugar and such coming off.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.570
On the carrots as well as the onions I don't
want to let them to go to long but I want

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.920
them to have just a nice glassy appearance.
I'm just kind of allowing the carrots and

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:12.720
the onions to sweat on to the rice. So it
is time for our liquid part of the receipt

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:23.090
which again is one full cup of chicken stock.
We showed you how to make. So I got my liquid

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.620
element into the equation there so I'm just
going to go ahead and crank this fire up so

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:33.720
that we would bring up to a boil. Once we
have reach a boil I'm going to crank it right

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.720
back down so we could just achieve just a
simmer. At that point I'm going to go ahead

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.650
and cover it with my lid here and we would
let that simmer. What we are allowing the

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:48.439
rice to do is just to soak in all that good
reach chicken stock that we made from scratch

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:52.319
and that is what makes the rice come out nice
and tender and fluffy but it is all in using

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.129
the right amount of ratio so you don't use
to much liquid or to little. So you need to

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.250
pay attention to that. So we would come here
in just a bit and show you the simmering and

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.010
boiling technique that we just talked about.
