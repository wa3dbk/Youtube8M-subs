00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:04.430
we are here in Amsterdam in the
Portuguese synagogue

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.770
this synagogue is huge, very big

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.410
very fancy and very old

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:15.010
it's called the Portuguese synagogue
because the majority of the Jews

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.990
who were worshiping here in the 16th 17th
18th century

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.119
were Portuguese Jews, they were Jews who

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:25.790
were victims of the inquisition

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.430
of the Catholic Church. They were forced to
convert in Portugal

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:36.150
to catholicism and Holland was a very
liberal country at that time

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.320
and the Jews were welcomed to Holland

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.600
and their rabbi that was here

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.239
in the 16th century in 17th century with
Rabbi Mortera

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.020
Mortera was

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.219
a very strict rabbi because the Jews that
converted to

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.989
catholicism when they came out of

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.870
catholicism and restored their Jewish
identity here in Amsterdam

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.930
they retained some of the

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.280
Christian traditional dogmatism

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.119
and dogmatic attitude. that's why Mortera was excommunicating people for

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:17.020
for any reason that he could find. he
excommunicated

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.619
Baruch Spinoza, the famous philosopher
mathematician

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:25.039
and optician, he excommunicated

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.729
Jews that came out of catholicism,
restored their Jewish identity

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:33.899
but remained believers in Yeshua. There
were many of them

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:38.280
this synagogue and the community in
Amsterdam

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.630
still exist hundreds of years later

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.740
but the spirit of dogmatism

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.390
is dead. and we are very happy to

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:57.040
you know, say that in Amsterdam there is a
Messianic Jewish

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.940
community, a Messianic Jewish synagogue, and there is several

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.220
all throughout Holland in Hague, in Rotterdam

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:08.240
in Amersfoort and in other places.
Jewish community

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.930
of believers who are 100%

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.010
Jewish and who are also 100%
disciples

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.430
of Yeshua. they are living a Jewish lifestyle

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.470
but they accept Yeshua as their Messiah. And I think that this

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.120
is the wave of the future. This is the
wave of the future for the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.890
Jewish community and this is the wave of the
future for the Christian community
