00:00:05.161 --> 00:00:06.550
Anthony: Cooking in a Columbians kitchen,

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:07.909
you have to do a Columbian dance.

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:09.541
Carlos: That's right
and it's called Cumbia.

00:00:09.541 --> 00:00:10.474
Anthony: Cumbia.

00:00:10.474 --> 00:00:11.725
Carlos: Como quiera.

00:00:11.725 --> 00:00:14.450
Anthony: Como quiera.

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.257
I'm Anthony Anderson and I'm on a mission

00:00:16.257 --> 00:00:19.533
to find the best home cooks in America.

00:00:19.533 --> 00:00:24.559
(lively music)

00:00:24.559 --> 00:00:27.507
We're here in Sherman
Oaks on Ventura Boulevard

00:00:27.507 --> 00:00:33.867
where Carlos Andres Patino lives.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:39.345
Carlos: Today we're going
to be cooking Bandeja Paisa.

00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:42.583
Anthony: Now this means
platter of food from a friend,

00:00:42.583 --> 00:00:44.297
from a mountain in Columbia?

00:00:44.297 --> 00:00:46.249
Carlos: Paisa means you're
from a specific area

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:47.210
of Columbia.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.805
Bandeja Paisa has everything
but the kitchen sink on it.

00:00:49.805 --> 00:00:50.701
Anthony: No wonder they call this

00:00:50.701 --> 00:00:52.007
breakfast, lunch, and dinner.

00:00:52.007 --> 00:00:54.220
Carlos: That's right. A little pork belly,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.416
a little sausage, pork sausage.

00:00:56.416 --> 00:00:58.418
Anthony: Yeah, little was relative.

00:00:58.418 --> 00:00:59.785
Carlos: A little meat.

00:00:59.785 --> 00:01:01.154
Anthony: (laughing)

00:01:01.154 --> 00:01:02.842
Carlos: Don't you be
making fun of my tic tac.

00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:05.670
Anthony: Who taught you how to cook?

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.701
Carlos: My grandmother taught
me how to cook when I was a kid.

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:10.513
When the kids were out
playing making trouble,

00:01:10.513 --> 00:01:12.751
she taught me how to cook and clean.

00:01:12.751 --> 00:01:15.366
She always taught me that you
could make anything you want,

00:01:15.366 --> 00:01:17.425
but it won't taste good
unless you put love into it.

00:01:17.425 --> 00:01:20.090
Anthony: Ah, yeah, yeah,
spoken like a true cook.

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.663
Carlos: I just grew up cooking.

00:01:20.663 --> 00:01:22.465
I used to, when I was a kid I used to

00:01:22.465 --> 00:01:24.102
when my sister would come back from school

00:01:24.102 --> 00:01:25.617
in college I'd make her an omlette.

00:01:25.617 --> 00:01:27.606
I was eight years old and I
could barely look over the stove,

00:01:27.606 --> 00:01:28.743
and I'd just make her omlettes.

00:01:28.743 --> 00:01:31.237
I always liked the kitchen.

00:01:31.976 --> 00:01:34.237
I'm going to throw these in there too.

00:01:34.237 --> 00:01:36.492
I also need to grab a
little utensil over here.

00:01:36.492 --> 00:01:37.315
Anthony: Utensil?

00:01:37.315 --> 00:01:38.297
Carlos: Yeah. Well, fork I mean.

00:01:38.297 --> 00:01:39.187
Anthony: We call that a fork.

00:01:39.187 --> 00:01:40.317
Carlos: Yeah, sorry about that.

00:01:40.317 --> 00:01:42.549
Anthony: In a Columbians
case that could be a utensil,

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:44.857
but here in America,
in particular Compton,

00:01:44.857 --> 00:01:48.931
where I grew up that's
called a three prong fork.

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:51.596
Hold on. I've always wanted
to do this on camera.

00:01:51.596 --> 00:01:54.603
I've always wanted to do this on camera.

00:01:54.695 --> 00:02:00.754
Ah! Look at that. Tell the
people you learned that from me.

00:02:00.754 --> 00:02:01.455
Carlos: So we're going to go ahead

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:02.531
and put this all in here together.

00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:03.235
Anthony: Really?

00:02:03.235 --> 00:02:03.792
Carlos: Yeah.

00:02:03.792 --> 00:02:04.731
Anthony: I'm supposed
to eat this big chunk?

00:02:04.731 --> 00:02:05.804
Carlos: That's true.
You're supposed to eat

00:02:05.804 --> 00:02:07.322
that big chunk. That's
right. Nice and chunky.

00:02:07.322 --> 00:02:08.428
Anthony: There's nothing
wrong with nice and chunky.

00:02:08.428 --> 00:02:10.211
Carlos: (laughs)

00:02:10.781 --> 00:02:11.771
I'm going to show you in a minute

00:02:11.771 --> 00:02:14.432
what the Hogao looks like.

00:02:14.432 --> 00:02:16.968
Anthony: Is this Columbia's
version of a salsa?

00:02:16.968 --> 00:02:18.979
Carlos: It's a version of a cooking base.

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:20.471
That's what we use to cook with.

00:02:20.471 --> 00:02:21.867
Anthony: Okay. Is this all
right for me to eat right now?

00:02:21.867 --> 00:02:23.229
Carlos: Totally. People
do it all the time.

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:25.792
We use this for everything.

00:02:25.792 --> 00:02:28.056
Anthony: That's pretty tasty.

00:02:28.887 --> 00:02:29.981
Carlos: Any time my grandmother was going

00:02:29.981 --> 00:02:31.639
to make this plate,
everyone we knew wanted

00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.127
to come to our house
because my grandmother

00:02:33.127 --> 00:02:35.855
just had that touch. We called it sazon.

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:37.372
The tradition was we'd
always invite someone

00:02:37.372 --> 00:02:39.349
from the church, someone less fortunate.

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:40.456
Anthony: Even a sinner like me?

00:02:40.456 --> 00:02:42.295
Carlos: (laughs)

00:02:44.572 --> 00:02:45.410
Anthony: Huevo.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.183
Carlos: Huevos. Huevos is the last thing

00:02:47.183 --> 00:02:48.687
we put on the plate.

00:02:48.687 --> 00:02:50.355
I'm going to fry the egg real quick.

00:02:50.355 --> 00:02:51.383
Anthony: Oh, sunny-side up?

00:02:51.383 --> 00:02:52.528
Carlos: Sunny-side up.

00:02:52.528 --> 00:02:53.781
Anthony: I like mine scrambled.

00:02:53.781 --> 00:02:54.704
Carlos: I like mine scrambled too,

00:02:54.704 --> 00:02:56.680
but that's the way the plate is served.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:57.847
I couldn't tell my
grandma, "Hey, can I get

00:02:57.847 --> 00:02:59.018
my eggs scrambled, grandma?"

00:02:59.018 --> 00:03:00.327
She'd be like, "You're getting it

00:03:00.327 --> 00:03:01.421
"like everyone else is getting it."

00:03:01.421 --> 00:03:07.206
(lively music)

00:03:07.206 --> 00:03:08.320
Let me grab that egg and we're going

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.465
to put it anywhere you want.

00:03:09.465 --> 00:03:11.444
Anthony: Put it right there in the middle.

00:03:11.444 --> 00:03:12.486
Carlos: That's perfect. We're
going to grab some plantains.

00:03:12.486 --> 00:03:13.493
Anthony: Plantains.

00:03:13.493 --> 00:03:15.338
Carlos: Then we're going
to grab the chicarone.

00:03:15.338 --> 00:03:19.030
Anthony: Why does this look
like the jawbone of a T-Rex?

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.358
Carlos: It does look like
a jawbone of a T-Rex,

00:03:20.358 --> 00:03:22.577
but it tastes delish. That's the chorizo,

00:03:22.577 --> 00:03:23.538
and then we're all set.

00:03:23.538 --> 00:03:24.451
Anthony: Carlos?

00:03:24.451 --> 00:03:24.970
Carlos: Yes, sir.

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:26.551
Anthony: In my haste
to have you plate this,

00:03:26.551 --> 00:03:28.967
I think we forgot Hogao.

00:03:28.967 --> 00:03:30.674
Carlos: Yes, you did. I
did. I forgot some Hogao.

00:03:30.674 --> 00:03:31.991
We need some Hogao.

00:03:31.991 --> 00:03:33.971
That's the magic. Go ahead
and put this over here.

00:03:33.971 --> 00:03:35.363
Maybe a tablespoon. You're all set.

00:03:35.363 --> 00:03:39.904
There you go. That's
what I'm talking about.

00:03:39.904 --> 00:03:40.655
Anthony: How you do it?

00:03:40.655 --> 00:03:41.607
I go straight for the meat.

00:03:41.607 --> 00:03:42.408
Carlos: That's it.

00:03:42.408 --> 00:03:43.577
Anthony: Let me get a
little Hogao on there..

00:03:43.577 --> 00:03:44.447
Carlos: Eso, eso.

00:03:44.447 --> 00:03:45.171
Anthony: Brother.

00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:45.853
Carlos: My man, cheers.

00:03:45.853 --> 00:03:46.853
Anthony: Thank you for
sharing this with us.

00:03:46.853 --> 00:03:47.222
Carlos: Thank you.

00:03:47.222 --> 00:03:47.863
Anthony: Bon appetit.

00:03:47.863 --> 00:03:49.703
Carlos: Buon Appetito.

00:03:50.411 --> 00:03:53.030
Anthony: Mmm. I'm going
to make this tonight

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.582
when I go home. This is delicious.

00:03:56.582 --> 00:03:57.636
Carlos: Anyone want to try this?

00:03:57.636 --> 00:03:58.665
Anthony: I wouldn't recommend it.

00:03:58.665 --> 00:03:59.950
I'd stab you with my utensil.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.123
Carlos: (laughs)

00:04:01.123 --> 00:04:05.780
(lively music)

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:06.940
Girl: Mic.

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.803
Carlos: So now we got the sausage

00:04:08.803 --> 00:04:10.081
and the chicharone.

00:04:10.081 --> 00:04:11.045
Anthony: Hold on.

00:04:11.045 --> 00:04:13.635
Carlos: (laughs)

00:04:13.635 --> 00:04:14.537
Voiceover: Alice are you good?

00:04:14.537 --> 00:04:15.126
Voiceover: Yes.

00:04:15.126 --> 00:04:16.022
Anthony: Because I said
come out your shell

00:04:16.022 --> 23:59:59.999
don't mean come out your shell right now.
