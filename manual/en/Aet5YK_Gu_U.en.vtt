00:00:04.835 --> 00:00:06.985
- I mean hello!

00:00:07.295 --> 00:00:08.941
(bottle pops open) Boo-boop!

00:00:08.941 --> 00:00:09.731
Wodka.

00:00:09.731 --> 00:00:12.159
I chose green, like cash money.

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:13.932
This is how fancy people walk.

00:00:13.932 --> 00:00:14.543
Mmm!

00:00:14.543 --> 00:00:16.340
Actually I think it's like this!

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:17.918
Smells like Sprite?

00:00:17.918 --> 00:00:19.892
Oven top? Is that what that's called?

00:00:19.892 --> 00:00:22.237
I mean boop boop skadoop.

00:00:22.237 --> 00:00:26.020
(soft jazzy music)

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.271
(singing) Don't wait to say Jell-O!

00:00:29.271 --> 00:00:31.072
For you old school Hart-o-sexuals,

00:00:31.072 --> 00:00:33.328
you'll remember that tune.

00:00:33.498 --> 00:00:37.457
♫ Don't wait to say hello ♫

00:00:37.457 --> 00:00:38.653
But this week on My Drunk Kitchen

00:00:38.653 --> 00:00:39.697
it's not about remembering the old,

00:00:39.697 --> 00:00:41.217
it's about embracing the new,

00:00:41.217 --> 00:00:45.513
as we christen the new home of me,

00:00:45.753 --> 00:00:48.079
and also, My Drunk Kitchen.

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:48.834
This week on My Drunk Kitchen,

00:00:48.834 --> 00:00:50.135
we're going to be making Jell-O.

00:00:50.135 --> 00:00:50.819
Why Jell-O?

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:52.654
Well, Jell-O seems like the kind of thing

00:00:52.654 --> 00:00:54.534
that people I guess in the 1950's

00:00:54.534 --> 00:00:56.628
gave to their new neighbors, maybe.

00:00:56.628 --> 00:00:57.958
But first, drinking.

00:00:57.958 --> 00:00:59.212
This week, we're going to be drinking

00:00:59.212 --> 00:01:00.779
a vodka spritzer, which I don't even know

00:01:00.779 --> 00:01:02.047
if that's a real drink, but it seems like

00:01:02.047 --> 00:01:04.193
the kind of drink that
homemakers would drink.

00:01:04.193 --> 00:01:05.853
So, homemakers make Jell-O,

00:01:05.853 --> 00:01:07.513
they give it to neighbors,
et cetera, et cetera.

00:01:07.513 --> 00:01:09.289
You see we have a theme.

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:11.891
Vodka, raspberry seltzer.

00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:13.758
Cheers, dears, ooh!

00:01:13.758 --> 00:01:16.371
First spill on the new floor!
(children cheering)

00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:17.091
Mmm.

00:01:17.091 --> 00:01:19.518
Coasters, in my new
place I'm using coasters,

00:01:19.518 --> 00:01:21.376
because I really care
about these countertops.

00:01:21.376 --> 00:01:23.615
Look at them, guys, they
look like cutting boards!

00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:24.650
Mmm.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:25.704
The first step in making Jell-O,

00:01:25.704 --> 00:01:28.247
is deciding what color
Jell-O you want to make.

00:01:28.247 --> 00:01:32.392
I chose green, because
of new green beginnings.

00:01:32.392 --> 00:01:35.597
Step number two, read the
directions on the Jell-O.

00:01:35.597 --> 00:01:38.836
One cup boiling water, one cup cold water.

00:01:38.836 --> 00:01:42.168
Why would it ask me for two different cups

00:01:42.418 --> 00:01:46.276
of the same substance at
different temperatures?

00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:48.751
Jell-O, you confuse me.

00:01:48.751 --> 00:01:50.155
Since I'm making three packets of Jell-O,

00:01:50.155 --> 00:01:51.792
I'm gonna do three cups of water.

00:01:51.792 --> 00:01:52.337
Let's go!

00:01:52.337 --> 00:01:55.391
Did you guys notice my
very fancy cooking ware?

00:01:55.671 --> 00:01:57.620
It's 'cause I'm a fancy person.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.604
Pan!

00:02:00.604 --> 00:02:03.529
Here's a pan, it's a
pot, Hannah, it's a pot!

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:04.469
Mmm!

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:07.163
It works great!

00:02:07.163 --> 00:02:09.102
Guys, it works great!

00:02:09.102 --> 00:02:11.110
Three cups boiling water.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.916
One,

00:02:13.386 --> 00:02:14.593
why are you clicking?

00:02:14.593 --> 00:02:17.495
Two, three! (laughs)

00:02:17.495 --> 00:02:20.179
Also, refill your water so
you can have cold water.

00:02:20.969 --> 00:02:23.649
Because apparently Jell-O
likes it both ways,

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:26.408
(somber piano music)
which is fine, let's not

00:02:26.408 --> 00:02:29.906
promote bisexual erasure.

00:02:29.906 --> 00:02:30.847
Mmm.

00:02:30.847 --> 00:02:32.251
While you wait for your water to boil,

00:02:32.251 --> 00:02:34.051
put your Jell-O into a bowl, upon which,

00:02:34.051 --> 00:02:35.931
we'll pour both temperatures of water,

00:02:35.931 --> 00:02:37.689
stir it, and then freeze it, I mean,

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:39.449
not freeze it, refrigerate it, but anyway,

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:40.529
that's the interesting part.

00:02:40.529 --> 00:02:41.283
Mmm!

00:02:41.283 --> 00:02:43.172
Do I have bowls?

00:02:43.792 --> 00:02:45.045
The thing about moving,

00:02:45.045 --> 00:02:46.589
is that while you may have unpacked

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:48.087
everything in this frame,

00:02:48.087 --> 00:02:51.374
most of everything else is
in boxes all around you.

00:02:51.871 --> 00:02:53.229
Maybe there's a bowl though.

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:54.530
Victory!

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.283
Guys, here's a tip about
moving to a new place.

00:02:56.283 --> 00:02:58.430
Recently I read that in tiny houses,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:01.867
every item in a tiny
house has three purposes.

00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:05.025
So, if you are moving,

00:03:05.025 --> 00:03:06.704
make sure that the only bowl you have

00:03:06.704 --> 00:03:10.701
is multipurpose-able,
multipurpose-ful, bowl.

00:03:11.251 --> 00:03:12.083
Mmm!

00:03:12.083 --> 00:03:14.250
Jell-O packet number one!

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:17.737
(coughs) Don't breathe it in!

00:03:17.737 --> 00:03:19.049
Number two!

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:20.860
Number free!

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.006
Clean as you go, because
if we've learned anything,

00:03:24.006 --> 00:03:26.467
I hope it's this, (bell rings) ooh!

00:03:26.467 --> 00:03:27.732
Now that your water is boiled,

00:03:27.732 --> 00:03:29.513
add it to your Jell-O mix.

00:03:29.833 --> 00:03:34.454
Then, try and, you cleaned
up the Jell-O boxes.

00:03:34.774 --> 00:03:36.173
(nervous laughter)

00:03:36.483 --> 00:03:38.692
Add boiling mix, stir for two minutes,

00:03:38.692 --> 00:03:40.526
then add the cold water.

00:03:40.526 --> 00:03:42.593
This is why it's important
to go get the box

00:03:42.593 --> 00:03:44.671
after you've already thrown it away!

00:03:45.171 --> 00:03:48.162
(record scratch) Four hours until firm?

00:03:48.932 --> 00:03:50.301
This is gonna be one of those Kitchens

00:03:50.301 --> 00:03:53.491
where I record something
late, late into the night.

00:03:53.761 --> 00:03:57.738
Ooh, oh, yeah, that looks terrifying.

00:03:57.738 --> 00:04:00.065
It's like evil gack.

00:04:00.065 --> 00:04:02.270
Oh look, my spoon's right here!

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:03.501
Like a real kitchen!

00:04:03.501 --> 00:04:04.686
Stir, stir, stir.

00:04:04.686 --> 00:04:07.390
(nonsensical sounds)

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:09.480
C'mon buddy, just completely dissolve!

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.790
God, this really takes about two minutes!

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.683
Mm-mmm!

00:04:13.683 --> 00:04:17.142
Oh yeah, uh-oh, uh-oh second spill!

00:04:17.142 --> 00:04:18.419
Good, good, good.

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:20.730
Now that it's completely dissolved,

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:23.197
add three cups cold water.

00:04:23.412 --> 00:04:25.020
To make it lukewarm.

00:04:25.512 --> 00:04:28.009
One, two, three.

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:29.089
Stir, stir, stir.

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:33.460
There's something so, mysterious

00:04:34.614 --> 00:04:37.895
and terrifying about Jell-O.

00:04:38.271 --> 00:04:39.525
Now at this point, the instructions say

00:04:39.525 --> 00:04:41.731
to put the Jell-O into
the fridge for four hours,

00:04:41.731 --> 00:04:45.213
but, you got new neighbors,
you want to impress them,

00:04:45.213 --> 00:04:47.373
so, put the Jell-O into molds,

00:04:47.373 --> 00:04:51.228
and then put those molds into
the fridge for four hours.

00:04:51.518 --> 00:04:55.913
That extra step shows that
you have some extra pep!

00:04:57.009 --> 00:04:58.588
To make the best impression, I've selected

00:04:58.588 --> 00:05:01.026
Jell-O molds that can
also double as boobies!

00:05:01.026 --> 00:05:03.356
I just bought these, so
I need to clean them.

00:05:05.482 --> 00:05:08.305
Dip it, dip it!

00:05:08.305 --> 00:05:09.431
Put your molds into the fridge

00:05:09.431 --> 00:05:11.317
and I'll see you guys in four hours.

00:05:12.252 --> 00:05:14.243
What to do in the interim?

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:15.190
Hmm...

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:18.928
(exotic music)

00:05:18.928 --> 00:05:20.971
So, there's good news
and there's bad news.

00:05:20.971 --> 00:05:24.106
Good news is, I had
pomegranate seeds in my fridge.

00:05:24.446 --> 00:05:25.974
Good news is, there's no bad news.

00:05:25.974 --> 00:05:28.331
Bad news is, non-existent.

00:05:28.331 --> 00:05:29.841
(singing) Time to put
the Jell-O on a plate,

00:05:29.841 --> 00:05:30.612
Jell-O on a plate.

00:05:30.612 --> 00:05:31.629
More good news!

00:05:31.629 --> 00:05:34.583
This Jell-O is totally done, look at that!

00:05:35.633 --> 00:05:38.496
(singing) They call me mellow Jell-O.

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:40.591
Just kidding, I think
I'm rather high-strung.

00:05:40.591 --> 00:05:41.787
(frustrated grunting)

00:05:41.787 --> 00:05:43.424
How are you supposed to get Jell-O out?

00:05:43.424 --> 00:05:45.733
Come on-- (shouts) oh no.

00:05:45.733 --> 00:05:47.231
Oh yeah!

00:05:47.231 --> 00:05:48.950
This feels awesome!

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:50.610
Nobody leave me alone with the Jell-O.

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:51.967
Hubba hubba!

00:05:51.967 --> 00:05:54.099
Hey guys.

00:05:54.429 --> 00:05:55.788
So here you have it.

00:05:55.788 --> 00:05:57.146
(shouts) Oh no.

00:05:57.146 --> 00:05:59.224
You may notice that one is
slightly smaller than the other.

00:05:59.224 --> 00:06:02.500
Let's taste it, oh, mm, mmm!

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.910
Cool, slippery, refreshing,

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.980
but tastes heavily of cleaning product.

00:06:10.183 --> 00:06:13.283
I put pomegranate seeds in
to make it look like nipples.

00:06:13.283 --> 00:06:14.908
Hey my guys, thank you
so much for watching,

00:06:14.908 --> 00:06:16.429
as I say hello to my new neighbors,

00:06:16.429 --> 00:06:17.625
and please subscribe to my channel

00:06:17.625 --> 00:06:19.506
for new videos every Tuesday and Thursday!

00:06:19.506 --> 00:06:21.711
Also, you know when
introducing myself to people,

00:06:21.711 --> 00:06:23.662
I'm like, "Yes I'm the host and creator

00:06:23.662 --> 00:06:24.602
"of My Drunk Kitchen,

00:06:24.602 --> 00:06:27.920
"but did you also know we
have a volunteer project?"

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.571
Mwah, have a great day, mwah!

00:06:29.571 --> 00:06:31.465
Have a great Have a Heart Day!
