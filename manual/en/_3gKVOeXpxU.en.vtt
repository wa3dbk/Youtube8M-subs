[ Music ]

00:00:05.046 --> 00:00:06.376
&gt;&gt; You may think you
have nothing in common

00:00:06.376 --> 00:00:07.896
with a creature that
lives under water.

00:00:07.896 --> 00:00:13.286
But at some point in the distant
past all mammals shared a common

00:00:13.546 --> 00:00:15.746
ancestor and that
ancestor was a fish.

00:00:17.646 --> 00:00:20.666
It turns out that our shared
brain structures are one

00:00:20.666 --> 00:00:24.806
of the best places to see a
remnant of our fishy past.

00:00:26.826 --> 00:00:27.876
&gt;&gt; This is a trip
to the beginning.

00:00:27.926 --> 00:00:29.326
This is as basic as it gets.

00:00:29.326 --> 00:00:32.006
We're going human,
fish represented

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:34.066
by a cartilaginous fish
shark on the right.

00:00:34.536 --> 00:00:36.066
You see the muscles and nerves

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:39.016
and organs inside the shark
head but, importantly,

00:00:39.306 --> 00:00:40.726
you see it as yellow tissue.

00:00:40.726 --> 00:00:43.136
This is the front end
of the spinal cord.

00:00:43.136 --> 00:00:43.576
It's the brain.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.426
It doesn't look like much
but it's the shark brain.

00:00:45.696 --> 00:00:48.966
This is the human brain.

00:00:49.276 --> 00:00:51.646
This is where it all happens for
us, where our memories reside,

00:00:51.646 --> 00:00:53.346
where our fears, our
loves, our hates.

00:00:53.486 --> 00:00:54.296
It's all in here.

00:00:54.636 --> 00:00:57.906
The human brain really at the
surface level looks nothing

00:00:57.906 --> 00:01:00.436
like what's sitting
inside the shark head.

00:01:00.436 --> 00:01:01.556
Yet when you know how to look,

00:01:01.976 --> 00:01:04.436
you find a very profound
similarity,

00:01:04.436 --> 00:01:06.226
and that similarity lies

00:01:06.416 --> 00:01:09.226
in the overall architecture
of the brain itself.

00:01:10.006 --> 00:01:11.926
In the human we have
a forebrain,

00:01:12.286 --> 00:01:15.926
and that forebrain consists
of this folded tissue here,

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:17.696
where much of our
conscious thought happens.

00:01:17.986 --> 00:01:21.146
Then there's a midbrain,
this walnut-sized area

00:01:21.146 --> 00:01:24.706
in the middle, and
then a hindbrain.

00:01:24.746 --> 00:01:27.536
That's a fundamental division.

00:01:27.536 --> 00:01:29.906
We see that in development,
and we see that based

00:01:29.906 --> 00:01:31.206
on where the nerves
exit the brain.

00:01:31.206 --> 00:01:33.846
Well, if you follow the
similar nerves in a shark,

00:01:34.146 --> 00:01:36.516
what you see is sharks too
have that same structure;

00:01:36.516 --> 00:01:41.666
a forebrain, a midbrain
and a hindbrain.

[ Music ]

00:01:47.056 --> 00:01:50.436
&gt;&gt; There's a fundamental
architectural similarity among

00:01:50.566 --> 00:01:53.496
all brains; the brains of
people, the brains of dogs,

00:01:53.776 --> 00:01:56.936
the brains of cats, the brains
of monkeys, lizards, frogs,

00:01:56.936 --> 00:02:01.516
salamanders, trout, bass,
even sharks are similar.

00:02:01.966 --> 00:02:05.266
Each one of them has a forebrain
and a midbrain and a hindbrain,

00:02:05.266 --> 00:02:08.936
despite the fact that those
brains are often very different

00:02:09.216 --> 00:02:11.436
in function and form.

00:02:11.436 --> 00:02:13.766
&gt;&gt; By comparing these
two brains we can see

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.076
that the basic structure

00:02:15.076 --> 00:02:17.846
of our brain hasn't changed
much since we were fish.
