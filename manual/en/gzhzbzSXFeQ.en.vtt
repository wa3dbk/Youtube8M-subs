CARRIE: Hi Everyone! I’m Carrie Cudney from
the Training Team with Tiffany Breinholt,

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.340
one of our amazingly talented designers here
at Stampin’ Up!

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.380
We want to show you the three of the beautiful
hand-painted Designer Series Paper Packages

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:20.609
from the Holiday or Autumn/Winter Catalog.
The first one we want to highlight is called

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:28.980
Home for Christmas. You can see the traditional
colors and traditional images. They have a

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.680
retro or vintage feel to them. You'll see
the images like ornaments and fun patterns.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.300
TIFFANY: This one is my favorite.
CARRIE: The playful reindeer.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.210
TIFFANY: So cute.
CARRIE: This one is my favorite, the jolly

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.480
Santa Clause. The idea behind these images
is that they'll bring back memories from childhood

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:55.780
Christmases with that vintage feel. They are
really beautiful. The next one that we want

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.999
to highlight is called Season of Cheer. These
are traditional colors and images as well.

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:08.990
You can see the patterns and some of the same
images like the ornaments. These really focus

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:17.580
on the watercolor trend. This watercolor paper
has a softer look to it, just creates a different

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.860
feel for your projects. All of the images
have been water colored by hand. It is just

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:32.350
a really pretty, soft watercolor look for
your projects. The third one that we want

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:40.020
to highlight is called Into the Woods. This
one was done for the autumn season. This is

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.100
actually the paper that Tiffany worked on,
and there is lots of really fun texture in

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:53.730
these papers, images that can be used on any
autumn project. Really beautiful colors. They

00:01:53.730 --> 00:02:01.590
have that hand-painted look to them. They
will create a vibrant, earthy and beautiful

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:10.250
feel on your projects. Really fun colors and
textures for autumn. You heard me mention

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:16.140
the term "hand-painted” more than once.
Tiffany, why don't you explain what that means,

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.140
and what the process is behind creating these
papers.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:27.900
TIFFANY: When we are designing a DSP we start
with an idea. I usually go on the internet

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:35.110
and I gather some images. I make a board like
this, and then I do some rough sketches of

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:44.569
what I think the DSP should look like. Usually
when we do the watercolor we use our own inks

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:49.780
so that they are pretty color accurate, but
with this one we wanted to do a thicker paint

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:55.610
so we used acrylic. I went to the store and
found some paints that were similar to some

00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:02.720
of our cardstock colors and then I started
painting away. You can see that these coordinate

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:10.050
exactly to the final printed DSP. Here is
the wood-grain. It has a cool texture.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.240
CARRIE: I wish everyone could feel that, the
layers of paint.

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:17.150
TIFFANY: The texture is fun. All of them kind
of have a cool texture, but the wood grain

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:26.090
feels like what you would imagine wood feels
like. On some of these patterns I actually

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:33.150
didn't paint the 12x12. You can see I painted
little bits, and then in Photo Shop I would

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.590
arrange them so that they would make a full
sheet.

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.860
CARRIE: It would have taken a long time to
paint that whole sheet.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:44.160
TIFFANY: Yes, it would have. After that, I
actually took these to our photography department

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:50.450
and we shot them individually, one on one.
Then we put them on the computer. I had to

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:56.000
do some color correcting with them, so that
they match our cardstock very accurately.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.890
As you can see the paint didn't match exactly.
CARRIE: This is the finished papers.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:11.290
TIFFANY: You can see the color difference.
When we go to the printer then we get these

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:16.000
big press sheets that they pull of the printer.
We actually bring cardstock with us and we

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.049
match them to the paper to make sure that
they are very accurate.

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:25.749
CARRIE: Perfect. So what all of this means
for you, is that when you purchase and sue

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:31.710
these papers you will know that every image
is hand-painted or hand-drawn and completely

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.740
unique and exclusive. you won’t be able
to find them anywhere else. That's exciting!

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:43.219
You can use these art pieces in your paper
crafting to elevate them to a whole new level.

00:04:43.219 --> 00:04:48.349

hand-painted paper, be sure to talk to your

00:04:48.349 --> 00:04:53.000
