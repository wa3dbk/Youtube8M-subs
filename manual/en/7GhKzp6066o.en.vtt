00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.520
Not much remains
of the old castle

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.570
although some still remember it

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.530
in which lived Litus III,
powerful King of a forgotten country

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.550
In this castle everyone
laughed, danced and sang

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.560
Everyone... except Princess Pumpkin.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.520
Pumpkin, who lived all her life
full of luxury and comfort

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.570
often felt that princess life
didn't suit her at all

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.560
She wanted to fall in love,
to go out of the Castle,

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:50.560
to have an adventure.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.550
But she was alone and bored.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.550
One day the King, tired
of seeing her daughter sad

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:03.580
thought of a brilliant idea:
He bought the best of harpsichords

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.590
and hired the best music teacher
of the Kingdom.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.510
Oh Pumpkin, little did she know,
while watching the sun arise,

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.510
that that very same day
her destiny would change.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.590
She thought, while being
dressed for the first lesson,

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.500
"Harpsichord lessons... just another
Princess-like useless waste of time"

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.510
But of course, how would've she known

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.510
that only seconds after the
Great Hall doors were opened...

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.500
- Princess Pumpkin?
- Yes?

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.500
- Let me introduce you
Professor Kord.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.590
- Call me Calvin, darling

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.570
...she'd be entirely in love

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.570
Some say this is the end
of the story

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.500
But they're wrong

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.570
Because, you see, Professor Kord
happened to be in love

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:07.580
...with someone else

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:14.550
Months came and went.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.590
Pumpkin continued practicing

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.500
and continued looking lovingly
to her teacher...

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.550
...whose thoughts were far far away

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.560
Then the summer went away

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:29.560
and leaves became yellow

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.560
then they dried,
they they flew,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.500
and Princess Pumpkin still continued
taking lessons with Prof. Calvin Kord

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.550
and he was still distant.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.540
And then came that cold night

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.550
in which everything, once more,
would suddenly change.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:50.540
It was very late,
though no-one slept in the Castle

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.500
It was very noisy inside:
Cooks, decorators, musicians

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:57.590
and dressers, everyone was
preparing a big ceremony:

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.500
The Princess' 18 birthday was
to be celebrated the very next day

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.520
But she, far from happy or anxiuos,
was in her bedroom, crying.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.550
And then, the unthinkable happened:

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.520
Popped up, inside a Bubble,
the old Witch Mubble

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:19.580
- Don't say a word, girl, I know it.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.550
You're crying because you think that
dork of a Professor doesn't love you.

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.520
But you don't seem to know why.

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.580
It was many year ago.
A young witch fell in love whit him

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:34.520
(inner joke, never mind)

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.510
and furious, not being able
to get his love,

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:40.520
she conjured a powerful spell:

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.540
a Dis-Love spell

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:47.510
He would have eyes only for
whom doesn't love him.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.520
- And there's no way of
turn the spell off?

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.540
- Only if his True Love kisses him

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:54.510
- So, all I have to
do is kiss him!

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:56.590
- Nonsense, girl!

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:00.510
That only could happend while
she was underage

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.560
and it's too late for that!

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.510
It's half past midnight,
it's already your birthday!

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.590
You're already of age, It's done!
That pompous will never be happy!

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.540
Couldn't be mine,
and won't be of anyone!

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.540
- Oh, Witch... you forgot to change
the clock, it's ELEVEN thirthy!

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:20.580
and, no time for surprising,

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.580
she took a needle and broke
Witch Mubble's old Bubble

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.510
How happy she was now!

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.560
She still has the time for finding
her loved and break the spell!

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:35.540
The Princess tied 14 white sheets

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.570
and started climbing down
through the balcony

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.510
She ran across the Kingdom
full-speed, until she found

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.520
Prof. Calvin Kord's house

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.540
and knocked three times

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:51.510
but no-one came.

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:53.530
It was too late.

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:57.560
Her 18 birthday was
just a few minutes away.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:59.560
Her last chance to be happy
was now lost.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.530
But then...

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.540
...she felt a hand in her shoulder.

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:07.510
It was the Professor!

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.520
And, without thinking twice,

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:13.500
she stole from him the kiss
that waked him up from a long dream.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.560
He looked at the beautiful
Princess between his arms

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:20.560
and, for first time in his life,
he fell in love.

00:05:22.150 --> 00:05:23.560
The spell was broken.

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.530
Litus the King, seeing that her
daughter was finally happy,

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.540
allowed Pumpking and
Prof. Kord to be married

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.550
and to live happily ever after.

00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:46.510
But, of course,
that's part of another story,

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:48.520
that I'll tell you
some other time.
