00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.724
Alpha team is flying around the forest zone, situated in Northwest Raccoon City

00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:03.546
where we are searching for the helicopter of our compatriots, Bravo Team

00:01:03.557 --> 00:01:05.923
who disappeared during the middle of their mission

00:01:05.947 --> 00:01:08.268
- Chris, you haven't found it?
- No, I haven't found it yet.

00:01:11.384 --> 00:01:15.096
Bizarre murder cases have recently occurred in Raccoon City

00:01:15.344 --> 00:01:19.720
There are outlandish reports of families being attacked by a group of about 10 people.

00:01:20.727 --> 00:01:22.528
Victims were apparently eaten.

00:01:23.346 --> 00:01:26.641
Bravo Team went to the hideout of the group, and disappeared.

00:01:30.398 --> 00:01:32.111
Look, Chris!

00:01:47.684 --> 00:01:50.829
It was Bravo Team's Helicopter. Nobody was in it.

00:01:51.696 --> 00:01:54.811
But strangely, most of the equipment was still there.

00:01:56.017 --> 00:01:58.348
However, we soon discovered why.

00:02:12.034 --> 00:02:13.834
Hey! Come here

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.056
JOSEPH!

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:09.387
No!

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:10.718
Don't go!

00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:28.130
Jill, run for that house!

00:03:40.737 --> 00:03:43.314
There are only three S.T.A.R.S. members left now.

00:03:43.644 --> 00:03:47.225
Captain Wesker, Jill, and myself.

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.642
We don't know where Barry is.
