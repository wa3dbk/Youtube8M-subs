Hi, this is Dr Michael Persky.

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:08.300
I'd like to talk to you about chin augmentation
using chin implants.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:13.549
Both for men and women, chin implantation
is one of the fastest growing facial plastic

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:15.110
surgical treatments.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.860
We've seen an increased in demand for this
procedure.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:30.270
And many people think it may be because of
social media and the preponderance of the

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:42.940
digital age seen ourselves on video cams,
computer, Face Time, Instagram, etc.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.820
It's a relatively simple procedure to have
done.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:55.030
It's done through a small incision under the
chin and a crease where most of us have little

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:56.891
traumas in the past.

00:00:56.891 --> 00:01:06.000
The scar when it heals is almost undetectable
and the procedure is done through that incision.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.830
The section is carried down to the actual
mandible bone.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:19.821
A small pocket is made in the tight lining
of the bone on either side and the chin implant

00:01:19.821 --> 00:01:22.030
is then tucked in to that pocket.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.000
The muscles then closed, the soft tissues
closed, and the skin is closed.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.890
The stitches stay in place for 4-5 days.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:40.130
Once it heals it's very difficult to even
tell that there's anything in there both from

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.320
the patient's perspective as well as from
other people's perspective.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.090
When patients come in for chin implant consultation,
we assess their anatomy.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:02:01.090
We have different sizes of chin implant sizers
that are then placed over the area.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.549
The implant fits somewhat like this (demonstrates)
Depending on how much projection the patient

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:12.069
needs, the correct implant is selected.

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:18.821
During surgery the implant is placed along
the inferior border of the mandible and it

00:02:18.821 --> 00:02:25.810
sits kind of like this (demonstrates).

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:33.590
The most important thing when performing the
surgery is to make sure that your surgeon

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:41.030
dissects low on the mandible to avoid these
little holes called, where the mental nerve

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.709
comes out and if this is damaged you can end
up with some numbness.

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:54.290
So it's very important for the surgeon to
know their anatomy obviously as with any surgery

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.629
and to avoid that.

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:05.709
Ideally you want your chin to hit your lower
lip if a line was dropped straight from your

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:09.520
lower lip to your chin tangentially.

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.220
That's about the projection that you want.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:19.120
Another interesting aspect of augmentation
implants in that area is a pre- implant which

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:25.670
doesn't really have the projection for the
chin but it has projection out here for the

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.480
jaw and these and the pre jaw.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:36.010
So what it does is it blends the jaw area
with the chin and gives the patient a stronger

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:39.870
chin line.

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.239
So it sits there like this (demonstrates).

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:46.159
It doesn't really give you projection but
it fills in the jaw area permanently.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.300
The chin implant and pre jaw implant are available.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.610
It's a relatively simple procedure it takes
probably about 30 minutes to do.

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.760
It's usually done in the operating room.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.160
If you have many more questions about your
chin or chin implants, please feel free to

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.900
contact us.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.710
One of the really nice things about chin implant
is the bigger the chin is the smaller the

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:10.910
nose looks.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.319
Be well, bye.
