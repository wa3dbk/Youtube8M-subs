00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.000
Hi, I'm Tricia, a California organic gardener.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.460
I'm here at my friend Stephanie's backyard orchard.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.060
And in addition to these
beautiful walnuts, Stephanie wants to plant a fig tree!

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.400
Site selection is really important to
the success of your tree,

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.000
you want to pick an area that's got lots of sunlight, good
air circulation, and good drainage.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.540
You want to dig a hole at least twice as big as the size of the roots.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:33.740
In preparation for planting, I have
filled this hole with water

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.740
and let it drain twice to ensure this spot has
proper drainage.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.620
If you don't have soil that drains well, you might wanna consider planting your tree in a raised bed.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:48.300
This soil is full of clay so I'm going to rough up the sides before I plant the tree.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.270
Figs don't like to be fertilized right off the bat, so i'm not gonna add any at planting time.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.660
If this was an olive tree,
I'd definitely add some fertilizer.

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.740
So i think I'm ready to plant the tree now.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.890
Figs and pomegranates have a pretty
sensitive root system.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.390
Olives and citrus are evergreen so your
chances of success by planting trees

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.700
that come in this sleeve are
greater than if you were planting bare root.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.080
Carefully massage the tree out of its
sleeve

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.640
and if you see any dry or dead roots, just snip them off.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.080
Inspect the root system carefully.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.790
Place the tree in the hole and backfill the unamended soil.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.310
For anything other than a fig, you want to plant the tree at the same level that it was planted before.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.130
Alright, now that my hole is filled, I'm going to
compact the soil lightly with my hands.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.350
And I've put a little mound of about one to two inches high around the root to prevent crown rot.

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.789
So finally I'm going to water the tree and watch for settling.

00:01:52.789 --> 00:02:01.429
If the tree starts to settle and you get some air pockets in there, you can lift up on it and remove them.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.670
Fruit trees require a lot more water while
they're getting established than they will later on.

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:12.439
Right now I'm going to use this shrubbler and I'm putting it on the up slope of the tree.

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:18.059
And these are great because you can adjust the amount of water anywhere from 0-20 gallons per hour.

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.570
This tree is gonna need about six to eight
gallons,

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:26.079
oh, about every other day, every couple of
days while it's getting established

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:31.119
I'm going to add about three to six inches
of compost mulch over the top of the hole.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.180
Wow! Look at all those beautiful little earthworms coming out of my compost! WooHoo!

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:40.949
You want to make sure and not let the compost mulch get up to the trunk of the tree.

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.199
And so finally we want to put some straw mulch or bark on the top,

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:54.800
and mulching is really gonna help keep the soil moist, and it's going to prevent weeds,

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:57.329
and it's going to help improve the tilth of the soil.

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:01.699
So to protect Stephanie's little fig tree 
from the hot California sun,

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:06.109
I'm going to put this spiral tree guard around the trunk.

00:03:06.109 --> 00:03:09.660
So in a couple of years hopefully
Stephanie will share some of her figs with me!

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:14.120
In the meantime, maybe I'll get some walnuts for helping her plant the tree!

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.700
So thanks for watching! And Grow Organic for Life!
