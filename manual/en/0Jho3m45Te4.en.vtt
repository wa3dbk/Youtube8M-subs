In this episode, I’ll show you how to animate
text around an object. You can download this

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.940
project for free by clicking the link below.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.300
I'm Mark Spencer from RippleTraining.com.
Welcome to Motion Magic where you'll learn

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.789
visual effects and motion graphics in under
5 minutes.

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:25.410
Here we are in Motion. I have a rotating earth
that was built with a still image, the Sphere

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.460
filter, and a parameter behavior. You can
find a similar animation in Motion’s library.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.480
You can use any object that has a transparent
background. To show that the background is

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.420
transparent, I’ll go to the Channels pop-up
menu and choose transparent; the checkerboard

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:46.809
represents areas of transparency. I’ll set
that back to Color.

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.879
With the playhead at the start of the project,
I’ll press T for the text tool, click in

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.309
the Canvas, type some text, and press the
escape key. If needed, I can format it in

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:59.789
the Heads Up Display but this looks good for
now.

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.519
To wrap the text, I’ll go to the Text Inspector,
to the Layout pane, and change the Layout

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:12.100
Method from Type to Path. Then, in the Path
Options section, I’ll change the Path Shape

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.109
from Open Spline to Circle, and increase the
Radius to about 400 to be larger than the

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:21.529
earth. Then I’ll position the text around
the earth in the Canvas.

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:25.969
The text is now wrapped around the object,
but what I really want is to wrap it around in 3D

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:30.999
space so that it goes behind and in front
of the object. To do that, I’ll select the

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:36.560
Adjust 3D Transform tool, then in the Canvas,
I’ll hold down the Shift key while dragging

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.279
down on the red X-axis rotation circle to
rotate the text 90 degrees so that it’s

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:44.479
laying flat like a floor.

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.099
The text path now encircles the globe like
the rings of Saturn, but I need the letters

00:01:49.099 --> 00:01:55.450
to stand up, so back in the Text Inspector,
in the Format pane, under Advanced Formatting,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.159
I’ll open Rotation and set Rotation X to
-90 degrees.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.219
If I now return to the Layout pane and drag
the Path Offset parameter value field, we

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:12.600
can see the text never actually goes behind
the globe. This is because groups are 2D by default.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.599
In the Layers list, I’ll click the 2D/3D
icon to the right of the Comp group to switch

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:23.489
to 3D. Now if I reselect the text layer and
change the Path Offset value, the text rotates

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:25.780
around the globe.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.730
To animate the text, I’ll right-click the
Path Offset parameter name and choose Add

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:37.730
Parameter Behavior &gt; Rate. I’ll set the
Rate to -15% and play the project.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.060
 I can also rotate the text on the X and Z axes for a
more dramatic effect.
