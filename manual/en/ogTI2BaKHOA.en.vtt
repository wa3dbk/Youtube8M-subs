00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.734
The President:
Earlier this year,

00:00:01.734 --> 00:00:05.066
I launched something we're
calling "My Brother's Keeper,"

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:11.333
and I think that many of
you recall me talking in very

00:00:11.333 --> 00:00:16.667
personal terms about someone
who grew up without a father

00:00:16.667 --> 00:00:18.767
and made some mistakes
when I was young,

00:00:18.767 --> 00:00:24.700
but benefitted from the love
and attention and opportunities

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.967
that were given to me during
the course of growing up,

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:33.533
and the fact that we have too
many young men of color -- 

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:39.900
black boys and young men, Latino boys
and young men -- who are adrift

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.960
and don't have those same
opportunities and don't have

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.133
those same structures
of support.

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:48.133
The idea behind "My Brother's
Keepers" was that there

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:50.266
are a lot of folks that
want to do something,

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:52.567
but we hadn't
created a platform,

00:00:52.567 --> 00:00:55.934
a mechanism to gather all
those resources together,

00:00:55.934 --> 00:00:58.900
concentrate and focus
on them, get good data,

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.166
figure out what the
best practices are,

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.200
and then go out
there and implement.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:10.300
And so what I did was assign
a process for us to inventory

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.000
everything that's already being
done to help young boys of color

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.433
and men of color to succeed,
to have every agency -- 

00:01:18.433 --> 00:01:26.500
from Justice Department to Education
to HUD to USDA -- look at how they

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.033
could contribute to the
process to make sure that we've

00:01:30.033 --> 00:01:32.834
got the best data possible,
and then to report back

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:35.967
to me so that we can
have a plan of attack.

00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:40.333
Today, thanks to the good
work of my Cabinet Secretary,

00:01:40.333 --> 00:01:46.000
who has been heading this
up as well as our

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.300
Deputy Secretary of Education
-- Broderick Johnson

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.266
and Jim Shelton, they've
presented to me our

00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:57.400
report on what we
need to be doing.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.500
And it is comprehensive and it
goes -- everything from making

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.467
sure that we've got better
early childhood education

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:07.567
to finding better ways to create
apprenticeship programs

00:02:07.567 --> 00:02:10.767
and job-training programs
and mentorship programs;

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:15.600
how do we modify policies in
schools where young men of color

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.900
are being disproportionally
suspended -- which we know

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.433
results in higher dropout
rates, which we know results

00:02:21.433 --> 00:02:26.700
potentially in them ending up in
the prison system -- all the way

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:32.200
to how do we deal with young
people who have gotten into

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.900
trouble with the law but can be
redeemed if we have effective

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.266
ways of reaching them.

00:02:41.266 --> 00:02:46.200
With this task force report,
we're now looking to implement.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.066
And we're partnering
with philanthropies,

00:02:49.066 --> 00:02:50.433
we're partnering
with businesses,

00:02:50.433 --> 00:02:54.367
we're partnering with
community organizations

00:02:54.367 --> 00:02:56.734
and non-governmental
organizations that are already

00:02:56.734 --> 00:03:01.567
doing great jobs on the
ground but feel isolated

00:03:01.567 --> 00:03:05.767
and disconnected from other
efforts in other places.

00:03:05.767 --> 00:03:10.734
And the goal then is going to
be for us over the course

00:03:10.734 --> 00:03:16.600
of the next couple years to
really put in place not only

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.867
an all-hands-on-deck effort
on the federal level,

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:25.467
but a partnership with the
private sector so that we can

00:03:25.467 --> 00:03:27.133
see some concrete outcomes.

00:03:27.133 --> 00:03:32.734
And we've already got enormous
enthusiasm from mayors around

00:03:32.734 --> 00:03:35.767
the country, many of whom tell
us that this is the single-most

00:03:35.767 --> 00:03:39.066
important priority that
they have in ensuring

00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:40.300
that their cities will thrive.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:43.300
We've got businesses
who are saying,

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.500
we know this is going to be
the workforce of the future,

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.500
and if we do not address
this demographic,

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.467
our companies aren't going to
prosper and the American economy

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:58.767
as a whole is not going to
grow as quickly as it could.

00:03:58.767 --> 00:04:04.367
We know that there is enormous
enthusiasm from faith-based

00:04:04.367 --> 00:04:09.967
groups that feel as if they're
laboring out there on their

00:04:09.967 --> 00:04:12.734
own and want to connect
up with others.

00:04:12.734 --> 00:04:17.333
We know that our national
service programs have real

00:04:17.333 --> 00:04:20.033
interest in figuring
out how this works.

00:04:20.033 --> 00:04:24.800
So you're going to see a rollout
over the next several weeks of

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:28.900
some very specific commitments
that have already been made.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:34.967
We have benefited from input
from a whole range of sources.

00:04:34.967 --> 00:04:38.200
There have been listening tours
that Broderick and Jim have

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.800
conducted in cities
all across the country.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.633
I want to thank the CEO of
Deloitte, Joe Echevarria,

00:04:46.633 --> 00:04:50.433
as well as Magic Johnson,
who are going to be leading

00:04:50.433 --> 00:04:53.934
an external push to get
more folks on board.

00:04:53.934 --> 00:04:57.600
And I also want to thank members
of Congress who have given

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.166
us some great input, as well.

00:04:59.166 --> 00:05:02.367
One of the big pushes we're
going to make because

00:05:02.367 --> 00:05:04.734
of the timing is on summer jobs.

00:05:04.734 --> 00:05:11.467
And already we're seeing I think
a much greater sense of urgency

00:05:11.467 --> 00:05:15.800
this summer about putting these
young people in opportunities

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.767
where they can learn the basic
skills that they're going

00:05:18.767 --> 00:05:21.000
to need to get attached
to the labor market.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.300
So overall, I'm very
happy with the report.

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:30.500
We'll give the press the report
and our executive summary to see

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:33.300
the very specific steps,
the things that we know

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:34.600
are going to work.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.900
And we are going to be rolling
out over the next several weeks

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:42.934
more specifics about commitments
that we've obtained,

00:05:42.934 --> 00:05:46.200
and you can expect over the
course of the next year,

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:51.867
you're going to be getting more
news from us about the successes

00:05:51.867 --> 00:05:54.500
that we're achieving and the
lessons that we've learned.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.066
But the bottom line is this:
As we approach Father's Day,

00:06:00.066 --> 00:06:04.233
I'm just reminded that I am
only here because a bunch

00:06:04.233 --> 00:06:06.500
of folks invested in me.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:10.967
We've got a huge number of
kids out there who have

00:06:10.967 --> 00:06:14.133
as much talent, and more
talent than I had,

00:06:14.133 --> 00:06:17.567
but nobody is investing in them.

00:06:17.567 --> 00:06:20.533
And I want to make sure
that I use this platform,

00:06:20.533 --> 00:06:24.333
and every Cabinet member here
wants to make sure that they

00:06:24.333 --> 00:06:31.133
use the tools that they've
got, so that these young men,

00:06:31.133 --> 00:06:33.233
young boys, know somebody
cares about them,

00:06:33.233 --> 00:06:36.433
somebody is thinking about them,
and that they can succeed,

00:06:36.433 --> 00:06:38.813
and making America
stronger as a consequence.

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:40.740
All right, thank you very much, everybody.
