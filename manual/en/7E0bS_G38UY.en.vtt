00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.100
J.Bradshaw: Yardy on to bowl the 41st over. I thought this mightn't be a bad time to have a look

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.860
at it...two established batsmen....
M.Nicholas: Yeah that yellow bar in the final

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.340
segment showed England's burst in this last
ten over period when they made

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.640
92 runs

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.340
Strauss really swapping his bowlers
around here determined not to let any

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.480
of the Australian batsmen settle against someone

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.400
Err I think he's saying I want a batting power play

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.870
M.Erasmus (Umpire) :  No No...it's not my problem...

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:41.100
Because that's the rule

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.800
We've been in postion for more than a minute!

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.829
M.Nicholas: Yeah, there you go. Marius Erasmus says everybody's been

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.650
in position for more than a minute. You
can't make your decision now. You should

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.920
have made it earlier. So Clarke's gotta wait an over before he could take his batting

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.340
power-play

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.100
I.Healey: He must have wanted it with
Yardy

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.540
so he might wait two overs out till Yardy
comes back on for his last over, this is

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.860
his ninth...he might wait two overs...but see what happens.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.560
M.Clarke: Yeah, well try batting in my position...

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.420
.....see how'd you feel

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.320
M.Erasmus: I'm batting for you mate...

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.060
I.Healey: Clarke's cranky....It's good...

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.460
Australia are just above the English line
but under where they want to be - that

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.680
pink line is what they really want

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.540
M.Clarke: Does this concern you?...no?....well then piss off!

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.780
I.Healey: but this is a fantastic game in progress

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:30.820
the captains are blueing and the umpire is
settling and it is heating up it's been

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.520
hot all day &amp; the finish is even gonna be
just as good

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.420
Tony Greig and Michael Slater

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.740
are into the commentary box. They're both with Mark Taylor

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.300
M.Clarke: Fuck off (inaudible)...fuck...(inaudible) fuck (inaudible)...

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:42.500
M.Taylor: Well two of the three men are smiling

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.640
mainly umpire and bowler

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.820
Michael Clarke's not too happy about it

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.840
He wanted to call the batting power play at the start of last over...but...

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.060
I think Marius Erasmus got it right

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.180
I think he waited too long - that was the problem

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:59.560
as there's nothing wrong (a) captain calling for the power play but he

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.299
just waited until Andrew Strauss had
picked his bowler set the field and

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.040
then he said no hang on I want a
batting power play

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.180
no you've got to do it before

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.140
before that

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:09.340
I think Marius Erasmus

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:10.680
One thing I've liked about him right through..

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.460
this summer he's trying to get the game
moving

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.920
if we've had it one criticism up here for a number of years

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.740
here for a number of years in the commentary box

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.180
it slows down too much so

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.060
I think he's done an excellent job...the umpire

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.280
T.Grieg: Yeah I agree with that.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.540
Agree with that absolutely wholeheartedly

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.960
...and...umm..it is it is a business of making sure

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:34.240
everyone gets on to it...we've had far
too many drinks run out at inappropriate

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:39.819
times just prior to a drinks break to
have drinks runners on the ground

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.340
is ridiculous then you're right it's rather
like the umpire decision review system

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.820
you neither do it straightaway or don't
do it at all. (If) you take too long...Well...

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:53.060
...bad luck

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.460
M.Taylor: Now there's only three men out

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:59.240
I'm not sure they signaled for the batting power

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.960
play as yet...now hang on now now we're
gonna have the umpires get together

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.640
and now what's going on here? Michael
Clarke he's livid

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:15.110
Darryl Harper's just walked over to Andrew Strauss and said well hang on, you have to

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:18.640
bring an extra man in but I have actually
haven't seen a signal yet for a batting power play

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:19.540
D.Harper (Umpire): It's not on !?

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.880
This is turning out to be comical really it's

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.320
either a batting power play or it's not

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:26.960
D.Harper: It's not on, if it's not on...

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.200
M.Clarke: Everyone now wants us to take it...eh...eh!?

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.100
D.Harper: Shall we do a vote!

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.540
M.Slater: Michael Clarke can't believe what's going on...he...he's wondering...

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.800
...now he's laughing...he's got a lot to say

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.420
is it a batting power play or what?

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.500
we're talking about getting the game sped up

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.400
Well, this is been the longest delay of the match

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:47.300
(radio): No power-play

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.080
D.Harper: Never has been!

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.860
M.Taylor: Darryl Harper just said no power play so

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:56.690
we're still allowed, or Andrew Strauss is
still allowed to have five men outside

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:01.000
T.Grieg: Well he said no power play and never "has been"

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.980
M.Taylor: okay so it's just back to four men

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:06.040
inside the circle so half an hour later
we're going to borrow the forty second over

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.240
[[Australia won; M.Clarke was not out]]
