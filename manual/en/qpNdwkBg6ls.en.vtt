00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:12.150
It seems to be taking many small incremental
changes, but the Asphalt series by Gameloft

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.810
is slowly approaching something akin to the
coin-swallowing racers that still dominate

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.420
modern arcades.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.290
Gorgeous in its presentation, utterly unrealistic
in its racing, but still challenging thanks

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:29.099
to fierce AI opponents, Asphalt 7: Heat keeps
things simple, but nails the mindless fun

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.919
inherent in the genre.

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.890
Each of the 15 eye-popping stages feature
a range of hidden, and not so hidden short-cuts

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:39.519
that will eventually become the difference
between finishing on the podium.

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:43.880
The game itself is split in to 13 cups, requiring
players to complete a series of fixed events

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:49.329
before competing for the cup itself and unlocking
a special car should you take out first place.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.999
The range of vehicles on offer is nothing
short of impressive, with anything from fast-fours

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:58.719
to super-cars and everything in between being
available, albeit for a price.

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:03.300
Each handful of cars are split in to one of
seven tiers, with players being given one

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.200
car to start with that can also be upgraded.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.390
New cars are unlocked as you earn stars from
races or completing mini-missions, but if

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.120
you're after an edge you can also 'rent' a
car in the appropriate tier for a reduced

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:15.120
price.

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.410
The career mode initially presents itself
asa very linear experience, starting (predominantly)

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.560
with lower tiers of cars and slowly working
its way towards the final tier.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.610
However, in a surprisingly refreshing change
the game mixes things up by going back to

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:34.220
earlier tiers and introducing harder AI opponents
to test your ability to drift, conserve turbo

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.160
or 'adrenaline' boosts, and manipulate short-cuts
to your advantage.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.380
This manages to stave off the usual fatigue
from repetition, though lengthy play sessions

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.530
can still feel same-ish.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.390
Once you've unlocked a few cars it's worth
checking out the multiplayer as well - hosted

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.090
mostly through Gameloft's servers, it's hard
not to find a race or three and despite some

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.270
latency, the games ran smoothly (though drop-outs
from other drivers were quite common).

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.920
The only thing missing from Asphalt 7: Heat
is an evolution to the gameplay itself - the

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.170
gameplay tweaks and career balancing make
for an intense and entertaining Arcade Racer,

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.830
but it's still the mindless drifting and turbo-punching
gameplay we've come to expect, albeit pitch-perfect

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:20.810
in its execution.
