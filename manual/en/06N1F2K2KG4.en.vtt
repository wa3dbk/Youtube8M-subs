00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:23.470
Pfft, iOS games and this casual mumbo jumbo.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.359
Hey, it’s not like these are real video
games, right?

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.990
They don’t have a plastic controller.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.980
They don’t have cords all over the places.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.370
What a jo—oh, this is an action RPG?

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.220
What’s that?

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.620
Custom control mapping and leveling up and
stuff?

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.100
Well, that all sounds like a real video game.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.290
Are you sure this is an iOS gam—oh, it uses
touch controls?

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:50.990
Ah, I knew it!

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:53.120
Just get...get out of here.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:01:01.040
With your ORC: Vengeance for the iPhone.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.580
The only thing separating ORC: Vengeance from
similar games on dedicated handheld consoles

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.070
is that it’s more affordable.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.660
Otherwise, you couldn’t tell the difference.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.580
And of course, given the team behind it, that
makes sense.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:21.570
ORCS: Vengeance is the work of Big Cave Games,
a little studio with massive talent.

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.320
Its two founders worked at places like Treyarch
and iD Software before setting out on their

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.310
own to develop games with a smaller team and
smaller budgets.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.510
ORCS brings a clearly Diablo-like experience
to Apple’s platforms, a blueprint for which

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.350
touch control would seem like a seamless addition.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.350
And it is.

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:47.080
You play the entire game with a simple touch.

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.700
Touch a spot, your orc goes there.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.760
Touch an enemy, you attack.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.950
ORCS couldn’t be simpler to control, yet
it also provides console-like gameplay.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.950
Part of that depth comes from its gesture
system.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.890
You can assign various skills or attacks to
certain gestures, whether drawing a quick

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.009
circle, double tapping or even performing
a quick swipe.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.640
It feels good, and more importantly, it just
works.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:24.329
And actually, the control customization is
exceeded in depth by the RPG elements.

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:29.040
Leveling up and improving your attributes
is obviously a key component, but there’s

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.040
more than that, too.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.930
There’s a seemingly endless amount of items
and weapons to collect and either use or sell,

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:41.049
so your orc’s skills and abilities are totally
up to you.

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.209
What I find most interesting about ORC is
its development foresight.

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:50.939
They took this genre that sucks up your time
and demands long play sessions...and condensed

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:56.579
it into an iOS game that, while still deep
and rewarding, can also be played in shorter

00:02:56.579 --> 00:02:57.579
bursts.

00:02:57.579 --> 00:03:02.030
By throwing in lots of checkpoints, it’s
adapted perfectly for gaming on the go.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.639
And not only that, but it has the look of
a console game, as well...and on devices that

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.700
some would have you believe aren’t real
gaming platforms.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.040
Cling to buttons and cords, if you must.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.540
The rest of us will enjoy games like ORC:
Vengeance, a great little action RPG that,

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:29.540
yes, we got in the App Store.
