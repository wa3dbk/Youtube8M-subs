The decline of American cities, some once proud examples of the industrial might of the United States is another 
 huge reminder of the economic collapse we are facing in 2012 or in the next few years.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:29.570
In many cities that used to be prime examples of this industry such as Detroit Michigan, Gary Indiana, 
 Flint Michigan and others, industries such as steel mills, car manufacturers and other blue collar industries,

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:46.929
those that power much of what we use every day, have left because of stiff competition from foreign countries 
 like China or they are in search of cheaper labor like what we see in India and China.

00:00:51.767 --> 00:00:59.767
Many cities such as Detroit have seen housing prices go from $100,000 for the price 
 of an average house down to a ridiculous level such as $10,000 or $15,000.

00:01:07.203 --> 00:01:14.203
In some cases we wee prices in the 4 figure range around $6,500 or less and 
 in the worst examples in Detroit we even see whole sections of the city abandoned.

00:01:52.582 --> 00:02:04.580
And in some cities such as Oakland California, police won't even response to crimes such as robbery, 
 identity theft, loud music, interfering with a power line and unauthorized connections to tv cables. 

00:02:07.586 --> 00:02:12.590
So, I guess if you want to get 
 free cable TV, head to Oakland CA.

00:02:18.082 --> 00:02:28.080

 once proud American cities that are prime examples of America's decline:
