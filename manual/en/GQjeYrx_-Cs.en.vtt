00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.569
No that's a candle that eats its vegetables

00:00:08.569 --> 00:00:14.029
a candle that size has got to have a special
name or meaning. Right? Right..

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.710
We are talking the Paschal Candle on this episode of Chuck Knows Church

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:24.710
[fun music intro]

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.380
Paschal comes from the Hebrew word
meaning

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.600
meaning "deliverance"

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.070
or Passover and in the Christian
church it means Easter

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:44.680
so it connects the resurrection

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.600
to the exodus from Egypt. [subtle: "How bout that"]

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.670
now for most congregations it's the
largest candle in worship

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.960
and will sometimes display the cross or the
Greek letters Alpha and Omega signifying

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.290
God is the beginning and the end.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.570
now Paschal also rhymes Eddie Haskell

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:06.080
which is uh... literally no significance what so ever.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.170
now for Christians Easter is the

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.100
Passover of the Lord where Jesus

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.180
passed from death into life.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.670
so the Paschal candle is often
referred to as the Easter candle.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.560
It's flames represents Christ as the
light of the world and can be a great

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.580
way to entry into the mystery of the resurrection.
resurrection

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.610
For example,

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.560
many churches that utilize the Paschal Candle
will do so to introduced

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.200
the Easter vigil

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.930
then they keep the candle lit for all the
services during the fifty days

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:35.970
from Easter

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.260
to Pentecost.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.020
So, that's why

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.690
you're gonna need a bigger candle.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:45.310
Be careful

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.830
be sure to get a good glass of brass candle
follower to save it from dripping and burning every which way

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.030
cause a good drafty church can, uh,

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.150
blow the heaping wax in to quite a mess.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.230
[serious voice] and don't forget to consult the candle safety manual for proper candle care

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.170
and maintenance.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.300
Alright, that's the Paschal Candle

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.710
If you wanna learn more

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.009
