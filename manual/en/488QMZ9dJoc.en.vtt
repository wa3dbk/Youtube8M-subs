00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.890
This is the question that came in.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.850
Hello Antonio, I discovered your website “Real
Men, Real Style” and I think it’s great.

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:37.850
Thanks.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.629
I have a question about ties.

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.160
Basically what is the best tie know to use
for any occasion I go to?

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.850
Example being is the Windsor knot for formal
events.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.850
Is the four-hand? is that for casual events?

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:54.879
I hope you’ll be able to find time to answer
this question.

00:00:54.879 --> 00:00:55.879
Many thanks.

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:02.090
To get right to the questions, there are actually
isn’t a right tie knot for a certain occasion.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.220
The only – actually I take that.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.700
The only one I think of is for black tie.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:12.211
And when something says black tie that means
that you should be wearing a bow tie, one

00:01:12.211 --> 00:01:13.760
that you actually tie.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.670
So don’t buy those clip-ons.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:22.090
Well besides black tie events which we very
rarely ever go to anytime you need to be wearing

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.270
a tie you can wear any type of knot that you
want, as so long as it doesn’t detract and

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.520
pull away and make you look you know a bit
eccentric.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.970
That’s one thing you know you need to become
from with this.

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:37.630
So right now I’ve got a four hand and it’s
not the straightest knot.

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:40.690
I know there’s a knot going to retie it
multiple times.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.920
This is a knot that I love.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.040
It’s the first knot I ever learned to tie.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:49.920
Had a job where I was stacking groceries at
Albertson’s and this is back in 1990 I believe

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.630
and you had to wear a tie and a white dress
shirt and this was the summer I learned really

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.160
how to tie a tie because every single day
on the way to work I was tying that thing.

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:03.050
Taking it off at lunch break.

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.900
I’ve got a connection to this tie.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.900
I love it.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.350
It’s – so this knot in particular is the
one that I use for a 98% of the time.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.819
Now the 2% of the time I’m throwing in something
because there’s a lot of other knots out

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.480
there and perhaps you will find one that you
like because maybe it looks good with your

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.840
head shape, with your neck color type.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.590
Maybe you want to go with the half Windsor.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.099
You want to may go with the full Windsor,
a Pratt, Shelby, a Cabin dish, the simple

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:34.629
knot, honestly there are almost a hundred
that I know.

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.090
Almost a hundred knots types out there and
not going to get into them all.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.981
Probably – actually a book has been written
about this I’ll actually maybe I’ll do

00:02:42.981 --> 00:02:48.349
a review on this book and link to it later
but the answer your question again, you’ll

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.940
hear and you’ll actually see me write about
this.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.060
There are knot types that you can try to match
with certain types of shirt colors.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.010
So right here I’ve got a medium spread color.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.510
Technically I could be wearing a half Windsor
or a Windsor because those are going to fill

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.110
up the top space a bit better but I still
like the way the four hand looks.

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.280
I don’t think it’s overwhelmed by the
size of the tight space I have up here.

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.870
Although there are many with larger heads
and because they have a larger head or they

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.810
got maybe a lot of hair on that larger head
as well.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:26.189
They need a larger knot for it to look proportional.

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.569
So that’s probably the key thing you want
to think about is what not is going to look

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:31.569
proportional.

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:37.640
So if you got a really small thin head, you
want a small know because if you wear a Windsor

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.209
knot and if it’s something that you’ve
a very thick tie.

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.280
That knot in comparison with your head, it’s
just going to make your head look smaller.

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.470
So just think about that and be you know also
at the end of the day you want something you’re

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.510
comfortable wearing.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.480
So if you put it in to a knot that you never
worn before and you feel people are staring

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.480
at you.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.159
Well you’re not going to – you’re not
going to perform.

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.330
You’re not gong to be – you’ll just
going to feel nervous and whenever we feel

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:04.879
nervous about something that we can control,
that’s a bad thing.

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:09.579
To summarize, there isn’t a right tie knot
for the right occasion.

00:04:09.579 --> 00:04:15.150
It comes down to the right tie knot for you
once you feel comfortable tying.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.430
And what you feel looks good with your proportions
and the clothing that you’re wearing.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:26.760
All right, this has been Antonio Centeno with
