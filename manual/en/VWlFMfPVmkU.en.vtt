00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.900
In this video, I'm going to
do some more examples of

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.880
simplifying radical
expressions.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.990
But these are going to involve
adding and subtracting

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:08.200
different radical expressions.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.850
And I think it's a good tool
to have in your toolkit in

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.080
case you've never
seen it before.

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.520
So let's do a few of these.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.710
So let's say I have 3 times
the square root of 8-- we

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.836
learned before that's actually
the principal square root of

00:00:19.836 --> 00:00:24.010
8, or the positive square root
of 8-- minus 6 times the

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:27.025
principal square root of 32.

00:00:27.025 --> 00:00:29.950
So let's see what we can
do to simplify this.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.110
So first of all, 8, we can
write that as 2 times 4.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.605
When 4 is a perfect
square, you might

00:00:36.605 --> 00:00:37.400
already recognize that.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.990
We could further factor
that into 2 times 2.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.940
But I don't think we need to.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.770
So we can rewrite 3 square
root of 8 as 3 times the

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:50.430
square root of 4 times
the square root of 2.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.830
This is the same thing as the
square root of 4 times 2,

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.490
which is the square root of 8.

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.220
So this term is the same
thing as that term.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.890
And then, let's look at 32.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.050
We want to do the square
root of 32.

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.650
32 is 2 times 16.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.660
Once again, 16's a perfect
square, so

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.490
we could stop there.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.160
If you didn't realize that,
you would factor

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.230
that as 4 times 4.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.260
You'd see that twice.

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.980
You could even go even further
down to 2 times 2 and all of

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:16.940
that, but you see immediately
that's a perfect square, so we

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:18.020
can stop there.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.030
So this second expression can
be written as minus 6 times

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.920
the square root of 16 times
the square root of 2.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.510
This right here-- I want to be
clear-- is the same thing as

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:34.520
the square root of 16 times 2.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.770
You can separate out.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.850
The square root of 16 times 2 is
the square root of 16 times

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.000
the square root of 2.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.600
We saw that with our exponent
properties.

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.000
Now, what does this first
term simplify to?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.270
This is 3 clearly.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.230
This right here is a 2.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.050
So you have 3 times 2 times
the square root of 2.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.060
That is 6 times the principal
root of 2.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.880
And then from that we're going
to subtract-- well, what's

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.790
this term right here?

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.260
That is positive 4.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:06.820
So 6 times 4 is 24 times
the square root of 2.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.240
And we're not done yet.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.780
If I have 6 of something and
I'm going to subtract from

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.910
that 24 of that same something,
what do I have?

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.290
I have 6 square roots of 2 and
I'm going to subtract from

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:20.780
that 24 square roots of 2,
well, this is going to be

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:28.020
equal to 6 minus 24 is negative
18 square roots of 2.

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.420
And hopefully, this doesn't
confuse you.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.250
Remember, if we had 6x minus
24x, we would have minus 18x

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.150
or negative 18x.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.870
Now, instead of an x, we just
have a square root of 2.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.090
6 of something minus 24 of
something will get us negative

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.120
18 of that something.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:45.880
Let's do another one.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:53.300
Let's say I have the square root
of 180 plus 6 times the

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.470
square root of 405.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.940
So this is really an exercise
in being able to simplify

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.600
these radicals, which
we've done before.

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.250
But you can never get too much
practice doing that.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.230
So let's just do the
factorization

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.610
of these right here.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:14.670
So 180 is 2 times 90,
which is 2 times 45,

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.290
which is 5 times 9.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.860
And we can factor 9 down more
into 3 times 3 to realize it's

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.550
a perfect square, but we could
leave it like that.

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.940
So this first term right here
we can write as the square

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:34.550
root of 2 times 2 times the
square root of 5 times the

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.420
square root of 9.

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:39.120
I'm going to put the square
root of 9 out front.

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.470
So square root of 2 times 2
times the square root of 5

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.440
times the square root of 9.

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:48.360
Now, what is this second
term equal to?

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.900
So let's factor it out.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:50.870
405.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.670
That is 5 times--
I think it's 81.

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.970
But just to verify, 405,
5 doesn't go into 4, so

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.340
let's go into 40.

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.040
5 goes into 40 eight times.

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.340
8 times 5 is 40.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.090
Subtract.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.910
You get a 0.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:09.520
Bring down the 5.

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.470
5 goes into 5 one time.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.100
Right, 81 times.

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.290
81 is 9 times 9.

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.260
You could factor more if we were
trying to do the fourth

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:22.390
root or something like that,
but we want to just do a

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.960
square root.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.910
We have a 9 and a 9, so no
need to factor any more.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.360
So this second expression right
here is plus 6 times the

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:40.600
square root of 9 times 9 times
the square root of 5.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.260
So what is this?

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.140
This is 3.

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:44.710
This is 2.

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:45.860
This is the square root of 4.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.270
So it's 3 times 2 is 6.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.790
So we have 6 square
roots of 5.

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:54.160
Plus-- what's this right here?

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:57.100
The square root of 9 times
9, the square root of 81.

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.380
That's, of course, just 9.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:09.190
So 6 times 9 is 54, so plus
54 square roots of 5.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:12.520
And then, what do
we have left?

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:17.120
We have 6 of something
plus 54 of something.

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:22.050
That's going to be equal
to 60 of that

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.400
something just like that.

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:27.490
Let's just do one more and
we're going to have some

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.750
abstract quantities here.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.000
We're going to deal with
some variables.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.960
But I really just want to do
it to show you that the

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.200
variables don't change
anything.

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:36.520
Let's say if we have the square
root or the principal

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:38.300
root of 48a.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:46.830
And I'm going to add that to
the square root of 27a.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.130
So once again, let's just
factor the 48 part.

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:51.930
We'll leave the a aside.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.350
So 48 is 2 times 24, which
is 2 times 12.

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:04.650
Sorry, 2 times 12, which
is 3 times 4.

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:08.250
So we could rewrite this first
expression here as the square

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:14.920
root of 2 times 2 times the
square root of 4 times the

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.590
square root of 3.

00:06:16.590 --> 00:06:18.520
Now, you might have done
it a quicker way.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.040
You might have just factored
into 3 and 16 and immediately

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.090
realized that 16 is
a perfect square.

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:25.190
But I did it just kind of
the brute force way.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.470
You'd get the same answer
either way.

00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:29.950
And, of course, not just the
square root of 3, you also

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:31.210
have the square root
of a there.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.910
So I'll just put the
a right over here.

00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:35.060
I could put it in a separate
square root, but both of these

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:37.710
aren't perfect squares, so I'll
leave both of these under

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.250
the radical sign.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:43.750
Now, 27 is 3 times 9.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:46.040
9 is a perfect square root,
so we can stop there.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.480
So this second term, we can
rewrite it as the square root

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:54.295
of 9 times the square
root of 3a.

00:06:54.295 --> 00:06:56.620
And in both of these you can
kind of view it I'm skipping

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:57.750
an intermediate step.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:01.970
The intermediate step, I could
have written that first

00:07:01.970 --> 00:07:08.070
expression as the square root
of 9 times 3a and then

00:07:08.070 --> 00:07:09.130
gone to this step.

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:12.210
But I think we have enough
practice realizing that 9

00:07:12.210 --> 00:07:16.510
times 3a, all of that to the
1/2 power, or taking the

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:18.970
principal root of all of that
is the same thing as taking

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:23.130
the principal root of 9 times
the principal root of 3a.

00:07:23.130 --> 00:07:25.080
So that's the step I skipped
in both of these.

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.580
But hopefully, that doesn't
confuse you too much.

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.140
And so, this term right here
is going to be a 2.

00:07:30.140 --> 00:07:31.990
This term right here
is going to be a 2.

00:07:31.990 --> 00:07:37.220
So this is going to be 4 times
the square root of 3a.

00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:40.840
And then this over here, this
right here, is a 3.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:45.000
So this is going to be plus 3
times the square root of 3a.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:51.480
4 of something plus 3 of
something will be equal to 7

00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.930
of the something.

00:07:53.930 --> 00:07:56.270
Anyway, hopefully, you
found that useful.
