00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:05.440
This is a demo of Optia, a puzzle game for
the iPhone, available on the App Store. We'll

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.210
start with an easy level.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.980
Each level has a laser, one or more targets,
and an assortment of obstacles and assets.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.099
The goal is to reflect a laser beam through
each target.

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.320
At the bottom of the screen is the bay, which
contains all the mirrors needed for the level.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.670
In this level, we have access to four regular
mirrors.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:28.009
To fire, tap the laser. The beam activated
the first target, but since it didn’t reach

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:32.380
the other targets in the same shot, the first
one immediately lost its power. We need to

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.171
hit all of the targets on the same shot.

00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:38.900
We’ll try to reflect the beam up to the
second target. To do this, grab a handle around

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.039
the mirror and rotate it.

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:47.590
From here, reflect the beam down through the
third target, then up and through the fourth,

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:56.550
and finally down to the bottom target.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:59.960
This next level is more difficult. We can’t
just bounce the laser beam around through

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.239
the targets – there’s a bomb in the way,
and the walls and gaps don’t make it any

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.490
easier. So let’s blow up the bomb.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:12.229
That won’t work – it blew up the laser
too, so we can’t take a second shot to hit

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.790
the targets. As you can see, the level automatically
restarts if you blow up your laser. We’ll

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.670
have to blow up the bomb, AND hit the targets,
with one shot.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.659
We can do that using this splitter. Use one
beam to blow up the bomb, and the other one

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:37.329
to hit the leftmost target, and then bounce
it back through the path we’ve just cleared.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:41.939
This last level is pretty tough. Here we have
to blow up the bombs to reach the last target,

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.760
but if we detonate them before activating
the target that's next to them, it'll blow

00:01:45.760 --> 00:02:08.140
up too. Here's a solution.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:10.360
Thanks for watching, and have fun playing
Optia!
