00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.500
This video shows how to prevent and reduce
heat inside your computer by keeping it clean

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:09.760
and ventilated.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.220
If Windows stops responding,

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:16.379
the fans become louder,

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.630
or the mouse and keyboard stop responding,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.710
the computer might be overheating.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:29.100
Before beginning, make sure the area around
the computer is clear to avoid electrical shock.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:34.160
Work on a noncarpeted floor to 
avoid electrostatic shock.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.840
Avoid any sharp edges.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.960
The most common causes of excessive heat are:

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.120
dust inside the computer,

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.850
a new component such as a hard drive,

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.050
high room temperatures,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:50.210
or worn out cooling fans.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.860
Follow these steps to test the computer for
heat issues.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.880
First, remove the side panel screws and slide
the panel open to cool the computer.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.900
Keep items away from the inside of the computer
to avoid damage.

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.680
Turn off the computer and unplug the power
cable while the side panel is open.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.040
Wait for the computer to cool.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.320
Plug in the power cable and turn on the computer.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:34.680
Try starting a software program that has recently
stopped responding.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.080
If the issue persists, continue to the next step.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.320
Verify that the computer fans are operational.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:49.200
With the computer powered on, look inside
to find the cooling fans.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.860
If one of the fans is not moving or makes
an unusual sound,

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:56.720
turn off the computer and replace the fan.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:04.420
Some components can be damaged by electrostatic
discharge (ESD).

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.170
To reduce the chance of ESD damage,

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.910
work over a non-carpeted floor,

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.470
use a static dissipative work surface (such
as a foam pad),

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.770
and wear an ESD wrist strap connected to a
grounded surface.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.580
Dust can build up around the internal components
and obstruct air flow.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.060
Follow these steps to clean the computer.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.140
Turn off the computer

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:35.880
and disconnect the power cord.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.320
Use canned air or a small vacuum cleaner to
clean all of the exterior vents.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.680
Do not use a vacuum cleaner to clean the inside
of the computer.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.120
Doing so might damage the computer.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.480
Replace the computer side panel.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:03.820
Connect the power cord and turn on the computer.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.180
If the issue persists, continue to the next step.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.040
Make sure there is enough space around the
computer for ventilation.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.940
Place the computer upright on a level surface.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.360
Make sure there is at least 15.25 centimeters,
or 6 inches,

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.350
of space in front and back of the computer.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.760
Place the computer in a cool room to prevent
it from overheating.

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.620
A small difference in temperature might prevent
damage to the computer.

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:56.360
Check the HP Support website to check for
available BIOS updates.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.910
To download updates from HP's website,

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:06.910
open your web browser and go to hp.com/drivers.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.420
Follow the on-screen instructions to download and update the drivers and BIOS on your computer.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.280
Install another fan to draw out extra heat.

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:26.900
Case fans, such as a slot fan, are available
at most computer supply stores.

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.360
These fans can be installed into a slot next
to the video card.

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:42.430
Follow the instructions included with the
fan to install it,

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:48.000
then replace the side panel and plug in the
power cord.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:50.080
Turn on the computer.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.830
If heat-related issues remain, continue to
the next step.

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.660
Test for hardware failure when troubleshooting
heat issues.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.420
At the Start screen, type diagnostic software,

00:05:04.420 --> 00:05:08.760
then select Diagnostic Software from the Search
charm results.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:13.230
Follow the on-screen instructions to test
for hardware failure.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:21.660
