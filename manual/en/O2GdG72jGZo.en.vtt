00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.410
Hello friendly listeners and welcome back
to the Ancient Art Podcast.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.490
I’m your host Lucas Livingston.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.410
This is not your usual episode of the Ancient
Art Podcast.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.509
The subject of this episode is the Japanese
art of the folding screen.

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:36.200
Some of the feedback expressed a keen interested
in Japanese art, so I thought I’d indulge

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.230
you.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.101
The recent exhibition Beyond Golden Clouds:
Japanese Screens from the Art Institute of

00:00:42.101 --> 00:00:46.550
Chicago and the Saint Louis Art Museum is
now in it’s final days at the Art Institute,

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.180
from June 26-September 27, 2009.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.329
it brings together the strengths of two phenomenal
collections of art.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.281
The 32 works of art in the exhibition trace
the explorations and innovations in the art

00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:04.770
form from as early as the 16th century to
contemporary screens of the past decade, stretching

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:08.450
the definition of the Japanese folding screen
format.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.600
The screens in the exhibition showcase the
wide variety of forms prevalent throughout

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.980
the tradition, from tall screens of approximately
280 centimeters to diminutive screens like

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:25.050
this 96 centimeter masterpiece from 1605-1610
by Hasegawa Togaku from the Saint Louis Art

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.090
Museum.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.890
One finds screens even shorter than this called
pillow screens used to shelter one’s head

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.060
from the draft when sleeping on rather low
traditional Japanese beds, and even smaller

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.340
still simply to place around your fire when
trying to heat a pot of tea.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.590
That gets at the heart of the function of
the folding screen; that is as a wind breaker.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.610
The Japanese word for the folding screen byobu
is spelled from two characters meaning “to

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:52.450
stop” or “block” and “wind.”

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.450
Japanese screens are traditionally produced
in pairs with a right and left.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.010
Generally any sort of narrative or other sense
of continuity present in the subjects flow

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.920
from right to left.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.709
Folding screens are also traditionally regarded
as the highest form of art within Japanese

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:13.340
culture and the greatest masterpieces of artists’
careers, like this well known pair from the

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.849
Art Institute by Tosa Mitsuoki, Flowering
Cherry and Autumn Maples with Poem Slips completed

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:22.400
sometime between 1654 and 1681.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:26.600
It’s hard to walk through the Art Institute
gift shop without tripping over some likeness

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:28.430
of these famous screens.

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.810
Here we see two beautiful trees from opposite
seasons, spring and autumn — this explosion

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.450
of brilliant beauty for only a brief period
of time before a powerful gust of wind or

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.030
rain shower come and scatter the flowers or
leaves on the ground.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:46.560
The blossoming of cherry trees is feverishly
celebrated in Japan very much still today

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.130
as the momentary beauty that heralds the new
lunar year.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:55.280
Imagery of the natural world is a favored
subject of Japanese screens, exploring the

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.230
four seasons often as a metaphor for the impermanent,
fleeting nature of the physical world around

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.220
us and our own lives.

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.940
Very Zen Buddhist concepts that make their
way into the art and popular culture.

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:13.210
Strips of paper tied to branches of the trees
are decorated with famous poems from highly

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.030
regarded anthologies of the 10th through 12th
centuries.

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:22.090
The poems celebrate seasonal themes, connecting
nicely with the subject matter of the screens,

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:26.160
and give praise to the emperor, leading us
to believe that this pair of screens were

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.560
likely produced by imperial commission.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.750
Notice how the slips of paper are wafting
in the wind, some even turned around or partly

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.750
obscured.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:39.540
These poems were so famous to the well educated
aristocrat that only a few words from any

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:41.121
given piece were necessary for identification.

00:03:41.121 --> 00:03:46.870
And I really like the clever little visual
pun that Tosa Mitsuoki made here where lovely

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:50.110
cherry blossoms obscures part of a poem.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:53.870
The word that the cherry blossoms cover up
is in fact “cherry blossoms.”

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:58.840
It reads: “Since my heart is not content,/To
return home after viewing/The cherry blossoms,/Around

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:13.099
the site of their blooming/I’ll borrow a
place to stay.”

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.840
Jumping to the end of the exhibition, we come
to the magnificent installation of Okura Jiro’s

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.790
series Mountain Lake Screen Tachi.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:24.780
Produced over a period of about 6 months during
the artist’s residence at the Mountain Lake,

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.280
Virginia workshop in 1990, this contemporary
work of art dramatically redefines the art

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.090
form of the folding screen.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:36.180
The artist produced a set of 16 four-paneled
screens.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.180
There’s a great little video in the exhibition
documenting their creation.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.370
Five of the screens are exhibited in the show;
three from Saint Louis and two from the Art

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.370
Institute given as a gift by the artist, himself.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:51.050
The other 11 are in various museums and private
collections.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.740
Among the many non-traditional features to
these screens are the use of metal hinges,

00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.610
which swing both ways, allowing for maximum
flexibility in installation.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:06.310
Also abandoned is the traditional painting
on paper framed within a wooden framework.

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.010
Here the narrow panels are made of timber,
specifically black walnut selected from the

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:16.520
Jefferson National Forest in Virginia, chosen
for its likeness to the Japanese gray-bark

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:20.400
elm often used for sacred objects in Japan.

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:25.590
On account of Okura’s deep spiritualism,
a Shinto priest presided over a ceremony blessing

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.080
the trees prior to their logging.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.660
After cutting the logs into several planks
of varying length, the artist and his students

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:36.220
went to work drilling holes and chopping out
bits with chisels.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.830
It’s important to emphasize that this was
a group process.

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:46.449
The pluralizing suffix tachi in the title
of the work refers to this collective collaboration.

00:05:46.449 --> 00:05:51.250
The artist likened the collaborative effort
of repetitive drilling and striking to the

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:55.750
meditative recitation of holy Buddhist sutras.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.380
Portions of the screens were finally covered
with red cinnabar and black paint before a

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.710
layer of gold leaf was applied almost haphazardly.

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:08.389
Okura took no pains to smooth out the gold
leaf or apply it with any great precision.

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:12.880
In fact, the gold leaf is largely only partly
adhering to the surface with portions dangling

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.320
and wafting with the slightest draft.

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:19.710
If you look closely, you might even see a
flake here and there dusting the ground beneath

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:20.710
the screens.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:25.840
A conservation nightmare for sure, but conservation
wasn’t his motivation.

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:31.919
Inspired by ancient Japanese statuary at Buddhist
temples, whose painted surfaces have long

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:38.630
since disintegrated exposing the natural beauty
of the wooden grain beneath, Okura Jiro recognizes

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:44.120
and embraces the impermanence of his artwork,
knowing that it too will decay and return

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:48.150
to a natural state, much as the flowering
cherry and Autumn maple celebrate the ephemeral

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.550
nature to the physical world.

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:55.930
Lastly, it’s interesting to realize how
the folding screen, once regarded in Japanese

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:01.699
culture as the highest form of artistic achievement
in painting, has now been adopted by other

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:08.060
artists or dare I even say “craftsmen,”
like carpenters, sculptors, and ceramicists.

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:11.470
Another example of the changing face of the
Japanese screen.

00:07:11.470 --> 00:07:16.600
I hope you enjoyed this brief escape from
the ancient world.
