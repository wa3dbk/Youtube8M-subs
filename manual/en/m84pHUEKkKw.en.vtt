Hi. This is Julie with Beadaholique.com and I want to talk to you about toggle clasps

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.299
We get a lot of requests for videos here and this
is a request that we got so I thought

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:18.390
I'd go ahead and put it together

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.050
I have five bracelets here and they all use a
toggle clasp

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.550
so I have this one here which is bead woven.
It's just a bar with a notch on the

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.529
other end

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.589
and then I have one with more a more traditional toggle clasp which is going to

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.399
have a toggle ring rain which is also referred to sometimes as the female

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:37.630
part

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.210
and then the toggle bar which is also referred to as the male part. You'll see it both ways in

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.520
instructions

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.980
and so what you do to make this work is
you just take the bar

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.420
slip one end first through the ring

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.580
pull it through

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:57.160
and then it locks in place and so when
you have this on your wrist or on your neck

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.370
you have the tension pulling in either
direction and that's not going to come

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:01.390
undone

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.020
until you wanted to and then simply take
the bar

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.100
that back through the ring and do it

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.240
so one tip though if you are making sure
using toggle clasps

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.760
is that you want to make sure that that
bar can very easily and freely go

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.660
through the through the ring

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:20.990
side in this case here

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.400
actually had to add extra jump rings, so
instead of just attaching at right to

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.280
the end of my chain I had to create a
little smaller chain of jump rings

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.540
so that when I do go to put it through
my toggle

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.640
ring, there's enough

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.040
leeway before it hits the thicker chain which is too wide to go through

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.910
the ring

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:43.120
it can pull through

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.690
and latch like so. You see in the examples such
as this one here

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.660
that wasn't a problem because the chain
itself is narrow enough to go through

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:52.780
the actual

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:53.719
toggle ring

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.950
as I didn't have to allow any extra

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.840
space between the chain

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.770
and the toggle bar itself

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.309
so that's one quick tip if you are making
jewelry yourself using toggle

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:07.829
clasps. They are a great option for a
lot of different jewelry design and

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.400
they're really easy to use as you can see
from these examples they come in really a

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.059
lot of fun shapes and designs

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:16.370
and one more thing before I sign off here

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.480
for if you're doing bead weaving, the same type
process even though you don't have a ring your

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.540
going through, you still take the toggle bar

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.430
put it through the notch

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.439
and then latch it and you can see here
this is a bracelet created by Megan

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:34.099
you can see she made sure that she
left at gap is well to allow a very

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:36.069
easily

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.979
go through that notch

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:41.579
so those are toggle clasps and how to
use them. Go to www.beadaholique.com to purchase beading supplies and to get design ideas!
