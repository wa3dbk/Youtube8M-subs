00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:25.080
here that I have on I absolutely love
this is a very Brian Z but orange base

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:30.810
makeup up this is preferable summer and
fall and as crazy as it is we are

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.690
approaching followed coming very soon so
he could still wear this during the

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.280
summertime by it is also really great
for the fall season because it's just

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.720
very like warm and sultry and stuff so
yeah I really like a slut like it to you

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.790
and lets go ahead and get started so I'm
starting off with Peach Smoothie from a

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.030
peak as usual and amusing in e14 brush
from said much to a playlist Rep crease

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.030
and this is just the perfect base
transition shade for all of your other

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.350
eye shadows and going in with this color
from more feet in the color deep scan

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.030
and on and this is an easy 35 brush and
is working this traffic just to warm it

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:19.020
up a little bit more than 54 make a peak
this is add a lot more orange enos to

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.210
the island and I really liked it I
wanted it for so long so this is one of

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.950
my new favorite eyeshadows from me right
now we're going in with Coco bear and

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.690
Annie 25 fresh from said I'm just
working this through the crease and also

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:36.920
on the inner and outer corner store to
kind of creating spotlight I don't

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.840
really have to do that but just mainly
focusing it throughout the crease and

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.799
making it very round you don't want to
be long get this just make it very very

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.979
and now I'm taking brutal from Mac and
putting it through the crease after I

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:53.600
was looking at this footage it really
didn't make that much of a difference so

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.470
you could skip this step

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.780
also I don't know if you've noticed but
I'm using my old camera for this video

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.590
and I feel like it just looks so much
brighter and whiter so let me know your

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.930
thoughts on the camera situation let me
know which one you like better or if it

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.509
really doesn't matter right now I'm
using this eyeliner pencil from stigma

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.650
and use it as a base all over my eyelids
that the next code we put on just goes

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:16.090
on

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:20.180
more intense right now for the fun part
I'm going in with flame thrower from

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.840
make a peek at the time to research this
is one of their foiled shadows and

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.800
therefore I'll generals are busily my
favorite eyeshadow formula they're still

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.540
creamy and they go on so nicely and
pigmented and I mean look at the color

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:39.940
pretty much speaks for itself

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.460
now I'm adding some mascara it doesn't
really matter what kind because I'm

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.020
gonna go in with false lashes and these
false lashes are from the brand crown

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:53.920
there actually synthetic lashes and I
haven't used synthetic clashes in awhile

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.680
but these were like holy crap they were
so dramatic

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.660
you don't have to go if such a dramatic
fall / but I had fun today then I'm

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.750
trying a new foundation and it was super
super dark I have to go back and

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:14.110
exchange yet I felt like super orange
all day long but this is the Loreal

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.610
infallible foundation and I'm just
playing it with my makeup geek

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:26.319
foundation brush I only want like once
or twice and so far so good

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.459
and now from a concealer and using the
Urban Decay Naked skin cancer and

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.150
buffing it ended with this brush from
the dome-shaped kabuki brush and then

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.730
because my foundation was so dark and
setting the under eye area with the

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:45.389
banana shade from the Anastacio country
usually I need even later than the

00:03:45.389 --> 00:03:50.799
lighter shade but i'm looking pretty
tame today announced that my whole face

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:54.849
with the Rimmel Stay Matte powder so far
I like this as well this is a pretty new

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:58.069
products for me too but I really like it
so far

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:04.219
now i'm brushing my face is the Make Up
For Ever profusion bronze and 35 I and

00:04:04.219 --> 00:04:08.260
I'm just rising all the areas of my face
and that I'm contouring and using his

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.530
makeup geek blush brush the country may
face and I'm using this blusher make a

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:17.049
peak as well in the color summer fling
at like a bright orange color and I

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:21.680
really really like it now I'm
highlighting I'm using the apricot

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.570
summer break from Bobby Brown and I'm
highlighting and I also took a little

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:31.330
bit of the darker shades over my cheek
now with the liner brush and tightly

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.409
putting Coco bear right on my last line
and then blending it out with any of

00:04:35.409 --> 00:04:38.870
your transition shades from before it
could be checking it could be Peach

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.920
Smoothie whatever

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:52.100
and as usual my eyes are watering like
crazy and adding a lot of mascara to the

00:04:52.100 --> 00:05:00.420
bottom lashes just because the top
lashes were super super dramatic

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:04.590
announced bring my face with the Urban
Decay makeup setting spray an allnighter

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.700
and I went and fixed my hair I hate
putting on my lips before do my hair

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.890
done now that I did my hair I'm applying
subculture lip liner for Mac and then

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:20.470
this YSL lipstick and number 10 it's
like the perfect nude ever and it's so

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.770
pretty it's relatively new to my
collection and I've been wearing it a

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.150
lot this month I'm not a fan of nude
lipsticks so I like this one is like a

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:36.250
pretty big deal and then applying this
glass from Sigma as well as a compliment

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:40.470
to the ice perfectly because it has a
very warm orange basin it but the lips

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:51.120
were still nude and now that our lips
are done the

00:05:51.120 --> 00:06:15.060
