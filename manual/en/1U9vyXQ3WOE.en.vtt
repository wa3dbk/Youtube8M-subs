WHAT DID YOU DO?!

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:04.671 align:start size:31% position:69%
LET ME GO.

00:00:04.704 --> 00:00:06.406
NOT UNTIL YOU TELL US.

00:00:06.439 --> 00:00:07.774
OR WE<i> MAKE</i> YOU TELL US.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:09.776
THREATENING HER ISN'T THE WAY
TO MOTIVATE HER.

00:00:09.843 --> 00:00:11.611
WELL, I'M ALL OUT OF FISH FOOD.

00:00:11.678 --> 00:00:12.746
DOESN'T MATTER
IF YOU GET HER TO TALK.

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.415
YOU CAN'T TRUST HER.
MERMAIDS ARE LIARS.

00:00:15.448 --> 00:00:16.483 align:start position:0%
OF COURSE THEY ARE.

00:00:16.516 --> 00:00:17.684
MAYBE THEY'RE JUST SCARED
OF PAN.

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:19.252
IF WE LET HER GO,
MAYBE THEY'LL BE ON OUR SIDE.

00:00:19.285 --> 00:00:21.888
OR MAYBE SHE AND HER FRIENDS
WILL COME RIGHT BACK TO KILL US.

00:00:21.921 --> 00:00:23.523 size:84% position:58%
OH, I DON'T NEED MY FRIENDS
TO KILL YOU.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.326 size:72% position:64%
YOU'LL KILL YOURSELVES.
NOW LET ME GO.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:29.763
(loud thrashing)

00:00:29.796 --> 00:00:31.431
(thunderclap)

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:33.533 align:start size:47% position:53% line:85%
WHAT THE HELL?!

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:33.533
(Hook) IT'S A STORM.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.868 size:81% position:41%
SHE CALLED IT.

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:36.536
DON'T LET HER GO!

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:37.804 align:start size:81% position:19%
SHE'LL SWIM OFF
AND LEAVE US ALL TO DIE.

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.773
AT LEAST WITH HER,
WE'VE GOT LEVERAGE.

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:44.511 line:78%
(blade zings)

00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:44.511
STOP THE STORM.
THEN WE LET YOU GO.

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:49.449 align:start position:0% line:78%
(grunts)

00:00:46.646 --> 00:00:49.449
(Regina laughs)
THAT'S MORE LIKE IT, CHARMING.

00:00:49.482 --> 00:00:51.017 align:start size:97% position:3%
FILET THE BITCH.

00:00:51.084 --> 00:00:53.186
(gasping and whimpering)

00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:57.557 align:start size:41% position:59%
(panting) NO.

00:00:57.624 --> 00:00:59.993 align:start size:66% position:34%
WE'RE NOT BARBARIANS.

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:01.094
(thunderclap)

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.196 size:75% position:38%
WHAT WE'RE GOING TO BE
IS DEAD.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:05.799
HOLD ON!
I'M GONNA TURN HER AROUND.

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:08.835
I'VE OUTRUN MANY A STORM.

00:01:10.737 --> 00:01:12.672
MAKE IT STOP OR DIE.

00:01:12.705 --> 00:01:14.007 align:start position:0%
WE ARE<i> NOT</i> KILLERS!

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.210
YES, YOU ARE. AND YOU'VE BROUGHT
THIS DEATH UPON YOURSELVES.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:18.545
THIS IS WHY WE SHOULD FREE HER!

00:01:18.578 --> 00:01:20.380 size:75% position:63%
THAT FEEL-GOOD NONSENSE,
SNOW,

00:01:20.413 --> 00:01:22.215 size:75% position:63%
MIGHT PLAY
IN THE ENCHANTED FOREST,

00:01:22.282 --> 00:01:25.919 size:56% position:72%
BUT THIS...
THIS IS NEVERLAND.

00:01:25.952 --> 00:01:27.320
(grunts)

00:01:27.353 --> 00:01:29.189
(thunderclaps)

00:01:29.222 --> 00:01:30.824 align:start size:72% position:28%
KEEP YOUR GRIP, PIRATE!

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:32.892
IT WASN'T ME, MATE!
IT WAS THE SHIP!

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.695 align:start size:69% position:31%
WE'RE TAKING ON WATER!

00:01:35.762 --> 00:01:37.430
<i> NOW</i> MAY I RESUME KILLING HER?!

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:38.832
(Mary Margaret and David) NO!

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:41.701
YOU KILL HER, AND HER KIND HAVE
A PERSONAL VENDETTA AGAINST US.

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:43.069 align:start size:78% position:22%
LOOK, THE QUEEN IS RIGHT.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.505 size:66% position:67% line:83%
THEY'VE ALREADY TRIED
KILLING US.

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:45.505 align:start position:0%
STOP! THAT'S ENOUGH!

00:01:45.538 --> 00:01:47.974 size:59% position:30%
WE NEED TO
THINK THIS THROUGH!

00:01:48.007 --> 00:01:49.142
I ALREADY HAVE.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.244
<i> (whoosh)</i>

00:01:51.277 --> 00:01:52.712
THERE.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:54.881
THAT SHOULD STOP THE STORM.

00:01:54.948 --> 00:01:58.885 size:53% position:27%
REGINA!
WHAT DID YOU DO?!

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.287 line:85%
(rumbling)

00:01:58.952 --> 00:02:01.287
NO.

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:06.426 align:start size:97% position:3%
WHAT HAVE YOU DONE?!
