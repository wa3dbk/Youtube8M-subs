00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:04.439
The Volturi are the closest thing my world has to royality.

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:05.959
They enforce the law.

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:07.839
Vampires have laws?

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:12.039
You're a human

00:00:12.319 --> 00:00:14.599
who knows entirely too much about us.

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:15.799
They could kill us all.

00:00:18.559 --> 00:00:20.239
You just don't belong in my world, Bella.

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:21.799
I belong with you.

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:24.199
This is the last time you'll ever see me.

00:00:24.799 --> 00:00:27.559
Please just promise me you won't do anything reckless.

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:31.839
The absence of him is everywhere I look.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:37.279
It's like a huge hole has been punched through my chest.

00:00:40.959 --> 00:00:42.159
I know what he did to you.

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:43.239
But Bella,

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:46.000
I would never ever do that.

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:50.159
There's only one way I know to see him.

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.639
So, you're an adrenaline junkie now?

00:00:56.359 --> 00:00:58.799
If a rush of danger is what it takes to see him,

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:00.439
that's what I'll find.

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:14.000
What the hell were you thinking?!

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:18.039
Bella, it's Edward.

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:18.879
He thinks you're dead.

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:19.599
What?

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:21.759
He's going to the Volturi.

00:01:22.519 --> 00:01:23.879
He wants to die, too.

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:26.079
He left you, Bella.

00:01:26.199 --> 00:01:27.439
He didn't want you anymore.

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.799
Please, stay here. For me.

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:32.039
I have to go.

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:36.039
He's gonna make a scene.

00:01:36.839 --> 00:01:38.159
The Volturi will kill him

00:01:38.199 --> 00:01:40.199
if he reveals himself in the sunlight.

00:01:40.639 --> 00:01:42.000
No, Edward, don't!

00:01:42.839 --> 00:01:44.079
The girl comes with us.

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:46.039
You can go to hell.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:47.439
Edward, I'm scared.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.159
This may hurt just a little.

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.000
No! Please! Please!

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:22.000
