00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.770
Let's talk about designing a piece. I'm going
to give you 10 points for a

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:16.209
direct mail piece that have to be in every
time, now you all are my

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.859
customers so if you have done postcards with
me you know that you get a

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.400
check list to make sure these 10 points are
in after we design your card.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.000
Let's go over it.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.930
You want to have a clear, bold headline. Here's
another really bad card.

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.270
The first thing I see, well, I don't know
what to look at first because the

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.420
eye trail on this card is just a mess. It's
just four big boxes but the

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.600
headline is Sunshine Rain Motors. You should
really never really make your

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:46.610
name of your company your headline, unless
the name of your company

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:50.630
explicitly says what you do or what problem
you solve. In this instant,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:56.200
this is a card that actually worked for a
client of ours. "Let us do the

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.950
dirty work." Very clear, very bold headline.
It's the first thing you see.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.689
You also want a graphic image that supports
the message or the headline.

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:08.360
When you first look at this card, I'm sure
the client looked at this and

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:14.219
thought it looked great, but, "get your piece
of the financial bailout".

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.450
I'm sorry. That is just so general. That is
not even like a real

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.529
communication and then a credit card with
a mouse trap? We're trying to get

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:26.439
so clever. You never want to sacrifice clarity
for it to be clever. You

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:30.229
never want to be so clever that nobody understands
what you are doing. This

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.770
is an image of people actually cleaning. "Let
us do the dirty work." That's

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:42.569
clearly not you, that's them. You want color
that pops. Simply not too much

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:44.990
copy on the front of the card and you want
really good color that pops.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.209
This is not a very good example of a card
because I see her face, but it's

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:50.200
a nail salon.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.649
All right, now we are doing simple colors.
Colors that pop. Let's look at

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:59.499
the back of the card. All you are trying to
do with the front of the card

00:01:59.499 --> 00:02:05.840
is to get them to turn it over. Once they
turn it over, you need a subhead

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.489
that leads into text. You want to get them
to read the card, and then

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.120
eventually take action. Here we go. This is
a subhead that leads into text.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.320
"Welcome to a more affordable cleaning solution."
Usually people that don't

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.090
have a cleaning person, the reason they don't
have someone cleaning their

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:26.390
house is they either love to clean themselves.
How many of you fit that

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.060
category? Or they feel like they really can't
afford it; and so by knowing

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.300
that that is a button and putting that there
right in the subhead is great.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:42.300
The copy for your card...we have to talk about
features and benefits.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.290
Sometimes you have to put features on your
card. It's important. Most of

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.110
the time, what you want to do is take a feature
and how can I turn that

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.040
feature into a benefit. A benefit is, "what's
in it for me as the consumer?

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.760
What am I getting out of it?" Here are just
some examples and you'll see in

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.710
the orange column is the feature and you'll
see how we reworded it as a

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:11.990
benefit. "Most powerful floor cleaning system"
is a feature. Beautiful

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:18.000
shiny floors in half the time. 24/7. That's
our service. We have

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.410
appointments that fit your schedule. That's
the benefit to the person. Very

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:27.960
difficult to do.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.330
We should have a worksheet about this. Even
a seasoned copywriter has

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:37.260
difficulty taking a feature and turning it
into a benefit. It takes some

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:42.870
skill. You should be able to tell the difference.
Here we have a list of

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.620
benefits, benefits, benefits and now an offer.
An offer is super, super,

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.550
super important. We want free stuff. Google
is free. WiFi at Starbucks is

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:59.130
free. We get so much free stuff, we are now
the entitlement generation.

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.069
Where we just expect everything to be free
and you should just give it to

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:09.819
me because I want it. You need to roll with
that and offer something for

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:15.080
free. Something of value. Something of very
high perceived value that is

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.750
very low cost to you. Something that will
really make the person feel that

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.580
you are giving them something so valuable
so they at least want to give you

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.699
their contact information. That's what we
are going for.

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:33.469
They are going to give a free hour of cleaning
with the purchase of four

00:04:33.469 --> 00:04:40.270
hours. It's just something free because I
want something free. This company

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.590
is not giving me a free hour, you are, I'll
go with you. Your company name

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:50.120
and logo seems silly but if you don't have
a company name on your card,

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.810
then they really can't identify you. They
probably won't call.

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:59.979
There. ABC Cleaning. A call to action. It's
really funny, but it actually

00:04:59.979 --> 00:05:03.819
works on me, so I'm assuming it works on most
people. If you tell me what

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:07.499
to do in writing, then I will do it, but if
you leave it up to me to figure

00:05:07.499 --> 00:05:14.379
it out, I may not do it. It's very simple
to put on there, "Call today!

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:17.580
Visit our website." Instead of just putting
the website there or putting

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.159
the phone number there. Whatever you want
them to do, tell them to do it.

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:24.430
Call today.

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.629
If the phone number is too small...don't ever
make someone look for the

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:34.370
contact information. It's a small nuance,
but don't make them look for it

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:40.559
because it just lowers...what you're trying
to do...You learned what the

00:05:40.559 --> 00:05:43.650
ARC triangle is this morning. What you're
trying to do is build trust.

00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:47.249
Build ARC. You want to make the person like
you more. There are these

00:05:47.249 --> 00:05:50.090
little nuances in the design of your card
that will either make the

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:55.229
recipient like you a bit more or like you
a bit less. All we are trying to

00:05:55.229 --> 00:06:00.039
do is to get them to like you enough to go
to your website or call you or

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:04.559
buy from you online or get a quote from you
or have a sit down with you.

00:06:04.559 --> 00:06:08.150
That's what we are trying to do with the card.

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:15.150
If you don't put a return address on your
card and it's undeliverable, it

00:06:15.169 --> 00:06:19.849
won't come back to you, so there's no return
address on that card. You just

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:23.139
want to make sure you have one. Why would
you not want to just save some

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:27.960
money and share another postcard with another
business? Have two very

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:34.960
distinct advertisements on one piece? Anybody
have an idea why you wouldn't

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:37.599
want to do that? Seems like a good idea. Just
saved a bunch of money. You

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:40.919
know what, the person won't do anything. They
don't know what to look at.

00:06:40.919 --> 00:06:45.740
I'm not sure what to do? Should I call ABC
insurance or should I look at a

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.599
new car? It's just too confusing. You want
to sell one thing. Even if you

00:06:49.599 --> 00:06:55.199
sell many, many, many different products and
services in your company, you

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:59.580
only want to advertise one thing mostly. You
can bullet point the other

00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:00.849
things that you do, but you really want to
advertise one thing.
