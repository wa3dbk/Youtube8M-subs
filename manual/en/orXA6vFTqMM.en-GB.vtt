Today I'm sewing a simple usamimi headband!

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:27.540
Gather your materials.
Cut a long rectangle of fabric and put the

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:34.129
ends together.
Fold in half length-wise.

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:51.479
Snip the end into a rounded point like this.
Unfolded it should look something like this.

00:00:51.479 --> 00:01:02.370
Unfold and then fold in half to form a big
sausage.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:11.330
Thread a needle and start stitching at one
point.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:34.360
Running stitch down the side.
It can take a while to get to the other side.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:42.719
Leave a small gap when you reach the other
end and tie off.

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:59.799
Turn the whole thing inside out through the
end gap.

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:18.620
Flatten it out and you should have something
like this.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.150
Unwind a piece of wire twice as long as the
tube.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:39.410
Fold it in half, twist together then fold
the ends into loops.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:54.280
Thread the wire into the tube.
Then stitch up 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:03:19.010
the gap.
Tie off the end.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:33.550
All done!
Taadaa!

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:42.650
Cure and it holds itself up with the wire,
the perfect bunny headband.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:50.209
And that's it! You can whip one of these up
in a couple of minutes once you get the hang

00:03:50.209 --> 00:03:52.239
of it and it's even quicker on a sewing machine.
Check out the link in the description for

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.490
a photo version of the tutorial on my blog.
Hope you all enjoyed the video and good luck

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:11.150
if you give it a try yourself.
Thanks so much for watching, bye!
