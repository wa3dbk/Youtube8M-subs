00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.350
All right.

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:02.350
Here we are.

00:00:02.350 --> 00:00:03.350
We are going to get this Geigerrig out.

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:04.350
We are
going to do a little

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.879
gear testing today just for durability and
show what the Geigerrig's

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:07.879
can take.

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:08.879
We got it all

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:10.630
pressurized up and ready to go.

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.630
Spray action's ready.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:12.970
We will going to
get this baby up to

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.379
about 100 miles in hour out in the hard country
road here.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.770
And let it
fall off the back of

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:19.140
the truck and see how it does.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:31.530
So we will get in the truck right now
and going to take a

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.530
look.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:39.420
All right, we are about 80 miles an hour,
90 miles an hour, 100

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.079
miles an hour.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.109
Letus

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:54.260
give this Geigerrig a test.

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.350
All right.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.249
Let us see what we got here.

00:01:01.249 --> 00:01:02.760
We
got the Geigerrig and

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.299
see how it did.

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:05.299
So far everything looks good.

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:06.320
Let us look at the
functionality.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.320
Yes.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.469
It is still

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:09.469
spraying, still working.

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:10.789
Valves working.

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:14.030
All the equipments still
seems to be in place.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.609
Zipper poles, let us check the zippers.

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:17.979
Zippers are all in good.

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:19.890
A
pair of buckles.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:20.890
Buckles

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.890
are all looking good.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:23.290
You can see the impact spotted in a almost
a

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.290
hundred miles an

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.290
hour,.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.710
Or about a 90- 100 miles, 95 miles in hour
when it hit.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.820
The
bladder is in good

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.820
condition.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.820
You can see in here.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:31.820
No issues at all.

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.570
Stayed right in its
spot.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.570
Everything is

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.570
working good.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.530
So this particular pack right here had a 100
miles an

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:40.530
hour.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.530
Drop in out to a

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:42.659
hard road.

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.090
It took it well.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.090
Let us check.

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.109
Let us demonstrate the spray
again.

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:48.109
We are still

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:49.109
looking good for that.

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:50.710
So this is a good way to test a piece of gear.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:51.710
This is the kind of thing

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:52.710
that happens.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.710
You got with your buddies.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:54.710
You throw all your gear in
the back of the truck.

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.749
You are driving down the road.

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:56.749
You are having a good time.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:57.749
You are
probably not going in

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:01.530
a 100 miles an hour but outgoes the pack,
slams into the road and

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:02.530
there you go.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:03.530
So that

00:02:03.530 --> 00:03:11.480
could happen 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:17.380
to you.

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:54.740
You 

00:03:54.740 --> 00:04:08.050
are 
on 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:28.440
a mountain bike.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:47.030
You are flying down
into the trail.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:49.810
And

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:57.400
you fall off into the brash.

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:29.120
And this pack can take into the beating.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:06:24.400
So there you go.
