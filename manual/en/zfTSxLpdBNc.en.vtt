00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.830
What if medicine was different?

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:14.830
What if you could coordinate care between
this clinic, this hospital, and that pharmacy?

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.860
What if you could ensure the best care for
your family?

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:29.860
What if these prescriptions, and this bill
had, that co-pay.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.760
What if the focus was on prevention, rather
than treatment?

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.839
What if checking your vitals was as routine
as checking your emails?

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:49.050
What if you spoke their language, and they
spoke yours?

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:56.050
What if there was no need for a transplant
list?

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:03.829
Instead of in the operating room, what if
the checklist started at home?

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:12.100
What if we crowdsourced the things that mattered?

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.100
What if you knew all of your health data and
it followed you everywhere you went?

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.419
Now what if that wasn't a burden, but was
actually your greatest asset?

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:38.149
In 2033, Open source medicine will elevate
both patient and doctor.

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:49.509
The line between them will blur, and the white
coat will disappear.
