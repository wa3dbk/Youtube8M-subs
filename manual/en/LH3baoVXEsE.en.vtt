Hi, this is Linda Lewis on behalf of Expert
Village.com. Check out my website at www.keytime.com.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:26.880
How do I change my keyboard to a DVORAK layout?
It is very simple. You first go to your control

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.949
panel so you go down to your start button.
Next you go into your control panel. From

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:38.199
there you want to go into your language area
so this is date, time language and regional

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:47.239
options. From that point, you are going down
to the regional and language options. Then

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:55.869
you are going to be going to the language
tab and then to details. From there if you

00:00:55.869 --> 00:01:03.530
would like to add a DVORAK Keyboard, you go
to add and then it shows up here with the

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:10.460
keyboard lay out and the United States DVORAK
is the option you are going to be using. It

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.630
has other traces available to if you wanted
to go to the left handed DVORAK or to the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:23.120
right handed DVORAK which I speak about in
another clip. Once you have the DVORAK on

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:29.810
here, you click okay. Then be sure to go down
to the apply button and that will load it

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:37.280
into the computer and then you can click out
by going to okay. So at the moment the default

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.299
is the Qwerty Keyboard so if I type on the
keyboard it is actually the Qwerty Keyboard.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:50.659
To change it to DVORAK you go down to the
icon and then you are going to click on it

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:57.939
so there is a check and now I am going to
show you the home row of the DVORAK Keyboard.

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:04.170
The left hand on the home row is the vowels.
If you want to change back to the Qwerty you

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:12.720
go back down to the icon and you click on
the English and it is back into the Qwerty.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:18.120
That is as simple as being able to go back
and forth between Qwerty and DVORAK. When

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:23.370
I flip DVORAK keyboard in the computer, the
icon is where you do the switching between

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.600
the Qwerty and the DVORAK. All you do is when
you go into an application, that is when you

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.510
change and click on the DVORAK icon. If you
want to clip back to the Qwerty in this same

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:41.629
application, you just go to the icon. It automatically
goes to the default which in this case would

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:47.390
be the Qwerty Keyboard. When you leave the
application and go into an excel program or

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:54.720
word program from the notepad, you then would
again click on the icon to change it to DVORAK.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.620
If you want to set up your computer so that
it defaults to the DVORAK when you turn your

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.049
computer on and use it, you would do that
in establishing when you go to the control

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.079
panel the first time or any time that you
load it, you just click that you would like

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.930
to have that as a default language.
