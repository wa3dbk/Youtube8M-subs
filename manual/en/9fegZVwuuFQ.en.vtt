00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.500
I'm Greg Miles. I'm the course caller here at Flemington.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:07.500
I've been the on-course caller since 1989. 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.700
And I call for radio 927, and also for the on-course and off-course television.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.000
Racing. The 150th time the Cup's underway ...

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:26.000
The race caller is there to add to the pictures, to identify all of the horses in the race  

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.500
and tell the viewer and the listener where they are 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.000
how they're traveling and who wins and who loses.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.500
A good race caller observes the vowels of broadcasting. The five vowels of broadcasting.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:49.000
You need to be accurate, entertaining, informative, original and understood.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.500
Before a race meeting, there is a day's work that a race caller has to do.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.800
And that is to sit down and study the form and produce a set of selections 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.500
which are then broadcast on the radio and then sent out to all the TAB agencies 

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:10.500
so punters can go in and have a look what the race broadcaster is selecting for the day.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.600
So there is a full day's work before the races get under way in preparation.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:23.000
And there is another little code in race broadcasting that has to be observed, and that's the four Ps of broadcasting

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.800
Preparation Prevents Poor Performance.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.500
Followed by Americain and behind them Illustrious Blue Red Ruler Campanologist ...

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.000
During the course of a call, you' re really operating at high level 100% concentration 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.500
and processing all the information and also deciding what information to let go.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.700
A lot of things happen in a race that you can't call.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.000
You can't talk about everything you see, so you're watching the race unfold 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.000
and processing what information is important and what information isn't important.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.800
The race caller owns all his own equipment. Basically, you'll walk into a broadcast box at any race track 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.200
and it'll be just a bare bones, just a desk, and that'll be it.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:13.300
So you need to be able to construct a little stand. So I have a stand here, just off a musical stand 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:20.700
and then the swivel and the binoculars, of course. The race caller owns his own binoculars, and most have got several sets.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:28.500
These days, I've been calling for 30 years. So, generally speaking, on an average Saturday, I don't get nervous.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
But when it comes to the Melbourne Cup, that's a different kettle of fish, really.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.500
Anybody that's closely involved with the Melbourne Cup 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.500
and doesn't get nervous, it's probably time for them to think about doing something else.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:45.500
It's such an important race. It means so much to our very  

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.050
being Australian, I think, that it needs to be broadcast properly.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:54.000
Americain from France coming right away, Americain. Americain is coming away ...

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.000
Americain. Tres bien!

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.700
The great thing about calling the Melbourne Cup is that you become involved 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.000
in something that is so important to so many Australians.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Jockeys and trainers and owners can feel it, but a race caller can also. 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.800
And when you're a racing tragic, like most race callers are, to be a little part 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:20.000
of history unfolding and telling the world about it, that's pretty special.
