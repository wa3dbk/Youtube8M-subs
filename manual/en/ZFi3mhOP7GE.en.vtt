This what really got me into the game of DJing
is scratching with turntables. You guys have

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:29.790
all heard it the ʻwika wikaʼ. Thatʼs what
got me into it. - Hi Iʼm DJ Prism, Hopefully

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:34.120
some of you know me as Cameron Kalegi. I started
Djing

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:41.140
the summer between high school and college
and one day I picked up some turntables and

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.280
i started watching videos online and called
around to friends to see if they know anyone

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:49.190
who did or if they were interested in what
I was interested in.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:54.170
I just fell in love with DJing thereʼs just
something awesome about having people dance

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.130
to something that youʼre doing. Even if I
donʼt care about every single song that I

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:03.700
play, It doesnʼt matter because at the end
of the night I was still helping other people

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:12.710
have alot of fun. And for me thatʼs alot
of fun. So I did all of this in Cincinnati

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.252
before college I was still in high school
at the time. So I moved down to Louisville

00:01:16.252 --> 00:01:21.969
and I was Djing in my dorm and I started finding
out that ʻwhoa Fraternities &amp; Sororities

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:25.600
have parties all the time this is a great
opportunity for me!ʼ

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.939
So I started contacting a few of the people
I knew who were rushing and I got hooked up

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.569
with a couple of gigs which was great. So
I was Djing with fraternities &amp; sororities

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:41.719
doing any house party that I could trying
to make...As...I was trying to play as many

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:47.950
events as possible. Be it for free, for pizza,
um really cheap it really didnʼt matter it

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.909
was really all about exposure and trying to
hone my craft and find out where I stand in

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:58.939
this whole DJ game.- Juggling all these activities
on campus and in my personal life are pretty

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:04.490
difficult. Iʼve been fortunate enough not
to completely fail at any of them yet. Iʼm

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:10.110
still an honors student, still got good grades,
keeping up with friends and family as well

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.159
as DJing trying to rock as many parties as
possible. Itʼs definitely not an easy gig

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:20.870
but it all comes down to organization; which
I got a little bit of, Iʼve got just enough

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:28.610
of to make it by as well as support from the
people around me. Without my friends, without

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:36.159
my family and without the full support of
the people who I surround myself with I probably

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.040
wouldnʼt be able to do all the things that
I do.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:44.540
Just recently the Leo Magazine awarded me
the #1 Club DJ in Louisville from itʼs readers

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:50.590
poll. Which is- itʼs a great, itʼs an honor
because I know that Iʼm getting out to people

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.799
it doesnʼt necessarily mean Iʼm the best
DJ it just means that I can do a fair amount

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:59.409
of promoting and people are liking what they
are hearing and thatʼs what really, thatʼs

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:05.329
what makes me happy, if I can make everybody
else happy then thatʼs just where itʼs at.

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:12.159
One thing that I get asked alot is where did
the name DJ Prism come from? And itʼs actually

00:03:12.159 --> 00:03:17.840
pretty funny because I had alot of different
ideas of what I wanted to be, and itʼs kinda

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:26.799
like how sound frequency and color frequency
are completely intertwined and that we are

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:37.599
just a note in that frequency. So we are the
color of sound, or we are the sound that colors

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:43.420
make. I canʼt describe it in two seconds
but thatʼs where DJ prism comes from. Itʼs

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.219
not that I just like triangles.

00:03:46.219 --> 00:03:51.849
If anyone ever wanted to contact me to book
me for a gig definitely email me at:

00:03:51.849 --> 00:04:00.470
TheDJPrism@gmail.com or hit me up on facebook
or send me a text or shoot me a

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.579
message on twitter it really doesnʼt matter
so long as one form of communication or

00:04:04.579 --> 00:04:11.190
another you try to get ahold of me I will
make sure I hear it. - My name is DJ Prism,
