ANNE MOONEY: Hi. I'm Chef Anne Mooney and
I'm also the regular food columnist for Simply

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.539
The Best Magazine out of Delray Beach, Florida.
Today, I'm here on behalf of Expert Village

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:17.790
and we're going to talk about crepes. Crepes
have had kind of a bad rap for a long time

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:24.380
because they're regarded as fancy and difficult
and complicated. But they are not complicated

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:28.590
at all. They're a wonderful, healthy way to
eat, and you can eat them for breakfast, brunch,

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.420
lunch, dinner, snacks, and dessert, any other
time you want them. Not only that, you can

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.960
make a bunch of them ahead and freeze them,
and you can pull 'em out of your freezer anytime

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:48.190
you want a crepe and they defrost in about
two minutes. We're going to talk now about

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:57.319
how to make crepes. I've made a dish of batter.
Actually, I made it last night and you do

00:00:57.319 --> 00:01:02.519
need to refrigerate the batter. This is the
only time where you really need to think ahead

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:09.369
so that the flour will absorb the liquid.
And so you end up with a batch of batter like

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:23.079
this, and all you need to cook the stuff is
a little skillet, some cooking spray, and

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:34.990
a ladle. You'll ladle the--about this much
batter into a seven-inch skillet, swirl it

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:44.090
around so it's nice and round. Make sure your
fire is not too hot, and leave it on the fire

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:52.990
for about 45 seconds for the first crepe.
And then you're going to flip it when it gets

00:01:52.990 --> 00:02:03.640
bubbles on the top, just as if it were a pancake.
And when you're done, you have a whole stack

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.930
of lovely crepes that look just like this,
and they're ready for their filling.
