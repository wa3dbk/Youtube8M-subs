00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.990
A mix of haze and clouds prevailed in the
metro area， and as you can see， light

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:12.139
rain clouds are approaching some parts down
south， so Jeju and the southern provinces

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:14.340
could see sudden showers tonight.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.110
But the rain is expected to clear out just
in time for the weekend.

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.680
Temperatures will be way above the seasonal
averages， hovering in the mid to upper twenties...

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.680
under plenty of sunshine.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.600
In fact， the sun will be so strong that
the UV index will be high across the nation

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:37.110
tomorrow， so be sure to have some sun protection
with you before heading out

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.180
And as for Saturday′s readings...

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:47.680
Seoul and Daegu will get up to 25 and 27，
while Gwangju and Busan will hit 26 and 23.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.100
For other regions...

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.930
Daejeon will see a high of 25 and Jeju Island
and Dokdo will top out at 20 and 18.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.000
A dry weather advisory has expanded today
to many parts of the country， including

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.989
here in the capital， but thankfully there
is some relief on the way in the form of rain，

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:10.820
which is expected to start next Monday afternoon
and could linger till Tuesday morning.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:37.749
That′s Korea for you， and here′s look
at weather conditions around the globe.
