Hello everyone. Here we are with
Destroy Gunners SP.

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.439
I was a little bit kind of huh

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:19.439
when I saw this, a mech game for the phone.

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.509
Traditionally not the best 
graphics in the world.

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:26.259
I have to say, this is a cracking game.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:31.320
You basically are a giant mech, you have
the guns, there are enemies, destroy them all.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:38.320
Plain and simple, right.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.870
Gorgeous looking 3D graphics and I think
this is the Unity game engine again doing

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.750
its thing.

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.490
So here is me,

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:48.910
big giant mech.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:50.250
I can move left and right

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.310
I have jump jets

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.870
and a different weapon.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.780
If I drag my finger across the screen, 
that causes me to fire.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.710
Let's find some things to blow up.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:24.930
There's just wave after wave basically of mechs
out to destroy you to clear the level out.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.700
Switch over to

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.850
You can see really nice animations on

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.500
my mech.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.500
That really helps with the immersion.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:53.900
There you can see, the frame rate's
really really nice.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.720
Nice fun game,

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:03.720
quite difficult in places though, I've noticed.

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:22.550
Reasonably difficult to play and talk and
review this at the same time because

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.159
last time I was playing it

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:28.729
I held it in my hands and it was much
easier to control it.

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:32.189
You can see the graphics are fantastic
and all these smoke effects 

00:02:32.189 --> 00:02:33.119
are

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:35.219
really really slick.

00:02:35.219 --> 00:02:39.659
Ooh, I am so dead!

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.899
My score was... not very good.

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:50.060
You have  free missions, you can customise
your mech including your loan outs

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.050
check your high score. Select your mech

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:54.639
check your game levels etcetera.

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:57.389
Game options in there.

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:59.829
Lower graphics quality, lower texture quality

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.279
so if you want to you can use this on a 
slightly less powerful phone

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:06.259
without any major problems.

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:09.969
Comes turned up full be default so when
you get the 

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:13.469
game don't worry about going and
searching for that setting.

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:16.689
Absolutely cracking little game.
