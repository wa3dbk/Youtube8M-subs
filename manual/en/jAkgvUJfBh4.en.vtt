Hey guys! It’s Phil the smiling gardener
and I’ve just put together a list of my

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.690
50 absolute best organic gardening books or
at least my favourites. You can check that

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:17.290
out if you’re not already on the website
you can check that out at smilinggardener.com/books

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.519
and I’ve put together pictures and little
reviews and links to other reviews and other

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:26.089
information of them so it’s actually a really
good list, I spend a lot of time on it.

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:30.759
And I thought what I want to do is take my
five favourite organic gardening books and

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.410
just tell you a little bit about them here
so the first book is about plants and it’s

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.260
called the Secret Life of Plants it’s a
classic book and it’s a little bit more

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:45.641
exoteric but really good advice and it will
change the way you think about plants, they’re

00:00:45.641 --> 00:00:47.300
a lot smarter than a lot of us thinks.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.960
So a little bit of information that will help,
plants can read our mind, what kind of music

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:55.980
they like? They definitely prefer certain
kinds of music and they don’t like some

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.890
kinds of music and how they respond to being
threaten either physically or even if we think

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:01.890
about hurting them.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.710
But there’s actually some practical information
there, it’s really well researched and well

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.440
foot noted and everything. So even if you’re
sceptical I think you should check this book

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.820
out, it is one of my favourite.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.360
Next category in organic gardening books is
about microorganisms and the book is called

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.221
Teaming with Microbes. Microbes are so important
in the garden, as important as you know as

00:01:23.221 --> 00:01:28.690
calcium and nutrients and this is really great
introduction to what they do in the garden,

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.740
in the soil and on plants.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:34.520
And more importantly how we can help them
do their job and even bring them in through

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.190
compost and compost tea and other microbial
inoculants, so this is another practical book,

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:43.210
lots of good advice but are really fun to
read and you know learned a lot from this

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:44.820
one too.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.920
Next category is soil, my favourite topic,
I have lot of books in the list about soil

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.010
that are really good, this one is definitely
on the top of my list of organic gardening

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:58.780
books because it’s pretty easy to read,
it’s called The Nontoxic Farming Handbook

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.001
but it’s not just for farmers but it’s
for everyone who wants to have really good

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:03.600
soil.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:09.050
And Phil Wheeler uses the Albrecht and the
Reams systems of soil management. Lots information

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:14.629
there about on how to test your soil, fertilizing
it and lot of information about ultimately

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.400
about pest control, weed control, insect control
and all that because you know you have healthy

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.069
soil and healthy plants and those things don’t
cause problems and so I love that book on

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:26.939
soil management.

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:33.680
Next category is permaculture, permacultue
is basically a system of sustainable design

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:39.159
and there’s a focus on growing an abundance
of healthy food. But it’s a design system

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:43.450
linking it to relationship between all the
elements in your garden so you know where

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.549
do you put your compost pile and your vegetable
and your chicken and how they are relate to

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:55.189
each other and how they can actually provide,
provide things for each other such that it

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:59.120
become a sustainable garden, a garden that
pretty much takes care of itself.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.451
So that’s kinda a quick definition of it,
it’s a really good topic and this is my

00:03:04.451 --> 00:03:09.790
favourite introductory book about permaculture.
It’s a lot easier to read than the Mollison

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.120
books which are really good but this is a
good intro.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:18.799
Next category is vegetable gardening, I’m
always kinda weary of books about veggie gardening

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:23.209
they just never seem to do that creative,
that creative job frankly especially when

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.439
it comes to soil management.

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:29.299
What some of them are good at and this is
one of my favourite is just giving you information

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:33.450
on the plants and how to so this one you know
how to select them and grow them and harvest

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.812
them, it has a lot of plants in it, its presented
it in a really good way. I like the way it’s

00:03:37.812 --> 00:03:38.909
done.

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:44.719
And there’s a lot of information on short
term pest control as well. So just you know

00:03:44.719 --> 00:03:49.840
when you have a problem how can you get rid
of it in the short term for long term pest

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.379
control you might want to read the nontoxic
travelling handbook and other soil book?

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:58.159
And the book in the next category which is
General organic gardening, what’s my favourite

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:03.059
general book and that is Working with Nature
which is written by my friend Heide Hermany

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:09.069
founder of Gaia college, it’s more of a
textbook and more expensive but its bigger

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.730
too and its, just really, it brings all this
other discipline together.

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:18.299
A lot of information on soil management and
water management and again more on soil testing

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.849
and fertilizers and it’s a great chapter
on energy on the garden and radionics and

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:29.470
just really cool stuff from the future of
gardening in my opinion and the overall books

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:34.340
is just about creating health in the garden
such that you don’t have any pest problem

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.310
and you have healthy food and healthy people
and definitely one of my favourite gardening

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.310
books.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:48.150
So those are my top I guess I have six I have
in here and if you want to check all 50 go

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:55.640
to smilingardener.com/books and that is all
for today so until next time keep your eyes

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.259
to the soil and remember to smile.
