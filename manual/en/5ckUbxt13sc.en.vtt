00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.580
Hi this is Megan with Beadaholique.com and I'm going to show you

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.350
how to make these festive

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.050
abstract Christmas tree style

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:21.800
earrings out of the new Swarovski triangle
pendants

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.400
and what I have here

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.539
is a 16mm triangle pendant and the
new color dark moss green

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.449
I also have a 14mm light siam round
Swarovski

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:37.900
bead. I have a one-and-a-half inch

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.390
20 gauge gold plated head pin. I have a 6mm

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.850
28 gauge jump ring and you do need a

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.089
a larger size ring to fit through the top of your pendant

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:53.350
and then I just have a gold plated bali style earring hook

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.900
So I'm just gonna show you how to do one
earring

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:02.809
Just repeat those instructions for the second one. First thing I'm going to do

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:07.060
is place the 4mm bead

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:13.480
onto the eye pin.Take a pair of chain nose
pliers

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.530
make a simple wire loop here by

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.400
bending right above

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:25.340
the bead using

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.890
a round nose pliers and then just

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.670
bend the wire right around

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.190
and trim and if you

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.190
need more an in-depth look at how to make a simple wire loop

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:46.190
we do have a video on that. Now we're going to just take the chain nose pliers

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:48.610
and

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.990
close that loop you just made and make sure
that

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:59.990
both of the loops nice and straight

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.250
open your jump ring

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.640
and onto the jump ring hang the pendant

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.680
and the little link

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:22.680
that you made and close the jump ring

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.989
take your earring hook

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:32.689
open the loop

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:36.319
and hang from the hook and close the loop
back up

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.329
you can see they're super quick easy

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:46.000
They are a really pretty festive way to show a little bit of holiday spirit.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000
