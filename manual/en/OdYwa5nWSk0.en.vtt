00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:08.099
hey what I got here is my microwave from
the house and it works in it and it

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:18.060
cooks food everything but the turntable
inside here has stopped turning and I'm

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.740
going to take it apart and see if I can
figure out why and fix it if I can if

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.230
not I'm going to keep it till it quits
running because it still works but if I

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:34.590
could figure it out i'm going to what we
got there's a bunch of phillips screws

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:49.559
on the bottom and one of those let's see
one of those is 88 orcs with the little

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.730
nub in it i'm not sure what they call
them she's going to get you a close-up

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:04.049
on that now it's right here and it's a
Torx but it's got a little nub in it

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:10.860
that won't allow you to use as standard
torps but there's enough screw there or

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.290
I can use my scripts so let me get to
taking this apart and i'll show you what

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.460
i got the turntable portion of it the
gears are built or whatever it is that

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:27.540
drives that turntable is down here this
is the bottom of thing turned up so let

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.040
me just tell you this that in a
microwave there's a capacitor that holds

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:39.090
a bunch of energy and if you're not
careful that could zap you but we're not

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.170
going near that capacitor world or I'm
going to be working on this thing all

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:55.259
right I'm gonna work on getting these
crews out ok I got it apart and here's

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:03.899
the capacitor that you don't want to
touch here's the motor right here this

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.550
is the thing that makes the turntable
turn I'm going to unplug it I'm going to

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.420
pull this motor out and have a look
got it when this thing started going bad

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:35.069
I could hear a grinding noise I'm going
to turn this or see if I can well I

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.690
don't see any reason why that would not
work tell you what I'm going to plug it

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:49.090
back in here's the plug I'm going to
take this plug out in the back I'm gonna

00:02:49.090 --> 00:03:04.690
plug it in and so we can get that motor
to work i'll be right back I gotta get

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:10.390
extension cord over here I'm not working
on my regular bench all right don't try

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.340
this at home might not be safe there's
my disclaimer I'm just going to start it

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.110
and we'll see if this motor he returns

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:30.480
no does not so I think what I'll do now
is put a volt meter on here and see if

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.130
I'm getting in juice when we get low
volt meter be right back all right i got

00:03:35.130 --> 00:04:16.170
the pro probes in there i did have this
all set up to all right let's just give

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:19.910
it a real fast click here

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:46.100
well it's saying that we're getting
juice well I got power coming to the

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:54.350
motor so now all I can guess is the
motors bad i may try to take this apart

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.840
with the heck i'm here be right back
well I decided I'm not going to take it

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.650
apart let me show you why when I when I
turn this there is something there's

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:14.780
some gears or something wrong hold it up
close so you can hear it you hear them

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:25.190
gears and that's what I heard as this
thing was getting worse and worse that's

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.000
what I heard was grinding and and
crunching and I'm sure these little

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:35.870
gears in here nylon so I'm just going to
leave it out I'll we didn't fix anything

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.530
but we figured out what the little motor
looks like that's pretty cool little a

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:46.610
little tiny motor like that so I'll just
use this thing till it quits working it

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:49.790
doesn't heat evenly you've got to stop
it two or three times and turn your

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:57.770
plate so so the plate will heat evenly
but anyway I'll put this up it's not

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:01.460
it's not a repair but it's definitely
may you know there's a lot of people

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:07.100
haven't seen the inside of a microwave
this isn't the part that makes the

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:11.540
microwave but this year is the
transformer and this here is the

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:16.370
capacitor and the things that makes the
microwave is actually in the top of the

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:22.490
microwave and that's the dangerous part
so I'm going to put this back together

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:26.360
bring back the kitchen and we won't tell
my wife i had this part thanks for

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:31.580
watching it's going to give you a close
up of them little screws that they don't

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.910
want you to undo and the i'm sure they
got some fancy name for my safety screws

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:41.670
but their sole purpose is to keep you
from getting in

00:06:41.670 --> 00:06:47.970
and fixing them if you can god forbid
you fix some kind of some of the Chinese

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:52.470
crap they send us look at all the
Chinese that would go to bed hungry at

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:58.800
night if we could actually fix some of
the crap they send us I'm going to hang

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:04.010
on to this little motor you never know I
might run across another microwave that

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:09.660
you know transformer broke but the motor
works and I'm sure they're pretty much

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:16.770
standard so I'll keep my eyes up for a
junk microwave all right we fixing go to

00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:33.980
the kitchen plug it in and make sure it
works all right it works good enough
