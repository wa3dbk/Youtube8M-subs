00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I'm going to explain how to make a inside out french braid

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.000
you start

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
at the top you take a strand of hair  

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and divide into three strands  

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
usually you go up on top of each strand but now I take the strands under and braid them.  

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:49.000
when you turns the strand left or rigth take a strand of hair and braid it together

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and you doing it also on the other side

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
you go on as long until all the hair has braided

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
if all the hair is braided. Braid the strands in the normal way  

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Braid the strands inside out

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
put your braid with a hair elastic  

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
so does your inside out french braid looks like
