00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.740
A prayer a day keeps the doctor away!

00:00:02.740 --> 00:00:03.740
Also apples.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.759
And probably bingo.

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:12.919
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.490
Prayer is an aged ritual and a nearly universal
human behavior.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.029
Nearly 90% of Americans pray regularly and
about 60% pray at least once a day.

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.949
From a psychological perspective, is this
a positive thing?

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.670
Religions often convey God as a sort of parent
figure - which is, amongst psychology researchers,

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.359
God is seen as the ultimate attachment figure.

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.870
It’s well established that our relationship
with our parents can determine mental health

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.660
outcomes, and researchers are finding that
the nature of a religious person’s relationship

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:41.520
with god may also determine mental health
outcomes.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.870
In a new study on prayer at Baylor University,
people who had a positive attachment to god

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.060
(who believed he’d be there for them to
comfort them and support them) showed fewer

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.129
symptoms of anxiety.

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.730
They had less irrational worry, stress, self-consciousness,
and dread in social situations.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.969
The researchers say god is seen as a form
of emotional support that they can count on.

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.080
People who had an insecure attachment and
weren’t sure whether or not god would be

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.620
there experienced more frequent symptoms of
anxiety.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.490
This builds on earlier research about prayer.

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.100
A study in the British Journal of Health and
Psychology found that those who pray frequently

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.390
have fewer symptoms of depression and anxiety
than the general population.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.710
The researchers believe this is because prayer
can be used as a form of stress relief - an

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.540
outlet for relieving fear, anger, and worry.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.990
Critics fired back, however, claiming that
studies have also found bingo contributes

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.990
to better mental health.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.170
The National Secular Society argues that the
key to deep relaxation isn’t the praying

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.950
itself, it’s having a community (like a
church) that people can go to and feel a sense

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.030
of togetherness.

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.780
To make things even more interesting, when
we look at prayer in a secular context, or

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.530
in the context of eastern religions, it’s
actually quite a lot like meditation.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.140
It’s a moment of quiet, a chant, a self-affirmation,
or a plea.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.590
It’s centering on a particular thought and
seeking inner calm.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.140
Unsurprisingly, studies on meditation, which
I’ve talked about on DNews in the past,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.140
also find the same effects - particularly
the anxiety relief.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.670
But in the meditation studies, the anxiety
relief wasn’t contingent on how the person

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:02.850
felt about their deity.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.820
So folks, what do you think about prayer?

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.860
Has it ever helped you out?

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.580
Tell me about it down below and I’ll see
you next time on DNews!
