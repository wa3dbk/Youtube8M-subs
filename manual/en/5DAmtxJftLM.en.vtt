00:00:00.556 --> 00:00:02.606
&gt;&gt;This is James Morgan and
today we're going to be talking

00:00:02.606 --> 00:00:06.296
about digital media art, new
media art, and the intersection

00:00:06.296 --> 00:00:07.366
of art and technology.

00:00:07.836 --> 00:00:09.716
All three of these
things actually refer

00:00:09.716 --> 00:00:12.806
to the same body of
work essentially.

00:00:13.266 --> 00:00:16.276
But there's also like
computers and art and there's

00:00:16.276 --> 00:00:17.766
like several other topics

00:00:17.766 --> 00:00:19.996
and you'll hear me use them
fairly interchangeably.

00:00:21.506 --> 00:00:22.356
So what is art?

00:00:22.636 --> 00:00:26.436
Well, art is a discussion,
it's about philosophy.

00:00:26.506 --> 00:00:30.776
It's not really terribly useful
to approach it from that aspect.

00:00:31.356 --> 00:00:34.116
It's much better to talk
about well, what's interesting

00:00:34.596 --> 00:00:37.826
because people aren't interested
in what experts have to say,

00:00:38.186 --> 00:00:39.886
they're more interested
in what their taste is

00:00:40.256 --> 00:00:41.036
when it comes to art.

00:00:42.036 --> 00:00:45.546
Media on the other hand
is more understandable

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:47.786
and media has also shifted.

00:00:47.786 --> 00:00:52.136
It used to be more about
one-to-many in the case

00:00:52.136 --> 00:00:54.486
of print media or
broadcast media.

00:00:55.356 --> 00:00:58.666
With the advent of
computers and the Internet,

00:00:58.666 --> 00:01:01.026
this has become much
more about many-to-many.

00:01:02.586 --> 00:01:07.346
Along these lines though, art
has changed in the last country.

00:01:07.346 --> 00:01:12.316
In the early 20th century,
Marcel Duchamp changed the way

00:01:12.316 --> 00:01:13.216
that we understand art.

00:01:13.416 --> 00:01:17.476
Our art after Marcel
Duchamp is conceptual;

00:01:17.636 --> 00:01:20.606
it is about the ideas, it's not
about the aesthetics any longer.

00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:25.796
Clement Greenberg in the middle
of this last century talked

00:01:25.796 --> 00:01:28.326
about modernism and he
got some things right,

00:01:28.356 --> 00:01:30.376
but in other ones he
sort of missed the point.

00:01:31.146 --> 00:01:34.726
He said that it's really about
the characteristic methods

00:01:34.726 --> 00:01:36.766
of a discipline to criticize
the discipline itself.

00:01:36.766 --> 00:01:40.056
Not to subvert it, but to
entrench it more firmly

00:01:40.526 --> 00:01:42.166
in the areas of its competence.

00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:43.796
So let's look at painting.

00:01:44.086 --> 00:01:47.416
Now when we're talking about
painting, we all have like sort

00:01:47.416 --> 00:01:49.526
of a basic understanding
of what it is about.

00:01:49.526 --> 00:01:51.646
We're not talking about house
painting so much, we're talking

00:01:51.646 --> 00:01:53.606
about like fine art
painting, right?

00:01:53.966 --> 00:01:57.426
It's about taking a substance
and applying it to a surface

00:01:58.356 --> 00:02:01.696
so there are a lot of things
we consider along these lines.

00:02:01.816 --> 00:02:03.896
So what is the surface?

00:02:03.896 --> 00:02:08.166
What type of paint are we using
and how are you applying it?

00:02:08.326 --> 00:02:11.106
The work of the artist's
hand is there,

00:02:11.106 --> 00:02:12.866
like how do they apply it?

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:16.806
What sort of materials are they
using; is it thick, is it thin,

00:02:16.806 --> 00:02:20.066
is it water based,
is it oil based,

00:02:20.066 --> 00:02:23.356
is it even some sort
of traditional media?

00:02:24.336 --> 00:02:26.256
The form, the color,
the subject.

00:02:26.346 --> 00:02:27.896
What is the image?

00:02:28.216 --> 00:02:31.426
What is being represented in
it; is it anything actually?

00:02:32.046 --> 00:02:37.146
What do think of when we see
it and what do we fantasize

00:02:37.146 --> 00:02:38.976
about when we see this image

00:02:38.976 --> 00:02:41.866
when you see what has
been applied to it?

00:02:43.666 --> 00:02:48.136
Mark Tribe describes new media
art as projects that make use

00:02:48.136 --> 00:02:50.356
of emerging media
technologies and are concerned

00:02:50.356 --> 00:02:51.726
with the cultural, political,

00:02:51.866 --> 00:02:53.866
and aesthetic possibilities
of these tools.

00:02:54.676 --> 00:02:57.646
In fact these three
things, cultural, political,

00:02:57.646 --> 00:03:01.066
and aesthetic possibilities,
apply to all art media.

00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:07.346
Now, with respect to video art,
where does this leave video art?

00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:09.206
Is it part of the digital?

00:03:09.206 --> 00:03:10.786
Well certainly YouTube is.

00:03:11.206 --> 00:03:14.916
And YouTube is a very
interesting way to look at video

00:03:14.916 --> 00:03:17.046
and to consider it in
a contemporary setting.

00:03:17.416 --> 00:03:21.626
It is both digital and new
media in that standpoint.

00:03:22.906 --> 00:03:26.526
In terms of technology, how
does one look at technology

00:03:27.026 --> 00:03:31.946
and call this sort of
"Greenbergian" formalism out?

00:03:31.986 --> 00:03:33.796
How does one sort
of deal with this?

00:03:34.226 --> 00:03:38.266
Very often it is
about the formalistic

00:03:38.326 --> 00:03:43.186
and the physical aesthetic
qualities of it itself.

00:03:43.566 --> 00:03:47.186
More specifically, we're
dealing with the concept

00:03:47.306 --> 00:03:53.086
because it always falls back
on the idea of the concept.

00:03:53.086 --> 00:03:55.606
If you can't answer the
question, "What does it mean,"

00:03:55.966 --> 00:03:57.846
then it does appear that
you're missing something.

00:03:58.356 --> 00:03:59.696
Now you could say
that it means nothing,

00:04:00.356 --> 00:04:03.976
that's certainly a
viable answer for it.

00:04:04.146 --> 00:04:07.606
In terms of contemporary editing
and contemporary collage,

00:04:07.936 --> 00:04:11.756
a lot of work has to be done at
Photoshop and this is like sort

00:04:11.756 --> 00:04:14.146
of like the visual match-up.

00:04:14.216 --> 00:04:19.536
Or images that sort of question
the authenticity of themselves

00:04:20.476 --> 00:04:22.256
and what they present to us.

00:04:23.236 --> 00:04:27.506
In addition to that the World
Wide Web provides an interesting

00:04:27.506 --> 00:04:30.206
means to reach indirectly to us.

00:04:30.206 --> 00:04:34.506
With that, www.jodie.org
actually takes and looks

00:04:34.506 --> 00:04:37.086
at the essential quality
of the web which is to say

00:04:37.086 --> 00:04:40.036
that beneath the surface,
there is a source code

00:04:40.036 --> 00:04:43.586
and they plant a little
nugget of the source.

00:04:44.606 --> 00:04:50.026
In terms of games, games
fall very specifically

00:04:50.026 --> 00:04:51.176
at the point of interaction.

00:04:51.886 --> 00:04:55.456
And in the game like Passage,
you experience your entire life

00:04:55.556 --> 00:04:57.276
in the five minutes
that it takes to play.

00:04:58.016 --> 00:05:02.716
It is a very sort of
profound, yet retro experience.

00:05:03.276 --> 00:05:10.836
Working with 3D and inflatables,
it's possible to take and deal

00:05:10.836 --> 00:05:15.086
with scale and deal with
the public and intervention

00:05:15.486 --> 00:05:23.666
in a very sort of fun, if not
accessible sort of manner.

00:05:24.566 --> 00:05:27.936
Performance for that matter
often intersects a lot

00:05:27.936 --> 00:05:28.996
of digital media art.

00:05:29.446 --> 00:05:32.806
In this example, the [inaudible]
are reenacting classic

00:05:32.806 --> 00:05:35.726
performances instead of a
game or virtual environment.

00:05:36.356 --> 00:05:39.356
The question is, "Well, how does
this affect the performance;

00:05:39.356 --> 00:05:41.436
how does this change
it to suddenly be

00:05:41.436 --> 00:05:43.906
in this other space,
or this area?"

00:05:45.196 --> 00:05:49.816
For that matter, /hug
creates for an organization

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:53.236
like the American Red Cross,
but in the World of Warcraft

00:05:53.296 --> 00:05:55.446
which has been at
war for 3,000 years.

00:05:56.046 --> 00:05:57.696
And this question
is much more like,

00:05:57.696 --> 00:05:59.686
where did we leave
our central humanity?

00:06:00.116 --> 00:06:03.556
What is the place of
our central being?

00:06:03.886 --> 00:06:07.556
In terms of art and
digital media art,

00:06:07.556 --> 00:06:12.986
it's held at the same standards,
but has different goals.

00:06:13.676 --> 00:06:16.646
Essentially the political,
cultural,

00:06:16.696 --> 00:06:20.106
and aesthetic possibilities
are relevant

00:06:20.526 --> 00:06:22.246
in all of these aspects.

00:06:23.346 --> 00:06:25.386
In the end, art is art

00:06:25.466 --> 00:06:27.156
and everything else
is everything else.

00:06:27.316 --> 00:06:31.316
And that's not to say
that anything is less

00:06:31.506 --> 00:06:35.686
than something else, but
the point is not well,

00:06:35.686 --> 00:06:39.236
is something art, but If
it is art, then it is art

00:06:40.046 --> 00:06:43.386
and we just aren't going to
engage in that conversation.
