00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.440
-PLAN IT-
Once youâ€™ve measured your kitchen 
you can start using our online kitchen planner at home. 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.480
But if you need help planning-

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.000
-book an appointment with a member of staff 
at your local IKEA store-

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.150
-or contact us for details.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.100
Here are some things you need to 
think about when you start planning your kitchen.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.900
You should be able to move quickly and easily 
between the cooking area, the fridge and the sink. 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.000
This is sometimes called the working triangle.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.850
The shape of our kitchen 
will usually be dictated by the shape of the room-

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.250
-but just because your existing kitchen is one shape- 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.250
-doesn't necessarily mean your new kitchen
has to be the same. 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.350
Here are a few layout options:

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.400
A line kitchen is good for 
small spaces but not so good for bigger rooms. 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.100
If you have the space, 
you can add an island- 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.000
-which not only gives more storage-

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.200
-it can also act as a serving area,
a hang-out and a room divider. 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.500
An L-shaped kitchen creates a good working triangle
and gives you lots of storage space. 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.600
A U-shaped kitchen gives you 
loads of storage and worktop space-

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.600
-but you'll need a big room.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.700
A parallel kitchen gives you two
work and storage stations on opposite walls. 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.200
It doesn't need that much space and works really well 
in rooms with a door or window at the end. 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.950
When it comes to worktops-

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.500
-space on both sides of the hob 
will give you somewhere to put hot pans-

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.900
-but if you're short on space
prioritise the space between the sink and the hob.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.700
In a parallel kitchen make sure there's room for two 
people to work without bumping into each other. 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.800
A distance of at least 120 cm will let you open 
drawers and doors on both sides at the same time. 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.700
Place wall cabinets at a height that
won't block the view of the counter tops.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.400
Make sure you follow the 
manufacturer's recommendation-

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.770
-when it comes to the height of the fan
above the hob.  

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.100
Placing your oven at eye-level means less bending and 
keeps the oven out of reach of the kids. 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.300
Counter space beside the oven will
give you somewhere to put hot trays.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.300
Keeping your cooking utensils and 
pots and pans close to the hob-

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.000
-means they'll always be within
reach when you need them.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.200
Storing your glasses, cutlery and 
porcelain close to the sink and dishwasher-

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:01.960
-will make loading and
unloading the dishwasher easier.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.850
Leave space for a filler piece between
the last cabinet and the wall. 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.160
This will give you
enough room to fully open the door-

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.630
-which is especially important if
you have pull-out baskets.

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.480
Here are some things to avoid:

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.400
Putting your oven or dishwasher in a 
corner will block the adjacent drawers and cabinets. 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.500
Placing a sink next to a wall will disrupt your
workflow and reduce your counter top space.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.300
Placing the oven next to a wall will
expose the wall to heat and fat splashes. 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:35.590
Placing drawers in a corner will block the
adjoining cabinet and may damage its door or handle.
