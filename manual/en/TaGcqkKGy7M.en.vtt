Funai SV310FX1 Night Vision HD Digital Video
Camera Review

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:17.529
Hello, I’m going to review the Funai HD
digital video camera model SV310FX1.

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:26.600
I got this camera for one purpose and that
was for doing some night tutorials for my

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.680
telescope.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:37.750
This particular camera is very compact; it
has one IR light here in the front.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:45.839
You can see here it has a microphone and the
video camera lens here in the front.

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:55.469
It also has a slide here for your USB stick,
you just it open, and slide it out, and there

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:03.909
you go you can plug it in for charging or
getting more images off of your SD stick.

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:11.620
Now the SD card it has is right here on the
side, it’s a micro SD card.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.400
Goes right here, it comes with 1GB right here
on the side.

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:20.780
Another nice feature it has is a little camera
mount, right here on the bottom.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.580
So a standard camera mount, is very cool there.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.250
I’m going to show you something with that
in just a minute.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:35.140
Here’s your interface right here, you can
hit the power button, and it comes on, turns

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.870
off of course right there.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.150
All of the controls are right there on the
front.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:52.680
It’s got an HDMI output here, it’s also
got this simple day and night mode switch

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:56.940
right here, and you slide it to go to night
mode, very easy to use.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.200
What you can do here, is I got something to
show here later on in the test, I got this

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:10.200
extra IR light bar to help illuminate, when
I work at night under my telescope, and give

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.760
some tutorials there.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:24.359
What’s really cool with the IR light, you
can attach the camera just like that, and

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:25.359
there you go!

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:30.459
You have yourself a nice little night vision
camera.

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:37.121
We’re going to record this during the day,
this is just the regular video mode; this

00:02:37.121 --> 00:02:40.530
is coming straight from the Funai SV310FX1
camera.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:49.569
I’ll come out here later tonight and we’ll
do another shot out here at night with the

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.700
recording of the just the night vision part.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:03:03.240
It does have a zoom feature on it, I did notice
the zoom feature makes it pixelated when you

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.939
try the zoom.

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:11.749
In Night vision you cannot use zoom at all,
because it’s just way too pixelated.

00:03:11.749 --> 00:03:19.370
Night vision I would recommend just doing
the standard, all the way zoomed out mode.

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:30.279
Ok that’s just a shot showing you what it
looks like, during the regular vision.

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:40.939
Here’s a video using the regular LED, or
the infer red, on the stock of the camera.

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:44.219
You get to something’s close and you can
see.

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:58.590
It’s got pretty good night vision, things
from a far, it’s kind of hard to see, now

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:10.200
here, this is the stock one right here, let
me turn on my extra Infer Red light and whoa!

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.449
Look at that!

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:15.059
That blasted it out!

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:25.600
So having that extra IR light really brightens
things up.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:32.030
Ok there’s the extra IR light ON, now it’s
OFF.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:35.880
You can hardly see that tree.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.240
Turn the extra IR light ON and WOW!

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.470
It comes up nice and bright.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.640
See the corner of the yard there with the
extra IR light on, take it off, really can’t

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:58.760
see much there, so the verdict is that the
stock Infer red light will do good for close

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:06.720
up stuff, but if you want to get any kind
of distance, having this additional IR light,

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.510
BOOM just lights up the whole area!

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:12.420
Really bright!

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:27.560
Now let’s try this, I’m going to try pointing
up at the moon, you can see the moon, there’s

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.310
Jupiter right there.

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:43.570
Here’s me with the single IR light, Ok and
when we turn on the additional IR light, and

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:44.570
what do you see?

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:45.570
Is it much brighter?

00:05:45.570 --> 00:06:21.169
I imagine it is, ok that’s it, see ya!
