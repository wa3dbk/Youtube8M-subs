00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:08.200
You know, the big reality of the game Accordion
is that you will be faced with dilemmas. And,

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:16.610
unlike most games, I can't really tell you
which way to go because you'll have to learn

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:25.290
from experience and Accordion is a game where,
if you play it in the version where you lay

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:34.710
out all fifty-two cards at the start, it's
a game that you can get a good score at most

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.230
of the time if you sit and think about all
you're moves before you make a single one.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.550
So, if you're the type of person who can play
a game that way and wants to play a game that

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:54.829
way, Accordion dealt all out on the tableau
at the start is the game for you. Let's give

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.359
an example of what I'm talking about. What
are the dilemmas? Well, you see the very last

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:07.550
card right now is the king of diamonds and
there's no play on the card beside it, but

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:13.760
three over, is another king. So you can play
that there, but here's the thing. If you play

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:20.980
that there at this time, you'll be losing
the opportunity to play this king of spades

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:30.590
on like spade. You can take the spade and
go kind to ten, right there, right? With the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:40.810
kind of spades there's another kind of dilemma.
It's sort of a dilemma in that going here

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:46.280
is one move, but going three over to this
spade is another. Luckily there's a spade

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:55.430
in the middle of the ten and the seven, so
it can be played like this. So, in this case,

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.090
there actually is an answer for what to do,
in that you would move the kind over and play

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:09.000
the spades, and then you can jump this king
over to here. But! But! Even then, you've

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.470
cut yourself off from an option. Because if
I play the king here, I can't play the spade

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:26.330
here. OKay? And it's just something you'll
have to learn as you go, and learn when, basically,

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:35.190
to play a suit or play a rank and go from
there. So that's the difficulty of Accordion,

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.520
and its best beaten by experience.
