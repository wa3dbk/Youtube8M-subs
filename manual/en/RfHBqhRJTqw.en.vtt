Holly Sugrue here your go to video gal and
today I'm going to be talking to you about

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.370
how you can create a killer video scripts
for your business.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:22.939
Three words Amy Porterfield lives by when

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.260
creating content, are the same three words
I am going to share with you today for you

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:36.380
to use when creating a video scripts. Your
video script should be Entertaining, Educational, or Empowering.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.380
So step by step, here are the 5 steps that

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.520
you need to know to create a killer video
script for your business.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:49.160
Step 1 - Figure out who you're making this
video for, know your audience. You have to know your audience.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.880
Step 2 - Writing a script is different than

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.890
writing copy for your website. You're going
to be writing for the ear. Which means using

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.890
short sentences and simple language. You want
to avoid using tongue twisters or jargon and

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.800
always want to read your script out loud before
you start rolling on your first take. I usually

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:17.300
read through my script a bunch of times before I start rolling and make any necessary adjustments that I need to make. 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.740
Step 3 - To quote Dale Carnegie  

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:25.350
Tell them what you're going to tell them, tell them and then tell them what you've just told them.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.940
Attention spans are short. So within the first
30 seconds you want to tell your audience

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.480
what you to tell them, so they know what to
pay attention to. You're going to tell them

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.250
and then you're going to tell them what
you just told them to reinforce your message.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.270
Step 4 - Speak directly to the person watching.
When writing your script you want to use personal

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:51.210
pronouns like "you &amp; your". Usually when
people watch videos they're at their computer alone

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:57.610
They're not typically in a big group. So you want to speak to them as though you are having a one on one conversation.

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.360
Step 5 - Create a call to action. Tell your

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.770
audience what you want them to do after they're
done watching your video. Do you want them

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:09.210
to buy your products or services, like your
Facebook page, follow you on tweeter? 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.560
Whatever it is that you want them to do, make sure you tell your audience what the next step is.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.920
SO the 5 steps are - 1. Know your audience

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.700
2. Write for the ear 3. Tell'em what you're
going to tell'em, tell'em-tell'em what

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.160
you've just told'em. 4. Speak directly
to the person watching. And 5. Create a call to action.

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.600
Now is the time to take action, everyone starts

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:37.420
with their first script, everyone starts with
their first video. No matter how professional

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.400
or polished or intimidating they may be today
they all started with their first script and

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.700
they all started with their first video. If
you want to get to that level where they are,

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.980
you really need to start now. So I want you
to grab a piece a paper and I want you to

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:58.340
write your first script. If you already written
a script I want you to grab a piece of paper

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.569
and just write another script because you
don't get better at things you don't practice.

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.270
So do that and leave your comments below.
