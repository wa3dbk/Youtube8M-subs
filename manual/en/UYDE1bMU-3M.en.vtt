00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.480
We're going to go ahead and practise our Ukemi
Waza which is the art of falling. I want to

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.950
go ahead and first demonstrate to you guys
how a good Ukemi full force impact fall will

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:24.029
look like. Very quickly, but very safe. "Zorai".
What Zorai's going to do over here, she's

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.929
going to, first and foremost, tucking her
chin so that back of her head is covered.

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:32.680
Second thing she's going to do, she's going
to set up her arms in front of her, just like

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:40.610
this. She's going to spread her legs a little
bit, slightly bend them and then she's going

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.242
to go ahead and bend them all the way and
fall back in a rolling way and then she's

00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:52.370
going to slap her hands to the mat, just like
this. "Do it slowly Zorai". You're just going

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.850
to go ahead and let those legs just flop up
like that and when she slams, she's going

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.030
to do a less than forty five degree angle
right here, bam, that's nice and perfect.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:08.780
"Zorai can you show them one more time please".
Okay again, tucking the chin, stick out the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:17.780
arms, bend your knees, roll back, just like
that. This is very good because a lot of people

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.640
will be thrown in Judo competitions. When
they get thrown, they need to be aware that

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.700
there's a certain right way to do it. You
could fall without getting hurt or hurt that

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:34.110
much. A lot of people reach for the ground.
Never reach for the ground, this is not reaching

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.960
for the ground, this is slapping to have your
hands absorb the punishment, not the back.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.330
And the chin right here should be tucked in
at all times even as their laying down. Of

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:49.470
course in competition you don't willingly,
you don't willingly get thrown, you resist

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:57.360
it and you fight for it. But, you do not resist
during Kata and you do not resist while Randoring.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.340
Randoring is free practise with a partner.
When you're doing a Randori with a partner,

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.400
you go ahead and lay each other. You know,
you may resist a bit, but not that, not as

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.869
much as you would in like a competition.
