Hi,

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.010
This is Judy, I'm the owner of MountainBaby.com

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.610
and today we're going to talk about Padraig Wool slippers.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.089
and I'll show you what I'm talking about.
Padraig Wool slippers

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.600
are the biggest selling item on MountainBaby.com

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.710
and for good reason. First of all, they range
from

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.980
teeny teeny teeny teeny too big enormous
giant

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:29.560
slippers and they are made, handmade
still, in Vancouver BC

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.380
They're made from woo on the outside
and when you put your finger inside,

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.710
it's soft soft soft sheepskin

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.780
which feels so good on your feet. Virtually every baby

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.940
in this community in Nelson has a pair
of these because,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.860
not only are they super warm, but because
they're all natural fiber.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.640
They don't make your feet sweat so
baby

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.309
or you stay warm and comfy; basically all
year round. Right now,

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.690
I am wearing my Padraig Wool Slippers
which I wear

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.010
all year round even in the heat of the
summer. I wear them in the evening when I

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.040
get home from work

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.080
because they feel like home to me. They've
become kind of my best friend.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.119
What's great about them also, because
they're natural fiber, is they stretch,

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.140
so that most pairs of the Padraigs

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.770
for a child will last for about a year
and a half to two years... still be in

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.970
great condition... you can pass them on to
the next child and pass them on to the

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.100
next child and pass them on to the next
child... and all your friends and relatives

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.700
etc

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.790
They're beautifully made, super
comfortable.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:35.170
They come in a great array of colours. Sizes
all the way from newborn, which is

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.390
kind of an heirloom thing that
you keep forever,

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:43.090
up to the giant men's extra-large. 
One of the few adult

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.299
products that we carry in our store. 
Basically because the parents saw their kids

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:47.750
wearing them and said... " Hey...

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.799
come on... These look so comfy we want them". So we brought in

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.110
adult ones as well. If you're looking for a great baby gift...

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.439
also if you're looking for the ultimate
Canadian present...

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.439
sell these to people who
come from all over the world who come in saying

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.070
"We want to bring back something Canadian"

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.549
We say "Get these slippers. They're the essence of Canadian... warm and fuzzy and comfy... and all that"

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.009
So please subscribe to our
(YouTube) channel: so you don't lose out on all

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.400
the great information we're giving you
about products and child development

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.290
and share this with your friends and
family so they don't miss out either and

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:19.610
do yourself and them

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.870
and us a favour. Thank you so much. This is
