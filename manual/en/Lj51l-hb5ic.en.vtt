Hi my name is Madeline Franco and we're here
to talk about birds specifically we are talking

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.730
about sexing birds, determining whether they
are male or female. I am standing here with

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:16.170
two birds that are what we call dimorphic.
This is the female. This is Zoey and this

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.450
is Nigel the male. You'll notice that Zoey
has some yellow spots on her and she has a

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:29.090
striated tail. They are red tailed black cockatoos
and Nigel here has a red slash across his

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:40.039
otherwise black tail. He is otherwise dimorphic
birds are Jasmine who is a female eclectics

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:48.789
and this is Josepie, Josepie Verde which means
in Italian Joe Green and he is a male eclectic.

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.739
You'll notice his beak which is also a candy
corn color. There are several Asiatic parrots

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.289
that also have candy corn colored beaks in
the male and the female has a black beak most

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:05.740
notably the Derbyan Parakeet. Most parrots
however, are monamorphic which means that

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.549
they do not have any differentiation between
the male and female that is visible to us

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:20.300
as humans and this over here is an example
of that sort of bird. This is a kieek. This

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.700
happens to be a female but if it were a male
it would look not a whole lot different. Those

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.469
of us who know birds a little better realize
that behaviorally you can often tell the difference

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:36.729
but my advice would be for anyone not to wait
until a bird is older or lays an egg to find

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.649
out that it is a female. It is best to know
the sex of your bird because knowing the sex

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:48.350
of your bird also helps you deal with certain
behaviors that are typical of a male or female.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.531
The most reliable way to sex a bird these
days is through DNA sampling and there are

00:01:53.531 --> 00:01:57.950
many labs throughout the USA who will do that
for you. For DNA sexing all you need is a

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:02.880
small blood sample which you can obtain when
you cut the bird's nails or something like

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.979
that way and you get your results back with
a very short amount of time with the e-mail

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:13.640
even quicker than we used to and it helps
you as I say anticipate behaviors and deal

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:20.190
with some problems and hopefully could save
your bird's life if there is a disease or

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:26.240
a situation that is specific to a female such
as egg binding that you would know about because

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.990
you would know right away that your bird is
female and that would be a possibility. DNA

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:36.080
sexing is as I said very inexpensive. It is
about $20 or $25 and it is highly recommended.
