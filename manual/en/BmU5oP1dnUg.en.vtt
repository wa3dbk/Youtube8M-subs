00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:41.771
Hi it's the twenty-second of September and
today we're looking at Yew trees.

00:00:41.771 --> 00:00:46.370
Ok, well as you can see, I'm in a graveyard
at the moment and there's an old Yew tree

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:47.370
here.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.500
Um you'll often find them in graveyards, because
churches are often built on old religious

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.649
sites and...well you can see by this tree
and there's the church there, this tree is

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:10.060
clearly much older than the church and was
obviouslyhere before and er...it's also hollow

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.740
and this particular tree, you're supposed
to be cursed ifd you go inside it, but let's

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.170
give it a go anyway.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:24.970
And yeah, you can see it's pretty dark in
here.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.700
But quite, quite fascinating.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:47.130
And er..also down here, I don't know if you
can see, there's some Chicken Of The woods

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:54.460
that's really quite manky and mouldy but,
often to be found growing on Yew trees.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:03.250
Chicken Of The Woods is one of the main fungi
responsible for heart-wood rot in Yew trees.

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:09.899
And er, Yew trees do have this...this habit
of producing these kind of secondary trunks

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.190
on the outside and then hollowing out in the
middle, which makes them notoriously difficult

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.720
to age.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:23.070
The growth rate of Yew trees slows as they
age, as well as them being prone to periods

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.310
of dormancy in which little or no growth occurs.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.180
It has been estimated that for the first three-hundred
years of it's life, a Yew tree adds about

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.019
an inch of trunk girth, every five years.

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:38.660
After this, growth becomes more errratic.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.190
Different areas of the tree may become dormant
and it is this that causes the apparent divisions

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.671
in the trunks.

00:02:45.671 --> 00:02:49.640
There are certainly Yew trees that are over
two-thousand years old and some have been

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:54.840
estimated to be over five-thousand years old,
making them contenders for the oldest living

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.580
things on Earth.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.240
Now um...most parts of a Yew tree are poisonous.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:08.980
Um...the foliage is particularly poisonous
to livestock, especially cattle and um...yeah,

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:16.400
when it dries, it becomes even more toxic
to them, so um...cattle have died from eating

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:20.350
Yew foliage.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:31.549
Now the edible part of a Yew tree is the berries,
but um...only the er..red fleshy part of the

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:32.549
berries.

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.530
The seeds are um...poisonous, like the rest
of the tree is.

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:42.570
So when eating the berries, probably the safest
thing to do is try and extract the seed before

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:49.030
you put it in your mouth, but um.. as you
can see, they are really slimy and um...it's

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:50.930
actually quite difficult to do this.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:57.052
So really the easiest way, is to put the berry
in your mouth and um...

00:03:57.052 --> 00:03:59.239
And spit out the pip.

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:04.650
And er...when eating these, it is quite important
that you make sure you don't swallow the pip.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:10.639
Um...I've heard stories that three of theese
are enough to stop your heart and someone

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:15.970
ate one with a cracked tooth and cut the seed
and made themselves really ill, but um...

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.750
I don't think they're that toxic, uh...the
only evidence I've heard of anyone actually

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.870
dying from eating Yew, is children eating
the foliage.

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:28.350
But, um...yeah, it's best not to take any
chances.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.040
Bear in mind that all parts of the Yew tree,
except the flesh of the berries, are fatally

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.410
poisonous - the wood, the bark, the leaves
and the seeds.

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.320
They also can produce an allergic reaction,
which may be a problem for some people who

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:46.590
are doing things like making long bows from
the Yew wood.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:50.000
And one thing with Yew berries is they are
really, really sweet.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.250
You'll be quite surprised how sweet they actually
are.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.560
They don't have much flavour, but they are
very sugary.

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.180
A real sucrose kind of sugar...

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:07.300
Now yew berries, they don't intend to kill
us by advertising themselves to be eaten like

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.850
this, but mormally they're eaten by things
like birds and foxes, of which they pass straight

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:18.500
through the digestive system, whereas our
digestive system's a bit stronger and will

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.520
digest the seeds, hence they're a bit more
toxic for us.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:28.420
Our digestive systems are more effective at
breaking down plant matter and grazing animals

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:35.820
are even more efficient at doing so, hence
Yew is very toxic to cattle/

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:44.700
Now Yew trees have seperate sexes on different
trees, so um...you're only gonna find berries

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:48.520
on the female trees...

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:55.880
And of course, aside from the um...the edible
berries, another traditional use for Yew trees

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:58.020
is using the wood to make longbows.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:02.800
And this is a Yew lonhgbow here.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.680
This one's actually a replica of er..um...one
of the ones that was found on Henry the Eighth's

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.180
flagship, The Mary Rose.

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:15.900
And you can see it's um.. got the heartwood
on the inside there.

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:26.390
yeah, quite interesting...and it actually
works.

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:31.270
With my boots on, I'm about six foot tall,
so you can see how large this longbow actually

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:32.270
is.

00:06:32.270 --> 00:07:07.440
Anyway, here's my friend John, demonstrating
it a bit more efficiently than I do...

00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.920
The Yew tree has an ancient association with
the supernatural, in particular, an association

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.920
with death.

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.330
Perhaps this is due to it's longevity, or
it's poisonous attributes.

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:23.110
Perhaps it's due to it's reputation for having
hallucinogenic qualities and accompanying

00:07:23.110 --> 00:07:24.220
frightening visions.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:31.000
Whatever it is, over the millennia, reluctance
to cut them down has left a legacy of ancient

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:31.300
Yew trees, across Britain and Ireland.
