00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:24.459
In the South African context, this place is
unique because

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.260
we're a dry, arid country, and we don't have a lot of water.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.220
The Afrikaans
name for it is Sterkfontein, which directly

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.720
translates to strong fountain.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:42.860
And it's strange

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.100
to find a lake

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.600
in Africa,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.800
especially in southern Africa, that's this clear.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.760
You know, this
water is this cobalt blue color,

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.660
and we've got all of these indigenous

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.680
smaller yellowfish swimming up and down the edges of the lake.

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.949
Like, 98% of the fish in the lake is within
ten feet of the edge.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.220
And you can

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.660
throw chunky, big flies at these fish,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.360
and they'll come
over, and they'll eat.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.960
See, just because the fish are so close to
the bank, doesn't mean that it's a short cast.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:19.660
Typically what we'll do is, we'll fish two
guys together.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.500
Or, if you're fishing on your own, it's more challenging.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.440
We'll get fairly
high up on the banks, and then we get some

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.039
elevation, get some light behind us, and we
can walk the edges looking for these fish.

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:31.139
It's easier to see them when the sun's behind
you.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.040
And that's the challenge of this fishery,
that is,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.480
it's a difficult fish to convince to eat.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.740
It's physical; you've gotta walk these
hills and walk these mountains, and there's

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.520
snakes that you've gotta dodge.

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.120
And you need
to make ten-point, accurate long casts.

00:01:52.989 --> 00:01:54.889
And you need to be good to catch these fish.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.740
But this fishery,

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.180
is as good

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.660
as any dry fly
fishery that I've seen anywhere in the planet.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.940
Nice.
