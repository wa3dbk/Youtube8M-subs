00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:03.750
&gt;&gt; Dracula: I am Dracula.

00:00:06.035 --> 00:00:11.710
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: A moment ago,
I stumbled upon

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.612
the most amazing phenomenon,

00:00:17.612 --> 00:00:22.833
something so incredible,

00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:29.647
I mistrust my own judgment, look.

&gt;&gt; Dracula: Dracula, the very

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:43.280
mention of the name brings in mind things
so evil, so fantastic, so degrading.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.466
You wonder if it isn't all a dream,
a nightmare.

00:00:46.466 --> 00:00:50.672
&gt;&gt; Speaker 4: Rats, rats, rats,

00:00:50.672 --> 00:00:56.990
thousands, millions of them.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.949
&gt;&gt; Dracula: But no,
this is no dream, this is Dracula.

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.493
The original, terrifying story of
a maniac, and a man who lived after death,

00:01:08.493 --> 00:01:13.252
lived on human blood,
took the form of a vampire bat, and

00:01:13.252 --> 00:01:18.610
lured innocent girls to a fate
truly worse than death.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.033
&gt;&gt; Speaker 5: Dracula,

00:01:22.033 --> 00:01:27.737
what's he done to

00:01:27.737 --> 00:01:34.210
you dear, tell me.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.463
&gt;&gt; Speaker 6: He came to me, he opened
a vein in his arm and he made me drink.

00:01:40.463 --> 00:01:41.650
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.060

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.086
I'm going to turn into a bat now.

00:02:05.086 --> 00:02:09.431
&gt;&gt; [SOUND]
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: Now.

00:02:09.431 --> 00:02:12.110
&gt;&gt; Dracula: Not, not working.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.340
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: I'm going to fly away
