00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.760
"Then you are the... 'FRIEND'!"

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.520
"If you don't have any..." 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:37.160
"There's such 'friend' around every one of us..." 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:19.920
I have found you a bad egg... Now, go and learn from him. 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.640
My dear grandson...

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:05.000
"Meanwhile... In another world..."

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.200
Yu Yu!

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.160
Hey! I'm telling the truth!

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.240
Keeping watch on you? Weird? Missed??

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.000
Hey stop!

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.440
That's weird... I felt as if someone keeping watch on me...

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:43.200
There's a reason why I could miss...

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.520
Aiya! You're lucky you have me here! No problem! I will help you!

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.000
Forget it.I think you should take the kick...

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.120
But...

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.200
Nah! He only looks good.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.000
The goal keeper looks good. You are ok?

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.840
Don't worry... I was faking!

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.280
You fell just now. Are you OK?

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.800
Sure, no problem!

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:06.840
No problem?

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.640
Chong Wei, do your best!

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.640
I will!

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.280
Hey! Good Luck!

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:04.280
Ok!

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.200
Hmph! I hate these people most!

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.360
"What if your 'friend' likes to show off?" 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.440
It won't get creased anyway! So there's no need to iron!

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.400
Look~ His uniform can hardly fit him. 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:40.400
Why?

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.280
You know why?

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:35.480
Actually Yu Yu's uniform doesn't need to be ironed. 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.320
*Eat Shit*

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:30.560
As a reward, let me tell you a joke...

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.760
Thank you very much!

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.800
Wah... 'Friend' who makes fun of me? That's annoying!

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:20.560
"Don't you have a 'friend' who likes to make fun of 
you?"

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:12.560
Xiao Ling~ Chong Wei definitely doesn't have a crush on you!

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.360
Thank you~ 
Don't worry, I won't tell Xiao Ling that you have a crush on her...

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.280
YOU!

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.480
Fine... If you don't, I will tell Xiao Ling you have a crush on her!

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:00.400
How dare you ask me for help?!

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:57.240
By the way...  I haven't finished my homework... 
Can you help me... please?

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:49.720
Cheer up...
 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.400
Hmph! No way, I don't have 'friends' like this! 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.320
"Don't you have 'friends' who blackmail you?"

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.280
AHHHHHH!!!! *Extremely frightened of cats*

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.000
Meow~

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.360
Actually... I have 2 tickets with me...

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.320
Yeah yeah~ Why did you ask so?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.400
Er... you said you like "Mayday" right?

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.000
Morning... Chong Wei...

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.440
Hi... Xiao Ling...

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.360
No! No one gives me trouble!

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.800
"Don't you have a "friend" who likes to cause trouble?"

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.400
Uh...

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.200
Where? Where?

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:03.520
Wah! UFO!

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.480
Wow... your cake looks good! 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.640
Morning! Chee Kao!

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.880
Hey! Yu Yu!

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.800
Ah... the last cake... I am so reluctant to eat this...  

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.800
'Friend' who takes advantage? NO! 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:45.440
"
Don't you have any 'friend' who takes advantage of 
you or bully you?" 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.800
"
Is this for real? I don't believe..." 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.440
Ha! (Smirk) I've no such 'friends'!

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.680
"Don't you have any 'friend' like this?" 

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:28.680
*Damn... Why is there's always such a friend around every one of us.*

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.680
 
Please! Do not include me. I'm special, not like all of you.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.880
Sigh... Someone is complaining on Facehook again.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.000
He mentioned every one of us?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.240
Wake Up Chee Kao! You√≠ll will be late for school !!
