[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.370
-Hey y'all.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.340
It's Bailey from
Brooklyn and Bailey.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:14.770
And as you can tell, I'm
trying out my new Texas accent.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.560
And today we also
decided that we

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.660
are going to show a nighttime
routine, because everybody's

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:21.870
been asking for them.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:24.240
And so we decided, hey why not.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.370
Let's do a nighttime
routine, so here we are.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.300
And it's just me today
showing the nighttime routine.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.170
So I think we'll start.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:35.020
For the first thing we do is
we always pull up our hair,

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.780
because when we wash
our face and stuff,

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.290
we don't want our hair
getting stuck to our face.

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.960
And usually people just
put it into a ponytail.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.570
But I learned that
pulling it into a braid,

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.150
and when you sleep on your
hair and it's in a braid,

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.890
it keeps it from being damaged.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.030
So I always pull my
hair into a braid

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.254
before I wash my face and stuff.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.760
And also, when you
sleep on it, it also

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.910
adds texture to your
hair, so when you wake up,

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:06.470
it'll be wavy or curly,
depending on your hairstyle.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.480
So, yeah.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.570
After we've got
our hair pulled up,

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.870
me and Brooklyn
usually wash our face

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:17.510
with the St. Ives
apricot scrub because I

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.420
know all teenagers have acne.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.340
So I use this.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.710
And it really helped
my face a lot.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.320
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.820
Hm.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.529
So as you can see, I've got
it all rubbed into my skin,

00:01:31.529 --> 00:01:33.820
and you're actually supposed
to let it sit for a while,

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.615
so I'm going to brush
my teeth while it sits.

00:01:45.004 --> 00:01:47.968
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:01:49.814 --> 00:01:51.480
And now I'm going to
wash the face scrub

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:55.512
off now that it's been
sitting for a while.

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:05.790
So after all of the face
scrub is washed off,

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.020
I have some acne medicine I have
to take because I'm a teenager,

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.710
and it's natural
to get blemishes.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:15.315
So I have some Tazorac and
a prescriptive medication

00:02:15.315 --> 00:02:18.750
that I put on my face
before I go to bed.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.240
And I also have a moisturizer
I have to put on before,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.430
because it does dry out my skin.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.930
And so, yes.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.468
Moisturizer.

00:02:27.468 --> 00:02:30.342
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.300
So after all of that face stuff,
we'll begin with our eyes.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.800
Now we have really bad eyesight,
so we do wear contacts.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.930
But they are not colored.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.240
They're just for our eyesight.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.720
So we do have bad eyesight,
so our parents have not

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.080
gotten us new glasses yet.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.060
So we're hoping for those.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.695
But when I take
my contacts out, I

00:02:59.695 --> 00:03:04.670
will act like I'm not very able
to see much, because I'm not.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:09.330
So we'll begin by
taking them out.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.334
And my case looks like a
glasses case, by the way.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:20.375
I'll dump out the old water--
I mean solution, actually.

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.562
Can you see that?

00:03:41.562 --> 00:03:43.546
Just reach in there and grab it.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:02.410
I can't see anything.

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:05.940
So we've grown out of our
old prescription for glasses,

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.430
so my parents really
need to take us in.

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.400
Actually, leave a
comment below telling

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.960
my mom she needs to take
us in for a new glasses

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.279
prescription, because I
can't see anything at all.

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:18.339
Anyways, that's our
video for today.

00:04:18.339 --> 00:04:19.769
I hope you guys enjoyed it.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.240
We will see you guys next week.

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.800
And wait!

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.300
