00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.690
You know, the only thing better than a good,
hot shower is a good, hot shower that's energy

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:11.690
efficient.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.469
Let me show you what we're doing here.

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:20.080
They say an eco-friendly house can't be built
in 150 days for $150,000, and I say it can.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.150
I'm Allen Smith, join me as I push the limits
with time, budget and creativity with the

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.859
Garden Home Challenge, exclusively on eHow
Home.

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:29.490
So guess what this is.

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.379
Yeah, I know it doesn't look like a hot water
heater, but it is.

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.870
It's not the conventional tank type, this
is tankless.

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.620
And the reason we have it is because it really
cuts down on the cost of energy.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.289
Remember, we're all about saving energy with
this house.

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:47.649
Now I've been familiar with these tankless
hot water heaters for some time -- I've used

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:48.649
them on several projects.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.460
But I first learned about them from some friends
in Europe.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.280
This is what they use -- this is the standard
in Europe because of the energy efficiency.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.640
The tankless, it doesn't really run, you know,
unless it's -- you call for the water.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.360
You know, there's not a -- it don't always
kick on and off, and always has to heat that

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.360
water.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.740
It only heats the water when you actually
turn the faucet on.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.330
What it does, it just basically doesn't run
when you're not home.

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:17.720
It's not always heating and cool -- you know,
water don't have to heat up and cool off -- heat

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:18.720
up, cool off.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.900
It just runs when you need it.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.951
You see, the good thing about having a hot
water heater that goes on vacation when you

00:01:24.951 --> 00:01:30.400
go on vacation is it's not charging anything
to your account while it's on vacation or

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.540
you're on vacation.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.560
Admittedly, you're gonna spend more money
on a tankless hot water heater, initially,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.060
but it will begin to pay for itself over time,
to the tune of about 25 to 30 percent a year

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.790
savings in what you would normally spend on
energy to heat the water that you use in your

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:48.790
home.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.920
It's a gas burning unit, so you have to -- you
can't -- it has to vent to the exterior.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.500
And what we're doing is we're coming out of
the side of the wall here, so you really won't

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.770
see it -- it really won't be a retina irritant.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.260
They make models that actually come out on
the exterior that vent directly out to the

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.420
atmosphere without the venting itself.

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.660
You know, electric heaters don't have a vent,
because they don't have any fuel to burn.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.790
They make them indoor or outdoor model on
these tankless heaters.

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:15.670
Either way, you're gonna have to have some
of the fundamental things that you're gonna

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.360
need for one of the conventional tank hot
water heaters: You're gonna need a source

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.810
of electricity to ignite the fuel to heat
the water.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:25.100
And then, of course, you're gonna have to
have a fuel source.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.419
We're using propane.

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:28.120
You can go with all electric if you like.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.050
