00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.840
So in this section I am going to continue
with showing you how to pick out snow boarding

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.010
outerwear. But showing you how to pick out
you snowboarding pants. Like I mentioned before

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.910
with the jackets. There is different styles
and different cuts depending in your personal

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.980
style preference. Some people like a little
bit slimmer fitting pant. Some people like

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.550
a baggier fitting pant. Regardless of what
you pick it is really important to make sure

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.460
that you can layer underneath the pant. Even
if they are slim fitting really tight pants

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.089
like a lot of people like to wear. You want
to make sure you can at least fit a pair of

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.780
thermals underneath them. Just so your a little
bit warmer. Because layering is really important

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.850
when staying warm when it does get cold out.
Similar to snowboarding jackets snowboarding

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:46.160
pants are rated on levels of waterproof and
breath ability this, the waterproofing is

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.809
based upon a scale that starts out from five
thousand and goes all the way up to thirty

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:56.980
thousand. What you don't want to do is pick
something that's too waterproof but not waterproof

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.460
enough. You want to find that?s right in the
middle. So for typical snowboarding you really

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.080
want to find something that is fifteen thousand,
twenty thousand even something that is twenty

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.120
five thousand. Something that is going to
keep you dry but not, if you don't need to

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.420
go and spend the necessary money that someone
would need if they were traveling to Alaska

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.140
and really, really harsh conditions. Because
usually when people are just starting out

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.990
snowboarding. They are not going to go when
it is really harsh conditions. They just want

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.560
to go when it is fun. And so they are not
going to need to spend that extra money to

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.740
get that extra waterproof. Because the fifteen
thousand to the twenty five thousand are going

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.470
to work just great. A long with that. There
is a level of breath ability for all the snowboarding

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.229
pants you really want to make sure the pants
breath well as well as keep water out. This

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.909
makes it so you can, your body can let the
moisture out when it needs to and your not

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.200
sweating inside your pants. Because eventually
that sweats going to get cold when it cools

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.980
down later in the day. You definitely don't
want to be keeping that inside just because

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.179
it, for uncomfortable and nobody has fun when
they are uncomfortable. And they are soaking

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:03.219
with sweat and there are not dry. Because
that is a big part of choosing your outerwear

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.119
is staying dry. That is why you wear outerwear.
So you really need to go and find something

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:13.550
that is breathable yet waterproof. And something
that is comfortable and fits your personal

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.680
style preference. There is tons of different
brands out. Tons of different styles. You

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.490
really want to find something that you like
personally. So just go to the shop and see

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:24.990
what they have if they don't have it at that
shop go to a different shop. Different shops

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.540
carry different brands they have different
stuff. So what you want to do is find something

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.600
that you like. That has all the functions
on it. All the snowboarding pants that are

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.450
usually sold in a snowboarding shop will usually
have all the necessary functions. So go out

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:43.140
and pick something you really like and then
take that new outerwear and bring it up to

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.010
the hill and you will be able to go and have
a really good tome with it and not have worry

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.380
about getting wet. And that is how is how
you go through and pick out your snowboarding

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.260
pants and the rest of your outerwear.
