Hi, I'm Kelli Ronci, and I'm a stylist for Pottery Barn Kids.

00:00:13.689 --> 00:00:16.689
Today, I'm going to show you how to make some of the numbered eggs

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:22.689
that we made for our Easter egg hunt, and some of the 
personalized eggs that we made for our Easter party.

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:29.689
Here's what you'll need: some paper towels, hard-boiled eggs, 
numbered and decorative stickers,

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.689
a regular white crayon, an egg dipper or a spoon, 
and some egg dye.

00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:40.689
All of these items can be found at your local grocery and craft store.

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:47.689
For the first step, you want to take your hard-boiled egg, 
and apply the numbered sticker to one side.

00:00:47.689 --> 00:00:54.689
Make sure that you press the edges down firmly, 
so that no dye will leak in.

00:00:54.689 --> 00:01:01.689
Then I'm going to put some star stickers on, 
placing them all around just to add a little decoration.

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:07.689
For our personalized eggs, we applied some flower stickers,
and to write the name,

00:01:07.689 --> 00:01:12.689
you want to take your wax crayon, and just write it 
on there, 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:20.689
and now you can dip your egg into your dye, 
and dip it three times.

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:26.689
And where you wrote the name with the wax crayon 
you can see is now revealed.

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:31.689
Then you're going to want to dry your egg 
off with a paper towel, right away,

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:38.689
just pat it gently, and it's a good idea to take 
your stickers off right away,

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.689
so that the stickers don't get too stuck on there.

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.689
and you can see the pretty flower shape that's revealed 
underneath the sticker.

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.689
And the trick to achieving these pretty 
pastel colors that we have here

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.689
is to start off with a diluted dye bath, and make 
sure that you dip your egg only three times like I did,

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:00.689
and then pat it dry right away with your paper towel.

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:04.689
This is a great craft to do with your kids, ahead of time,

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:09.689
and they're going to have so much fun finding these 
the day of the Easter egg hunt.
