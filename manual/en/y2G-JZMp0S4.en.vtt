00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.500
Once upon a time

00:00:01.093 --> 00:00:03.033
In a kingdom not so far far away

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.100
Okay...did you watch Tangled?

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:07.300
Yeah... we all sorta know the story of Rapunzel somewhere

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.260
One day, a prince found her, fell in love with her golden hair...

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.000
...And they lived happily ever ever ever after.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:12.900
Or that was how the story was told.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.900
(wind sound)

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:21.660
In the painful reality, keeping the hair that long would not be a good idea...

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.400
Eww...

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:24.160
But worry not Rapunzel

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.560
you are not the only one who face with hair problems everyday.

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.760
1 global research shows that women spend around 15 minutes per day to damage their hair

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.260
Combing, ionizing, dying, styling...

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:46.040
And how did they deal with that?

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.440
instead of trying to restore and protect them

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.020
Using hair conditioner properly, for example Dove hair conditioner,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.320
is one simple way to  resurrect the hair to its original state

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:56.960
But what keep them away from this method? 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.280
there’re many reasons behind it

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.300
it could come from their rooted habits

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.440
their prejudice

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.120
their knowledge 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.340
their lack of self-care

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.560
or even something like this...

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:08.440
Oh, Snow White...

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.120
Saying that just to point out,

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.420
we perceive that Dove hair conditioners it not a popular name on the market right now,

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.700
and that is where we come up the idea for our campaign

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.840
First, we will create a team of professionals hair stylists and hair care experts

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.960
The team’s leader will be one influential celebrity 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.460
1 month prior to major national holidays of women 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.420
such as the Third of March or The Twentith of October

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.360
The crew will secretly go to Baber shops and hair salons around HCM city

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.960
In each place they come, they will randomly select 2-3 guests

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.700
The guests will be carefully analyzed the current condition of their hair

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.600
Their hair would then be received a full treatment

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.440
And after realizing how good their hair can be, the guest will be given advises on how to keep it that way

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:41.820
The whole process is all free

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.000
In particular, after finishing the unexpected visit

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.960
the lucky guests as well as those who are present at that time 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.540
will have the celebrity revealed information about the "Big Event"

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.820
And if they want themselves or their friends, their relatives to enjoy the best hair care experiment with zero cost

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.260
they are welcome come to join and spread the words 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.200
We intend to make anothersub advertising-campaign running in parallel with The Crew

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.080
At some stores and large supermarkets in the city,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.540
after the customers buy a set of Dove products including Dove shampoo + conditioner

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.340
they will be given a photograph together with their relatives or friends right away

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.540
They will also be given picture frames as well as informed about the “Big Event”

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.360
and given a priority cards for that event

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.040
It will take place for three days

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.560
 And we call it the Hair Magic Show

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:20.620
Coming to this event of Dove

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.980
customers will be taken care of their hair and given free advice about hair care like what The Crew has done

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.080
Customers will also have a chance to access and learn more about Dove products, especially Dove conditioners

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.660
In addition to, there will be some mini games

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.260
a live show available for the customers to participate in and take home some Dove’s gifts.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.700
Our aim is to raise Dove popularity to its best in these couple of months

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.720
We bring the slogan “Real care for real beauty” to reality

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.420
and give out the best “care” experiments directly to the Vietnamese women

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.120
By doing that, we show out we have one of the best customer service ever

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.380
customers will perceive an overall good impression about the brand in a lenghthen duration

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.020
which may lead to a switch in their mind 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.340
and positive results in product development in the near future.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.460
Because our commitment is

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.680
We care about you in the most extraodinary way.
