00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:04.950
Here’s some of the stories trending This
Week at NASA!

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:10.400
Over twenty-two thousand Earth and space scientists,
educators, students and leaders from around

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.000
the world connected with each other and NASA
at the American Geophysical Union’s 46th

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.990
annual fall meeting in San Francisco.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.380
Among some of the new revelations …

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.610
NASA's Mars rover Curiosity has determined
the age of a rock on Mars, accomplishing a

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:31.970
fundamental and unprecedented measurement
that would have been considered unlikely when

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.820
the mobile laboratory landed last year.&nbsp;
Curiosity also made the first measurements

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.280
of the natural radiation environment of the
surface of Mars and determined it to be approximately

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.470
an average of 0.67 millisieverts per day.
For comparison, radiation exposure from a

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.320
typical chest X-ray is about 0.02 millisieverts.&nbsp;

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:59.420
NASA’s Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter or MRO
has detected additional liquid streaking down

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.610
mountain slopes near the planet’s equator
during the red planet’s seasonal changes.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.700
The Cassini space probe has photographed actual
seas and lakes on Saturn’s moon Titan. Although

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.280
these bodies are filled with liquid ethane
and methane rather than liquid water, they

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:23.280
do represent the only known stable lakes in
the solar system that are not on planet Earth.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.280
New images of the Juno spacecraft making it’s
closest ever flyby with Earth were revealed

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:34.470
this week as it sped away for a rendezvous
with Jupiter in July 2016.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.869
The NASA Glenn Research Center hosted a summit
on energy and manufacturing activities attended

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:43.780
by more than two hundred representatives from
regional colleges and industry. Case Western

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.340
Reserve University sponsored the event that
included dignitaries such as Congresswoman

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.360
Marcy Kaptur, Dr. Ernest Moniz, Secretary
of Energy and panelist member Dr. Rebecca

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.620
Spyke Keiser, NASA’s associate deputy administrator
for strategy and policy.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:04.990
Testing on the Project Morpheus planetary
lander is underway at Kennedy Space Center’s

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.239
repurposed Shuttle Landing Facility – which
has been outfitted with rocks, craters and

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.549
other hazards to automatically avoid. Using
“green” propellants, landers like Project

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:20.260
Morpheus and NASA’s Mighty Eagle could deliver
cargo to asteroids and other planetary surfaces

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.500
on future missions.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.180
&nbsp;
Landsat 8 is learning more about our planet,

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.549
including the coldest place on Earth.&nbsp; Using
data from NOAA and NASA satellites, the coldest

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:38.610
recorded spot… a tall ridge on the East
Antarctic Plateau at minus 133.6 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.779
would turn&nbsp;hot water - tossed into the air-
into shards of ice.

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:49.090
At NASA’s Wallops Flight Facility, Orbital
Sciences is preparing a resupply mission to

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.159
the International Space Station. The mission
will be the first launch of its commercial

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:58.730
cargo contract with NASA, and is scheduled
to launch in mid to late December to bring

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.799
more than two tons of food, experiments and
other supplies.

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.690
And that’s what’s up … This Week at
NASA.

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.909
