00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:07.667
The President:
Yesterday I laid out a plan
to cut $4 trillion from

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:09.400
our deficit.

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.934
It is a balanced plan that asks
for shared sacrifice in order to

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:17.200
provide shared opportunity
for all Americans.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:21.266
And I'm very pleased today
to have Erskine Bowles and

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:25.567
Alan Simpson, the chairs of
my fiscal commission, because,

00:00:25.567 --> 00:00:29.734
very frankly, it is the
framework that they developed

00:00:29.734 --> 00:00:34.967
that helps to shape my
thinking on these issues.

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:39.867
As they pointed out in
their bipartisan effort,

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:42.967
it is important that we put
everything on the table.

00:00:42.967 --> 00:00:46.400
We've got to take some tough
decisions when it comes to

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.133
domestic spending.

00:00:48.133 --> 00:00:52.066
We've got to look at everything,
including our security spending,

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:55.867
in order to achieve
the goal that we need.

00:00:55.867 --> 00:01:00.066
It's important that we look at
our tax code and find a way to

00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:06.700
work together to not only
simplify and make the tax system

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:14.300
fairer, but also that we use it
as a tool to help us achieve our

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.500
deficit targets.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.734
And it's also important -- and I
think these gentlemen share the

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:26.600
view -- that we can't exempt
anybody from these efforts;

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.233
that it's not appropriate for
us to ask for sacrifices from

00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:36.300
everybody except for the 2% of
Americans who are doing best,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.467
but rather we should ask
everybody to participate in this

00:01:39.467 --> 00:01:42.000
effort to get our
fiscal house in order.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.367
So my main purpose here today
is to once again thank them for

00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:50.333
their outstanding work, but more
importantly to solicit their

00:01:50.333 --> 00:01:52.767
ideas in terms of
how we move forward.

00:01:52.767 --> 00:01:59.000
No matter how we may
disagree between parties,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:05.066
no matter how much we spend
time debating the issues,

00:02:05.066 --> 00:02:07.867
at some point we're going to
have to come together as Americans.

00:02:07.867 --> 00:02:12.500
And yesterday, I brought
together the leaders of both

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.133
chambers, leaders
of both parties,

00:02:15.133 --> 00:02:19.734
to discuss with them how we
could start moving rapidly to

00:02:19.734 --> 00:02:22.000
get some of these
major issues resolved.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.500
And I'm pleased that Vice
President Biden is going to be

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.800
heading up that effort, but
we're going to need the help of

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:33.367
citizens who've served this
country in extraordinary ways in

00:02:33.367 --> 00:02:37.133
the past and are continuing
to do so in their spare time.

00:02:37.133 --> 00:02:40.533
I'm looking forward to having them
as partners in order to get this done.

00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:41.834
So thank you.
