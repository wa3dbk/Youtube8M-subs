00:00:01.001 --> 00:00:04.001
Can Barca afford to drop any more points?

00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:11.001
I’m not entirely sure, although I guess that it is true that we cannot really afford to drop many more points.

00:00:12.001 --> 00:00:18.001
From now on, we are trying to win every match. We are extremely close with Real Madrid who are very strong,

00:00:19.001 --> 00:00:23.001
and if we want to win La Liga it depends on us not giving away many points.

00:00:24.001 --> 00:00:26.001
Will El Clasico decide who wins the title?

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:34.001
There’s still some time before this match, and there are some big matches to play so anything can happen.

00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:42.001
A lot will depend on how we arrive at the Clasico, and the difference between us both, whether we’re on the same points or not.

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:48.001
And after this match, there are still more left, so we will have to wait and see. Every game is vital.

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:51.001
Are Barca suffering from having a small squad?

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:57.001
Considering that we have virtually the same squad who won everything last season,

00:00:58.001 --> 00:01:01.001
I think it would be untrue to say that our squad is too small.

00:01:02.001 --> 00:01:04.001
Dream signing?

00:01:05.001 --> 00:01:14.001
It’s not the moment to think about new players. We are not playing at our peak so we shouldn’t really think about new signings.

00:01:15.001 --> 00:01:21.001
Right now, it would be disrespectful to speak about new players who could potentially come to the team.

00:01:22.001 --> 00:01:27.001
We only need to think about us and the people who are here, trying to win all titles.

00:01:28.001 --> 00:01:32.001
At the end, when we finish, we can think about who may be coming or not.

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:35.001
How’s team spirit?

00:01:36.001 --> 00:01:41.001
The feeling in the squad is very good and we’re really motivated to win things.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:48.001
The result against Valencia really fortified us because we had gone into that game off the back of some poor results.

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:51.001
Would you prefer to play in Serie A or the Premier League?

00:01:52.001 --> 00:02:00.001
I have always said that I want to stay here. Right now it is the only thing that I think about and is the only thing that I want.

00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:08.001
I don’t know what can happen in the future, but my idea is to always be here.

00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:12.001
Which England and Italian player do you most admire?

00:02:13.001 --> 00:02:18.001
I think that Rooney in the English League is playing at a great level.

00:02:19.001 --> 00:02:28.001
He is a very important player in his team and in the England team. I think that his level is above any other player in England.

00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:36.001
In Serie A, I think Diego Milito is having a great season. He’s battling to be the top scorer,
and is scoring plenty of goals,

00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:41.001
and generally playing very well for Inter.  He is also standing out right now.

00:02:42.001 --> 00:02:44.001
Your thoughts on ex-teammates Ronaldinho and Eto’o in Serie A?

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:56.001
I see they are both doing very well. Milan were unlucky to come up against Manchester United and the amazing Rooney, who was very good in both matches.

00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:04.001
But now Milan are very close to Inter, are they’re fighting hard for the title.

00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:12.001
I think Ronaldinho is doing fine, and Samuel as well. It’s true that maybe he had some difficulties in adapting to Italian football,

00:03:13.001 --> 00:03:18.001
because it is very different from here. But Samuel is always an important player.

00:03:19.001 --> 00:03:21.001
Is there a player you would like to see playing in the Argentinean team?

00:03:22.001 --> 00:03:31.001
We’re very lucky because Argentina have many good players, and all of them play at a high level.

00:03:32.001 --> 00:03:40.001
I would like Gabriel Milito to be with me as he is my friend and I think he would be good for the Argentinean team.

00:03:41.001 --> 00:03:47.001
Though I am not the person who selects the players and I can’t decide.

00:03:48.001 --> 00:03:50.001
Describe the rivalry between Argentina and Brazil? How do you fancy your respective chances in the World Cup?

00:03:51.001 --> 00:03:58.001
Brazil are a big team and are always in with a chance of winning the World Cup.

00:03:59.001 --> 00:04:05.001
They have good players and will always be challenging.

00:04:06.001 --> 00:04:14.001
In spite of the fact that we had an uncomfortable time in qualifying, our recent matches against European opposition went well,

00:04:15.001 --> 00:04:22.001
and we will have time to work as a group and build on what we have done together until now.

00:04:23.001 --> 00:04:27.001
Which team would you prefer to avoid at the World Cup?

00:04:29.001 --> 00:04:34.001
I think that nowadays Spain are the team who are playing the best football.

00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:44.001
England are a good side too, but during the World Cup anything is possible, and you have to play and beat everyone in order to be the Champions.

00:04:45.001 --> 00:04:47.001
Your perfect Champions League final?

00:04:48.001 --> 00:04:55.001
I would like to be in the final. I am not interested in the opponent, only that Barca are in the final.

00:04:56.001 --> 00:05:00.001
What are the best goals you’ve scored?

00:05:01.001 --> 00:05:14.001
The goals I remember are the three goals against Real Madrid because the match was very important, and to score a hat-trick in the derby was great.

00:05:15.001 --> 00:05:25.001
The goal against Getafe, and the goal last season against Real, because it was a defining moment for us in La Liga that year.

00:05:26.001 --> 00:05:30.001
If you hadn’t won the FIFA Player of the Year award, who would you have nominated?

00:05:31.001 --> 00:05:37.001
If I hadn’t won, I would have given it to any player in our team.

00:05:38.001 --> 00:05:45.001
Before I received the prize, I said that Barca had achieved a perfect year, and therefore any of us would have deserved to win it.

00:05:46.001 --> 00:05:48.001
How do you cope with constantly being kicked? Are you scared of injuries?

00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:56.001
I see being kicked as part-and-parcel of football. I don’t worry about getting injured, I don’t believe I’m going to get injured.

00:05:57.001 --> 00:06:01.001
If I did that, then I wouldn’t be able to play in the same way.

00:06:02.001 --> 00:06:04.001
What makes Guardiola different from other coaches?

00:06:05.001 --> 00:06:14.001
Every coach has his way, his style.  And while I know Guardiola, I don’t know others.

00:06:15.001 --> 00:06:24.001
Guardiola is a person who understood the game extremely well when he was a player and now, from the touchline, he is doing equally well, or perhaps even better.

00:06:25.001 --> 00:06:31.001
His relationship with the players is very close, and as players, that is a really good thing to have.

00:06:32.001 --> 00:06:36.001
Aside from La Liga, what other football do you follow closely?

00:06:37.001 --> 00:06:50.001
I don’t really follow many other leagues or matches. Although I do like to see the big games in the Argentinean League, which I do keep track of.

00:06:51.001 --> 00:06:54.001
But I am not really a big fan of watching football.

00:06:55.001 --> 00:06:57.001
I am too busy to follow other matches

00:06:58.001 --> 00:07:02.001
You’ve already achieved so much. How far can Lionel Messi go?

00:07:03.001 --> 00:07:10.001
I hope to grow even more and to continue being as successful as before.

00:07:11.001 --> 00:07:19.001
Thank God, everything is going really well at the moment, and I hope to win more titles with my team, individually, and with Argentina.
