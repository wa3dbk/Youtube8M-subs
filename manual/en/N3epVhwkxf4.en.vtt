00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:06.589
Now I'll show you how to tie the fringe on
our reversible poncho. I've cut all the fringe

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:11.990
all the way around our reversible poncho.
And I've also put a few pins in just to hold

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:20.360
the two layers together. We'll be, I'll start
the tying at the, the front. It doesn't rally

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.380
matter where you start, but that's where I'm
starting. And we're going to be doing just

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.820
a simple square knot. Now, you want to have
a consistent knot all the way around. It will

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.949
have a nicer look. And to do a square knot,
I'm going to, you do a right over left, left

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:45.389
over right, or you can do a light over the
dark, a simple knot and then light over dark

00:00:45.389 --> 00:00:55.699
again. And pull that nice and tight. And just
go down, down the line doing the same thing.

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:13.170
Light over the dark, and light over the dark
again. Light over dark and light over dark.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.951
Okay, continue down the edge with a light
over the dark and light over the dark. It's

00:01:20.951 --> 00:01:28.579
good to get into a rhythm and pull them all
kind of evenly tight and continue down. Now

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:34.740
don't worry if it seems like it's starting
to bunch up a little bit because as you go,

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:41.180
you can give it a little tug and just stretch
it out a bit. Okay, and continue down the

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:47.420
line. You'll do this tying all the way around
your poncho. Let me show you the knotting

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:55.149
from a different angle. Here's the light and
the dark. Take the light, cross it over the

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:03.810
dark one and then go around the back and through.
Pull it tight and now again, take the light,

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:14.940
go over the dark, around through the back,
through the back and pull. You could see that

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:22.470
all of our knots line up very nicely and very
consistently. Let's do it again. Take the

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:30.720
light, cross over the dark, come around back
and pull tight. Now again with the light over

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.890
the dark, around the back, pull it through
and pull tight.
