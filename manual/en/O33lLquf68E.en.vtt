Hey guys, Sean Nalewanyj here of BodyTransformationTruth.com
and in this video I'm going to discuss leg

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.070
extensions, whether they're bad for your knees,
and whether they have any real use as a muscle

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.460
building exercise for your quads.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.890
So I don't know of any muscle building exercise
out there that gets more blatant hate than

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.590
the leg extension machine.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.710
It's typically said that they are useless
when it comes to building muscle, that they

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:38.510
they will destroy your knee joints, and that
they're a wimpy exercise that no hardcore

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.769
bodybuilder should ever include in their leg
training routine.

00:00:42.769 --> 00:00:44.770
But what is the real truth here?

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.720
Well, let's tackle the main questions.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.189
First off, are leg extensions useful when
it comes to building muscle?

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:57.140
Well, when it all comes down to it, any exercise
that you perform that allows you to place

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.450
consistent tension on the targeted muscle
and that allows for progressive increases

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.710
in resistance over time is going to result
in muscular hypertrophy.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.330
The leg extension allows you to accomplish
both of these things, and so yes, it certainly

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.540
will add size to your quads overtime if you
include it in your routine.

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.970
Sure, leg extensions are an isolation exercise,
but so are bicep curls and tricep extensions,

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.610
leg curls and calf raises.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.330
Nobody seems to have a problem with the idea
that those exercises are effective for building

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.210
muscle, so I'm not sure why the leg extension
tends to be viewed differently.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.840
Now let me make a few things clear here before
I go any further.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.430
First of all, there's absolutely no question
that the foundation of effective quad training

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:46.500
lies in heavy compound exercises such as squats,
leg presses and lunges.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.760
Obviously you should never be performing leg
extensions as a primary quad exercise in your

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:56.180
routine or in place of any of these basic
bread and butter lifts.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.650
If you are going to include leg extensions
in your workout then they should always be

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.690
done at the very end of your workout after
all of your compound work is complete.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.330
And secondly, I'm not saying that you need
leg extensions your routine or even that you

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.680
should be performing them.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.989
In fact, in the majority of cases they won't
be necessary at all.

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:21.160
I'm not even saying that leg extensions are
a particularly good exercise or that they're

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.980
going to contribute in a big way to your quad
training efforts.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.689
All I'm really trying to point out here is
the simple fact that they can be included

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:35.989
as part of your overall quad workout in specific
cases and that they're definitely not a useless

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:38.659
exercise like so many people try to say.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.760
So here are a few situations where including
leg extensions at the end of your quad workout

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.609
could make sense.

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:49.840
First off, maybe you want to include some
additional volume for your quads but your

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:55.969
lower back or just your body in general is
already worn out from your heavy compound

00:02:55.969 --> 00:02:56.969
lifts.

00:02:56.969 --> 00:03:01.989
Another situation, maybe you experience lower
back discomfort in general or you're recovering

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:07.430
from an injury and you need an isolation exercise
for your quads that doesn't place your lower

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:09.519
back at risk.

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.459
Third, maybe you're particularly posterior
chain dominant and your glutes and your hamstrings

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.760
tend to take on a high percentage of the work
during your compound leg exercises.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:27.530
Another situation, maybe you want to perform
some higher rep work for your quads but you

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.400
find that your cardiovascular system becomes
the limiting factor when you perform compound

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.620
quad exercises in the 12 or 15 rep range.

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:41.870
So these are just a few situations where leg
extensions could be a useful addition to your

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:43.319
training plan.

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.999
So now on to the second major question, are
leg extensions bad for your knees?

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:54.260
Well although most people will give a quick
black and white yes or no answer to this question,

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:59.430
the real answer is that it depends on your
individual body structure and it depends on

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.329
how you perform them.

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:07.170
For some people, regardless of how they approach
the leg extension machine, they're always

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:10.409
going to experience knee discomfort no matter
what.

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:17.510
I think it's pretty obvious that in this particular
case, this exercise should be completely avoided.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:24.250
However, if you are able to perform leg extensions
without any pain then they'll probably be

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:30.229
fine as long as you perform every rep using
a slow and controlled cadence, so you should

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.050
never be exploding out of the bottom position,
and you want to make sure that you perform

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:39.889
every rep under complete control without using
any momentum.

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:43.470
You want to make sure that you're using moderate
weights for higher reps, so stick to a bare

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:49.310
minimum of 8 reps per set, and an even higher
rep range of somewhere between 10 and 15 will

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:51.310
probably be even better.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.970
You want to make sure that you progress very
slowly, so don't make any major leaps in the

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.780
amount of weight that you use from week to
week, and you want to focus on very gradually

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.970
increasing the resistance over a longer period
of time.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:08.030
And finally you want to adjust the settings
on the machine to what feels most comfortable

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.030
to you.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.740
Everybody's body structure is different, so
make sure to adjust the back pad and the seat

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:17.840
to an angle that minimizes the pressure on
your knees.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.060
If you follow all of these steps and you use
some basic common sense, then you shouldn't

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.150
run into any problems when performing leg
extensions in your quad workout.

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.319
You can also optionally cycle on and off of
them just to be even more on the safe side.

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:37.419
For example you can do 6 to 12 weeks on followed
by 6 to 12 weeks off.

00:05:37.419 --> 00:05:43.370
So the purpose of this video is not to encourage
you to perform leg extensions in your workout

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:49.099
or to claim that they are a necessary part
of an effective quad training workout.

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:54.430
Rather, all I'm trying to point out here is,
number one, they're definitely not a useless

00:05:54.430 --> 00:06:00.340
exercise and they will allow you to add size
to our quads over time if you perform them

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.340
properly.

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:05.930
In most cases, the people who claim that leg
extensions don't build muscle on the quads

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:12.490
are the very same people who happily perform
leg curls in order to build muscle on their

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:13.490
hamstrings.

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.000
And number two, leg extensions can be included
at the end of your quad workout if they don't

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.409
give you any discomfort, and if you have a
specific application for them such as the

00:06:22.409 --> 00:06:25.210
ones that I outlined previously in the video.

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:26.330
So thanks for watching this video.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.250
