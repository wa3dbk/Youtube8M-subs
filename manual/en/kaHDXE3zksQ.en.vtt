00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:06.959
is the new york fire department racist
out there facing a discredited they're

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:11.320
facing a federal discrimination trial
because i'm black firefighters are

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:15.590
allegedly at discriminated against and
treated horribly within the fire

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.490
department so um... there are several
things that uh... black firefighters are

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:21.410
alleging

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.270
another which can be true because i
watch rescue me and and rescue me they

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:26.289
got white

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:31.659
and black and latino firemen in new york
so and they get along great

00:00:31.659 --> 00:00:35.810
final a on ninety percent of the new
york fire department is white

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.570
just amazing ok nine ostracism makes
explain what the real promises a but is

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.550
some important details in a lawsuit

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.759
so there are alleging that uh...

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:49.180
black firefighters are referred to as
the n_ word

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:54.710
okay regularly also humble usually when
it comes to deciding who will do the

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.100
menial tasks

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.370
they ask who wants to be the and work
for tonight

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.560
right because if you knew menial tax
that's where you are at the invades will

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:07.109
call that person that word

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:10.260
even if they're white or whatever they
might be

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.920
in addition the guest list which
featured a black former new york mayor

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.840
david dinkins had been defaced to
include rap stars

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.479
right then and then uh... a number of
other things have been the face of

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.650
obvious racial overtones in summerside
overtones

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.740
flat-out racist by n_-word etcetera

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.989
and mister black firefighter uh... who
was tired of it and and he eventually

00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:34.310
brought us forward i one of the sea also
complain about his when he became

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:38.959
lieutenant but he became a ten at the
same time is up but his own a white

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:44.189
firefighter and the palace will start as
an acting lieutenant immediately there

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.999
at the white firefighter do that but not
him analyst goes on in ob gyn than out

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:51.479
he says he's bring this forward

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.500
uh... people are really happy with him
to begin with that said the combined

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.490
into this

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.990
toxic brew of not good feelings that the
fire department adhere et cetera but

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.280
does anybody really think he's making it
out

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.090
now i think you can make the case that
hey maybe that's his experience but is

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.120
on the experience of all blacks in the
new york fire department

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:14.020
and certainly not what all-white fire
white firefighters to new york by

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.619
prolonged shot right

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:19.609
i think he genuinely experience those
things that he said

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:23.989
serious in genuine problem and this sort
of dismissing addition address it right

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:27.509
and dressing at their friend you know
they're facing a federal lawsuit and you

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:30.289
know we'll see what happens and what the
outcome will be about but i think it is

00:02:30.289 --> 00:02:31.890
an important thing to investigate

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.059
and again it's another one of those
issues where

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:39.279
the population the united states things
that we don't have a race problem at all

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:43.689
when we do we do have a uh... situations
where racism does occur and on

00:02:43.689 --> 00:02:47.679
situations need to be investigated not
brushed off as if racism is not a

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:51.319
problem in the country donnie moore and
let me explained as to why there might

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:53.939
be this inherent conflict first place

00:02:53.939 --> 00:02:55.909
because mcveigh

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:59.089
african-americans make about twenty five
percent believe the new york city

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:02.789
latinos are near that percentage and
they make it but i a percentage of the

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:06.589
firefighting forces anderson ninety
percent are white now why does that

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:09.289
system perpetuate itself was because

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:12.839
uh... oftentimes every dancer
firefighter you become a firefighter or

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:16.949
your uncle was et cetera et cetera right
and if they were all white in the

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:20.529
beginning they continue to be white if
it that's how the job gets passed on it

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:23.209
happens a lot of professions that also
happened sir

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.620
in in the firefighting that field

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.880
now the promise blacks latinos go hey
wait a minute that's not fair us we had

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.870
to be a liberate through in some way
words whites think wait a minute your

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:38.389
teenage opera my sunday from like ah...
nephew and increases conflict

00:03:38.389 --> 00:03:41.020
so we've got to be able to address and
the smart

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.709
decent and fair way

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.619
without both sides go to war

00:03:45.619 --> 00:03:47.700
jet fighters hope uh...

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.689
until as the allegations get
investigated

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:53.349
that there isn't edits national dues

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:54.819
that there is enough time

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.839
the feeling of force in new york fire
department we have

00:03:57.839 --> 00:03:58.890
this feeling from

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:02.339
eleven of they were you know it was so
her off with that

00:04:02.339 --> 00:04:04.609
that there is enough

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:06.129
that's off limits because of what the

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.440
the inventor already you know this is
the first article and highlighting my

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.290
fathers or with a religious lesson i
thought i thought this is so that is not

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:18.430
so you know is critical and although i
think that the fire departments of india

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.639
has done anything wrong

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:24.349
those try that did that becomes a a bit
of a factor right but uh... you know it

00:04:24.349 --> 00:04:26.280
drives me crazy when people can't

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.380
like separate outpatients right so for
example

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:33.900
are we under semi and the firefighters
when they go for healthcare coverage

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.060
and a republican wafted you know in

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:40.050
qasar value our first responder and you
you have some sort of cancer who cares

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:43.570
that's phase of course they should have
that without maybe one of those same

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.740
guys is involved in a case where he's on
the wrong side

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.720
and the you know the discrimination
whatever might be or several of them

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.520
okay the does each day with a health
care but also doesn't mean that they've

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:54.840
never done anything wrong

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.830
right there not some angel it creatures
a cetera

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:01.370
they're human beings and so in the right
you backed them when they're wrong you

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:03.030
pointed out

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:04.550
if only because you're in this way
