00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.150
I've just travelled... I reckon, I've got
to have done thousands of kilometres on some

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.439
of Australia's roughest roads with this trailer.
6 metre plate-boat trailer.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:39.439
And I think the secret to it is good quality
springs. Now I had these springs custom-made

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:47.360
by EFS. And I've also got a shock absorber
per point on the spring. So per point on the

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.360
axle where each tyre is, there's a shock absorber.
Now they're a big bore, 16mm shaft, gas pressurized,

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.960
4-wheel drive, off-road shock absorber. Now
why wouldn't you put a shockie on the spring?

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.220
You wouldn't leave the shockies off your car,
would ya? Or your 4-wheel drive? No, you'd

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:12.220
be stupid. So why not put a set of shock absorbers
on your boat trailer, your car trailer? They

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:18.150
do it for caravans and camper trailers. Why
not the boat trailer? See this one over here,

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.850
it's copped an absolute flogging on the leading
edge. Now that doesn't actually damage the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:28.830
shock absorber, because they are double skinned.
So you can actually get the dints on the outside

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.500
and there is an inner tube where your piston
runs up and down in, so there's no problem

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.750
there. It can take a beating with the rocks
and a bit of rust on the outside, because

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:45.750
that's what it's gonna get with the salt water.
But look, here's the proof in this trailer.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.909
This is an aluminium trailer. It has steel
springs under it connected to aluminium hangers.

00:01:51.909 --> 00:01:58.430
I'm very impressed with this trailer. But
I put it all down to the EFS suspension. It

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.400
holds everything together. Keeps the wheels
spinnin'. And gets my boat here to Walsh's

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:11.420
Point, probably one of the most remote locations
that you ever want to bring a 6-metre plate

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:18.420
boat in Australia. You gotta be happy with
that.

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:23.489
EFS Enhanced 4WD Suspension.
