00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:04.040
Hi and a fun welcome to Steve's Kitchen
today's popcorn is all about color

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.450
its all about fruit we going to be making
rainbow popcorn

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.360
we're going to start off with a plain popcorn
with a beautiful color on it and then

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.460
add our flavoring to it come on let's get on
and make

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.940
our colored popcorn

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:22.400
Now youare going to want

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.910
a pan with a thick bottom and a lid on it
I'm going to put half a cup

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.160
oil vegetable oil into there a quarter of a cop of 
popping corn

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.710
and quarter of a cup of white sugar

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.960
now we need to introduce color into our
popcorn at this stage so take a gel

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.510
coloring

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.850
I've got a sky blue here just going to pop some
blue just two or three drops

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.960
probably a couple at the most and that's
the basis

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.680
now we're going to take that over to the stove and start to heat this up

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.130
now over on the stove we want to turn it
up onto a high heat

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:58.060
and then what you going to do is just
mix all these ingredients together

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.430
get the color to start to blend with the sugar
what I like to do is just sort of shake

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.480
the pan around

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.290
in a circular motion and just stir like
that now fortunately for us

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.110
our corn will start to pop at the same
sort of temperature that our caramel starts

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.720
to form

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.290
now as I shake it backwards and forwards we're
just looking for the first of the

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.960
kernels to start to pop

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.700
but do be careful because you're dealing
with hot sugars and watch out for splatters

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.720
now look there is the first

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.429
little popcorn popping so I know it's
going to kick off very shortly

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:32.240
lets get our lid on there now what I'm
going to do is just

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.190
continue to shake this backwards and forwards
because I don't want to the sugars to burn

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:39.310
now it does take a little bit of practice
you're trying to get as much of that

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.630
popcorn to pop without the sugars burning

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.880
sometimes it's a good idea to turn the heat
down just a little bit

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.209
I can smell the caramel starting to form look at
the color coming on the lid

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:53.020
now I think that's just about ready so
I'm going to take that off of there now

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.810
Now when that popping started to slow down a
bit we would bring it over to the side here

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.580
keep shaking it just for a moment then
we're just going to take the lid off

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.800
pour it  into our bowl now this is optional but a
little salt  in there just enhances the

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.119
flavor of the sugars

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.290
pop my lid  on and then we just lift it
up

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.190
give it a good shake

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.330
and there you have it there is our

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.000
colored popcorn looking absolutely
beautiful and tasting

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.210
just fantastic as it is but we're going to make
these

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.360
fruity flavored come back and I'll show
you how now will you look

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.930
at those beautiful popcorn now if you're
watching this in black and white of course

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:36.290
your watching fifty Shades of Grey
popcorn but we are watching in color

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.880
and look at this even as it is now we've
got this wonderful

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:43.690
rainbow popcorn and you can eat it just as
it is it's fantastic

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.870
but we're going to take it up a notch and
add flavor to the rainbows and make them

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.190
fantastic

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:52.280
so let me show you what we're going to do
we're just pop the rainbow out of the

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.190
way for the moment

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.090
I'm going to work with the yellow I'm going to take it and pop it in a little tupperware

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.980
and to get flavour into here it's very simple
we're just going to take a jello powder or

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.460
jelly powder like this

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.880
and what you want to do is add maybe a
couple of teaspoons just sprinkle it over

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:08.640
the top

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.160
now  this is passion fruit I'm going 
passion fruit with the yellow

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.900
pop your lid on the top and then we're just going to

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.100
give this shake a up again and because
it's just a little sticky

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.430
the flavor sticks all over there we can
put that back in the bowl

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.660
and you've got this wonderful

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:31.050
yellow passion fruit popcorn which
tastes let me just tell you

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.709
just fantastic

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.020
now we're just going to repeat this with
the other colors I've got blueberry for

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.550
the Blue I've got strawberries going on my
pink there

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.800

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.269

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:50.989
