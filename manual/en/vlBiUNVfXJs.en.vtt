00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.380
Hi, I'm Allen and welcome to Expert Village.
Today, I'm going to show you how to build

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:11.630
your very own personal computer. This part
right here is the memory module and there's

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:17.989
a lot of different memory modules depending
on the type of motherboard you pick up and

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:20.769
that's going to determine what type of memory
and how fast the memory the memory is, thing's

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.009
like that. So, that's going to be something
that your really going to have to look into.

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:27.760
But pretty much a lot of these modules, they
may look the same but the connectors on the

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.630
bottom are a little bit different when put
them in place and they have to obviously fit.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.300
When you do your research, obviously, there's
so many different types right now that they're

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.770
all like DDR but there's different speeds
and things like that so you want to make sure

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:45.380
that they're good. Also, you'll see different
numbers, it'll have a series of four numbers

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:50.172
that are called timing numbers and you'll
want to some basic research if you see a good

00:00:50.172 --> 00:00:53.770
price on some memory, some of it might be
slower even though it is the speed that your

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:59.420
system needs. So, just look that information
up and there's a lot of different brands,

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.930
I usually buy just different brands as long
as the timings and speeds are really good.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:11.579
I bought PNY and a couple of those brands
like Kingston and really have not had too

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:16.850
much trouble with it and those really, really
good brands but also the generic brands are

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.240
really, really good too. So, do a little research,
find about the brands, some of the other brands

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.490
out there, just research them, look what other
people say about them, I picked up a lot of

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.780
my memory from clubit.com and also newegg.com
really, really good options for your and it's

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.670
not hard to install, essential component but
not hard to install, only goes in one way

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:44.930
on these newer boards, just put it straight
in, click, click, it's in and pretty much

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:50.689
ready to go. I do recommend going with at
least a gigabyte, starting these days and

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:56.210
you can usually get one gigabyte chip relatively
cheap nowadays and a gigabyte will really

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.209
get you up and going, I'm running four gigabytes
in my system but I do a lot of video work,

00:02:00.209 --> 00:02:05.729
as you can see. And, that will really get
you going, if you want to some high end gaming

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.729
stuff maybe two gigs will be good for you
depending on what you spend. But that's definitely

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.960
something to look at, you want fast memory,
a lot of memory and that's just going to allow

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.920
you to expand. Make sure that your motherboard
does allow you to also expand the memory at

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.700
least four is definitely a good way to go.
You'll also see something like dual-channel

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:32.020
which almost all the boards offer and that's
just a way of bringing the memory slots together

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.420
so that if you're running two gigabytes, instead
of addressing them separately it addresses

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.810
it as one memory module and makes things a
little bit faster, that's pretty much all

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:46.760
that is. So memory, right here, go ahead check
it out, make sure you get the right one but

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.890
essential part of your computer's too.
