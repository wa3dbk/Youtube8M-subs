00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:07.400
Hi guys! New acrobatic video.
This time I'll show you the no-handed kip-up.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:21.400
To be able to do this you need the basic kip-up.
Here's the link to the video.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:40.400
The no-handed kip up is useful if you, for
example, are holding a weapon with your hands,
so instead of planting them on the ground

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.700
you keep them in front and execute the kip-up
with the weapon in front of you.
A staff, a nunchaku, anything.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:01:00.500
If you have no weapon, you are just bare-handed,
instead of putting your hands on the ground,
use them to push on your thighs,

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:09.500
it will help you during the movement.
Let's see the technique in details.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.200
Start seated on the ground with your legs straight.
You will need more power than in the regular kip-up.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:31.100
Slide back until only your head and
your upper back touch the ground.
Keep your buttocks up and your legs straight.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:42.800
Push the ground with your shoulders and the
legs with your hands. Arch and land on your toes,
just like in the normal kip-up.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:58.300
This is harder to do than the normal kip-up, as
then you had your hands supporting you,
other then your head and your shoulders.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.600
You could just push with them while firing the legs.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.100
Now the hands will still help the movement by
pushing hard on the thighs, helping the legs

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:23.500
firing up, but you'll have to do a
much bigger job with the back of your head.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:36.200
Push hard with your neck and your shoulders, trying
to make it almost equal to the one you had before
with your hands, although it will never be that much.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:10.500
So, as I said, the hands will still help the movement.
The more they push on your thighs, the faster your
legs will fire up, the easier the movement will get.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:25.100
Be careful though: because of the nature of the move,
doing many no-handed kip-ups in one day may cause you
to have some serious neck pain the following day.
