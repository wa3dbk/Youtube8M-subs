00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.080
In a previous video, we saw
that we could view 2/3 times 6

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.460
as whatever number is
2/3 of the way to 6

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.450
on the number line,
which we saw is 4.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.300
Or another way to think about
it is that 4 is 2/3 of 6.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.110
2/3 times 6 can be
viewed as-- well,

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.530
how many do I have
if I take 2/3 of 6?

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.110
Now, what we want to do now
is apply that same idea,

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:25.800
but to multiply not a
fraction times a whole number,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.220
but a fraction times a fraction.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:35.060
So let's say that we wanted
to take 3/4 and multiply it

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.290
by 1/2.

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.000
And we know, of
course, the order

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.460
that we multiply doesn't matter.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.330
This is the exact same
thing as 1/2 times 3/4.

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.730
So to imagine
where this gets us,

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.760
let's draw ourselves
a number line.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.250
And I'll do it pretty
large so that we

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.680
have some space to work in.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.590
So that's 0.

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.560
And then that is 1.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.940
And of course, our line
could keep on going.

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.210
And let's first imagine 3/4
times 1/2 as 3/4 of the way

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.850
to 1/2.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.840
So first let's plot
1/2 on our number line.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.380
Well, 1/2 is literally
halfway between 0 and 1.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.330
So that's 1/2 right over there.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.660
And how do we think about
3/4 of the way to 1/2?

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.320
Well, what we could do is think
about well, what's 1/4 of 1/2?

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:34.940
Well, we could divide this
part of the number line

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:36.150
into 4 equal sections.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.240
So that's 2 equal sections.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.422
Now that's 4 equal sections.

00:01:39.422 --> 00:01:41.630
And while we're at it, let's
divide all of the halves

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.690
into 4 equal sections.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.600
So let's divide all of the
halves into 4 equal sections.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:48.330
So that's 4 sections.

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.810
And now let's do this one.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.960
I'm trying my best to
draw them equal sections.

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:54.730
So I've taken each of
the halves and I've

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:57.030
made them into 4 equal sections.

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:04.504
So this point right
over here is 1/4 of 1/2.

00:02:04.504 --> 00:02:05.920
But that's not
what we care about.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.560
We want to get to 3/4 of 1/2.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:14.160
So we want to get
to 1, 2, 3/4 of 1/2.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:21.350
So this point right over here,
this is literally 3/4 times

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.840
1/2.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.360
And this is, of
course, 1/2 here.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:25.359
But what number is this?

00:02:27.604 --> 00:02:29.020
And let me do this
in a new color.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.500
We can now visualize
it on the number line.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.040
But what number
is this actually?

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.500
Well, a big clue is
that, well, before we

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.290
had the section
between 0 and 1 divided

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.550
into 2 equal sections when
we only had to plot 1/2.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.520
But then we took each of
those 2 equal sections

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.360
and then split them
into 4 more sections.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:51.480
By doing that, we
now essentially

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.890
have divided the section between
0 and 1 into 8 equal sections.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:57.280
So each of these
is actually 1/8.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.210
So this point right
over here is 1/8.

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:02.210
This is 2/8.

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:04.750
And then this is 3/8.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.660
And that's in line
with what we've

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.130
seen about multiplying
fractions before.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:23.230
This should be equal to
3 times 1 over 4 times 2,

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:25.010
which is equal to 3/8.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.790
And everything that
we're talking about,

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.850
so we don't get
confused, this is all

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:39.332
referring to this point right
over here on the number line.

00:03:39.332 --> 00:03:41.540
But what if we thought about
it the other way around?

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:46.910
What if we thought about it
as 1/2 of the way to 3/4?

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:51.650
So we could divide the space
between 0 and 1 into fourths.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:52.940
So let's do that.

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:58.370
So that is 1/4, 2/4, 3/4.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.250
So this right over
here is the number 3/4.

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:05.990
And we want to go half
of the way to 3/4.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:08.440
Well, what is half
of the way to 3/4?

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.810
Well, we split this section
into 2 equal sections.

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:14.050
So we could split
right over there.

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.870
And we want to go exactly
one of those sections.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.520
1/2 of 3/4 gets us, once
again, right over here

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.017
to this point-- 3/8.

00:04:26.017 --> 00:04:28.350
So either way you imagine it,
whether you're essentially

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:32.530
taking 3/4 of 1/2, or saying
I'm going to go 3/4 of the way

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:35.420
to 1/2, or you say I'm
going to go 1/2 of the way

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:39.520
to 3/4, either way, hopefully
it now makes conceptual sense.

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:41.770
You can visualize it, and
it makes numeric sense

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:45.090
that this is going
to be equal to 3/8.
