00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.510
The Ant-Man movie is AMAZING, but there were
lots of people that wondered why it focused

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.370
on a guy named Scott Lang, when it’s likely
that if you’ve ever heard of Ant-Man before

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.429
the movie, it’s been in reference to the
original, Hank Pym.

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.950
Heck, Hank was even Ant-Man during the flashbacks
in the movie!

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:19.670
Well don’t worry because your friendly neighborhood
ComicDrake is here to give you the 4-1-1!

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.290
When electronics expert Scott Lang couldn’t
support his family, he turned to a life of

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.019
crime and became a burglar which landed him
a nice, warm spot in jail.

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.359
Our protagonist ladies and gentlemen!

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.870
While in the slammer, Scott’s wife divorced
him, and he was let out early due to good

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.870
behavior.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.260
Around this time, Scott’s daughter, Cassie,
was diagnosed with a rare heart condition

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.790
and whose only chance of survival was to be
treated by Dr. Erica Sondheim, a surgeon who

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.750
specializes in laser surgery.

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.040
There’s only one problem though…

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.859
She’s being held captive in a factory.

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:54.460
With high tech security and plenty of guards,
Scott hatched a plan to sneak in.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.790
First, he broke into Hank Pym’s lab and
stole the Ant-Man suit.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.690
I mean it’s not like Hank was using it since,
at the time, he was assuming the role of Yellowjacket.

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.159
No… not that one.

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.740
That guy is actually this guy.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:09.960
Let me explain.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.689
Using the Ant-Man suit, Scott broke into the
factory only to discover that his daughter’s

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:17.390
would be surgeon was taken prisoner by its
owner, Darren Cross.

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.250
Okay so get this.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.670
Cross also has a rare heart condition which,
to overly simplify things, made him overuse

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.670
his heart.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.710
To combat this, he kidnapped Dr. Sondheim
(and a bunch of homeless people) so that she

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.110
can constantly replace his heart with that
of another homeless person every time that

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.310
he burns through one…

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.270
That is some straight-up James Bond level
villainy right there.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.290
Scott managed to save the day and get Cassie
the treatment that she needed, but guess who

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:41.550
shows up.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.479
Hank freaking Pym!

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.400
Apparently Hank was there the entire time
and decided not to do anything so that he

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.509
could see how Scott’s handled his suit.

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.860
When Scott tries to return it, Yellowjacket
basically just says “Nah bro, that’s yours

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:54.860
now.”

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.570
So now with Hank’s blessing, Scott was the
brand new Ant-Man and he super-heroed around

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:02.620
for a little bit and even joined multiple
teams such as the Fantastic Four and even

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.640
the Heroes For Hire, where he met and dated
Jessica Jones for a brief time after the team

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.970
disbanded, buuuuut they broke up when Scott
found out that she was pregnant with Luke

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.110
Cage’s baby.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.390
After losing custody of his daughter, Scott
joined the Avengers where he butted heads

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.360
with the hero Jack of Hearts, but they slowly
became friends.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:24.050
In fact, when Scott’s daughter gets kidnapped,
he and Jack of Hearts go save her with Jack

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.490
dying in the process.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.470
But, because comics, Scarlet Witch brings
Jack back to life as a zombie and sicks him

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.640
on the Avengers.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.920
When Scott attempts to talk to Jack, he explodes
and kills Scott.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.440
In the wake of her father’s death, Cassie
becomes the hero Stature, joins the Young

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.130
Avengers, and manages to bring her father
back to life a few years later.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.880
Well… the Young Avengers actually travel
back in time to the day that Scott died and

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.320
take him back back to the present day instead.

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.900
So Scott’s alive again mainly because Marvel
wanted him to be the star of the Ant-Man movie.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.790
Oh and Cassie almost immediately gets killed
by Dr. Doom.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.230
On the bright side though, Scott gets his
revenge when he joins the Future Foundation

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:02.310
and nearly kills Doom.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.230
Thankfully, they’re cool again since Dr.
Doom brought Cassie back to life during the

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.050
events of Axis.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.050
Good on you Doom.

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.050
Good on you.

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.310
Nowadays, Scott is running Ant-Man Security
Solutions, a private security firm which in

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.920
his own words is “Because I know a lot about
how to steal your stuff, I know a lot about

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:21.020
how to not let your stuff get stolen”.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.480
With his employees, the former villains Grizzly
and Machinesmith, they help get all the things

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.620
not stolen…

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:30.420
Except for Cassie who was kidnapped… again.

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:34.760
This time it’s by Augustine Cross, the son
of Darren Cross, the dude from Scott’s origin

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.760
story.

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.630
Oh, and he kidnapped Dr. Sondheim too.

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:42.300
So in a weird deja-vu turn of events, Augustine
wants Dr. Sondheim to transplant Cassie’s

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:46.630
heart into his father since the Pym Particles
in her blood will allow her heart to grow

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:49.670
and shrink as needed to fight his disease.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.820
...Okay….

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.740
Now Darren Cross is alive again and tries
to kill Scott, but the Pym Particles in his

00:03:55.740 --> 00:04:00.440
bloodstream causes him to shrink and shrink
and shrink and he eventually runs away with

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.440
his son.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.180
Thankfully, Dr. Sondheim was able to transplant
a new heart into Cassie during the fight,

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:10.740
but it was incompatible with her body so Scott
shrinks down and fights off white blood cells

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.110
since Cassie’s body thinks that the new
heart is a foreign invader.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.120
The day is saved!

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.220
Cassie is saved!

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.920
Scott pushes Cassie away emotionally so that
she can have a normal life, and as of this

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:24.030
recording, that is the current state of Scott
Lang’s life.

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:30.080
It is uh… confusing to say the least, but
I think I did a decent job...

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:33.480
If you want to learn more about Scott, then
I highly recommend reading the Marvel Now

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.940
run of Ant-Man, the 2012 run of Future Foundation,
and Avengers: The Children’s Crusade

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.320
But as always, now it’s time for a vote.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.440
If you want to see a video on Scott’s daughter
then click on Cassie, but if you want a video

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.980
on the guy that accidentally KILLED Scott
then, click on Jack of Hearts.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.250
