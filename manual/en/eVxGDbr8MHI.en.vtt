00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.766
- SO YOU'RE OBVIOUSLY
DOING VERY WELL.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.833
LIFE IS GOOD.

00:00:03.866 --> 00:00:06.200
AND YOU WERE--
GROWING UP, YOUR DAD--

00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:07.266
WE TALKED ABOUT THIS
BEFORE.

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.533
- OH, YEAH, HE WAS HERE,
I THINK,

00:00:08.566 --> 00:00:09.566
THE FIRST TIME I WAS HERE.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.133
- YEAH, I THINK SO.
YOUR DAD WAS ON "CHIPS."

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.266
HE WAS THE ACTOR ON "CHIPS"
THAT YOU WOULD RECOGNIZE

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.266
IF YOU SAW HIM.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.633
SO YOU GREW UP KIND OF IN THE
BUSINESS A LITTLE BIT, SO...

00:00:17.666 --> 00:00:18.766
- GREW UP IN THE BUSINESS.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.500
MY FATHER IS ROBERT PINE.

00:00:20.533 --> 00:00:21.500
HE WAS ON "CHIPS."

00:00:21.533 --> 00:00:22.600
HE PLAYED SERGEANT GETRAER.

00:00:22.633 --> 00:00:25.900
WE ARE KIND OF--
WE LOOK THE SAME.

00:00:25.933 --> 00:00:28.866
IT'S FRIGHTENING,
IN A GREAT WAY, DAD.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.133
I LOVE YOU.

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:32.166
WOW.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.400
OKAY.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:35.633
WELL, I'LL BE SEEING YOU LATER.

00:00:35.666 --> 00:00:36.900
- OKAY.

00:00:36.933 --> 00:00:38.600
- [laughs]

00:00:38.633 --> 00:00:41.666
- WELL, LET'S TALK
ABOUT THAT PICTURE.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.033
- OH, MAN.

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:47.166
- THERE'S NOTHING WRONG--
- I'M NOT--I DON'T KNOW WHAT--

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.433
IT'S--THE--UM...

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:54.400
- AT THE TIME, I'M SURE
THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO HAVE.

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:57.133
[laughter]

00:00:57.166 --> 00:01:01.966
- THE MULLET-ESQUE HAIRCUT OR
THE PIECE OF ANIMAL ON MY CHIN?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.300
- WHAT YEAR IS THAT?

00:01:05.333 --> 00:01:07.033
- 2010?

00:01:07.066 --> 00:01:08.033
NO, I'M JOKING.

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.866
THAT'S 1998 OR SOMETHING.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.000
- YEAH, IT'S THE '90s.

00:01:11.033 --> 00:01:12.833
WE SHOULD ALL GET A PASS
FOR THE '90s.

00:01:12.866 --> 00:01:17.166
THAT WAS A BAD--NO ONE WANTS
TO SEE THEMSELVES IN THE '90s.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.166
- NO.
[laughs]

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.766
YOU CAN TAKE
THE PICTURE DOWN NOW.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:22.766
I THINK WE--

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.966
- OH, NO, THAT STAYS UP
THE WHOLE SHOW.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I HAVE SOMETHING FOR YOU.
- OH, NO.

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:28.700
- I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU'VE THOUGHT OF THIS YET,

00:01:28.733 --> 00:01:31.033
BUT YOU SHOULD MARKET
THESE THINGS.

00:01:31.066 --> 00:01:36.066
THESE ARE CHRIS PINE FRESHENERS,
AND, UH...

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.966
SO...

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.733
CHRIS PINE IN YOUR CAR.

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:41.366
- YEAH, FANTASTIC.
- YEAH.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.833
- ALL RIGHT.

00:01:42.866 --> 00:01:45.433
IS IT--WOULD IT BE ODD AT ALL
TO HANG THESE IN MY CAR?

00:01:45.466 --> 00:01:46.533
- NOT AT ALL.
- NO.

00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:49.100
- I DON'T KNOW WHY YOU WOULDN'T
AUTOMATICALLY DO THAT.

00:01:49.133 --> 00:01:51.833
"JACK RYAN: SHADOW RECRUIT"
IS IN THEATERS THIS FRIDAY.

00:01:51.866 --> 00:01:52.900

00:01:52.933 --> 00:01:54.600
IT'S REALLY,
REALLY FUN TO WATCH.

00:01:54.633 --> 00:01:56.666
IT'S ACTION-PACKED,

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.666
WE'LL BE BACK AFTER THIS.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.066
AND WHY DON'T YOU HAND
SOME OF THESE OUT

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.133
