00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.680
OK, we're gonna show you
how to tie what

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.159
I've always called the fishermen's Knot
but, I think the real true name is the

00:00:13.159 --> 00:00:15.519
Palomar Knot. It's one of the strongest
knots in the world.

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.689
The beauty of it is, everything
is doubled on it.

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.539
The most important thing to do is
when you tie this knot

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.999
is your tagged end, which is the end
right here.

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:26.289
always leave plenty of extra line.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.740
Line is very inexpensive its
3 cents a yard

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:35.290
give yourself plenty of slack, plenty of line
to double the line

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.680
what you're gonna do is

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.900
push it through whatever you'e going to
tie onto. Today we're gonna use a swivel.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:41.500
whether it be a lure

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.240
a Fish hook, it don't matter

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.399
Slip it through

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.270
as you can see it's through two times

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:48.430
you're going to tie an over-hand knot

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:51.660
like your tying your shoe - OK

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.090
you can see what I've created here

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.250
it's an over-hand knot like tying
your shoe.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.940
this loop right here

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.010
that we made, that's where

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.979
the lure, the swivel, the hook or
whatever your tying needs to go
through that the complete knot

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.580
so... just put it through there

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.650
I'm going to pull this together slowly

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:11.860
I want you to

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.220
actually visualize how this is all doubled

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.960
as I slowly do this and
you're looking at it

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.720
you can see that everything's doubled there
So... the beauty of this knot is it can't slip

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:22.630
when you pull it tight

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.970
cuz it works toward itself to tighten

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:28.790
so, what I'm gonna do is pull it down
a little smaller

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.390
and one of the keys to tying any knot is
you really should wet this area when you

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:34.520
cinch it down

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:37.369
cuz this is Mono-Filament,
which is a form of plastic

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:38.740
can create heat

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.410
and burn and weaken the line.
So I'm gonna wet my fingers

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.750
I just gonna put a little bit of a

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:45.690
witness on it

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.400
then we're going to pull it together you
see how the whole thing will come together

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.810
and it's doubled - OK

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:52.960
and then that part

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.700
where I told you the Tag-end and

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.290
your gonna see it's extra long here
just get a pair of fingernail clippers

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.030
you can cut that where ever you're
comfortable on the length - OK

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.509
that whole knot is doubled and you can
really tie this really fast, I did it slow

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.670
naturally so you can see how
it's done, but you can tie it

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.479
very quickly. A lot of professional Bass
fisherman use that. I've used it Striper

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:20.990
fishing, Salmon fisihng. I don't care what

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:24.190
fishing you're doing, that is one THE BEST
knots there is.
