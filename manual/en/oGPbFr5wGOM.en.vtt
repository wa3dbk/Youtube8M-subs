00:00:07.341 --> 00:00:08.210
-All right, Rebecca.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:10.429
So today, we're going to
move on to breaststroke, OK.

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:10.928
-OK.

00:00:10.928 --> 00:00:13.567
-A stroke you're
pretty familiar with.

00:00:13.567 --> 00:00:16.604
Breaststroke, as you know,
is the only real short axis stroke.

00:00:17.104 --> 00:00:18.713
It's the one where
we're rotating

00:00:18.713 --> 00:00:21.631
our body along the
axis to our hip.

00:00:21.631 --> 00:00:24.239
And we're really elevating,
counting on a lot of motion

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:28.726
backward and then forward,
that you've been so good at.

00:00:28.726 --> 00:00:30.555
But there's two elements
of the breaststroke

00:00:30.555 --> 00:00:31.474
that are really vital.

00:00:31.474 --> 00:00:34.962
One is, 80% percent of the
power comes from the legs.

00:00:34.962 --> 00:00:37.430
So you have to develop
a strong kick in order

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:38.759
to be very good at breaststroke.

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:41.787
The other part of it, that a
lot of people forget about,

00:00:41.787 --> 00:00:44.805
is the importance what
happens after the kick.

00:00:44.805 --> 00:00:48.382
Where 80% of that propulsion is
providing a lot of the force,

00:00:48.382 --> 00:00:51.370
but you also have to
be in a very low drag

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:52.709
position moving forward.

00:00:52.709 --> 00:00:54.168
What we're going
to start out with,

00:00:54.168 --> 00:00:55.647
a few drills that
are going to help

00:00:55.647 --> 00:00:58.805
us to get into that
low drag position.

00:00:58.805 --> 00:01:01.213
It amazes me, because
most breaststrokers,

00:01:01.213 --> 00:01:05.151
when they take the-- when
they're ready for the strike

00:01:05.151 --> 00:01:07.889
phase, when they're ready to
move forward, instead of going

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:10.477
into a low drag position,
they go out here

00:01:10.477 --> 00:01:14.134
like Superman or Superwoman,
which is a very bad position.

00:01:14.134 --> 00:01:16.613
So whether they have power
in their legs or not,

00:01:16.613 --> 00:01:19.781
they're not going to go very
fast or very far forward.

00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:23.448
So what we first do to
try to get you to do,

00:01:23.448 --> 00:01:25.157
something that is
really important,

00:01:25.157 --> 00:01:27.046
to keep the head down as
you're moving forward,

00:01:27.046 --> 00:01:30.693
is to go into what they call
the hyper streamline position.

00:01:30.693 --> 00:01:33.671
Practicing getting the chin
down into the same position

00:01:33.671 --> 00:01:36.089
you're going to come off if
you did a free-style flip turn

00:01:36.089 --> 00:01:37.178
and came off the wall.

00:01:37.178 --> 00:01:39.537
You're hopefully not going
to be in this position,

00:01:39.537 --> 00:01:42.155
but rather, you're going to
be in this hyper streamlined,

00:01:42.155 --> 00:01:43.884
tightest position
you can get in.

00:01:43.884 --> 00:01:47.451
We're going to start with
a three kick down drill.

00:01:47.451 --> 00:01:49.030
That way, you get
underwater, and you

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:51.568
stay in that streamlined
position for three kicks.

00:01:51.568 --> 00:01:53.997
You come up, take
the small pull,

00:01:53.997 --> 00:01:56.005
get back down into
the streamline

00:01:56.005 --> 00:01:58.414
with the chin on your chest,
holding that position,

00:01:58.414 --> 00:02:01.911
seeing if you can glide as
far and as long as you can,

00:02:01.911 --> 00:02:03.590
holding a minimal drag position.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:04.260
OK?

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.789
So let's start with that.

00:02:07.647 --> 00:02:10.845
At our Race Club camps,
we use many unique drills

00:02:10.845 --> 00:02:13.553
to teach the fundamentals
of breaststroke.

00:02:13.553 --> 00:02:16.461
One of them is the two or
three kick underwater drill

00:02:16.461 --> 00:02:19.129
in the hyper
streamline position.

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:20.798
By hyper streamline,
I simply mean

00:02:20.798 --> 00:02:23.306
that it's the very
best anatomical shape

00:02:23.306 --> 00:02:26.015
that the human body
can get into in order

00:02:26.015 --> 00:02:28.313
to reduce frontal drag.

00:02:28.313 --> 00:02:30.431
Olympic gold medalist,
Rebecca Soni,

00:02:30.431 --> 00:02:32.220
shows us how we
should try to look.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.308
Not only as we enter the
water from a racing dive,

00:02:35.308 --> 00:02:37.996
or when coming off
a wall or return,

00:02:37.996 --> 00:02:40.345
but also as we move
forward in the strike

00:02:40.345 --> 00:02:42.633
phase of the breaststroke.

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:44.502
We may not be
going quite as fast

00:02:44.502 --> 00:02:47.510
in the breaststroke compared
to the dive or the turn,

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:51.537
but the physical laws
of drag still apply.

00:02:51.537 --> 00:02:53.156
As a master swimmer,
I can tell you

00:02:53.156 --> 00:02:56.224
how hard it is to get into
the streamline position.

00:02:56.224 --> 00:02:58.522
Rebecca makes it look easy.

00:02:58.522 --> 00:03:02.419
And yet, in order to swim
fast, we have to try.

00:03:02.419 --> 00:03:05.377
Regardless of our
age or flexibility,

00:03:05.377 --> 00:03:07.396
there are three
important things that we

00:03:07.396 --> 00:03:10.584
need to do to create a
good hyper streamline.

00:03:10.584 --> 00:03:15.880
One, tuck the chin down, so
it nearly touches her chest.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.158
Two, squeeze the elbows
as closely together

00:03:19.158 --> 00:03:21.826
with the arms placed
behind the head.

00:03:21.826 --> 00:03:24.284
And three, extend
the arms forward

00:03:24.284 --> 00:03:27.242
in the shoulder joint
as far as possible.

00:03:27.242 --> 00:03:28.691
Not only will these
maneuvers help

00:03:28.691 --> 00:03:30.560
streamline the front
end of our bodies,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.717
but they also help excavate
and tighten the abdominal area,

00:03:34.717 --> 00:03:39.314
making the entire body leaner
and faster in the water.

00:03:39.314 --> 00:03:40.912
Now in order to do
this job correctly,

00:03:40.912 --> 00:03:42.651
you should start
out with just two

00:03:42.651 --> 00:03:44.840
kicks underwater
instead of three.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.148
And remain underwater
for both kicks,

00:03:47.148 --> 00:03:50.916
beginning the first
stroke by aiming downhill.

00:03:50.916 --> 00:03:53.494
Allow a little bit of air to
trickle out through the nose.

00:03:53.494 --> 00:03:56.302
And by the time you've
completed the second kick,

00:03:56.302 --> 00:03:58.220
the air remaining in
your lungs will float you

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:01.029
back up to the surface.

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:03.857
You may not have the same
kicking power as Rebecca

00:04:03.857 --> 00:04:06.425
or world class
swimmer, Zach Hayden,

00:04:06.425 --> 00:04:09.423
but hyper streamlining the
front end of your breaststroke

00:04:09.423 --> 00:04:12.421
will definitely help
you swim faster.
