00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:09.450
The @One Online Teaching Certification Program:
Giving twenty first century educators practical

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:16.560
skills for online teaching success.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.699
We understand that the world has changed.

00:00:21.699 --> 00:00:27.720
And so have the skills needed to effectively
teach in a mobile, digital society.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:33.000
In the United States in 2008, one in four
students in higher education was enrolled

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.020
in at least one online class, a 17% increase
from the previous year.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.790
Community colleges are experiencing even more
growth in online learning, roughly 22% from

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.610
2007 to 2008.

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:54.739
Striking, the strong enrollment growths we
continue to see in our online classes contrast

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.780
sharply with overall higher education enrollments
which, in the same period, remained nearly

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.280
flat at a 2% growth.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:12.319
The 21st century instructional landscape has
dramatically shifted.

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:17.649
And @One understands that you are seeking
effective, relevant professional development

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:23.570
opportunities to ensure you are delivering
high quality online learning experiences for

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.570
your students.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:36.279
This is precisely why we at @One have crafted
a cost-effective, comprehensive, high quality,

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:41.990
flexible certification program for new or
experience online instructors.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:52.969
Our program is anchored in practicality, excellence
and student success.

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:59.049
As a graduate of the @One Online Teaching
Certification Program, you will be able to:

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.569
Demonstrate mastery of iNACOL's prestigious
and highly regarded

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:11.439
National Standards for Quality Online Teaching,
Demonstrate the ability to apply California

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:18.610
Distance Education policies and regulations
to online instruction.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:24.670
Design and facilitate student-centered learning
activities.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.620
Design, develop, and teach and an online class
with effective instructor-student and student-student

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:35.040
interaction.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:41.430
Demonstrate effective instructional use of
your Course Management System.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:49.879
And meet the needs of a diverse group of students.

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:53.709
As @One is funded through a grant from the
California Community College Chancellor's

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:57.239
office,
our primary audience is California community

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:58.890
college faculty.

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.760
However, we believe that our program is relevant
to a diverse group of educators and are excited

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:07.180
about partnering with a variety of institutional
levels.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.959
We welcome and encourage participation from
community colleges outside of California,

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.989
as well as faculty from four-year universities
and K-12.

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:22.099
And we're also excited about meeting the needs
of forward-thinking graduate students who

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:28.680
may be preparing for a teaching career.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.090
So what does our program look like?

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.599
Well, we've kept it simple and clear.

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:39.299
As a member of the online teaching certification
program, you will be required to successfully

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.579
complete the requirements for five core courses:

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:48.749
Introduction to Online Teaching and Learning
Designing an Accessible Online Course

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:54.609
Course Management Training
Building Online Community with Social Media

00:03:54.609 --> 00:03:59.040
and Designing Effective Online Assessments.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:05.060
After you complete the coursework, you will
transition into our online teaching practicum.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.840
In this phase of the program you will polish
your online teaching skills as you partner

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.939
with an @One Mentor Facilitator.

00:04:12.939 --> 00:04:19.009
The two of you will evaluate your very own
ePortfolio, a robust collection of digital

00:04:19.009 --> 00:04:24.660
artifacts that you will develop throughout
the completion of your required course work.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:30.200
The Teaching Practicum culminates with your
very own online presentation, in which you

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.240
showcase your work and demonstrate how it
reflects a mastery of the

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:41.380
iNACOL National Standards for Quality Online
Teaching.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:47.490
In support of your busy schedule, our entire
program may be completed virtually or in combination

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.220
with face-to-face institutes.

00:04:52.220 --> 00:05:00.919
Our courses are facilitated by experienced
and highly respected online educators.

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:07.090
And we offer our core certification courses
at least three times a year: in fall, spring,

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:11.990
and summer.

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:17.280
It is possible to complete the entire online
certification program in a year or less but

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.340
we encourage you to focus on learning effectively
and managing your course load in relation

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:28.500
to your own individual schedule.

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:33.520
If you're new to @One, this just may be the
very best part!

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.319
@One courses are very affordable.

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:42.380
In fact, the entire certification program
can be completed for as low as five hundred

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:51.139
dollars, depending on your institutional affiliation.
