00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.759
Overlords, magnificent

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:07.120
giant, flying, monsters.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.629
Harmless looking

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:10.269
they hold the secret

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:12.909
to one of the most powerful tools

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:19.909
in the Zerg arsenal. Let's float around, in the

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.519
Overlords originally evolved

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:26.589
from an ancient species

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.149
Gargantis Proximae

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:34.990
A race of semi intelligence space-faring
leviathans.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:37.410
They were assimilated by the swarm

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.630
for their heightened senses.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.340
Ability that since then, has been atrophied.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.770
They quickly adapted to serve
pathfinders and coordinators

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.250
during battle.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.520
Their advantageous flight makes them an
essential part of Zerg scouting

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.740
Especially in the early game.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.140
Even though it is unknown how

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.190
They provide the Zerg race with supply,

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.350
food, basically,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.030
which enables the production
capabilities that characterize the

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.030
Zerg race.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:21.700
They are capable of generating creep

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.460
This, however, requires them to be stationary.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.840
And as unimportant as that might seem

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:35.840
It's sometimes fatal.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:37.880
Evolved from the lair.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:43.870
The Pneumatized Carpace allow the overlords to move at almost twice their speed.

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.050
Ventral Sacs, once the Overlords develop them,

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.629
ground Zerg units

00:01:52.629 --> 00:01:54.049
can be picked up

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.020
and carried through space.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.500
If used has an offensive tool, their effects

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.260
can be devastating.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.720
This ability

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:09.219
permits lightning quick drops, in the middle of production facilities,

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:10.519
mineral lines,

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:17.519
siege lines... and much more.

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.469
What a marvelous sight!

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:22.699
All that's left

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:29.239
is to clean up, and repopulate.

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:30.969
Join us next chapter

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:35.049
when we continue learning and
understanding the World of Zerg
