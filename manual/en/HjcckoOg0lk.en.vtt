00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.330
Hi I'm Tricia, an organic gardener. I grow
organically

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.380
for a healthy and safe food supply. For
a clean and sustainable environment.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.790
For an enjoyable and rewarding
experience.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.230
Peppers are a fantastic crop to grow at
home,

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.900
there's literally a rainbow of colors
of peppers,

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.260
all different tastes and lots of
different shapes. Peppers are related to

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:25.550
tomatoes and they're grown very
similarly.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:28.779
Pepper plants are native to tropical
South America

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:33.399
and are actually a perennial in their
native land. They are usually classified

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.399
by shape.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:38.300
Bell, round, cherries, heart-shaped anchos,

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:44.719
long cayennes any of these shapes can be hot or sweet. Peppers are very frost sensitive

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.149
and they need a long season, so if you
want to start them from seed you need

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.239
to do it indoors

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:52.280
about six to eight weeks before the last
frost.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.370
For more information about taking care
of your seedlings

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:01.600
check out our video on Seedling Care.
Pepper plants like soil that's full of

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:02.690
organic matter,

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:08.150
moderately fertile, and evenly moist. Set
your transplants out about two to three

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.210
weeks after the last frost.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.790
when the soil is warm. Add a starter
fertilizer when you plant. You can also

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:17.320
add a calcium supplement like

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.450
Azomite to help prevent blossom end rot.
Dig the hole and bury the transplant an

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.830
inch deeper than it was in the pot or
tray.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.070
If you're planting in a bed like mine
plant them twelve to fourteen inches

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.070
apart, if you're planting in a long row
you can go about eighteen to twenty four inches apart.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:43.200
Peppers can be finicky about flowering,
if nighttime temperatures drop below sixty,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.550
or go above seventy-five that can cause
flower drop.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.850
Even moisture is important for fruit and
flower set too.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.850
Hot dry winds and dry soil can cause the
abortion of

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:59.660
immature fruit and prevent fruit set. To
keep the soil moisture even you can use

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.180
a reflective plastic mulch

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.609
or an organic mulch.

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:09.769
Like tomatoes you should stake or support
your pepper plants

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:13.180
because the fruit will get heavy and it will
tend to topple the plant.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.200
When the first flush of peppers sets on
the plant side dress some more fertilizer

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.239
Inspect your pepper plants for aphids.

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.530
Aphids can carry diseases that affect
peppers. If you find any

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:30.060
all you need to do is spray them off with
water. If they persist you can use an

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.190
insecticide that's labeled for aphids.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.530
This insecticidal soap by Safer is good
because it also doesn't hurt beneficial

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.220
insects.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.549
Peppers can be harvested at any size and
color.

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.090
peppers start one color such as green
white or lilac

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.870
and then ripen to another color like
red yellow or orange.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.420
Mature peppers will break right off the
bush but use some snips so that you don't

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.620
damage the bush.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.750
Taste and enjoy a rainbow of peppers
and grow organic for life!

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.750
 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.390
 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.890
