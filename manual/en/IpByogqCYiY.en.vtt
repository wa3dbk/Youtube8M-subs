00:00:03.167 --> 00:00:07.067
The places that I've been,
like I said, to get to this place...

00:00:07.067 --> 00:00:10.267
The real estate is really not
what you would call,

00:00:10.267 --> 00:00:13.533
you know, they probably
have an ocean view,

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:17.533
but to get there it takes 1001 steps.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.900
Immediately after the earthquake

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:23.433
MCC sent a lot
of structural engineers here

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:27.633
to inspect buildings for our partners.

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:30.967
You know, schools, hospitals,
churches, orphanages,

00:00:30.967 --> 00:00:34.600
and I was lucky to be part of
that team that came in March.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.133
MCC is reaching out to Haitian builders

00:00:37.133 --> 00:00:40.567
by teaching more earthquake-resistant
construction techniques

00:00:40.567 --> 00:00:43.433
through workshops and rebuilding projects.

00:00:43.433 --> 00:00:46.467
James Mwangi,
of Paso Robles, California,

00:00:46.467 --> 00:00:50.233
decided to return to Haiti for a year
after his short-term stay

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:52.800
inspecting buildings
in the wake of the earthquake.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.367
He is using his experience and
knowledge as a structural engineer

00:00:56.367 --> 00:00:59.267
and professor at
California Polytechnic University

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:03.000
to lead building-workshops
and advise and coordinate with masons

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.300
as they repair and rebuild Haitian homes.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:10.233
Look at how dangerous this thing is!

00:01:10.233 --> 00:01:12.567
This thing can come down at anytime.

00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:20.000
Even any day, evan a strong wind
could bring this building down now.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.767
Even not an earthquake.

00:01:21.767 --> 00:01:25.767
So this is normal here for these homes
we are going to look at

00:01:25.767 --> 00:01:28.500
because these are the disabled people.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.167
In the beginning they were already
marginalized economically,

00:01:32.167 --> 00:01:35.467
so they built in
the cheapest places, you know,

00:01:35.467 --> 00:01:37.300
which are very hard to get to.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.133
He needs to come in a cut this
when he removes the wall.

00:01:43.133 --> 00:01:47.167
Because that footing, he needs to put
a beam all the way at the bottom.

00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:48.433
Tell him that...

00:01:50.367 --> 00:01:52.400
If you drive around this country

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.833
or even if you Google a satellite map,

00:01:54.833 --> 00:01:57.400
what you're not going to see
is a lot of trees here.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.833
In North America we are used to -
I'm from California -

00:02:00.833 --> 00:02:03.567
so a lot of our homes in California,

00:02:03.567 --> 00:02:07.233
because of high seismicity,
we build them very light.

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:09.433
So we use wood construction

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:12.233
because that way
they are very light in earthquakes.

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:17.300
We are able to detail them,
anchor them down and...

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:20.300
they are structurally safe.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.567
Here this would be great
if they had timber.

00:02:24.567 --> 00:02:26.900
Unfortunately, they don't have lumber here,

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.467
they don't have trees here.

00:02:28.467 --> 00:02:30.033
What we are trying to encourage

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:32.600
is to use the same materials
that they have here,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.133
but make it better,

00:02:34.133 --> 00:02:35.733
make it better quality.

00:02:36.533 --> 00:02:39.867
In North America we have about
eight different types of cement

00:02:39.867 --> 00:02:41.967
that we use for different construction.

00:02:41.967 --> 00:02:44.433
There's type one,
type two, type three,

00:02:44.433 --> 00:02:50.300
and every one of these is basically blended,
so that it is for a particular purpose.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.933
In Haiti you get one type -
one type of cement for everything.

00:02:54.933 --> 00:02:57.533
We are trying not to import any material,

00:02:57.533 --> 00:03:00.333
but we are trying to use
everything that is available here

00:03:00.333 --> 00:03:02.333
and see if we can get a better product.

00:03:02.967 --> 00:03:06.567
James has trained over 150
engineers and masons

00:03:06.567 --> 00:03:09.267
in hazard-resistant construction
and building practices

00:03:09.267 --> 00:03:11.033
during week-long workshops,

00:03:11.033 --> 00:03:13.500
as well as participated
in a planning project

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.100
for a new Haitian school of engineering.

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.000
So when we talk in our workshop
and we say, look at this -

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.767
how can you build it better
so that you save lives,

00:03:21.767 --> 00:03:22.900
it hits home.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.900
These people know exactly
what you are talking about.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.000
What I heard them talking about
were the cracks in the walls of the house.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.500
Then they talked about the columns,
all of that.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.800
They talked about the amount to use,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.400
then about the cement
to lay down the bricks.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.900
Then they talked about the water
to mix the cement.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.467
Engineer James talked about
all that as well.

00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:44.733
And he gave us...

00:03:44.733 --> 00:03:46.633
Well, everything that was
said in the training

00:03:46.633 --> 00:03:48.133
we'll put into practice.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.967
They don't need a manual;
they can see it through their eyes.

00:03:51.967 --> 00:03:55.233
And that, I think,
is where MCC comes in.

00:03:55.233 --> 00:03:56.633
Because right now, you know,

00:03:56.633 --> 00:04:03.000
sometimes, like they say,
you can solve a problem during crisis.

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.567
And if you can do that--
there's a big problem here.

00:04:06.567 --> 00:04:09.100
Building codes, building standards,
building materials.

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.267
If you can solve that now
when everybody is aware of it

00:04:12.267 --> 00:04:14.100
and set a goal that, OK,

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.200
we can start a training program here
that is sustainable.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.000
I think that will go a long, long way

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.667
and I think MCC stand
a very good chance of doing that

00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:23.667
with what we are trying to do here.

00:04:24.333 --> 00:04:28.100
Ismael Printemps and his family
were forced to move to a tent camp

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.767
after their home was
badly damaged in the earthquake.

00:04:30.767 --> 00:04:33.633
MCC worked with
three partner organizations

00:04:33.633 --> 00:04:37.033
to help restore the homes
of families like the Printemps.

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.767
I was in the house
during the earthquake.

00:04:41.767 --> 00:04:44.233
The walls trembled
and one fell down.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.267
We didn't have support for 30 hours,

00:04:49.267 --> 00:04:51.867
and that's why
we had to go to the camp.

00:04:55.267 --> 00:04:56.833
Through James' workshops,

00:04:56.833 --> 00:05:00.300
masons were offered jobs
to rebuild or repair these homes.

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:04.333
This was a test project
to repair 30 homes in 30 days.

00:05:04.333 --> 00:05:05.800
In some of these homes

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.700
you have nine people
living in two or three bedrooms.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.767
Or not just bedrooms
but a two-room house

00:05:11.767 --> 00:05:14.633
you have six to eight, nine people.

00:05:14.633 --> 00:05:20.067
And in Haiti the way it works is such
that even if this house is repaired,

00:05:20.067 --> 00:05:22.733
it's not just that family
that's going to come from the camp.

00:05:22.733 --> 00:05:26.667
There is this extended family that,
if you have some shelter,

00:05:26.667 --> 00:05:30.467
all your relatives are going to come
and occupy that shelter.

00:05:30.467 --> 00:05:33.233
So by us repairing
even two rooms for one family,

00:05:33.233 --> 00:05:36.100
we might bring three
or four families out of the camps.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.033
So it's going to go a long, long way.

00:05:39.367 --> 00:05:42.900
Before the earthquake
we had jobs and were working.

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.167
Now, after the earthquake,
we don't have jobs,

00:05:46.167 --> 00:05:50.300
but we're still alive
and living together as a family.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:52.767
The best thing
MCC has done for us

00:05:52.767 --> 00:05:56.000
is to repair the house
so we can come back here.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.300
Earthquakes are going
to be here to stay.

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:03.300
Cyclones are going to be here to stay.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.300
We have seen,
by neglecting all this education,

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.167
having these contractors
do whatever they need to do,

00:06:09.167 --> 00:06:12.700
having the government not have
any control of building codes,

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.033
we have seen what will happen.

00:06:15.033 --> 00:06:16.433
It happened here.

00:06:17.333 --> 00:06:20.000
I mean, it's been
incredibly challenging for everyone.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.533
We're always conscious of that,
that we can only do what we can do,

00:06:25.533 --> 00:06:27.633
but we're trying to do that well.

00:06:27.633 --> 00:06:32.400
And we're trying to do that
in a way that respects our principles

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.067
and the wishes and principles
of our Haitian partners,

00:06:36.067 --> 00:06:39.667
who I'd like to think that it's
their voices and their vision

00:06:39.667 --> 00:06:41.300
that guide what we're doing here.

00:06:41.633 --> 00:06:44.800
Thank you for your generosity
in this difficult situation.

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.667
Ongoing work that will continue
into next year includes building of homes,

00:06:49.667 --> 00:06:51.400
support of small businesses,

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.267
short-term job creation,

00:06:53.267 --> 00:06:54.733
community development,

00:06:54.733 --> 00:06:58.867
and advocating for responsible
national and international intervention.

00:06:58.867 --> 00:07:02.600
We encourage all who have given
to MCC's earthquake response

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.600
to stay engaged in our efforts by checking
the MCC website or Facebook page.
