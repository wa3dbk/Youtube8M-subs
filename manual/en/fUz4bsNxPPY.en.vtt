Our tour of the Curry current school begins with
rotunda thomas jefferson's academical

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.070
village

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:16.840
jefferson built these pavilions so professors and students of all disciplines

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.859
would live and work together

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:20.070
encouraging collaboration

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:27.050
across disciplines and across generations of scholars, these collaborations are the heart of Curry and UVA

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.759
on his tombstone Jefferson skipped his presidency in favor of founding UVA 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:39.310
we try to live up to that same standard of excellence

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:45.750
during the fall activities fair students groups of every sort from a capella colored to crocheting to

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.170
