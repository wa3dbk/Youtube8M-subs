00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.370
Okay, in this clip we're going to be drawing
the neck and shoulders on our king. And he's

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:09.210
going to be wearing a regal robe. So what
we'll do is we'll start here, and we will

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:20.042
come down just like this, and draw his regal
robe. Now, one thing you're going to want

00:00:20.042 --> 00:00:28.370
to keep in mind is this guy is a king, so
everything about his robe is very neat. He's

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:40.399
definitely not wearing anything that is shabby.
He's more than likely wearing the fanciest

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:47.190
robe in the room, I would say. So, keep that
in mind while you're designing the neck and

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.550
the shoulders. Also keep in mind that eventually
we will be drawing a cloak on this king too,

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:01.989
so don't worry too much about drawing much
further past these two points right here.

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:06.910
Kind of get in here with your hand--we're
going to create sort of a ruffled look along

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.570
the edge of this little cloak here by getting
in here with our hand just like that. And

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:24.360
drawing sort of like a nice little ruffled
thing--ruffled pattern. He probably has some

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:35.180
sort of collar situation, so we'll kind of
come in here like that and do that. Add the

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:43.350
details as much as you can. There'll obviously
be plenty of room for more later, but add

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.850
them now while you think of them. And get
as creative as possible. In a way, this is

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:55.610
sort of a chance for you to become your own
little fashion designer. Be as creative as

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:22.599
you want. As creative and detailed as you
please.

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:33.030
This would very likely be the king's regal
robe, and I guess we'll touch up on that more

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:39.600
later and as we move along. But you kind of
see basically what we're going for. We're

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:47.310
basically drawing the upper portion of our
king's body here. And that looks pretty good.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.709
That's a good start. So, if you've got a good
start on your king's royal robes, feel free

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:59.519
to move on now at this point on to--yes, his
arms, I guess would be the next step. So if

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:04.140
you've got the beginning portion of his royal
robe down, move onto the next.
