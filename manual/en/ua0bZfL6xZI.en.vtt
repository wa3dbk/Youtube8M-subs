connection. And you can easily tilt it to
whatever angle whether it's for a passenger

or driver with this really fantastic mount.
And you can see the Fire Phone, secure in

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.060
this mount and I want to point out these are
smaller vents.These are not your full size

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.740
vents and you can still establish that connection
easily. That was from my car and whether you
