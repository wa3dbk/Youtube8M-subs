00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:39.220
This is what we call "Fate". . .

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:46.860
It's something we can't stop . . .

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:54.620
Will I ever experience . . .

00:00:54.980 --> 00:01:02.200
. . . a beautiful day like this again in my life?

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.520
On this exhausting path of life

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.680
You came to me like a beautiful gift

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:24.660
I will always wash and shine this love

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:33.820
So that it won't rust away

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.020
I promise you, when this moment passes by

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.140
And we see each other again on that day

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.140
I will throw everything away and stand beside you

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:06.920
So that we can walk the path that's left for us

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.260
Our meeting was short like a drunken affair

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.140
But you occupied my heart

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:23.600
Even if our love is unattainable, I won't regret it

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.720
Because nothing is forever

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.580
This is what we call "Fate". . .

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.000
It's something we can't stop . . .

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.620
I will always wash and shine this love

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:52.320
So that it won't rust away

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:10.220
On this exhausting path of life

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:17.280
You came to me like a beautiful gift

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.440
I will always wash and shine this love

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:33.580
So that it won't rust away

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:51.300
This is what we call "Destiny". . .

00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:03.840
It's something we can't stop . . .

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:21.140
Will I ever experience . . .

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:35.180
. . . a beautiful day like this again in my life?

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.760
(There are many things I want to say)

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.480
There are many things I want to say you !

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.260
(But you already know them)

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:55.820
So when we meet each other along the way on that day . . .

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:02.440
Please don't let me go again . . .

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.120
The love we couldn't have in this life . . .

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.880
The fate we couldn't have in this life . . .

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:22.940
when we meet each other along the way on that day . . .

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.860
Please don't let me go again . . .

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:38.060
Please don't let me go . . .

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:47.760
Again . . .
