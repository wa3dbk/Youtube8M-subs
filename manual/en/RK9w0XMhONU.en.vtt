00:00:01.139 --> 00:00:04.350
Early morning in Iten in central Kenya.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.499
The first athletes already started their journey.

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:12.409
They come here because of the twenty
four hundred meters altitude which is

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:17.619
good for training since the oxygen level is
low.

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.899
Iten has produced dozens of winners
of international competitions.

00:00:22.899 --> 00:00:27.259
Many are born in the region and even have built their houses here.

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:31.529
Like Wilson Kipsang who won this
year's London Marathon

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.979
and got a bronze medal on the Olympic marathon. 'Iten is a very nice place because

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:39.450
first of all it is an high altitude area and

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.300
we have so many athletes around. There are good roads and we can train very well.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.520
The visibility also is is very good.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:49.120
So I think Iten is very nice to train.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.129
On average there are two thousand runners in Iten.

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:54.860
On a population of four thousand.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.810
They originate from forty countries.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.830
But the majority are young Kenyans sharing
the same wish.

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.970
My biggest dream

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.790
is to be a great athlete

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.610
and to remain in the top most of the time.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.160
So I have to work hard and train

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:18.160
to at least get a good result.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.860
Hotel had to be built to accommodate
all the visitors.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.979
And there are training schools for the athletes.

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:30.620
And in the villagere there are shops
selling sports gear.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.800
Mostly we do sell to the local people.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.040
People who train in Iten. Most of them are

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.650
Kenyans.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.350
At the same time we do sell to

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.500
people coming from other countries.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.870
Athletes who have less to spend go to the
street markets.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.160
But the presence of the athletes has a downturn.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.810
The drivers of public transport vehicles
complain they can't move around anymore.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:11.149
We request the authorities at least

00:02:11.149 --> 00:02:13.709
to make the road wider,

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.149
maybe make a track.

00:02:15.149 --> 00:02:19.639
The city council is preparing designated
routes for the athletes.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:23.799
Because it fears that otherwise they
moved to other places.

00:02:23.799 --> 00:02:25.459
If all of a sudden they went.

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:27.290
Let me tell you.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.059
You wouldn't find anything here.

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:33.959
But overall the athletes are
considered as something good.

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:38.019
Also because several internationals
use their prize money to support the

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.459
community.

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.909
Here Wilson Kipsang invested in
the building of a sports academy.

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.739
If children get better education

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.849
and also if we can nurture the young talents at the school I think

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.709
it will be to the benefit of the community.' And with the continuing success of the.

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:56.680
athletes.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.970
It's likely that Iten will benefit for many years to come.
