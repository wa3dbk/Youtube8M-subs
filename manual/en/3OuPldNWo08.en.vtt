Hi! I’m Melanie McLeroy with Taurus Training
for Expert Village. Today we’re going to

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:10.990
talk about training golden retrievers. A few
minutes ago Bodie, the golden retriever, practically

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:15.259
dragged me across the parking lot getting
over to here to where we wanted to film. So

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:21.550
he needs to learn how to heel. Now, heel is
the position. Bodie, come here, it’s when

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:27.350
the dog’s right shoulder is even with your
left leg, you should use the heel position

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.600
when you walk, so you’re in control of the
walk rather than letting your dog drag you

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.850
or set their own agenda. If you haven’t
already, checkout the videos on leadership

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.499
and relationship before you keep working with
your golden retriever. Now, Mr. Bodie here,

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:47.789
come here kiddo, has on a no pull harness,
because he was such a puller. This harness

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.890
is not a traditional harness. It’s something
that will help him learn not to pull. There’s

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.920
a good explanation of it in a different video
here on Expert Village. So what I’m going

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:01.630
to do first of all since he’s leaning against
me, shove them away a little bit, giving him

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.920
the heel command, and then reward him a lot
as he stays in the heel. Bodie… heel…

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.460
I need to get his attention. Ah, there we
go. So I have a nice loose leash he starts

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.300
to get ahead. I just put a little pressure
on the harness and keep walking. He’s very

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:26.329
distracted, so I’m going to use food and
a whistle to try keep his attention, and if

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:33.560
he looks at, good. If he looks at me I’ll
give him a lot of reinforcement. Good… Bodie…

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.159
Now what you can do if your dog tends to lag
or the leash gets tight, break into a run.

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:47.130
That will kind of stimulate their chase instinct,
and you win in a fun way. Come on… good

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.850
boy… yes. Bodie likes to walk a little bit
faster. Come here kiddo, too, too, too, too,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:02:03.659
too… good. How good!. So I’m using my
voice, I’m using body and oops… good and

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:12.489
I’m speeding up and slowing down to teach
him to pay attention to me. …come on, good…

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:21.319
heel, good… sit, good. If this tool in this
technique doesn’t work for your golden retriever,

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.790
simply checkout one of the other breed videos
here on Expert Village for some other techniques

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.710
on teaching your golden retriever how to heel.
