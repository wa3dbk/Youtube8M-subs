00:00:00.105 --> 00:00:03.685
The picture this week has been drawn by four-year-old Shota.

00:00:13.465 --> 00:00:15.465
What do you think this picture is about?

00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:18.305
It's a boy who is playing at the pool.

00:00:18.305 --> 00:00:21.045
It's an Oompa-Loompa! Or a beetle.

00:00:21.245 --> 00:00:23.925
What could this be? A tad pole?

00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:28.685
That's the boy's friend. He is making waves in the pool.

00:00:28.685 --> 00:00:30.785
- An ant?    - This is an ant!

00:00:30.785 --> 00:00:34.125
This is a lake. You can swim buddy.

00:00:34.125 --> 00:00:36.925
I wonder what that is. A rock?

00:00:36.925 --> 00:00:38.485
This is curry rice!

00:00:38.485 --> 00:00:43.125
-I wonder if tadpoles eat curry rice.   - They do.

00:00:43.125 --> 00:00:44.850
It looks tasty.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.785
-This picture is too cryptic, could you draw it more clearly?  - Sure!

00:01:28.185 --> 00:01:31.525
Please explain the picture to us!

00:01:31.525 --> 00:01:37.805
Two boys have come to play in the pool.

00:01:37.805 --> 00:01:42.385
This here is the pool.

00:01:42.385 --> 00:01:47.245
This boy came to play together with his friend.

00:01:47.245 --> 00:01:50.085
Does this boy not want to play with him?

00:01:50.085 --> 00:01:52.020
No, he is happy.

00:01:52.025 --> 00:01:56.725
-This one here is still wearing his clothes and about to join  -"I am coming!"

00:01:56.725 --> 00:02:00.085
This one here, is that a swim ring?

00:02:00.085 --> 00:02:02.065
Yes, it is.

00:02:02.065 --> 00:02:06.445
There is a lot of stuff on his body...

00:02:06.445 --> 00:02:09.385
That's the print of his shirt.

00:02:09.385 --> 00:02:16.325
There are big rocks and a befriended beetle and ant are sitting there to chat.

00:02:16.705 --> 00:02:24.125
I created the setting of them both watching the ocean while talking.

00:02:24.125 --> 00:02:28.045
I looks like a penguin but its a tadpole.

00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:30.285
A tadpole that is eating curry rice.

00:02:30.285 --> 00:02:32.605
But this curry rice is blue!

00:02:32.845 --> 00:02:39.265
Important point here is the... what do you call it .... eye shadow.

00:02:39.265 --> 00:02:41.385
It is wearing yellow eye shadow.

00:02:41.385 --> 00:02:45.125
- Is it a girl?   - It doesn't have a gender.

00:02:45.218 --> 00:02:47.218
And this here is an ant.

00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:50.985
It would like to eat curry too.

00:02:50.985 --> 00:02:55.105
This here is a pond. I don't know why.

00:02:55.105 --> 00:02:59.345
-Where did the zigzag go?   - Here.

00:02:59.345 --> 00:03:04.205
It's splashing water.

00:03:08.345 --> 00:03:10.345
The answer is...

00:03:10.345 --> 00:03:14.505
This is a tadpole that has just left its egg.

00:03:14.505 --> 00:03:17.825
And an ant who has just hatched.

00:03:17.825 --> 00:03:20.085
That's so difficult.

00:03:20.085 --> 00:03:23.325
-These ones here are eggs.  - Yes they are.

00:03:23.325 --> 00:03:24.925
I was so wrong!

00:03:24.925 --> 00:03:30.725
I need to have an even purer heart in order to understand this picture.

00:03:33.285 --> 00:03:38.685
Wow, thats amazing. I did not guess that they were eggs.

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:41.665
Does this mean that, this one is cracked?!

00:03:41.665 --> 00:03:46.645
-You drew the crack on the stone.   -No, this is not a crack it's the footprint of the ant.

00:03:46.645 --> 00:03:50.465
-It came out really well.    - I am a bit disappointed.

00:03:50.625 --> 00:03:53.405
Wow! I am totally right!

00:03:53.405 --> 00:03:56.245
But the face looked like they were eating.

00:03:56.245 --> 00:03:58.825
The lake was wrong.

00:03:58.825 --> 00:04:00.525
I might be a genius.

00:04:00.525 --> 00:04:03.345
This is an ant. Well done me!

00:04:03.345 --> 00:04:06.065
Children's minds are beautiful.

00:04:10.425 --> 00:04:15.745
Mister Minaminami! Could you please analyse today's drawings?

00:04:15.745 --> 00:04:16.665
I got it.

00:04:16.665 --> 00:04:19.605
The painter of this pictures likes Chibi Maruko Chan?!

00:04:19.605 --> 00:04:23.865
The hair looks just like her. Maybe this person has kids already.

00:04:24.085 --> 00:04:29.145
This is not about the painter. The painter wants the kids to have a good time playing.

00:04:29.145 --> 00:04:30.545
A warm picture.

00:04:30.545 --> 00:04:37.705
This seems like it has a story. Its the ocean and ... for an unknown reason there is an ant and a beetle.

00:04:37.705 --> 00:04:39.705
Down here there is another ant.

00:04:39.705 --> 00:04:44.485
There is a yacht or a boat in the ocean.

00:04:44.525 --> 00:04:51.145
Are these crows or seagulls? Have they come for a picnic?

00:04:51.145 --> 00:04:53.005
They seem to be singing.

00:04:53.005 --> 00:04:56.905
I think this is an ant... or a ghost?

00:04:56.905 --> 00:04:59.965
The Jacket Potato Ghost.

00:04:59.965 --> 00:05:02.545
-This is a potato? - Yes it is.

00:05:03.205 --> 00:05:05.465
This is the head of the ghost.

00:05:05.465 --> 00:05:08.745
Is this supposed to be an ant?

00:05:08.785 --> 00:05:12.585
It also looks like a cricket. Maybe they are married.

00:05:12.705 --> 00:05:14.365
This is a catfish.

00:05:14.365 --> 00:05:16.033
They seem to be eating.

00:05:16.033 --> 00:05:20.545
They are both relaxed and are having fun.

00:05:20.545 --> 00:05:23.385
What was the overall theme of these four pictures?

00:05:23.385 --> 00:05:27.845
I guess it's the summer holidays.

00:05:31.945 --> 00:05:36.705
Today's theme is: Summer Holidays!

00:05:39.625 --> 00:05:43.465
Today's theme is: Summer Holidays!
