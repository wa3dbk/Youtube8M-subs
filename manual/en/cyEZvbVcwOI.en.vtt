Hi this is rprentki with the fifth tutorial video for EyeWire

00:00:04.293 --> 00:00:06.289
Here's another cube.

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:12.289
Once again, everything you select is going to be blue, instead of the red or green that we were giving you previously

00:00:13.276 --> 00:00:16.769
We might have to scroll up and down a few times to make sure we get everything in this one.

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:18.266
It's going to be a little bit tricky.

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:21.260
Alright, so they gave us a tiny little seed piece right here.

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.254
And we can see that in the 2D

00:00:24.254 --> 00:00:26.254
Let's get started

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.243
Okay, so that little checker board blinking pattern that you just saw

00:00:30.243 --> 00:00:36.243
That happens once in a while when it's trying to load the image, but hopefully it's not going to be a problem

00:00:49.206 --> 00:00:53.706
Alright, so it looks like I'm going to hit shift just to make sure that there's no line here

00:00:54.196 --> 00:00:56.196
So let's color that in.

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:14.157
This looks like it's a very long and thin branch that's going across the cube

00:01:14.157 --> 00:01:23.639
Something to remember is that almost always the piece you're going to be playing with is going to go across the cube.

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:24.138
Usually they don't end in the middle.

00:01:24.138 --> 00:01:31.124
And if they do end in the middle of the cube, it should have a nice rounded end and not something that's jagged looking.

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:35.116
If we take a look in the 3D, let me zoom in a little bit

00:01:35.116 --> 00:01:37.116
See how that's got a jagged edge right there?

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.105
It indicates that it's not done yet, it should not look like that.

00:01:41.105 --> 00:01:43.105
So lets keep going

00:01:52.083 --> 00:01:57.073
Okay, we just added a big piece I can see in the 3D

00:01:57.073 --> 00:02:00.073
Look at that, we're getting close to the edge

00:02:11.046 --> 00:02:16.036
And even after it hits the edge you want to continue and make sure you get all the little pieces

00:02:16.036 --> 00:02:20.029
because sometimes it can run along the edge of the cube for a little bit

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:22.029
and you can end up missing a lot of stuff

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.519
Okay, we're almost done now

00:02:31.007 --> 00:02:33.007
And there it is, it disappeared.

00:02:34.001 --> 00:02:36.001
Let's hit "Check my work"

00:02:37.994 --> 00:02:45.978
And, 97% correct, and it looks like just a tiny little piece that got mistakenly added and two little things that were missed.

00:02:45.978 --> 00:02:47.978
Well done
