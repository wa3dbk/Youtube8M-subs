00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.150
Hi guys today on Divas Can Cook we are making
some good old spicy, crunchy fried chicken!

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.620
I have been getting so many requests for a
good spicy fried chicken recipe.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:12.100
I thought y'all said y'all wanted some healthy
recipes?!

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:13.110
Mmm hmm (laugh)

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.380
Well you know I'm ya girl!

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.380
I gotcha!!

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.970
So let's get right on into it!

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.429
Alright so the first step we're gonna brine
this chicken.

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.800
You already know I love me a buttermilk brine
it's so good.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.689
Place that buttermilk into a large bowl.

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.189
I line my bowl with a brining bag.

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:30.460
Ok now we're going to add in some good ol
hot sauce.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.430
I'm using Franks because it's so doggone good
but you can use any kind that you want to

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.430
ok.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.850
And then we're gonna add in some onions, we're
going to throw in a little bit of garlic,

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.761
and you can also throw in some salt if you
want too, you know...add a little flavor for

00:00:41.761 --> 00:00:42.761
to it.

00:00:42.761 --> 00:00:45.110
But yeah go ahead and mix that up ok get it
well combined.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.680
Then we're going to take our little chicken
here, just one whole, cut up chicken fully

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.680
thawed out.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:51.710
We don't want to use the frozen kind.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.910
And just place it right into this brine just
like this right here.

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:55.910
Perfect!

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.180
Go ahead and push it down like that, dunk
it in there.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.070
Then we're gonna take this bag and wrap it
up.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.480
We want this chicken to be completely submerged
in this brine alright!

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.480
Perfect!

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.630
We're gonna brine it for 3 hours or so and
then when it's done, pour off that brine and

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.590
then shake off the excess brine from the chicken.

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.979
I didn't even rinse them off I just went ahead
and shook them really, really good and got

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.929
as much buttermilk off as possible.

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:17.549
Now it's time to move on to our spices!

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.290
I have a ton of different, yummy spices in here.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.280
Just gonna mix this all up until it is well
combined ok and then I'm gonna season up my

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.639
chicken generously with this spice mixture
front and back .

00:01:28.639 --> 00:01:29.819
Don't use all of it.

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:31.369
Maybe like half of it okay.

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:34.469
Front and back make sure you season it really
really good.

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:36.659
And really you can use any kind of spices
you want to use.

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:39.009
You can just go with the plain cajun spice
blend if you want to.

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.159
It really doesn't matter just make sure you
get it well seasoned like that.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.159
Yum!

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:44.159
Looks perfect!

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.999
Alright now I have some self-rising all-purpose
flour here.

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:48.159
Perfect for frying chicken!

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.659
I'm going to add the remaining spices into
the flour.

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.659
Stir it up.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.109
Ooooh do not breath in this flour.

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:58.609
Oh my gosh you guys, I accidentally had a
flour cloud come up and it went in my nose

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:59.609
and I was going crazy child!

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:01.979
It was burning so bad!

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.039
Stir it up just like this!

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.349
You wanna taste the flour and make sure that
flour is well seasoned.

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:09.700
If not add in more salt, pepper, whatevs just
make sure it tastes nice and salty and spicy

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.700
ok?

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:11.700
Perfect!

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.260
Now we have our brown paper bag here because
we're old school!

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.060
We're gonna dump our flour mixture into the
bag and throw our chicken in there just like

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.220
this right here.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.600
Yes that's what you do!

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.630
Then roll that bag up and then we can pretend
like our name is Ceilia Foote and we're gonna

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.590
shake this chicken up and we're gonna say
"This is so much fun!".

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:28.990
I love that movie, The Help!

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.070
Oh my gosh you guys when they are making chicken
that is my favorite scene in that  whole movie.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.070
Love that movie so much!

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.960
And here's some little cleavage action for
you guys.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:36.960
Heyyyy!

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:37.960
Go Monique girl!!!

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:42.410
Alright so now we're gonna open up the bag
and our chicken should be very  well-coated.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.670
Perfect!

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.710
I love this method because it does it all
in one little step.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:47.710
Love it!

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.090
Shake off that excess flour.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.090
We don't need it!

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.980
We don't need extra flour on our chicken,
we don't need that!

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.310
Shake it  off and place it on a baking pan.

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.790
And now it looks like this right here!

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.530
It's perfect but we are not done.

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:02.260
We want a nice, thick, crunchy coating sooooo... we're
gonna mix up some eggs here.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.890
Go ahead and whisk them with your fork really
good until they are uniform in color.

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:08.530
We don't want streaks or anything.

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.530
Nice yellow eggs.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.340
We're gonna throw in some water.

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.810
And then we're gonna throw in some hot sauce!

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:15.400
We want is spicy, spicy!

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.860
If you can't handle spicy chicken then this
is not for you honey because this chicken

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:19.870
got a lil heat on it!

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.130
Next we're gonna throw in a little bit of
garlic powder.

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:24.640
We're gonna mix this on up like this right
here.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.570
Alright now that is ready to go.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:31.290
We're gonna take our chicken, dip it into
this little hot sauce-egg mixture, turn it

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.070
around, shake off the excess and place it
right back into the bag with the flour.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.790
Go ahead and repeat this with all of the chicken
and then you know the drill honey go ahead

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:42.720
and wrap that bag right on up and shake, shake
shake!

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.840
We are almost done with this part.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:44.840
Yay!!

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.960
Even though I like doing this I was ready
to be done with it.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:47.960
Ok we're gonna check it out.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:49.930
Our chicken should be very well coated.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:50.930
Perfect!

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:52.100
We're gonna shake it off.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.980
Place it on our baking sheet.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.330
And now this chicken is ready for some oil.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:58.550
Go ahead and pour some oil into a deep skillet.

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:01.580
I'm using vegetable oil but you could use
some shortening, you could use some peanut

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.940
oil, whatever lifts ya skirt  go ahead and do it!

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.010
When that oil is nice and hot go ahead and
place your chicken in, just like this right

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:08.010
here.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.950
Now you don't want this oil to be splattering
and pop locking and dropping.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:14.680
If the oil is popping and smoking, it's too
hot, turn it down sister!

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.260
Ok we don't want it to be too hot now!

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.570
It just sound like nice soothing rain.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.680
Like this right here [sound of chicken frying
gently]

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:21.680
Gorgeous!

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.380
Alright when the chicken is ready go ahead
and take it out of the oil and place it on

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.340
a plate lined with paper towels.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.960
And then go ahead and fry up the net batch.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.290
Oh my gosh, keep an eye on it because I almost
burned this doggone chicken and you know honey,

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.820
"Minnie don't burn no chicken!"

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.850
And then while it's really hot, don't let
it cool off yet, sprinkle with some cajun

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:39.850
seasonings.

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:40.850
Any kind of cajun seasoning.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:41.850
This is optional.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.570
You don't have to do it, it's already hot
enough but you know, if you really like it

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.090
hot go ahead and put on some cajun seasoning
and you're pretty much done!

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:49.090
Yayyy!!

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:50.500
You did it!

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.600
And even though it had a lot of steps to it,
it was pretty easy.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.600
Pretty easy and straight forward.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.730
I use to be so scared to fry chicken you guys!

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:57.680
Oh my gosh, but you know, easy recipe.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.280
Go ahead and get you some hot sauce.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.930
I love this kind right here, yum!

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:04.430
And go ahead and douse it with some yummy
hot sauce!

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.150
Now this is definitely some hot n spicy fried
chicken.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.990

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.450
