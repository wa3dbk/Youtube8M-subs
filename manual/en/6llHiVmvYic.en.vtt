00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.137
 

00:00:01.137 --> 00:00:08.049
Since last month, the US software giant Microsoft was investigated by China´s regulator on August 4 in Beijing, Shanghai and other cities.

00:00:08.441 --> 00:00:13.746
Mercedes-Benz in Shanghai also faced a "monopoly" investigation.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:20.132
Car maker Chrysler and Audi have committed "monopolistic behavior" and will be punished soon.

00:00:20.514 --> 00:00:23.851
Why do the foreign companies in China consistently face problems?

00:00:24.147 --> 00:00:25.925
Let´s take a look.

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:34.185
China´s regulator raided a Mercedes-Benz office in Shanghai on August 4.

00:00:34.357 --> 00:00:37.884
Several senior officials have been questioned and many computers have been forcibly inspected.

00:00:38.011 --> 00:00:44.194
Sources reveal that the regulators directly investigated Mercedes-Benz´s car prices and its lowest price policy.

00:00:44.691 --> 00:00:52.874
On Aug. 3, Daimler announced that from Sept. 1, it would cut the cost of spare parts 15 percent for its Mercedes cars in China.

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:56.822
This is the second time since July the company made cuts after-sale maintenance price.

00:00:57.424 --> 00:01:01.124
Experts analyze that there were two possibilities for Mercedes-Bens being faced with sudden raids: 

00:01:01.267 --> 00:01:04.030
The regulators were not satisfied with the price cuts Mercedes-Benz made; 

00:01:04.288 --> 00:01:07.624
Mercedes-Benz has touched forbidden areas apart from "anti-monopoly."

00:01:08.112 --> 00:01:11.687
On Aug. 4, China´s State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) has been investigating Microsoft.

00:01:11.787 --> 00:01:15.530
SAIC warned Microsoft not to interfere in the investigation. On July 28, Microsoft faced sudden raid by regulators.

00:01:15.769 --> 00:01:25.147
SAIC said that they have carried out an anti-monopoly investigation into Vice President Mary Snapp and other Microsoft staff.

00:01:25.644 --> 00:01:40.241
Jason Ma, NTD Television guest economic commentator: "I don´t think anti-monopoly is to seek revenge against the US´s cyber espionage incident, because this action is not only aimed at Qualcomm and Microsoft, German car makers are also included.

00:01:40.341 --> 00:01:44.075
The Chinese regime also claimed they received complaints from some companies.

00:01:44.175 --> 00:01:50.939
China´s entire economic development is weak and foreign companies have relied on China´s market.

00:01:51.062 --> 00:01:56.977
Thus China takes advantage of its market to blackmail and attack the foreign companies.

00:01:57.235 --> 00:02:00.728
This is in order to support its domestic companies."

00:02:01.053 --> 00:02:07.538
Earlier, China´s regulator has investigated into US chip-maker Qualcomm´s "monopoly."

00:02:07.645 --> 00:02:11.022
Qualcomm was alleged of abusing its market position and gain illegal profits in China.

00:02:11.122 --> 00:02:13.130
Qualcomm could face a fine of over $1 billion.

00:02:13.593 --> 00:02:20.293
China´s authority confirmed that investigation into Chrysler in Shanghai and Audi in Hubei Province nearly complete.

00:02:20.465 --> 00:02:23.336
The two companies would face a fine soon.

00:02:23.702 --> 00:02:27.961
Jason Ma: "Tencent Holding Limited follows the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) closely.

00:02:28.337 --> 00:02:30.639
People can tell that Tencent is the monopoly of WeChat.

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.715
PetroChina, Sinopec, CNOOC, telecommunication companies, and banks certainly are monopolies.

00:02:37.815 --> 00:02:41.189
The foreign companies actually haven´t taken up a large percentage of the market in China.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:45.146
These companies lead the market with its advanced technology, establishing advantages.

00:02:45.246 --> 00:02:51.169
For example, customers need to purchase Qualcomm´s chip patent, this is recognized around the world.

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:58.504
However, the CCP wants to support its mobile phone industry, using this way to force Qualcomm to profit share."

00:02:58.891 --> 00:03:05.580
Frank Xie, Professor at University of South Carolina Aiken believes these foreign companies in China cannot be classified as monopolies.

00:03:05.838 --> 00:03:10.914
The CCP´s actions manifest that its internal struggle became very intensified.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:24.745
Frank Xie: "The CCP raided German companies at the same time as the US and other countries on different products and sectors in China, which obviously did not look like a purely economic or commercial action but rather a political action.

00:03:24.981 --> 00:03:30.531
In other words, the CCP internal struggle has intensified, it is possibly related to people in one faction who obtained benefits from joint-venture companies.

00:03:30.918 --> 00:03:40.177
It caused another faction to counter attack.

00:03:40.307 --> 00:03:45.877
It is a reflection of the CCP´s internal political struggle, but not a commercial or anti-monopolistic action."

00:03:46.254 --> 00:03:54.927
On August 4, the Chicago Tribune reported that a global food company OSI Group´s Shanghai plant reportedly sells expired meat.

00:03:55.027 --> 00:03:58.966
Chicago Tribune reminded its readers that "it´s tricky to do business in an authoritarian state."

00:03:59.493 --> 00:04:04.580
The report says that China "is an inherently unpredictable partner because there are no checks on power.

00:04:04.687 --> 00:04:11.151
The CCP controls all, from the food safety inspection system to the judiciary, fom news organizations to social media.

00:04:11.251 --> 00:04:18.485
So it´s difficult to anticipate how the government will act at any given moment, because political considerations can influence any situation."
