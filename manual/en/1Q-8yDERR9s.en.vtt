00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:14.600
Everything began so quickly

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.760
I thought that certain things could only be seen in movies

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.880
We thought we were the rulers of the world

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.160
To be able to defeat any illness and any epidemic

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.100
But nature, God, or whatever you wish

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.360
Has a nasty sense of humor

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.320
And so I lost everything

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.300
We lost everything

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.920
Our conscience

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.420
Our civilization

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.280
And to think I've never believed in society

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.700
And today, that we have come to this point

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.800
For the first time I realize the importance of certain ideals

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.060
I've lost everything, yes, but I do not want to lose her

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.920
Facing a future without certainties

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.060
The only thing I can do now is to go forward

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.220
I must go forward for her

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.040
I want to see her again, I need to find her

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.780
And, to do so, I must continue to endure

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.228
Again

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.740
Another day

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:22.940
SWAMP MOVIE PRESENTS

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.040
ANOTHER DAY

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.140
Episode 0

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.320
Oh my God!

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:57.140
Help!

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:00.840
Help!

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.640
(background radio): we are interrupting the broadcasts to transmit a urgent communication

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.020
We invite all citizen to leave the city

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.400
Because of a new, strange virus we're getting to something that seems a true civil uprising

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.440
The political and national powers have decided to put the cities affected in a state of quarantine

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.980
What's going on?

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.360
(background radio)

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:09.780
Shit!

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:17.260
No, no no!

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:26.680
Fuck!

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.040
No!

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:48.680
I cannot reach you, I'm blocked

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:10.720
I can't reach you, I'm blocked

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.920
Ok, but where are you?

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.740
No! They're everywhere!
