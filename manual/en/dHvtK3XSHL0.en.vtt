00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.540
hey youtubers is Charlie so huge news
deadline is reporting

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:08.559
did Benedict Cumberbatch is basically
going to be Doctor Strange

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:11.940
so here's what's going on with the movie
marvels doing a special announcement

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.030
tomorrow

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.980
out to Li do a video for it but are
likely going to announce what their

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.300
phase 3 film slate is as well as the
official casting a Doctor Strange

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.190
they're basically closing the deal like
he isn't officially Doctor Strange right

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:24.750
now

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.779
just in final talks originally was
believed that Joaquin Phoenix was going

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:30.939
to be the doctors trained within that
fell through

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:34.160
just in general if you're not really
familiar with Benedict Cumberbatch's

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.489
work or has more serious drama work

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:39.600
all you have to do is just watch
Sherlock series 3

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.340
it on Netflix so it's totally fine
should definitely check it out

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.469
if you're not sure I think you could
totally watchin tear shit up

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.950
is the dragon smile in Palo the Weimar
means this December

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.500
it really is funny to see how quickly he
blew up since he started doing sure like

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.620
a couple years ago

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.090
it really has been a pretty short time
span but I'm a huge fan his

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:01.350
I think it is amazing drama I think he's
really funny I think he can hit all the

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.980
bases

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.939
Doctor Strange isn't a big muscly
character like Captain America

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.929
her door so you need a very different
kind of actor and yes there is high

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:11.679
potential for Doctor Strange appearing

00:01:11.679 --> 00:01:15.779
in Avengers 3 he is part of the
eliminating the comic so hopefully

00:01:15.779 --> 00:01:18.819
they'll do some sort of alumina the
story line at some point to

00:01:18.819 --> 00:01:23.020
let me know how you feel about the idea
benicar bench becoming Doctor Strange

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.039
currently they're set to begin filming
early next year

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.740
so they had to find her actor really
fast they're also going to be airing new

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:30.919
footage from Avengers

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:34.590
a default run during agency SHIELD
originally they were gay DB the trailer

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.490
but then it leaked

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.659
what a drama but it is gonna rot morning
footage the right now here's where the

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.029
doctor strange movie is

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:44.479
they have a director Scott Derrickson
very awesome guy

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:47.840
the screenwriter is John Speights so
there is we have the director

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.689
they have the script that they want they
just needed the actor enter Benedict

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:52.409
Cumberbatch

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.849
he's won my fantasy picks early on but
it really was a fantasy

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:59.039
like he's actually doing a stage play
for a lot of next year so I think

00:01:59.039 --> 00:01:59.770
scheduling

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.189
was a big problem it was widely reported
last year

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:06.349
that Marvel really wanted to work with
Benedict car back to the opportunity

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:07.299
ever arose but

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.599
typically with an actor this popular
especially right now

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:14.579
just scheduling is a nightmare even
getting all the Avengers together for an

00:02:14.579 --> 00:02:16.110
Avengers movie is crazy

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.260
so hopefully we'll find out in the next
couple days whether or not Benedict

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:19.879
Cumberbatch

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.969
signed his name in blood on a marble
contract the interesting thing about

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:26.319
this big marble showcase tomorrow the
lot people think that they might start

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:28.700
doing their own events away from
comic-con

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.780
but their own industry event like Disney
does woody 23

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.170
like now they're making stars
announcements through d23 didn't bring

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:37.730
any Big Star Wars Episode seven step to
Comicon

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:40.670
because they didn't really need to take
they have their own big event to do that

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:41.209
at

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:44.859
so Marvel might start doing it
themselves to let me know the you like

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:48.219
that idea or not you marvel doing its
own big special event away from

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:48.959
comic-con

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.989
this just about Marvel stuff why yes
think about that here are my top 5

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.459
doctors strange stories

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:58.049
number five essential doctor strange
stories volume 1

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.650
this is the collected works at Stan Lee
and Steve Ditko is original run in the

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:02.290
character

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.950
the original origin story I think
regardless of what they do obviously

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:07.640
they're gonna have a Stanley cameo

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.719
I'm sure it'll be ridiculous as it
always is ridiculous and awesome

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:14.629
whenever they wrote this story though it
was like this early sixties benchmark

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:15.469
for weird

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:18.629
it was kinda like a guardians of the
galaxy the day like in the way the

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.489
guardians of the galaxy the movie

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:24.370
kinda turned the superhero genre on its
head that's kinda what Stanley did with

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.090
Doctor Strange back in the sixties

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.249
this story has a whole lot along
speechifying which doesn't really fit in

00:03:29.249 --> 00:03:31.480
a lot a modern superhero genre movies

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:35.319
but because it's likely that they'll get
better car badge and he excels a

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.170
dialogue

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:39.239
they might have some fun with that just
watching episode a sherlock

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.480
he speaks at the speed of light and it
sounds so good

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.329
number four tramps and torment is little
bit should be in because the rights

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:48.379
issues that have to change a little
because it involves

00:03:48.379 --> 00:03:51.790
Doctor Strange getting darker dunes
helped to rescue dooms mother from

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:52.749
Memphis though

00:03:52.749 --> 00:03:56.279
it was actually done by Hellboy is Mike
Mignola in a tree that is

00:03:56.279 --> 00:04:00.170
super high drama romance down at East
out cross with a dream you can only have

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:02.019
your really really stoned

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:05.519
but think about this premise Doctor
Strange Doctor Doom

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:09.700
go to hell that would make an amazing
movie obviously they could use Doctor

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:10.400
Doom because

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.120
box but they can we substitute someone
else like scarlett which

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.959
number three a separate reality most
people think that this is Frank

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:20.670
runners run he was the artist not the
writer though

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:24.030
I would totally put it up there with
Frankie bones run which came much later

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:27.200
but the story is this excellent blend of
a lot in the sense fiction aspects the

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.900
moral universe

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.610
in the fan is the elements like magic
which is basically with Doctor Strange

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:33.500
is bringing to the Marvel Universe

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.389
Scarlet Witch is kinda magic I'll be
interested to see how they explain that

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:41.490
and as the in humans too so Marmol has a
lot of work and bring magic to the movie

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.169
universe

00:04:42.169 --> 00:04:45.610
number two later bones this is part of
the great

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:49.240
nor Marvel Knights mini-series there
that invoke his really cool detective

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:49.770
story

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.980
all I sure like it said Doctor Strange
against or Mamou

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:56.669
to give it is like Doctor Strange
britain like a Sherlock Holmes story

00:04:56.669 --> 00:04:59.820
in number one both by Brian keep on

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.820
this is an amazing retelling the origin
story

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:06.360
like in a much more modern setting it's
all the love the problematic aspects the

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.930
magic didn't really fit

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.830
in but the Marvel Universe was doing at
the time it also does a great job a

00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:14.220
balancing a lot more the philosophical
aspects

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.090
overbuilding limitless power with crazy
magical battles another dimension so

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:18.610
it's like

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:22.180
is really trippy step that the Marvel
movie universe hasn't done yet

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:25.850
really the big issue with doctor strange
stories that set it apart from

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.690
Captain America or Iron Man or the other
Marvel movies is that he can just

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:33.110
punches problems away plus he's a really
dark character

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.840
does this balance up super darkness and
light insider them

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.020
so really the twenties is is that any
courage gets to be a Marvel hero

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.940
but he also gets to be really dark
marble hero much darker than any other

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.780
Marvel Super Heroes we've seen so far

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:51.220
place he gets to be absolutely insane
Doctor Strange is definitely crazy

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.180
character

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.160
their whole lot other big things that
they can talk about at that big event

00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:55.660
tomorrow

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.340
like a black panther movie as well as a
female Marvel movie and everyone wants

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:00.130
Captain Marvel

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.220
I think black widows another big
likelihood utterly be doing another

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:06.550
video based on whatever announcements
they make so be sure to subscribe to get

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:06.990
that

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.770
it will be seen new Avengers footage
after agents shields all do a video for

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:11.520
that too so

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:14.910
lotsa marvels that happening this week
it's gonna be really awesome I know they

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:17.150
haven't said a lot about guardians to in
a while

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:19.729
they were denounced the release date for
that movie and everyone's really

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:21.640
wondering who starred fathers gonna be

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.260
and yes he's gonna figure into that
movie currently best odds are on Adam

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:28.430
are like but that's a bit of a stretch
lately they've been a whole lotta rumors

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.710
about the Marvel Universe and how they
might split Avengers 3 into a couple

00:06:31.710 --> 00:06:32.350
movies

00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:36.150
and they might not even include the
regular Avengers it's likely that Marvel

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:39.710
will explain a lot of that tomorrow the
idea is that right now

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:43.170
with vendors the jumbotron they're going
to fracture the team in a gonna throw

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.050
the movie universe into chaos

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:48.670
so they won't be able to buy Banos until
they come back together

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:52.410
and it's gonna take many many more
movies so just in general I wouldn't

00:06:52.410 --> 00:06:54.960
plan on Infinity Gauntlet storyline

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:58.760
for a long time maybe even Avengers for
like beans for

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:03.090
way way off that we haven't even hit ps3
yet just the case you guys haven't seen

00:07:03.090 --> 00:07:04.050
it for the doing time

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:07.880
you can click here to watch The Avengers
2 trailer again so good

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:12.200
and you can click here for Mike top 5
guarding the Galaxy two stories that I

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:12.980
think they should do

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.830
thank you so much watching such a high
five and I will see you guys tomorrow
