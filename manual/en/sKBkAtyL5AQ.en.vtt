00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Welcome to Lobster's List for July 26th 2013.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.000
#1 DwarfCorp is both real-time strategy game and a comedic economy sim

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
that draws inspiration from games like Dwarf Fortress and Roller Coaster Tychoon.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Manage a company's expedition in establishing a colony and extracting resources from the land

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
while facing dangers such as goblins, mole men and the risk of unhappy dwarves going on strike.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
A hot air balloon on a time schedule exchanges goods back and forth between the dwarven homeland and the colony.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
If you achieve quotas such as mining enough gold for a period, your stock price rises.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Missing too many quotas can cause a gameover.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The developers want to release the game for PC first

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and if it reaches stretch goals it could be eventually ported to Mac and Linux.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000
You can pre-order the game, get your name in the credits and get beta access at a limited availabilty $8 tier.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Late backers can still pre-order the game at a $10 tier and $20 backers additionally

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
get access to a playable pre-alpha before the campaign has even ended plus a download of the soundtrack.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
I've been following this game through its Screenshot Saturday posts since June

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and according to the counter on my profile page this is the 600th project I've backed through Kickstarter.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.000
#2 CANDLE is a sidescrolling adventure game starring a character with a candle for a head.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Fire will be part of solving puzzles and the protagonist must be careful to avoid the flame being extinguished.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
The strong art style uses a handdrawn look combined with dynamic lighting.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.000
There are some $10 early-bird tiers with a $15 tier after that to pre-order the game for PC.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Its pitch video was very effective for being just 4 minutes in length.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.000
#3 Chroma Squad is a RPG about managing a televsion studio's production of a sentai series.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Sentai is a superhero show genre in Japan with North Americans being familar with the example of Power Rangers

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
that used imported sentai footage splice with new footage that had American actors.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Engage in strategic turn-based combat to create episodes and

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
manage behind-the-scenes aspects of the studio like marketing campaigns and hiring actors.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
It supports PC, Mac and Linux with a pre-order of the game available at a $15 tier.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
iOS, Android, Ouya and Playstation Network may also get support.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
This is from people that worked on the game Knights of Pen &amp; Paper.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.000
#4 Tom vs The Armies of Hell is a mix of a comedic adventure game and isometric shooter.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Play as an office worker who has had an arm replaced with a demonic one and must deal with his workplace having been relocated to a hostile dimension.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:48.000
He is also armed with a prototype weapon that can fire a variety of attacks with the Ratchet &amp; Clank series being one of this game's main inspirations.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Target platforms are PC and Mac with Linux and console versions as possibilities later.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Contributing $15 can get you a pre-order of the game.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000
#5 Balrum is a fantasy RPG with crafting and construction systems.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Players are able to build a house and run their own farm in a world facing the threat of an undead horde.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Non-player characters will visit your house to offer quests

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000
While entering combat the gameplay becomes turn-based, but when walking around the game it is in real-time.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
You can pre-order for PC, Mac and Linux at a $20 tier.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:31.000
This game looks to be well thought out and there are a lot of systems to read about on the project page like a wound system or the chance of forest fires.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Now onto honourable mentions.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.000
SPACE SHOCK is a RPG with turn-based combat and is using the Unreal engine.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:47.000
It is compared to first-person view dungeon crawlers like Legend of Grimrock, but with a sci-fi setting.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
There are five classes of characters planned and there will also be the option to play a version of the game

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
from a overhead view that makes it more like a tactics game.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Backers' forum access and a copy of the game for PC is at the £15 tier.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Graphically the game already looks great for a prototype,

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.000
but with a large goal of £150,000 it is going to need a lot of backers to cover that amount

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:17.000
Sojourn is a roguelike RPG project with a £5,000 goal and a playable demo to download.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:24.000
Portions of dungeons are procedurally generated for increased replay value while some important portions are pre-made.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
The developer also wants to implement strong modding support.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.000
£10 backers can pre-order the game for PC with beta access.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Spacecraft: Galaxies is a sandbox style space game for PC where you can heavily customize your ship's design as its main selling point.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
The universe is procedurally generated.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Ships are composed of parts like engines, fuel tanks and weapons.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:52.000
An interested part of its pitch video describes its blueprint system for people to share their creations.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000
Even more interesting is the application of parts that serve as switches with

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000
an example of a switch activating a laser aimed at the fuel tank to explode it.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000
A copy of the game is at the $10 tier.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Kingcraft for PC, Mac, Linux and potentially mobile devices is a real-time twist on what is traditionally a turn-based combat system.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000
It is influenced by Final Fantasy Tactics but uses a cooldown like system to make the battles more real-time.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:25.000
There is a playable demo out for both PC and Linux with a pre-order able to be made at a $10 tier.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Legends of Firestorm is an online browser-based hack and slash game

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000
with good use of soft colours in the visuals and strong looking combat.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000
Players can chain together combos with healer, DPS and tank character classes.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.000
It is using a Free2Play business model and a £13 contribution you can get 200 units of in-game currency and a chance to play the beta.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:56.000
The developers talk about how they wish to prevent Pay2Win situations and the reasons they decided to not implement an auction house.

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:08.000
Insignificant for PC, Mac and Linux is an open-world RPG with players experiencing what it is like to be a small two inch tall person in a backyard.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:16.000
The tin foil armor and using items like forks as weapons are good touches, but the normal size looking grass textures broke the immersion for me.

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.000
Pre-orders are $20 on this project.

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:29.000
Last Jungle In Sector 17 is an open-world 2D spaceshooter for PC and Mac with a $10 pre-order tier that includes your name in the credits.

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000
Players will have to defend space stations which can have defensive turrents placed on them.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:39.000
There is a demo which is linked to from the project page so you can feel what the combat is like.

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:47.000
This project has a relatively small $5,000 goal and if it reaches stretch goals then co-op and versus multiplayer modes will be added.

00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Thank you for watching and I hope this helps those projects.
