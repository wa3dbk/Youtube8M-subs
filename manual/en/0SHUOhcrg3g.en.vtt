00:01:41.716 --> 00:01:43.716
Welcome back with a new episode!

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.900
Today we prepared...

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.460
Christmas cocktail...

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.360
with Kiwi, Jasmine and Grenadine...

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.640
it's pretty strong, spicy and sweet at the same time.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.860
Spicy flavor comes from the Jasmine tea.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.940
And a little bit from Cinnamon as well.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.100
One wouldn't say that...

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.100
but the harmony of Kiwi and Jasmine...

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.320
is really perfect. 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.140
We also have a guest here...

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:15.940
so he can say how it tastes.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:17.800
Hey bro!

00:02:18.473 --> 00:02:20.473
I have to say it's simply great.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.020
It has a very strong, aromatic flavor.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.360
Keep it up guys and thanks for inviting me.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.800
So this is a goodbye for today...

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:33.020
and...

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.000
