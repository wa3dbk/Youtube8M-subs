00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.900
How to dress sardines.

00:00:06.914 --> 00:00:13.900
Caution! I am about to take the guts out and it will be bloody, if you are unfamiliar with it, please go about 1:32.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:20.800
This time, I will dress them in two different ways. The second method would be at around 3:16.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:27.700
First, cut the head off along the red line above. Put the knife underneath the side fin, and cut vertically straight down.

00:00:42.374 --> 00:00:49.300
Then cut the belly away. Try not to cut the guts if possible, because if you do so, it gets all messy.

00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:28.100
Then wash it with water. Take way the guts and make it clean.

00:01:32.553 --> 00:01:39.500
Sorry, it is difficult to see, but I am taking the meat apart from the spine by pushing the bones with my thumb nail.

00:01:54.295 --> 00:02:03.200
Then the other side.

00:02:12.535 --> 00:02:19.500
This way, many little bones follow the spine, so it's a little easier to take away the bones.

00:02:33.954 --> 00:02:40.900
Now skin it by pushing the skin with the thumb.

00:02:51.754 --> 00:02:58.700
Then skin the other side. This time, avoid the back fin's bone.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.500
The other method.

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.300
Just like the mackerel, cut the skin along the red lines above. 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:30.500
But this time, cut the surface of the belly till the bones (Do not cut through the bones).

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:34.600
We only want to cut the skin, but cut the neck to the spine (wide line above) to take meat apart later on.

00:04:21.995 --> 00:04:28.900
Now take the skin off just by pulling from the neck to the tail.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.900
Cut the meat to the spine. Carefully avoid cutting the guts when you cut the belly to the tail fin.

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:42.100
When you cut, knife makes clicking sound with bones like on the right figure.

00:05:04.215 --> 00:05:11.200
Cut the spine off the meat from the belly to the tail. And pull the meat apart from the tail to the neck.

00:05:26.334 --> 00:05:33.300
When you pull the meat, pull the meat apart by pushing the spines with your finger.

00:06:13.114 --> 00:06:37.100
If you make Sashimi (fresh fish) cut the meat by the size which is easy to eat. By fresh I mean about a day old, because sardines go bad so fast, and it is why Japanese write them "weak fish".
