The Sol Republic Master Tracks XC is a version
of the Master Tracks headphones that Sol Republic

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.490
claims was specially tuned by Scottish DJ
and music producer Calvin Harris. "I've never

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.539
heard a headphone where the vocal has been
so clear and precise." Of course, we want

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.570
to know if this headphone has a well tuned
sound, or just well tuned marketing. You’re

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.050
watching Lachlan Likes A Thing, and let’s
find out. 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.060
Hey everyone! Welcome to Lachlan

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.550
Likes A Thing, the show where I take a thing
and see whether or not I like it. Now the

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:37.160
thing we're looking at in this video is the
Master Tracks XC from Sol Republic. Now I

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.320
actually bought these headphones many many
months ago at JB Hi Fi for something like

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:50.940
$240. And I've been dragging my feet kind
of sitting on these before making a review

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.840
and the reason for that basically is because
I don't like the way these headphones sound.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:03.440
I don't think they sound good. But before
I unpack that statement, let's look at the

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.969
rest of the headphone, staring with the design.
In terms of design, I think the XC is an attractive

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:13.829
headphone, with a classy mauve and black colour
scheme, premium feeling materials and nice

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:18.280
attention to detail on things like the metal
finishing and the headband stitching. So the

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:24.619
Master Tracks XC like a lot of Sol Republic's
lineup is based around a particular headband

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:30.049
design. And the way it works is that you can
actually remove the earcups straight off the

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.030
headband, and the headbands are replaceable,
you can purchase them separately. In a number

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.729
of different colours, so you can customise
them for your headphone, which is kind of

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:45.729
cool. That said I think this particular headband
that comes with the Calvin Harris XC version

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:50.999
of this headphone cannot be purchased separately.
I haven't seen it in stores. Now the actual

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:56.329
headband itself is made out of some kind of
plastic polymer. So it's apparently extremely

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:04.179
durable, very resistant to kind of torsion
force and that kind of thing. It's an interesting

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:08.700
little design. Unfortunately the headband
design means that the cable comes out of both

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.080
earcups instead of a more convenient single
sided cable, and the headphone can’t be

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.030
folded up. The cables are detachable and replacements
seem pretty easy to find in retail for about

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.170
$30. The ear pads however, don’t seem replaceable
- which I think is a big issue since they

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.190
inevitably wear out over time. On the plus
side, the ear pads are plush and pillowy,

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.630
and should fit around most people’s ears
comfortably. In terms of wearing comfort, the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.040
XC is definitely one of the more comfortable
headphones I’ve worn. It’s light weight

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.730
and the headband and ear pads feel great for
long term wear. Sol Republic may market this

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.620
as a headphone with a studio tuning, but this
headphone was obviously made to be worn on

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:51.990
the street. Noise isolation however, is surprisingly
only average for a closed headphone. So now

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:58.100
we get to the sound of the Master Tracks XC
and as I said at the beginning of this video,

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:06.000
I don't really like the way these headphones
sound. First of all you have bass, and the

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:12.920
bass is decent enough. It's solid, it's rounded,
it definitely has emphasis in the low end

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.920
on this headphone. It sounds just a little
bit loose but it's not completely flabby.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:25.570
But the rest of the way this headphone has
been tuned, the treble, the high frequencies,

00:03:25.570 --> 00:03:31.990
are incredibly rolled off. They just hit a
shelf and they're just completely rolled off

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:40.870
and as a result everything sounds very congested,
it sounds very muffled, and what's really

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.010
the worst thing about this headphone. And
the worst thing about this headphone is that

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.850
the mids, the way vocals sound, sound really
plasticky. For some reason you have this muffled

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:56.840
treble section and then the voices come in
and they sound kind of hollow and plasticky

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:01.460
almost as if you're listening to internal
reflections from the earcups bouncing back

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:08.460
into your ear. It's just a really gross, kind
of unnatural sound, and I really don't like

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.980
it. The Master Tracks XC sounds better for
some genres than others, and out of curiosity

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.949
I tried listening to Calvin Harris’ own
tracks on the XC. The headphone does indeed

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:23.270
sound better with electronic and pop kind
of genres, but even then I think there are

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:28.680
other headphones that do a much better job.
Sol Republic markets the XC as suitable for

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.509
studio production, but I think the sound is
far too sculpted for that. I think the Audio

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:39.479
Technica M50X delivers a tighter, more neutral
and detailed reference sound, though not everyone

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:44.560
likes the metallic treble. Unlike the XC,
the M50X also folds up, which is always a

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.879
plus for any headphone. That said, the XC
is a lot more comfortable than the M50X. The

00:04:49.879 --> 00:04:55.569
Beats Studio 2.0 is probably the natural competitor
to the Master Tracks XC, and I think it delivers

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:00.969
a clearer sound, especially in the vocals.
The Studio 2.0 offers similar levels of wearing

00:05:00.969 --> 00:05:06.279
comfort and folds up, but the noise cancellation
produces a constant, annoying hiss. If you

00:05:06.279 --> 00:05:10.800
want a bassy headphone with an around-ear
fit, the best alternative to the Master Tracks

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.680
XC that I have heard is the V-Moda M100, which
delivers a convincing bassy sound without

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.110
completely gumming up the midrange and the
treble like the XC does. The V-Moda is nearly

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.099
as comfortable, has good build quality, and
folds up to boot. In the end, I have no idea

00:05:26.099 --> 00:05:30.840
how much input Calvin Harris really had on
this headphone, but given the sound I really

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.040
doubt he actually produces anything with this
product.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:35.940
"When you're mixing vocals, I've never heard a headphone

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.380
where the vocal has been so clear and precise."

00:05:41.420 --> 00:05:42.879
So hopefully that gives you some

00:05:42.879 --> 00:05:47.389
idea about these headphones and you can check
