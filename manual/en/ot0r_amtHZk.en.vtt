00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.680
How to Grow an Herb Garden Indoors.

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:11.389
There's nothing nicer than being able to pluck
fresh herbs from your own little garden â€“ especially

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.459
when that garden is right in your home!

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:21.670
You will need Containers Pottery shards or
gravel Planter soil or potting soil and perlite

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:31.369
Saucers Seeds, starter plants, or cuttings
A sunny spot Fluorescent lighting and plastic

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.450
wrap.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:33.450
Step 1.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.830
Decide which herbs you'd like to plant.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:43.360
Basil, cilantro, chives, marjoram, mint, oregano,
parsley, rosemary, sage, and thyme all grow

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.360
well indoors.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.360
Step 2.

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.290
For each herb, get a container that measures,
from end to end, one-third to one-half the

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.390
expected height of the grown plant.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.150
Buy ones especially made for herbs from a
gardening center, or use a clean milk carton

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.000
or yogurt cup; just make sure you punch a
hole in the bottom for drainage.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.270
Basil needs a large pot because of its extensive
roots.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.270
Step 3.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.979
Place pottery shards or gravel in the bottom
of each container for drainage, and then put

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:13.869
each container on a saucer.

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:18.780
Fill the containers with planter soil, or
use potting soil mixed with perlite.

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.780
Step 4.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.909
Plant the seeds according to the package's
instructions.

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:25.719
Most should be sown close to the surface.

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:26.719
Step 5.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:29.689
Find a spot where the plants will get a lot
of sunshine.

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:32.429
A south- or west-facing window works best.

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.580
If you don't have a sunny window, put your
herb garden under fluorescent light for 12

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.829
hours a day.

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:39.829
Step 6.

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.189
Water once a week, or whenever the soil an
inch down feels dry.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.319
Add enough water so that a little runs out
of the hole at the bottom of the pot.

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:51.880
Pour out any that collects in the saucer.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.880
Step 7.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.680
Consider growing some or all of your herbs
from starter plants, which you can get from

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.110
gardening centers.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.609
Some herbs, like mint, sage, thyme, and savory,
take a long time to develop from seeds.

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:05.030
Step 8.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.850
Savor the luxury of snipping off some fresh
herbs whenever you want to spice up a dish.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.350
Did you know In ancient Greece, students wore
garlands of rosemary while studying for exams

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:17.420
to help their memory.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.500
Today, it is being studied as a possible Alzheimer's
treatment.
