00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.260
SUGAR + SALT

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.920
Mix thoroughly.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.060
CURRY LEAVES

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.620
We want only the leaves.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.440
CHILLIES

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.780
PRAWNS

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:02.780
Trim the legs.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.580
Snip the horn, and along the back.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.580
With a toothpick,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.120
remove the vein.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.760
Rinse thoroughly.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.820
Drain well.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.420
Use only prawns that are fresh.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.040
Dry with paper towels.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.060
SALT

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.480
Toss till evenly mixed.

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.540

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.920
FLOUR

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.900
Yup, toss till evenly mixed.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.140
When the oil around the chopstick bubbles,

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.020
deep-fry the prawns till just cooked.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.700
Use the maximum heat possible.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.100
Don't overcrowd the pan.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:31.820
Don't overcook the prawns . . .

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.280
or they'll be dry &amp; rubbery.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.480
Let the prawns drain.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.860
UNSALTED BUTTER

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.540
Heat the butter till lightly brown.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.940
Add curry leaves &amp; chillies.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.440
Fry over medium heat till fragrant.

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:04.560
Reduce the heat to low. Add cereal mix.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.300
Stir till cereal is lightly golden.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.120
In go the prawns (whether they want to or not).

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.140
Turn off the heat.

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.880
"Wee . . . !"

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.140
The cereal should stick to the prawns.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.180
Otherwise, you've failed.
