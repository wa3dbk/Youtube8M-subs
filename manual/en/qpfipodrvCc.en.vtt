00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:06.380
Hi.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.380
I'm Bill, with Rugged Liner.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.470
Today, we're going to install our Chevy
wheel liners; one of our newer products.

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:17.430
It's a great way to protect your
investment of your truck, it's a nice accessory.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.260
It shows your truck off a
little bit, plus it protects your investment

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.580
from paint chips and any
damage that could occur to the frame.

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:30.860
It's a 5-step simple installation;
you can do it with the tire on or off.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:38.870
Pretty much, the first step is to insert the
wheel liner, making sure you

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.680
have the proper hand.

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:51.880
Push the liner up behind the tire, forcing
the top up

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.140
into the sheet metal.

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:00.390
After having both ears tucked in, you take
the top

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:11.780
flange and you tuck it up and behind the sheet
metal.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:15.960
Then using the 3
supplied locking push-in fasteners, push each

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:21.490
one up through the sheet
metal, into the plastic part.

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.420
The final step, we'll take our drill with
our

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.369
5/16 [inaudible: 01:26] socket, and place
the 4 self-tapping screws

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:48.209
provided in the kit in each of the 4 holes
in 

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:58.460
the liner.

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:10.440
Next, we're going to continue to the passenger
side.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.880
Once again, we're
going to check and make sure we have the right

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.030
side, insert the liner, and
tuck in the ears on both sides.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.720
Tuck the liner under the sheet metal
flange.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.340
Insert the 3 included pushpins.

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.630
Use a 5/16 nut driver socket.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.690
Screw
in the 4 self-tapping screws.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:32.220
There you have it in 5 easy steps.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.960
You have an accessory that goes inside
your wheel well, that protects your investment

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.440
from chips, dents, rust.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.470
Only takes 5 or 10 minutes to install, and
also, really shows off the look

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:43.030
of your truck.
