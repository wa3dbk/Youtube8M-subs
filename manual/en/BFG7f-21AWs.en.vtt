00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.750
Hey how's it going people BrownBrady here

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:07.059
and thank you for tuning into my channel

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:08.300
I know it's been a while

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.810
Since my last video but

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:10.960
I'd like to thank you for hanging

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:11.960
in there

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.960
And also I'd like to thank

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:15.170
My new subscribers because this week

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.350
I hit 400 subscribers yes thank you

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:21.570
So this video is gonna be dedicated

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.009
To all of you with hair

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:25.849
Because it's very important

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:27.619
I know

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:29.499
To a lot of us having your hairdo

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:31.359
Messed up after wearing your helmet

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.190
Can be a concern

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.070
So in this episode I'm gonna talk to you

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.960
About dealing with helmet hair

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.800
If you don't have any hair on your head

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.030
Consider yourself lucky because

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.430
None of this concerns you except

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.550
Maybe to poke fun at those who make a

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.170
Big deal out of it

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:48.640
And also not to generalize

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.920
But I think many women with long hair

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.250
Can relate to this

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.239
And in fact I've seen some solutions

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.399
To this problem online

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:56.769
And this is how I go to work

00:00:56.769 --> 00:00:59.219
My hair is soaking wet

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.219
Underneath this towel

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:01.219
But it's totally protected

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:02.499
But a more practical reason

00:01:02.499 --> 00:01:04.309
For concern is for people

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:05.830
Who need to fix their hair

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.080
To look presentable at the office

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.910
So without further adieu

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:20.480
Here are 5 ways to deal with helmet hair

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.480
Number one

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.540
Acceptance

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.830
There are many important things

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.090
You need to be concerned about

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.950
While on your motorcycle

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.420
Like distracted drivers

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.340
Inattentive pedestrians

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.450
And animals making a dash for it

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.380
I'd say your hairdo is of very

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.380
Minor concern

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.820
Hey you okay there buddy

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.530
Hey nice hair

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.600
So one solution is not to do

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.710
Anything about it

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.110
And accept that your hair

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.670
Will get messed up

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.860
Number two

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.820
Change your haircut

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.280
Some hairstyles are more resistant to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.280
Getting messed up

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:52.570
For example

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.100
A combed back hairstyle is already

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.770
Compressed anyway

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.380
And I think in general

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.810
Any long hairstyle will work too unless

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.610
You are going for a puffed up

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.450
Full bodied glam rock look

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.880
Number three

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.360
Bring a hat

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.729
When my hair has grown to medium length

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.200
I like to wear a hat after riding

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:14.480
And I love hats anyway

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.860
If you have a snap back you can

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:18.010
Secure it to your bike or your belt

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.640
Otherwise you can carry it with you

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.650
In your bag

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:21.840
Then when you get off the bike

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.780
Just put it on your head

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:26.670
Number four

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.250
Cover your head

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.560
This one is convenient in cold weather

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:31.780
Since you're gonna keep your

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.430
Head sock on after riding anyway

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.950
Why not leave it on under your helmet

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.310
Personally I do this when the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.450
Temperature is below 5 degrees Celsius

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.730
Not in the summer

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:44.000
You can also wear a bandana

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.530
If you prefer the bad ass look

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.350
And finally number five

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.210
Shave your head

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.700
If you're like me and you have

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:52.740
Thinning hair

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.450
Your scalp shines through after your

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.350
Hair gets compressed

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:01.360
Yeah that's better

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.930
Well since I've been shaving my own head

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:04.290
Since I was thirty

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.819
It's convenient that I don't have to

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.010
Worry about helmet hair

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.780
And as a bonus I also have my own

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:12.020
Shaver so I save money by shaving

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.040
My own head

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.120
Again I think your hair shouldn't be

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:17.200
A top priority when you're riding

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.980
It's part of any sport that requires

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.980
A helmet anyway

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.040
Just restyle your hair after riding

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.040
If you have to

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.630
Shave it

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:25.670
Anyway that will be all for this

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.670
Episode

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.610
But if you have any other tips

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.120

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.920
You look like a bobble head
