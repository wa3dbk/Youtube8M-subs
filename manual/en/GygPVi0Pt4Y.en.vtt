Hi this is Julia Karch for Expert Village.com.
In this video series we will be talking about

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.540
still life drawing for beginners. In this
section we are looking at how to get dimension

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:23.020
in your drawing and that relies on shading
but also volume. So a lot of times in order

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:27.669
to create dimension you want to look at what
is underneath your object. Therefore, there

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:34.430
is some light that is creating a shadow underneath
each object which is automatically a little

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:41.430
secret way to bring some dimensionality to
your object. If you give it some darkness

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:51.649
underneath and basically I am just scribbling
here. That’s a little trick to create some

00:00:51.649 --> 00:01:03.510
gravity to your object and give it a little
bit more volume. Any kind of line will do.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:12.230
It’s a good idea to go in the direction
of how you think the form is. But on a flat

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.710
surface like this you can just do a straight
line in the direction of this is a table and

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:32.060
the lines are going to be going this way.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:38.880
Creating dimension doesn’t only rely on
shadow and light. It relies on how you see

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:46.580
the object as an entire form. This is an object
that could be broken down into planes. You

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:53.880
have a plane here on this spaghetti squash,
a plane here. There are various planes on

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.210
here that you could get involved with drawing
darker and lighter lines.
