00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:03.749
(tranquil sound)

00:00:03.749 --> 00:00:05.210
Maze: We're going to serve it with bread.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.017
(knocking sound)

00:00:08.055 --> 00:00:10.959
Anthony: It's not supposed
to be that hard. (crosstalk)

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:12.238
You all heard that at home, right?

00:00:12.238 --> 00:00:13.574
Bread's not supposed to be that hard.

00:00:13.574 --> 00:00:15.267
(hip hop music)

00:00:15.267 --> 00:00:17.203
Anthony: I'm Anthony
Anderson and I'm on a mission

00:00:17.203 --> 00:00:22.176
to find the best home cooks in America.

00:00:22.811 --> 00:00:27.310
(music)

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:30.484
I'm in Chicago, Illinois to meet a guy

00:00:30.484 --> 00:00:32.406
that a few local chefs told us makes

00:00:32.406 --> 00:00:36.261
the best barbecue shrimp in the
city and he's not Bubba Gump.

00:00:36.261 --> 00:00:40.774
He's a political strategist
named Maze Jackson.

00:00:40.774 --> 00:00:43.623
Maze: Welcome, we're about to go
in here and get us some shrimp

00:00:43.623 --> 00:00:45.775
so we can make our barbecue shrimp recipe.

00:00:45.775 --> 00:00:49.016
Best place in Chicago, all right.

00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:51.555
Typically, people get
these kind of shrimp,

00:00:51.555 --> 00:00:54.261
but I really come here for the specialty,

00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:55.572
which they have right over here.

00:00:55.572 --> 00:00:56.556
Come with me over here.

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:57.132
Anthony: We're getting the special shrimp?

00:00:57.132 --> 00:00:58.180
Maze: We're getting the special shrimp.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.023
Anthony: All right.

00:00:59.023 --> 00:01:00.556
(music)

00:01:00.556 --> 00:01:02.545
Maze: You can very rarely
find shrimp with the head on.

00:01:02.545 --> 00:01:03.629
You see those eyeballs?

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:04.174
Anthony: Yeah.

00:01:04.174 --> 00:01:05.195
Maze: It adds to the flavor.

00:01:05.195 --> 00:01:06.900
Anthony: I don't want my
food looking at me, though.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.358
This is how we just do it where I'm from.

00:01:08.358 --> 00:01:12.268
You put the bag in there and just
grab in on like that, all right?

00:01:12.268 --> 00:01:14.948
Maze: Now you'll be smelling
like fish all day, but it's okay.

00:01:14.948 --> 00:01:15.709
Anthony: There you go.

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:19.011
(music)

00:01:19.011 --> 00:01:21.453
Anthony: Why New Orleans
style barbecue shrimp

00:01:21.453 --> 00:01:23.180
when you're a Chi-town boy yourself?

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.939
Maze: There was this
restaurant here in Chicago

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:27.980
that I used to go out to
and get barbecue shrimp

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.244
and one day, they took it off the menu,

00:01:30.244 --> 00:01:32.884
so I searched far and wide
and looked all over the place

00:01:32.884 --> 00:01:34.509
trying to find out how I could make it

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.381
and I finally found a recipe
that finally matches it.

00:01:37.381 --> 00:01:38.605
This is it, I want to show it to you.

00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:40.099
Anthony: This is what we do, all right.

00:01:40.099 --> 00:01:42.810
(music)

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.843
Maze: All right, Anthony.

00:01:43.843 --> 00:01:45.327
Anthony: Hold on, they ain't said action.

00:01:45.327 --> 00:01:47.422
Will you calm down, brother?

00:01:47.422 --> 00:01:50.461
You relax, you'll have your
own show one day, trust me.

00:01:50.461 --> 00:01:51.095
Cameraman: Action.

00:01:51.095 --> 00:01:52.331
Maze: Why don't you grab
a stick of that butter

00:01:52.331 --> 00:01:53.163
and we're going to melt it.

00:01:53.163 --> 00:01:55.267
We want to get that started right away.

00:01:55.267 --> 00:01:56.994
All right, in the meantime,
what I want you to do

00:01:56.994 --> 00:02:00.699
is combine in a bowl some cayenne pepper,

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:03.764
some black pepper, a little
bit of salt, some chili pepper,

00:02:03.764 --> 00:02:06.452
thyme, rosemary, and oregano.

00:02:06.452 --> 00:02:07.209
Anthony: Look at that.

00:02:07.209 --> 00:02:08.127
Maze: All right, mix it up.

00:02:08.127 --> 00:02:09.428
We're going to wait for this to melt

00:02:09.428 --> 00:02:12.440
and once that melts we're
going to add it right on in.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.445
Anthony: What else is there
that you like to cook?

00:02:14.445 --> 00:02:15.776
Maze: I love to barbecue.

00:02:15.776 --> 00:02:17.548
Anthony: We're going to
have a barbecue show.

00:02:17.548 --> 00:02:20.100
I'm going to invite you
down for the barbecue show

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.564
and we're going to have
a barbecue cook off.

00:02:21.564 --> 00:02:22.364
Maze: You not ready.

00:02:22.364 --> 00:02:24.249
Anthony: You ain't ready.

00:02:25.843 --> 00:02:28.843
You are a campaign fixer.

00:02:28.843 --> 00:02:30.947
Maze: I wouldn't call it a
fixer as much as a person

00:02:30.947 --> 00:02:33.939
that is able to maneuver
through situations

00:02:33.939 --> 00:02:37.565
and help people come out
on top. (record scratch)

00:02:37.565 --> 00:02:39.268
Anthony: I don't know
what the hell that is.

00:02:39.268 --> 00:02:42.024
Without mentioning any
name, what's the worst thing

00:02:42.024 --> 00:02:44.278
that you've had to clean
up in your line of work?

00:02:44.278 --> 00:02:47.888
Maze: I don't think I would be
able to even talk about that.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:50.036
Anthony: Let's pour that over some rice,

00:02:50.036 --> 00:02:51.996
let's get that onto the table,
let's finish our conversation.

00:02:51.996 --> 00:02:53.093
Maze: All right, that sounds like a plan.

00:02:53.093 --> 00:02:53.724
Anthony: Okay.

00:02:53.724 --> 00:03:02.726
(Hip hop music)

00:03:02.726 --> 00:03:04.060
Anthony: Who do we have at
the table with us right now?

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.758
Maze: Right now at the
table we have Milan,

00:03:05.758 --> 00:03:08.516
my 13 year old daughter who is a teenager.

00:03:08.516 --> 00:03:10.572
We had to coax her to come
on out here and talk to us.

00:03:10.572 --> 00:03:12.687
Anthony: I know, it's 13
going on 30, ain't it?

00:03:12.687 --> 00:03:14.215
Maze: 13 going on 30.

00:03:14.215 --> 00:03:17.306
Anthony: What's your favorite
meal that your father cooks?

00:03:17.306 --> 00:03:20.943
Milan: Barbecue, pasta, chicken.

00:03:20.943 --> 00:03:23.151
Anthony: I'm going to have to
invite you over to another cook off.

00:03:23.151 --> 00:03:24.451
Maze: Another cook off?

00:03:24.451 --> 00:03:25.415
Anthony: Fried chicken.

00:03:25.415 --> 00:03:27.847
Maze: You ain't ready
for my fried chicken.

00:03:27.847 --> 00:03:31.511
Anthony: I brine my chicken
overnight with rosemary, lemon.

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:34.384
Maze: You've been in
Hollywood too long, man.

00:03:34.384 --> 00:03:35.567
That rosemary stuff.

00:03:35.567 --> 00:03:37.361
You have to get you some Lawry's, man.

00:03:37.361 --> 00:03:39.415
You've got to do it with
the Lawry's and do it right.

00:03:39.415 --> 00:03:42.192
Anthony: I put that in my flour.

00:03:42.192 --> 00:03:44.235
(music)

00:03:44.235 --> 00:03:46.544
How old were you when you started cooking?

00:03:46.544 --> 00:03:48.761
Maze: I started cooking when
I was in the third grade.

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:53.198
My dad was a preacher and
my mother was a teacher

00:03:53.198 --> 00:03:55.816
and he said, "No TV after school."

00:03:55.816 --> 00:03:58.760
I got into my mom's cabinet
and got the family cookbook out

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.400
and started making recipes and
soon I was cooking every day.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.704
Anthony: It's funny that
your father's a preacher

00:04:04.704 --> 00:04:06.650
and he wouldn't let you watch
television because it's the devil,

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.008
but he let you play with fire.

00:04:08.008 --> 00:04:10.836
Maze: Right, that is
kind of funny. (laughing)

00:04:10.836 --> 00:04:14.634
(music)

00:04:14.634 --> 00:04:18.644
Anthony: This bread is
hard again. (laughing)

00:04:18.644 --> 00:04:20.811
Maze: You got the corner.

00:04:20.811 --> 00:04:22.251
Anthony: I think it cut my gum.

00:04:22.251 --> 00:04:24.884
(hip hop music)

00:04:24.884 --> 00:04:25.749
Anthony: I need that recipe.

00:04:25.749 --> 00:04:26.671
Maze: I got you.

00:04:26.671 --> 00:04:27.622
Anthony: I need that recipe.

00:04:27.622 --> 00:04:28.842
Maze: I got you.

00:04:28.842 --> 00:04:30.787
Anthony: Hey, Milan, which one of
my movies did you like the best?

00:04:30.787 --> 00:04:32.117
Milan: Never Say Never.

00:04:32.117 --> 00:04:33.660
Anthony: I wasn't in that one.

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.652
Milan: Oh, Justin Bieber was.

00:04:35.652 --> 00:04:36.426
Anthony: Okay, never mind.

00:04:36.426 --> 00:04:37.559
Go on, eat your scrimp.

00:04:37.559 --> 00:04:42.374
(hip hop music)

00:04:44.145 --> 00:04:46.936
Milan: I just need Justin
Bieber's number. (laughing)

00:04:46.936 --> 00:04:47.666
Anthony: I can't give you that.

00:04:47.666 --> 00:04:51.666
(rushing sound)
