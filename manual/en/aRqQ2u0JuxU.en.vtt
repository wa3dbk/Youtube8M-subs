00:00:00.506 --> 00:00:11.126
[ Silence ]

00:00:11.626 --> 00:00:15.666
&gt;&gt; We've thought the best thing that we could
possibly do was to listen to what communities

00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:17.896
around the country are doing, because we feel

00:00:17.896 --> 00:00:20.036
that there's a lot of community-level
resilience.

00:00:20.326 --> 00:00:25.076
We have a lot of storytelling events where
we've provided communities with prompts such as,

00:00:25.136 --> 00:00:29.766
what sustains you or what keeps you up at
night or what is something that we need to know

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:32.266
about your community and
environmental issues in your community

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.976
or social justice issues in your community?

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:38.376
&gt;&gt; The bus was previously set up to run on waste
vegetable oil, and this year we're switching

00:00:38.376 --> 00:00:42.596
to biodiesel because waste vegetable oil has
actually become a pretty valuable commodity,

00:00:42.926 --> 00:00:45.386
and there are a lot of small startup companies

00:00:45.466 --> 00:00:47.656
that are making biodiesel
out of waste vegetable oil.

00:00:48.046 --> 00:00:50.396
So if we get the waste vegetable
oil straight from restaurants,

00:00:50.646 --> 00:00:53.496
then we're actually taking it away from
companies that we would really like to support.

00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:56.456
So we are going to be buying
straight from those companies

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:57.906
in order to support them in the process.

00:00:58.586 --> 00:01:02.846
Biodiesel made from waste vegetable
oil is basically just the oil

00:01:02.846 --> 00:01:04.016
with the glycerin removed.

00:01:04.016 --> 00:01:07.056
It's put through a chemical
process called transesterification,

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.526
which makes it basically
the same as normal diesel.

00:01:10.526 --> 00:01:13.506
You can just put it right into any
diesel engine and it'll run just fine.

00:01:14.746 --> 00:01:16.696
&gt;&gt; This is our bus ready to go.

00:01:17.476 --> 00:01:22.126
We used to have a big countertop
right here that we took

00:01:22.126 --> 00:01:24.886
out because we wanted a little bit more flow.

00:01:24.926 --> 00:01:27.856
So I think a lot of people are going
to be hanging out on this couch just

00:01:27.856 --> 00:01:31.036
because this is the biggest
open space on the bus by far.

00:01:31.246 --> 00:01:35.086
This used to be a stove, but it was
never connected, and no one ever used it.

00:01:35.156 --> 00:01:40.696
So instead we are growing some mint.

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:42.246
This is a sink.

00:01:42.246 --> 00:01:45.866
The water tank is under the bus, and
we can just continue refilling it.

00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:48.706
Back here, this is like our real living area.

00:01:48.936 --> 00:01:55.996
All of our food, and then back here we have
one bed, and we have a big set of cubbies.

00:01:56.196 --> 00:01:58.656
Everyone gets one small cubby.

00:01:58.696 --> 00:02:02.056
It's about 11 inches by 22 inches.

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:07.326
So not a lot of clothing, but this is
probably the cleanest it will be right now.

00:02:09.046 --> 00:02:12.676
&gt;&gt; So we're really excited to here
what the communities have to say,

00:02:13.086 --> 00:02:14.956
and we're really excited to listen.
