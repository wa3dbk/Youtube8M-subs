00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.500
First we're gonna do, uh, a little demo for the crews

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.500
that weren't here last time and are gonna sail today.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
gonna try and do a little more, a lot more practice

00:00:11.083 --> 00:00:13.083
When you head upwind, you're coming around the leeward mark let's say,

00:00:16.486 --> 00:00:18.486
Grab the sheet and turn around backwards

00:00:20.083 --> 00:00:22.083
Now you've got everything right in front of you.

00:00:22.361 --> 00:00:24.361
It's all right here.

00:00:37.583 --> 00:00:39.583
(Lyzz): Do you see how he's jumping on the one 
 side, and then the other side really fast?

00:00:43.083 --> 00:00:45.083
You want to do it really, really fast.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.750
Now when we go to tack, you can watch Sam 
 [the skipper] and you can watch the tiller.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.750
You can also watch the back of the boat, 
 and make sure the boat is flat.

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.000
Watch him, watch his body.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.500
Roll with him.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.700
When I come up, I bring my arm through,

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And the jib comes right in to where I need it to be.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.700
(Lyzz): He really wants everybody to sit backwards like that, when you're going upwind.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.800
And then when you're going downwind I can switch around

00:01:14.883 --> 00:01:16.883
(Lyzz): But when you're going downwind, turn around.

00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:19.417
Hold it way out there, nice and low.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.450
(Lyzz): Now crews- you see how he's holding it, that's very important.

00:01:24.381 --> 00:01:26.881
Go up with him, and then go right back down in.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.500
Soon as you get the boat flattening out, 
 I wanna jump right back down in.

00:01:32.033 --> 00:01:34.033
Now we're turning to go upwind,

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:35.933
You do a quick switch

00:01:39.517 --> 00:01:41.520
Going for a tack, I'm watching Sam.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.820
Roll it...

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Jump up

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.800
Jib right there

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Perfectly in.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.200
(Lyzz): He does a nice fast roll, a really hard roll.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.500
[inaudible]

00:01:55.798 --> 00:02:00.800
(Student): So... Is he saying this is for when it's light enough 
 to do that, or is this something we should do always?

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
(Another Student): Always.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.200
(Lyzz): Well, unless...

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:04.700
(Student): Oh unless you're on the rail?

00:02:04.917 --> 00:02:05.920
(Lyzz): Yeah.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
At the jibe, you always gotta go back 
 to pulling it in at the block

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.500
Pull it in through the block on the jibe 
 and then I jump out with my arm.

00:02:16.628 --> 00:02:19.630
Coming back up, I can [inaudible] if I want, doesn't matter.

00:02:22.083 --> 00:02:24.080
Pass [the sheets] behind your back.

00:02:24.617 --> 00:02:26.120
Watching Sam...

00:02:26.417 --> 00:02:28.420
Roll it with him

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.650
(Lyzz): Look, do you see how the water... How the 
 entire rail practically gets in the water with him?

00:02:32.217 --> 00:02:35.220
(Lyzz): Ok, so, I need you guys who are learning to 
 roll tack, that is what you need to do

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.500
(Untrained Observer): Bad idea...

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.600
(Lyzz): When you're a crew, and you're sitting backwards like that

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.450
It's much easier to look over the back of the boat 
 and see how flat or not flat you are,

00:02:44.667 --> 00:02:47.670
(Lyzz): Rather than to look towards the front of the boat 
 and try and figure out how flat you are.

00:02:48.066 --> 00:02:50.070
(Lyzz): So that's another reason you wanna [sit backwards].

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.310
(Lyzz): Ok, watch how much he rolls. See that?

00:02:58.917 --> 00:03:00.920
(Lyzz): He gets the entire side in.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
(Lyzz): So, you guys, you think you're rolling enough, but you're probably not.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.250
(Lyzz): In fact I can guarantee that you're not.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:27.500
[Inaudible]

00:03:29.012 --> 00:03:31.010
(Lyzz): When he's winging, you see how much heel he has?

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.500
(Lyzz): You want plenty of heel there.

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:38.200
(Lyzz): You see how far forward he's sitting, everyone?

00:03:38.477 --> 00:03:39.980
(Student): Especially when he's skippering.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.200
(Lyzz): Everybody, that's for everybody.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.400
Nice, easy, slow turn [when jibing], a really slow turn.

00:03:43.733 --> 00:03:46.230
(Lyzz): And watch, he has a nice big roll on the jibe too.

00:03:46.487 --> 00:03:48.490
(Lyzz): A nice big roll, you can even see the centerboard.

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:03.800
You see that - nice easy slow turns.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.800
(Lyzz): So they lean out first

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:13.750
(Lyzz): And he lets out the main enough so 
 that when he's on the other side

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.700
he can sheet it in, and sheet in the very last tiny bit.

00:04:18.667 --> 00:04:20.670
(British person): Watch to know your skipper.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000
(Lyzz): What? Yes, yes. So you go at the same time. Yeah.

00:04:25.833 --> 00:04:27.830
(Lyzz): See how they do it both at the same time? Yeah.

00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:38.830
(Lyzz): So a nice big roll...

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.000
(Lyzz): Over...

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:42.800
(Lyzz): And crews--

00:04:43.667 --> 00:04:45.670
(Lyzz): Sam is being a little sloppy right now, but...

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:47.750
(Cinematographer): Lyzz, the more you wanna talk, that is good.
