00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The World's biggest cycling channel

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:25.360
about your legs shave or wax

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.220
shave

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.240
back again

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.380
woah

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.240
[opening can ] oh

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.340
I would love to have a fresh pizza but

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.720
what is a service course

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.360
Oh cheers! Here we go!

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.980
Pizza!

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.260
That's nice!

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:03.380
so we're inside the mechanics

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.270
bit of the truck back here

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.650
it's like a lucky dip but I don't know what else is in here

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.170
they're keeping aware of the position of other riders

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.850
you can put on the brakes

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.940
with a great amount of force

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.040
and don't follow atacks that are clearly above your level

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.780
then I'm going to add two

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.240
tablespoons of golden syrup

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.760
it's really important to clean dry and re-grease the threads in the frame

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.920
now what we're going to do

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:24.680
So we're going to start

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.050
by taking the punctured wheel out

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.460
this would be the moment actually you should

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.649
go but then when my body went what the

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:32.869
heck are you thinking no not today

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:34.550
Would be nice to have a little bit more space than one

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:36.540
second going into finals day

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.100
feeling weak, dizzy and like getting an entire

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.380
warehouse of chocolate

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.260
(Crowd cheers)

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:53.480
Time to attack!

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.320
