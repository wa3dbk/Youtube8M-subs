Stanford University.

00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:19.272
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:19.272 --> 00:00:20.730
The Standford
Symphony Orchestra is

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.529
performing Holst's
"The Planets."

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.570
One of the exciting things
about this performance

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.250
is that we're actually going
to have these wide screen NASA

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:30.700
images that are projected
in the background.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:33.920
This is a piece in seven
movements related to the seven

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.970
planets, I guess, that they knew
about at that time, excluding

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:37.680
Earth.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.230
And so each movement has its
own kind of characteristics,

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.740
often related to the gods or
historical mythological ideas

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.500
the ancients had
about these planets

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.465
and so each movement comes
across in a very unique way.

00:00:50.465 --> 00:00:52.090
Typically with
classical music, there's

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.710
a little bit of the
dichotomy between tradition

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.750
and innovation.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.900
You want to honor the composer
and the composer's vision

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.062
for the piece, but there's
also been a lot of time

00:01:01.062 --> 00:01:03.020
that has passed and so
you want the piece to be

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.710
applicable to the
present day audience.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.220
This is one of the experiments
that many orchestras

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:16.796
are trying is to make symphony
music become multimedia event.

00:01:16.796 --> 00:01:18.420
It's definitely a
different experience.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.890
Most pieces, if you try to do
something audiovisual with them

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.170
it doesn't necessarily
add to the music.

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:26.900
I think in this
case, it really can.

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:28.580
It's sort of an
exception, it's almost

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.240
like this music was
meant to capture

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.090
your imagination
in a certain way.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.150
Creativity is limitless, and
so in that kind of spirit

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.890
it doesn't matter if
it's art or science.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:46.440
That's the spirit
of that university,

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.330
and that's the spirit
of all students.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:02:01.110
