00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:04.940
We're going to help you pass your New Zealand
driving theory test using the free Road Code

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:11.940
quizzes at drivingtests.co.nz. Today we'll
look at the parking section. There are 18

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:17.250
questions in total and we'll break them into
two videos with 9 questions in each. These

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.119
are the first 9 questions.
Be sure to check the link at the end of this

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.119
video to see the next nine questions.
When parking downhill on a steep road what

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.790
does the Road Code suggest you do? Select
all that apply.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.810
On a steep road, if your handbrake fails,
the car's going to roll forwards. So if you

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:44.440
turn your wheels towards the kerb the car
will hit the kerb and hopefully will stop.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.480
So A is one correct answer.
If you turn your wheels away from the kerb,

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.510
as the car starts rolling it will turn into
traffic.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.940
If you have a manual transmission you could
put your car into reverse gear and that will

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.380
provide some engine braking if the handbrake
fails. Or if it's an automatic car, put it

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.350
in park.
You won't be leaving your hazard lights on

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:11.659
because they are to indicate you're a temporary
obstruction and people will think you are

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:18.659
in trouble. But you will put your handbrake
on.

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:24.920
Can you stop on a bus stop in a private vehicle?
The answer is, no. Only buses are allowed

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:31.920
to stop in a bus stop.
How close can you park your vehicle to the

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:38.329
approach side of a pedestrian crossing where
no broken yellow lines have been marked?

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:44.209
The answer here is 6 metres. If you need to
judge 6 metres it's roughly 1.5 times the

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:51.209
length of an average car.
What does this sign mean? The sign shows a

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.319
motorbike and an arrow pointing to the left.
This means that only motorcycles are allowed

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:05.319
to park to the left of the sign.
This sign shows a clearway sign. This circle

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.649
means a clearway and a clearway is a stretch
of road where you are not allowed to stop

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:14.620
and park.
The distance marked underneath, for 4km, is

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.980
an approximate distance which the clearway
is in force. At the end of that 4km you'll

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.379
see a sign that says Clearway Ends. In this
case, then, the clearway extends for 4km and

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:31.319
you must not stop anywhere in the next 4km
except in an emergency.

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:38.319
This is another clearway sign showing the
clearway is only active between 7 and 9 in

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.280
the morning. Outside of those times you are
allowed to park your car on the left hand

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.280
side of the road. 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.280
The answer is C.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.280
How close can you park your vehicle to an

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:58.370
intersection where no broken yellow lines
have been marked? The answer is 6m. 6m gives

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.340
enough room for vehicles to turn out of the
intersection and also means that vehicles

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.870
parked on the side of the road are far enough
back as not to obstruct the view up the road

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:14.870
of approaching vehicles.
When can you park on the right hand side of

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:21.549
the road? If you think about how your car
lights are set up, on the rear you have lights

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:26.730
and reflectors, but on the front you don't
have reflectors. As a car approaches you from

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:33.230
behind, if your car is parked and it's night,
their car lights will reflect off your reflectors.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.329
If you're facing the other way your car is
less visible because there are no reflectors.

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:43.400
You can't park your car on the right hand
side of the road unless it's a one-way street,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:49.920
so the answer is A.
The exception is if there are perpendicular

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.430
parking bays. That is, if you are parking
90 degrees from the kerb you can turn from

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.769
the left of the road over to the right of
the road and into a park. You are not allowed

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:06.140
to park on the right hand side of the road
facing traffic.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:13.140
This sign is a parking sign that shows that
on the right of it you can park for 40 minutes.

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.720
Any vehicle can park for 40 minutes to the
right of that sign.
