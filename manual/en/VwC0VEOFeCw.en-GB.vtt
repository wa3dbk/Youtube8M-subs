00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.649
In 2012 a small group of

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.680
Kiwis took an even smaller car to the iconic
Bonneville Salt Flats.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.140
The car was a 1964 Mini Cooper S
and we took it to Bonneville Speed Week to see

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:17.000
if we could break a few records.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.740
The short answer is yes.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.000
In August 2015 we're heading back to the Salt 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.640
with more power, taller gears, and more grey hair.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.080
In the lead up to Speed Week we thought we'd make a few short videos

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.320
to answer some of the questions we've been asked over the last few months.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.140
This week we're heading the World of Wearable arts and Collectable Cars in Nelson, New Zealand.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.780
We're going to talk to Garry Orton, one of the project founders.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:01.360
He's going to tell us a little bit about changes that are happening to the car in preparation for Speed Week 2015.

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.720
Well last time we had two 286 horsepower

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.580
on petrol with 18 pounds of boost.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:15.540
We're aiming for the low 300s, 310, 315 with 18 pounds of boost this time. 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.800
Methanol is a different animal all together.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.400
With ten pounds of boost our engine was 326 HP on Methanol.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.820
So this time on Methanol if we can get it tuned properly

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.680
it could knock on 350 HP.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.640
Which is quite a bit for 1000ccs!

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.880
With the cooling system we run a 60 litre water tank inside the cockpit of the car.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.860
So all the water from the engine circulates through that via an electric pump,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.840
so we don't run the original water pump at all now.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.080
We are now going to also run the oil pipes into that tank

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.820
and cool them as well 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.820
because our oil temperature was going through the roof last time

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.500
Changes to the gearbox: we're changing from

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.080
from the 3.0:1 diff ratio to 2.9:1.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.760
So as long as the engine will
pull the 10,000 revs it did last time

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.840
that will give us quite an increase in speed.

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:17.440
The engine is a 970cc Cooper S engine.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.780
The engine is the same bore size as the 1275 but it has a very short stroke crankshaft.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.700
We've had the crankshafts made in Los Angeles and they're quite a clever looking piece of kit.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.620
The the conrods are from KAD in the UK

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.340
and we have Ross forged pistons

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.720
and then of course the 16 valve BMW cylinder head.

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.540
Modifications to the engines this time:
We've changed the compression ratio on the engine.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.960
We've actually increased the compression
ratio on one engine

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.800
and decreased it on the other.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:57.080
We've had some different specification camshafts made for it, for both engines

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:03.850
and we'll dyno those engines and then finally decide what camshaft combination we're going to use.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:12.720
Wheels and tyres: Once again we're using the 155/55R12 tyre.

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.620
It's the same diameter as the original 10 inch but we had to go to 12 because we need a speed rating

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.680
of over 150mph and we couldn't get anything in ten inch.

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.580
So the tyres that we're using are these Yokohamas

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:32.320
and they're having all the tread shaved off them and that will increase our speed rating

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:35.180
to probably 170, 175mph.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:39.400
[Off camera] So we're aiming for 175mph right?

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:41.980
That is the aim.

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:44.520
At least I don't have to sit in it at that speed!

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.260
[Off camera] Exactly!

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.280
Hi I'm Maria from WoW, Nelson, New Zealand and we're really excited to have this great

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.460
Project '64 world speed record Mini

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.700
right here in our classic cars museum.
