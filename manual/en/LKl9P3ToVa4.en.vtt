Hi, this is Yolanda from Vanveenbulbs.com.
In this segment we're going to talk about

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.070
how to start flowers from seeds. Now we all
start flowers from the garden center or the

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.330
farmers market, they're already in the container
growing and we plant them. And they do really

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.930
well, or we buy a flower bulb and we plant
them and they do really well. But a lot of

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.340
us are kind of afraid of seeds. But seeds
are so basic and they're really easy to use

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.460
and really easy to grow flowers with. So I've
just collected these seeds from my garden

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:36.700
in the fall, and so as soon as the blooms
are done, and the seed pods have formed and

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.080
they've dried out, and before it rains really
hard and before they've turned to mush and

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.810
freeze hard, I collect the seeds, and I just
keep them in little envelopes. So these are

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:52.790
just cimicifuga or bugbane seeds and they're
a really pretty flower that grows in the shade

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:58.030
or part sun and they're easy to grow too.
So I've collected the seeds in the fall and

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:03.370
I'm just going to save them in the fall. And
then keep them in the house in a dry area

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.160
and come April or May I'm going to start them
in a very easy manner. So there is a few different

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.580
ways to start the seeds. I could just go right
into the garden and plant some of these seeds.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.690
In April, May and just make sure that the
weeds have been pulled and that it's good,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.750
usable earth, good compost or potting soil,
and I could plant them right into the dirt

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.250
and they do really well, they probably come
right up. But because my garden is kind of

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.430
crowded and I want to control it a little
bit, I'm going to start them probably indoors.

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:38.630
And an easy trick I found is just put a napkin
on a plate, put some seeds on that napkin,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.590
put another napkin over it, keep it wet, and
keep it in a dark, warm location and the seeds

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.320
will start to sprout. And as soon as they
sprout, you turn around and put them right

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.850
into your flower beds or right into your garden
where you want them to grow or in a container.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.140
And that's easy as well. Or I could just put
the seeds into some paper and put them into

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.310
a plastic bag, and I've found that works really
well too 'cause then it never dries out. And

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.770
I just check on them every day or every couple
of days and as soon as they have sprouts I

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.730
throw them in the ground. I've also used different
seed starter kits, so you can use a lot of

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:16.841
the soil that you used to start seeds that's
high in vermiculite so it's got a lot of airy

00:02:16.841 --> 00:02:23.061
kind of peat moss soil in it. And so I'll
just put some soil in here and put the seeds

00:02:23.061 --> 00:02:28.260
about one or two inches deep. And keep watering
them, and the trick with seeds is don't throw

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.370
the water on heavily, kind of mist them or
put cloth on top or a sheet or any type of

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:39.921
cheese cloth and the water will go right through
without disturbing the soil and then the seeds

00:02:39.921 --> 00:02:44.090
will grow real easily. So there's lots of
different methods to grow seeds. You can put

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.970
them right into the ground or you can start
them in the seed starter kit, or start them

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.350
in paper towels, but any way you start them
they're easy to grow and the best time to

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.870
grow them is after the last heavy frost in
the spring. And you can also plant them through

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.910
the fall.
