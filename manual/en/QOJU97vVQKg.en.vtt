00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.240
A practical use of Photoshop for video professionals
is to cut out a logo and create a glass bug.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:12.259
For example, let’s say I want to cut out
this film clapper to create a glass bug.

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:20.040
If you are on a Macintosh, you can use the
keyboard shortcut command + shift 4 to select

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.750
an area to take a snapshot.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.930
If you are running windows, press the print-screen
screen and paste the image directly into Photoshop.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:35.330
Open your image into Photoshop, and check
to make sure the image mode is set to RGB.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:39.750
If you are grabbing something from the web
or Google images the mode may be set to index

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.960
color.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:48.170
Crop the image to discard the areas that are
not needed. To do this use crop tool or press

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:56.149
the C key to activate it. Press enter to crop
the image after you’ve drawn your crop box.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.010
Press Command Zero to enlarge the image to
fit your screen.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:07.810
Click on the magic eraser tool. The magic
eraser tool will automatically erase the background

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.439
based on the color that you click on.

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:15.619
You can adjust the tolerance that affects
the color range that will be removed and I’m

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:21.310
if going to set the tolerance to a fairly
high value of 120.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:26.429
In this case, I’m going to undo by pressing
command Z to remove the blue color with my

00:01:26.429 --> 00:01:32.149
new tolerance value and these white areas
so they are transparent.

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:37.749
Notice the checkerboard pattern. This represents
a transparent background which is sometimes

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:39.619
called an ‘alpha channel’.

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:44.950
After you’ve cut out your logo, double click
on Layer 0 within the layers tab.

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:48.899
This brings forward the layer style dialog
box.

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:55.399
Activate the bevel and emboss category. Drag
the depth slider to a fairly high value and

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:02.439
drag the size value to a value between 1 and
3.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:07.200
The last step is to remove the fill color
by moving over to the layers tab and dragging

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.030
the fill slider to a value of 0.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:18.260
For Final Cut Pro or Avid Media Composer users,
save the image as a .png file type. The .png

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.760
file format will automatically embed this
transparent background information into the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.599
file.

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.379
You can now edit your glass bug into your
favorite editing system. In this example,

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:36.799
I’ll edit this into Final Cut Pro.

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:42.069
