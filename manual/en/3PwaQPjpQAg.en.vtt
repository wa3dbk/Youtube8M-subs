00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.220
I'm going to talk about how to know if youR
newborn is getting enough to eat. One of the

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:12.120
key ways that you can tell if your baby is
getting enough to eat is to listen to what

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.930
they're doing with their breastfeeding. So
when your baby is on the breast and nursing,

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.690
you want to listen for the baby swallowing.
It sounds something like this: cah...cah...cah...

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:28.250
And they do a suck, swallow, breathe pattern
so you want to watch them as well as listen

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.719
to them. You can see the baby's jaw move backwards
as they swallow, or if you can see their throat,

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.710
you can see their throat moving as they swallow,
so you're going to be listening for that swallow.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.690
And after some time into the breastfeeding
goes to a suck, suck, swallow, suck, suck,

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.769
swallow as the milk flow slows down a little
bit. The other way that you can tell if your

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:56.249
baby is getting enough is to look at their
wet and poopy diapers. Now the baby will have

00:00:56.249 --> 00:01:02.959
very black poop the first day or two after
being born. As they start taking more in,

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:08.860
their bowel movements will start to change
from that dark, tarry black to a more dark

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.090
brown kind of sticky, greenish color, to a
yellow, bright yellow, with a little bit of

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.000
seeds and some wateriness to it. You see that
transition with their BMs, you know that they're

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.979
getting enough to eat. As well as you want
to look for their wet diapers as well. A great

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:31.619
way to look at that is this little chart that
shows you what the different colors look like.

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.810
The black tarry, the green, and the seedy
yellow. Now a very wet diaper would have up

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.170
to three tablespoons of water in it. Now with
the new diapers, it's very hard to tell if

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.220
it's actually wet, so a little trick you can
use is to take one piece of toilet paper,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.929
a little square, and put it in your baby's
diaper, and that way, when they don't have

00:01:52.929 --> 00:01:57.319
a bowel movement, but just a wet diaper, that
one little piece of tissue will be wet because

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:02.899
the super absorbency of the diapers won't
allow you to feel if it's wet or not. If you

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:08.509
have any questions or concerns about your
baby's intake, you should see your pediatrician.

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.120
And I recommend that all breastfed babies
should see their pediatrician on the second

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.030
day after discharge from the hospital. Another
way to know if your baby is gaining weight,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:26.580
or taking food in well, is to keep a chart
of some sort that charts how many feeds they're

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.480
having, how long they were at the breast,
how many bowel movements they've had in twenty-four

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.310
hours, as well as how many wet diapers they've
had in twenty-four hours. And at any time

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.440
that you have any concerns, call your pediatrician
or a lactation consultant for a weight check.
