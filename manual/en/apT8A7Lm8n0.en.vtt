00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
in the simulation you will learn how to
use page properties and give your

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:07.649
website a unique to find look I've
Dreamweaver open with just one image

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.509
text links and a white background you
can work on a blank web page or page you

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:16.500
have started that is ready to be worked
on page properties is located at the

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.880
bottom of the page in the properties
inspector upon opening page properties

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.810
you will see six categories on the left
hand side for the sake of this

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.150
simulation we will just be working with
appearance CSS and Link CSS alright

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.950
let's begin in the appearance CSS
category in this category you can change

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:40.410
this page font the size the text color
the background color you can insert a

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.940
background image you can repeat just
means whether or not your background

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.390
image should repeat and you can also
change the margins of your site alright

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.789
so now i'm going to set everything up
for my website my page font I think I'm

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:05.280
gonna go with Arielle size 16 text color
will do a dark gray and background color

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.240
i think i'll do a navy blue just be
careful when choosing a background color

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.840
because you don't want it to clash with
your text and you don't want it to be

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.460
too striking so just keep that in mind
i'm not going to do insert a background

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.119
image into my site but if you choose to
do so all you have to do is save the

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.680
image in your images folder and just
browse for the image

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.830
the margins I'm going to set the left
top right and bottom margin all at 100

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.990
let's hit apply and you can see some of
our changes occur and our text font and

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.700
size changes the color and the
background also changes so now let's

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.910
look at the link category so go back
into page properties and go to link CSS

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.170
okay here you can also change the link
font the size the link color' role over

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.130
visited active link colors as well okay
for my link thought I'm going to go

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.140
again with ariel and i'll just do 16 i'm
going to leave my link color at the gray

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.640
color since it doesn't clash with my
text and then i will change visited

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:20.190
links to read rollover links to yellow
active links to wipe and i will hit

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.690
apply and ok as you can see our links
stay grey we don't see any of the other

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.000
colors because unlike the appearance tab
you don't see the changes occur in the

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.250
work area you must preview them in web
browser alright so now you have learned

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.060
a basic understanding of how to use page
properties in adobe dreamweaver and

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.239
you're going to start applying these
changes to your own website good luck
