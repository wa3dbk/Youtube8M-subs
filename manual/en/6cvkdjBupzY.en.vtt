00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.070 position:95%
the most exciting and rewarding adventures a family can take.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.580 position:98%
The park is home to thousands of wild animals and nearly 10,000

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:18.790 position:88%
thermal features that are sure to amaze almost any young

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.820 position:83%
mind and soul. For most families, the connections and

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.920 position:66%
discoveries made here can last a lifetime.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:28.550 position:88%
But, Yellowstone can be as dangerous as it is beautiful.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.080 position:89%
For this reason, the best trips start with a safety talk.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.120 position:77%
Help your kids learn about the hot water hazards.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.100 position:97%

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.800 position:91%
Help your family learn why it is important to walk and not

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.800 position:97%
run in the thermal basins. Visitors should always remain on boardwalks

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:51.840 position:97%
and trails where they are available, but hot pools can be almost

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.810 position:63%
anywhere in the park, so explore safely.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.120 position:97%

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.310 position:92%
humans to stay 100 yards from bears and wolves and 25 yards

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:08.550 position:97%
from all other wildlife. Look for ways to help your kids learn why

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.660 position:98%
these laws are in place and how they can help protect the park.

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.360 position:98%
during their vacation. Even if your kids are not interested in completing

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.240 position:97%
the requirements for those programs, introduce them to a ranger.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.070 position:64%
It could open a whole new world for them.

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.870 position:73%

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.900 position:86%
Rain gear is a must. If you pack it, it might not rain.

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.930 position:88%

If your kids will need a stroller, you must bring one from home.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:05.910 position:92%
Plan ahead by packing some books, games or other items that

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.150 position:97%
can keep your young ones interested at night or if the weather

The lodges do not offer game rooms, pools and other things you might

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:21.790 position:97%
find on some trips. Here, it is nature and you that supplies the excitement.

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:27.240 position:88%
When planning your days here, take into account the long

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.370 position:95%
distances between stops. The speed limit is 45 miles per hour

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.430 position:91%
or lower in the park. The mountainous roads are narrow and

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.280 position:97%
this place is bigger than most people realize. Carry snacks, water

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.760 position:97%
and games in the car, just in case you get delayed by construction

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.550 position:97%
