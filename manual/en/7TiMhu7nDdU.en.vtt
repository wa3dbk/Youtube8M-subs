MYA (VOICEOVER): "Full
Time Kid," with Mya.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.484
[GIGGLING]

00:00:04.484 --> 00:00:05.750
Hi, I'm Mya.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:08.960
Today on "Full Time Kid," we'll
be making homemade ice cream.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.580
Here's what you'll need-- a
measuring cup, three one gallon

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.595
freezer bags, a towel, a cup
of milk, a cup of heavy cream,

00:00:17.595 --> 00:00:22.490
half a cup of sugar, two half
cups of salt, a pinch of salt,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.840
half a teaspoon of vanilla
extract, and 10 cups of ice.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:35.948
In the first freezer bag, pour
the milk, heavy cream, sugar,

00:00:35.948 --> 00:00:39.775
pinch of salt, and
vanilla extract.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.150
Try to take out most
of the air so it

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.690
can be as flat as possible.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.955
Then mix it together.

00:00:50.955 --> 00:00:54.346
In the second freezer bag,
pour five cups of ice.

00:00:54.346 --> 00:00:55.595
If it's too cold, wear gloves.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.364
Then put half a cup of salt.

00:01:01.364 --> 00:01:03.610
Mix them together to make brine.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.897
Brine is just salt and
water mixed together.

00:01:07.897 --> 00:01:09.730
Do the same thing with
the third freezer bag

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.120
so you'll have two
freezer bags of brine.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.100
The bags of brine will
freeze the ice cream

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.910
much quicker and smoother
than using a freezer.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:20.112
Lay the bags flat on half of the
towel with the bag of ice cream

00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:22.510
mix sandwiched between
the bags of brine.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:24.440
Fold the other half
of the towel on top

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:26.790
of the bags for insulation.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.030
Now let's wait for the
ice cream mix to freeze.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.530
It takes about 30
minutes or more.

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.367
I'm going to go play
outside while I wait.

00:01:40.325 --> 00:01:42.313
[COMPUTER GAME SOUND EFFECTS]

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:45.300
Woo.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.600
I'm working up a sweat.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.458
I could sure go
for some ice cream.

00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:51.350
Awesome!

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.990
My ice cream is done.

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.960
To serve, cut a corner of the
bag and squeeze it into a bowl.

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.130
This recipe makes
about one pint.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.295
You can put any leftovers
in a freezer safe container.

00:02:04.295 --> 00:02:05.780
Mm.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.535
That's it.

00:02:06.535 --> 00:02:08.035
Thanks for learning
how to make home

00:02:08.035 --> 00:02:10.680
made ice cream on
"Full Time Kid."

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:12.250
Here's what you'll
need-- a measuring

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.730
cup, three one fre-- gallon.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.770
I'm sorry.

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.285
Three one freezer gallon bags.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.630
(LAUGHING) Three one
freezer gallon bags.

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.961
Wait, gallon freezer bags.

00:02:23.961 --> 00:02:24.460
Wait.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:25.870
I love this part.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.392
Putting my makeup on.

00:02:28.392 --> 00:02:31.160
Can I have more ice cream after?

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.080
Three one--

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.580
MAN: Gallon.

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:34.580
 --gallon freezer bags.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.980
Sorry.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.220
(SINGING) You need a
measuring cup, and some milk,

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.260
and some sugar and salt,
and vanilla, and a towel.
