00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Hi! This is Mike Meacham again at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
and I want to talk to you some more about some other inflatable technologies

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
we're working on to slow down bigger and heavier things on Mars.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
(music)

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
When we're coming into Mars, we're going over 10,000 miles an hour,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
several times faster than the speed of sound, and we have to wait until we're  only

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
going twice the speed of sound before we can deploy our parachute.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
So we wanted to work on some other device that we could inflate when we're going even faster than that,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
so we can pull the E brake when were coming in.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
(music)

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This other device we call the SIAD, Supersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator, SIAD.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We are able to inflate this around our heat shield and increase our drag area

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
by sometimes even twice as much as it normally would be.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So we saw that crazy test with the parachute before, right?

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
That's in order for us to load up our parachute to the same types of forces

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
it's going to feel on Mars. We wanted to do the same thing with the SIAD.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
So we went back to the same track. We had to make a whole new rocket sled.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
It's a huge one. It's bigger than a house. It weighs 50,000 lbs.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
So we strap a bunch of rockets to this huge sled.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We drive this down the track going about 250 miles per hour and  inflate the SIAD

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and we study all the different things that are going to happen to it under this same aerodynamic load.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The atmosphere on Mars is a whole lot thinner than the atmosphere we have here on Earth.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
There's really only one place you can go to test your devices in a relevant environment

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
and that's way up in the sky here -- the upper atmosphere.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Pretty soon we're going to go out to Hawaii to a facility that they have there.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
We're going to take a balloon that's literally the size of a whole football stadium.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:47.000
It's going to pick up our test vehicle. It's going to go up about 120,000 feet into the upper atmosphere

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Our test vehicle is going to drop off the balloon.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
It's going to spin up like a football for stability. Shoot sideways across the sky with a huge rocket.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Our rocket is going to bring it up to four times the speed of sound,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
where we can test our SIAD and our parachute in the same exact type of environment

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
that they're going to see on Mars.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
As crazy as these tests sound, they actually performed them over 40 years ago

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and we've been using that technology since then to land rovers on Mars.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
But it's time to go bigger. We want to land astronauts and bigger payloads on Mars.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So we want to see just how far we can push this technology.
