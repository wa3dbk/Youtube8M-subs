00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.049
In this clip, we're going to talk about the
proper way to remove and replace worn front

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:10.590
brake hoses on a nineteen ninety-one Ford
Explorer. In this step, we're going to talk

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.580
about the proper way to reinstall your brake
hose retaining clip, the alignment of your

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:23.500
brake hose and starting of the hydraulic line
in the back. On this particular vehicle, a

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.840
ninety-one Ford Explorer the clip is different
than any other vehicle. This is actually the

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:35.190
tough one. How this works, is your brake hose
has a flat portion here. You can see that,

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.489
let me show it to you that way. See that flat
spot. That flat spot aligns with a corresponding

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.469
flat spot on the body of the vehicle right
here. What you're going to do, is line those

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:54.429
up just like so. This clip, just imagine you
still have it lined up, will slide into this

00:00:54.429 --> 00:01:01.319
groove here and hold the hose tight to the
body. The clip is going to slip on just like

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:09.340
so. Your brake line will screw in through
here and tighten down. Just due to room, I

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:23.770
can't really show you on the vehicle.

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.909
You may have to take and tap that clip down
into position. Alright. You can see the ears

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.580
are just barely sticking over the top. That
is fully seated. You're going to want to go

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:38.890
ahead and give a tug on your brake hose to
make sure it's secure. Once you have your

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.630
clip in place and the hose seated, you can
go ahead and start the brake line just by

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.719
screwing it into the back. You're going to
want run it down as far as you can by hand.

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:53.590
Just because, manipulating a wrench inside
here is kind of difficult and the less you

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:58.790
have to do the better. I've got in snugged
down. Take my eleven millimeter wrench and

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.969
put it on the fitting. Once you've got it,
go ahead and continue turning clockwise until

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:09.780
it tightens down. Once you have it tight or
approximately a quarter turn farther. And,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.890
that is the proper way to install your hose,
clip and tighten down the hydraulic fitting.
