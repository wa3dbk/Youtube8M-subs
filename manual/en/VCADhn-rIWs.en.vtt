&gt;&gt;EMMA: Hi, I’m Emma and I study in the
School of Media and Communication at RMIT,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.190
Melbourne Australia,

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:15.620
and I’m here to show you all the amazing
things RMIT has to offer you.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:27.070
Our students produce some of the best work
in the field of media and communication.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:33.930
Some of our students have won international
prizes.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:40.610
We offer programs in advertising, animation,
communication, creative writing, design, games,

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:48.430
journalism, media, music, photography, public
relations, publishing and screen.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.510
We have international media and communications
academics and industry practitioners,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.350
who all work in our state of the art facilities
all around our Melbourne City Campus.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:08.350
Around campus there are plenty of activities
and clubs you can be part of

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.110
including sports, music events and even the
Rubik's cube championship!

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:20.150
&gt;&gt;JILLIAN: I chose to study at RMIT whilst
I was studying in Malaysia. I found that RMIT

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.640
offered the same course, with excellent facilities
and lecturers with industry experience.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.430
&gt;&gt;RYAN: RMIT really stood out to me because
it presented itself as a much more hands on

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:29.430
university.

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.590
&gt;&gt;JILLIAN: If you’re interested in studying
in this field, then you need to be passionate

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:33.590
about the industry.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.840
&gt;&gt;RYAN: I love how different every lecturer
and tutor is – each of them have their own

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.680
unique experiences to share with us and that’s
really inspiring.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.880
&gt;&gt;JILLIAN: Melbourne is a great city and RMIT
helped me to make some really lovely friends.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.259
&gt;&gt;RYAN: As an international student, it was
a bit scary moving to Melbourne, but now I

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.330
can’t imagine being anywhere else. Everyone
here is so friendly and I’m just so comfortable

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:52.330
here.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:53.330
It’s my kind of city.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:59.759
&gt;&gt;EMMA: During your studies at RMIT you’ll
have many options to gain your global passport

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.810
such as working on class projects with students
from overseas universities, going on study

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:13.500
tours or undertaking a semester's exchange
in Europe, North America or even Asia.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.020
During your studies with RMIT you’ll have
access to a range of industry partners to

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.190
help you get on the job training and develop
a list of contacts to fast track your career.

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.780
Our media and design programs hold end of
the year student exhibitions, which is a great

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.080
way to showcase your work in front of friends,
family, industry and the general public.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:41.140
And at the end of your studies you’ll be
one of the most employable media and communication

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:44.880
graduates in the country.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:53.030
Many of our graduates are working in companies
all around the world. And some have even started

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.100
their own business.
