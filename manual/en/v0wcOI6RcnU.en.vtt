00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:01.299
Yo what's going on, guys?

00:00:01.299 --> 00:00:03.090
Troy here with WeightGainNetwork.com.

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:08.090
I'm chillin inside L.A. Urban Fitness, one
of my favorite supplement stores in the L.A.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.090
area.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.010
If you guys are anywhere in Marina del Rey
or Santa Monica, California, make sure you

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:13.010
guys check it out.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:14.610
They've got a sick selection.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:23.669
I want to get right into the best protein
powders for naturally skinny guys.

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:27.070
Being a naturally skinny guy, being an ectomorph,
you got to keep in mind that you have a really

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.740
fast metabolism.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.769
I'm also assuming in this video that you guys
can only afford one quality protein powder

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:35.769
a month.

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:38.960
In a perfect world, you're going to want that
really rapid-digesting protein post-workout;

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.910
you're going to want that really slow-digesting
protein right before you go to bed, and then

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.870
you're going to want that meal replacement
protein.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.860
But the three proteins I'm going to recommend
to you guys actually are going to achieve

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.780
all three because I have a blend of six different
kinds of proteins, which is perfect for big

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.700
and naturally skinny guys.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.739
You have the really rapid-digesting protein
like your isolate, your hydrolyzed protein.

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:06.260
You have the medium-digesting proteins like
your eggs and your whey protein concentrate.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.120
And then you have the really slow-digesting
form of protein – the casein protein that'll

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.260
keep you guys full; it'll keep drip-feeding
your muscles with all those amino acids.

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.310
So I want to get right into my three favorite
protein powders for naturally skinny guys,

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.740
and these are three of the more mainstream
protein powders.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.540
You guys should be able to pick them up on
bodybuilding.com or amazon.com, or essentially

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.560
any of the major nutrition and supplement
websites.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.520
First up – this is a newer one.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.840
It's actually one that I've been taking recently.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.540
This is Combat Protein Powder by Muscle Pharm,
and the thing that I really like about Combat

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.600
Protein Powder here is it has 25 grams of
protein per serving and it also has a really

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.980
high amount of branched-chain amino acids
and L-glutamine.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:55.250
Glutamine is going to naturally boost your
immune system, so if you're going to the gym,

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.520
you're hitting all those compound exercises
– I hope – really hard, you're doing your

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.140
deadlift and your squat and all those awesome
compound exercises, and you're breaking down

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.140
your body, and your body is – you're actually
lowering your immune system.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:13.980
You're entering a state of – a catabolic
state, so by having lots of glutamine along

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.030
with your protein post-workout, this is going
to help your body recover quicker, help you

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:19.440
guys turn into a machine.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.160
And it also has those branched-chain amino
acids, your body's most important amino acids

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:29.290
for going from the state of catabolism to
getting in that muscle-building, anabolic

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.390
state.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.890
It's got all six proteins here – excuse
me, this one has five.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.090
It's an eight-hour release of five protein
sources, so it's got your fast-release, your

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.310
medium-release and your slow-release, so you
guys are covered there.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.180
It also has really low sugar – just 1.5
grams of sugar.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.960
Obviously when you're taking it post-workout,
you want to spike your insulin but just as

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.730
a quality meal replacement shake.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.021
This is going to drip-feed your muscles with
really good amino acids; it's delicious, and

00:02:59.021 --> 00:03:01.920
I highly recommend Combat Protein Powder.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.740
Next up we got Muscle Tech Phase 8.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.190
Now supposedly Phil Heath takes this stuff.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.630
He's pretty big if you've seen him before,
but this is the multi-phase, eight-hour protein.

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:19.660
A lot of that's just marketing you know, some
say it's six hours, some say eight, some say

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:25.080
nine – all three of these proteins are essentially
the same thing.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.490
With that being said, Muscle Tech Phase 8,
it's got the same thing – it's got your

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.800
slow, medium and fast-release protein powders.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:37.690
It's got some digestive enzymes that help
your body break down protein easier, and only

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.990
2 grams of fat, no grams of sugar, 7 carbs
and most importantly, it's going to give your

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:45.959
body an abundance of quality amino acids.

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:51.210
When you buy stuff like this, you can take
it post-workout.

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:54.520
It's got some fast-digesting proteins; you
can take it even before you go to bed because

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.230
it's going to slowly release these amino acids
into your bloodstream.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.190
So you can really kill two birds with one
stone and use this stuff post-workout and

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.300
even before you go to bed, being a naturally
skinny guy.

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.340
So Muscle Tech Phase 8 – another really
high-quality ingredient profile.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.489
And last but not least, Syntha-6.

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:18.090
This stuff probably tastes the best out of
all of them.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.039
This is a new one here – peanut butter cookie.

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:25.360
I mean, I've had this stuff before; it literally
tastes like a milkshake.

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.169
The thing about this stuff, I would only recommend
it to the really serious hardgainer.

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.539
It's got a ton of carbs in it; it only has
2 grams of sugar, but you're looking at about

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:40.180
15 carbohydrates per serving, so it's got
a lot more carbs than the Combat Protein Powder

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:41.180
and the Phase 8.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.770
But if you guys just started working out,
you guys are in-between the ages of 14 and

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:51.939
18 and you're a really serious hardgainer,
the extra carbs are sure not going to hurt

00:04:51.939 --> 00:04:57.490
you, and this still has an abundance of branched-chain
amino acids and L-glutamine.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:03.520
We have 22 grams of protein per serving; it's
got a few more filler ingredients, but if

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.270
you guys don't like the taste of some of these
other protein powders, I promise you, you

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:08.289
guys will love this.

00:05:08.289 --> 00:05:12.629
And most importantly, if you enjoy the taste,
you guys are going to drink it more and be

00:05:12.629 --> 00:05:17.630
excited to drink it post-workout and before
you go to bed and as a meal replacement.

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.659
Like this one, they advertise “Use anytime,
day or night” and being a naturally skinny

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:26.110
guy, that is ideal for you.

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:31.080
And let's see here – we have the whey protein
concentrate, the isolate, the casein, the

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:35.009
milk protein, the egg protein, the glutamine,
the branched-chain amino acids, so all the

00:05:35.009 --> 00:05:39.729
stuff that the other two have, just a few
more filler, but Syntha-6 is another high-quality

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:43.969
protein for you naturally skinny guys to bulk
up and gain lean muscle mass.

00:05:43.969 --> 00:06:25.389
So those were my three favorite protein powders
for naturally skinny guys to build muscle.
