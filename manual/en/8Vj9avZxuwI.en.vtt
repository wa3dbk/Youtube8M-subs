00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980
Hey guys Chris fix here and today I'm going to show you

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:05.700
how to prevent your windows from fogging up.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:08.960
Sure you could use products from the store to keep your windows from fogging up

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:13.760
but did you know you could find products around your house that will do the same thing

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.900
In this video were going to test potatoes,  baby shampoo,  hand sanitiser and shaving cream

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.360
against the store bought anti-fogging treatment

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.100
so lets first go over why windows get all foggy.

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.980
Fog happens because theres a temperature change and because theres humidity...

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.780
right now its cold outside, my body heat is warm, and my breath is warm and its humid...

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.860
and thats what creates fog in the winter time.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.540
In the summer time it's kind of the opposite, it's warm outside...

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.760
but you turn your AC on on the inside, so it's cool on the inside and any of the moisture inside the car...

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.500
is going to turn into fog on your windshield.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.960
To get the glass foggy I have a hot pot of water...

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.640
as you can see the glass fogs up completely...

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.860
and this is our control test, so that you know the glass will fog up.

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.480
Now I can go and clean off the glass...

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.740
and we will section off the window in 5 parts to test each defogger.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.140
Now with the window sectioned into 5 parts...

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.440
let's apply the products.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.580
The first product we're going to try is the Rain.X Anti Fog...

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.260
the directions say just to put some on a towel...

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.180
and just rub it right on the glass.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.000
Make sure you cover all of the glass...

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.700
and then take a dry spot on the paper towel and lightly wipe so it removes any streaking.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.180
So the top left square is the Rain.X.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.460
The next product we're going to use is shaving cream.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.260
All you do with the shaving cream is get a little bit onto the glass...

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.860
and then you work it in with a paper towel.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.720
I'm using a new paper towel so we don't contaminate.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.200
Again make sure you cover all the glass.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:51.760
Now you buff off all of this until it's clear.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.860
And eventually it get's clean, this definately takes a little more effort then using the Rain.X...

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.820
Ok our shaving cream on the top here is done.

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.700
We'll move down to the bottom corner.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.780
On the bottom corner I'll be using an old scuba driving  trick that I use for my mask.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.280
If it keeps the mask from fogging up 60ft under water

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.500
It should work on my truck

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.800
so we'll just apply that, again making sure we get it everywhere

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.500
and then we'll get a clean paper towel and just lightly go over the top

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.100
So we remove any streaking so its nice and clear

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:27.840
When your doing this you don't want to remove the layer you're putting on here

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.820
you just want to make sure you can see through the glass and its clear

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:31.780
Now lets test the potato

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.540
So your probably thinking potato ? what the heck ?

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.560
this is one of the urban legends as a scuba diver, you're suppose to be able to split a potato

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.420
And then just take the end here

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.480
And you rub it on the glass

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.120
Make sure that you cover all of the glass

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:51.060
The Liquid from the potato is actually pretty clear, Maybe this will actually work

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.800
To be honest with you i've never actually tried it

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.360
Get a clean paper towel and we'll just lightly buff off any off the streaks

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.980
And thats streak free and looks good

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.880
And then the last one is going to be the hand sanitiser

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.520
just get a little bit and put it right on there

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:08.400
and then we'll rub it right in

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.120
And then we'll get a new paper towel and buff it out

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.380
Get that nice and clear just like the others

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.400
So in this corner we have the rain.x

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.040
Shaving cream

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.120
Baby Soap

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.740
Potato

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:26.100
Hand Sanitiser

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.440
Now lets go get the steaming hot water and see how it works

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.260
So we have our hot pot of water

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:33.180
Lets test it out

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.080
So as we can see our rain.x

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.100
And our shaving cream

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:48.260
Worked great

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:49.480
Now if we go down to the bottom here

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.740
Our baby shampoo left some kind on residue when it gets humid

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:57.400
so it does not look that great

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:00.980
Actually feels kinda soapy, which makes sense

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.500
Our potato again, left some kind of residue, doesn't  look that clear, its not soapy at least

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.280
And then our hand senatiser which is alcohol the reason people say it works is because its alcohol

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:16.740
That obviously didn't work

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:19.720
So from our results we can see the top 2 came out great

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.040
These 3 didn't work out that well

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.960
The Worst being the hand sanitiser

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:28.160
But the Potato and the baby soap didn't work that great either

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.180
So in conclusion  the shaving cream worked just as well as the store bought rain.x

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:33.780
Everybody has shaving cream at home

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.800
So in my mind its a clear winner, you don't need to go out and buy anything special

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:43.340
It didn't fog up, it looks nice and clear, and it was pretty easy to apply

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.640
The results speak for them selves

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.060
Before and after

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:48.600
No shaving cream

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:49.720
Shaving cream

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.480
Pretty good difference there

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.040
Hopefully this video was helpful

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.020
If it was, remember to give it a thumbs up

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:57.540
