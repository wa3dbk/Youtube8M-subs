00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:01.434
In today’s 2 minute tip,

00:00:01.434 --> 00:00:05.171
 I’ll show you how we train plants to grow up our conduit remesh trellises.

00:00:05.171 --> 00:00:07.640
I’ll start with pole beans, which are the easiest. 

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:10.760
All you have to do is plant them at the bottom of the trellis, 

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.879
and they'll start climbing all on their own.

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.116
Here you can see scarlet runner beans winding their way up a trellis.

00:00:16.116 --> 00:00:17.717
They don’t need to be tied to the trellis, 

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:21.154
because they grip it very tightly on their own. 

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:23.590
On occasion a bean plant will stray away from the trellis. 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.958
All you have to do when this happens

00:00:24.958 --> 00:00:30.597
 is gently weave it back in.

00:00:30.597 --> 00:00:35.902
Winter squash, pumpkins, and watermelons have tendrils that cling to the trellis. 

00:00:35.902 --> 00:00:39.139
However, tendrils alone won’t hold the weight of the plants,

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:43.309
 so I gently weave them back and forth through the trellis for additional support.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.746
This acorn squash starts out in front, then moves to the back, 

00:00:46.746 --> 00:00:48.815
and then to the front and so on. 

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:50.650
To some extent, they’ll do this on their own,

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.520
 but I also gently persuade them to follow this pattern.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.190
 Usually the plants are malleable enough to change sides every 3 to 5 squares, 

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:01.461
but when they aren’t, I coax them where I want them to go by tying them off with garden tape 

00:01:01.461 --> 00:01:04.197
or strips of fabric.

00:01:04.197 --> 00:01:08.702
When the fruit start getting larger, I sometimes tie the plant, near the fruit, to the trellis.

00:01:08.702 --> 00:01:12.572
This provides enough support for acorn squash and butternut squash,

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:16.343
but larger pumpkins, cushaw squash, and watermelons need more support.

00:01:16.343 --> 00:01:22.150
So I fashion hammocks out of old t-shirts to to hold the larger fruit.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.151
We use the same weaving with our indeterminate tomatoes,

00:01:25.151 --> 00:01:29.656
 weaving them from the front to the back, to the front, and so on.

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:31.224
When the plants are thin like this one, 

00:01:31.224 --> 00:01:33.460
I can easily weave them through the trellis.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:34.394
 But when they’re thick,

00:01:34.394 --> 00:01:42.469
 I use garden tape or fabric to gently pull them in the right direction. 

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:45.380
This may seem time consuming, but it really isn’t.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.641
 I usually do it when I’m out harvesting or casually strolling around the garden.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:52.212
 I’d guess it takes about 15 minutes per week. 

00:01:52.212 --> 00:01:56.750
This approach also works great for peas and cucumbers.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.751
Well, thats all for now.

00:01:57.751 --> 00:02:07.761
Thank you very much for watching this 2 minute tip.
