00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:12.059
MooMonitor+ uses technology which was first developed for rockets and torpedoes

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.599
to precisely the measure each cow's behavior and their movement.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.860
And from this we can determine if the cow's resting, if the cow's ruminating, if she is feeding 

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.060
or what level of activity the cow   is showing.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.009
Using this information we can monitor 24/7
what cow is doing and we can present this

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.960
information right on a mobile phone to the
farmer and he can make decisions based on that

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.300
such as looking for health alerts, looking
to know when is the right time to breed cows

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.559
And these are the hugely critical things on modern farms.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:54.340
We all know herds are growing in size everywhere but still herds are composed of individual cows.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:57.510
So for a herd to remain profitable we need

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.090
to pay particular attention to health and
fertility of every individual cow within that herd.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.770
There's two ways of doing that...

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.920
You either employ lots of people because right time consuming to be observing cows several times a day

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:09.580
and several times during the night.
So you need more staff or you need to spend

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.100
more time on your farm.
Or the other option is to invest to technology.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.360
Dairymaster are launching the MooMonitor+ which is the most precise activity based system currently available.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.000
It monitors the cow' s activity and based

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.210
on the activity it determines what behavioral characteristics the cows are showing.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.409
So it will tell us whether she is in heat, whether she is eating, whether she is resting,

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.189
whether she is ruminating, whether she is
restless, whether she is walking.

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:40.480
So it has a lot of benefits like that.
So basically it functions similar to an electronic stock-man

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:44.200
in that it takes the workout of monitoring your cows.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.540
There might be low rumination, high resting, then what the MooMonitor+ does is it measures it,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:55.579
it plots it down and if the farmer puts
it in to his adjustments then it will actually

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.750
push out an alert and you will see something on your App,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.340
on your phone or on your PC or whatever, that says ok "This cow, health alert".

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.289
So if you go out and you see that this cow
is actually not really herself, in that order

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.850
the MooMonitor+ is great help in finding out
which cows are not doing as well or as good as

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.139
they should be doing.
So you are actually walking up ahead of problems

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:25.639
instead of running after them and you might be able to intervene a little bit quicker than normal.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.760
The level of technology within this, which is what really gets me going, there is nothing like it!

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.850
This is a full 32-bit processor on each cow's neck.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.790
Your PC up to a couple of years ago was a 32-bit processor.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.840
This type of power, this type of technology,
is now on every cow in many corners of the globe.
