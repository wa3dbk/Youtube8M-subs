year is a symbol of the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:20.860
holidays and many winter celebrations around
the

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.570
world, but in 1941 the world was at war. Not
only was the

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.560
world at war but there was an attack that
will never

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.920
be forgotten in American history and that
attack is Pearl Harbor. The surprise attack

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.649
by Japan on the United States Naval Base,
took place on the island of a Oahu in Hawaii.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.039
The date will never be forgotten in American
history with many lives lost on Sunday, December

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.499
7th, 1941.
The attack was planned in a sneaky way.

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:53.629
The Japanese told the Americans that
they wanted peace,

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.289
while thinking a plan to attack. It is
also said

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.499
that the attack was done at 7:02 AM on
a Sunday morning

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:05.690
hoping to catch the American soldiers
sleeping. With their forces ready to

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.969
attack
Japanese flight commander Mitsuo Fujita

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:14.479
called for his forces to begin their
assault his words in Japanese one out to

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.240
all his forces saying,
"Tara, Tara, Tara," which in English

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.530
is, "Tiger, Tiger, Tiger." It only took to
hours to complete the Japanese attack on

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:30.240
the Americans
by the time the Japanese were done 2280

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.500
american serviceman
and sixty eight civilians were dead.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.130
1,109 were wounded.
Eight battleships were damaged and five

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.890
sunk.
Three light cruisers, three destroyers

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:48.619
and three smaller bolts were lost along
with 188 aircraft.

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.799
A few random facts about Pearl Harbor is
that after the attack,

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.829
eight ships were damaged but only two
were left unrepaired.

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:02.920
Like the USSWest Virginia and the USS
California had sunk completely but were raised

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.780
by the Navy
any eventually repaired and reused. There

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.130
are also still areas
at Pearl Harbor, that still have damage

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:14.860
from the Japan attacks.
For example Wheeler Army Airfield

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:18.820
Hickman Army Airfield and others still
show damage

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.410
from bullets fired that day to serve as
a reminder to never forget the lives

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:27.330
that were lost on that day.
Today more than 70 years

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.760
later, 1.5 million visitors come to the
memorial

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.020
that float over the sunken USS Arizona
and in the words of President Franklin

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:40.390
Roosevelt, "December 7th will be
a date which will lead in infamy."
