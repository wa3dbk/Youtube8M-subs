00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:06.640
I'm Dr. Joe Neely. I practice with the Barton
Oaks Dental Group. I'd like to talk about

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:14.640
preventive care or just home care. What are
you trying to accomplish in a brush and floss

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:22.050
and those sorts of things? If you could think
about it conceptually you want to try to keep

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:33.010
the eating utensils of your mouth as clean
as you do the eating utensils in your kitchen.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:41.750
This morning, after I had breakfast, fixed
my granddaughter some toast, the plate got

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:51.620
food on it, the utensils still have food on
them from this morning. I doubt that anybody

00:00:51.620 --> 00:01:00.410
would really want to eat their next meal with
these. But, many people after a meal allow

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:09.680
the food, except for the large hunks, to remain
on their teeth all day long. Conceptually,

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:17.909
all you're trying to do with a toothbrush
or floss or tooth picks or whatever is simply

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:28.180
to find the most efficient way of cleaning
the substances off of your teeth and gums.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:38.780
Weather it's using something as simple as
a washcloth on an eating utensil or some other

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:46.880
type of scrub brush that actually fits that
utensil, it's a simple process of determining

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:59.680
the easiest way to get to the accumulated
food matter. For most people a small toothbrush

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.939
that's flexible, can fit in between the teeth,
get into the nooks and crannies. Or, a piece

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.940
a floss that can be draped around the tooth
in between and hug against the tooth to clean

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:21.980
the surface. Or, a small toothpick that can
slide up under the gum. Whatever the easiest

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:30.150
way to clean the surfaces of your teeth, the
most efficient way to get the food products

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:42.540
off of your teeth so that you're eating with
clean utensils instead of dirty utensils is

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.380
the whole idea.
