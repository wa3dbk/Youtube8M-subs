00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:17.340
Hello everybody it is jrobi again with another
Grandmaster Chess Tactics video I’d like

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.340
to do.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.630
And this position actually took place in a
game between Magnus Carlsen and Levon Aronian

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.869
in the recent Bilbao 2008 chess tournament.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:29.899
And Magnus was playing white in this position
and it is white to move.

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:35.820
Now the tournament itself interestingly enough
the average ELO rating of the tournament participants

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.620
was 2775, which is the highest average ELO
rating of all time for chess tournaments.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.579
So this tournament’s definitely going to
go down in the books as one of the strongest

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:47.780
chess tournaments of all time.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.340
And now I’ve put the full PGN on up on my
jrobichess.com of the entire tournament.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.590
It is on the left hand side when you first
go to the site in the tournament section.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.879
So definitely take a look.

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.460
Like, I mean, one of the things that really
stuck out to me about this tournament as I

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.810
was kind of tracking the progress was that
even at the top levels of chess mistakes happen

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.880
and you are just punished for them.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.510
Like, I mean, these are the best chess players
in the world and when a mistake takes place

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.899
on the board, you know, they get punished
for it.

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:21.549
And to me that just says that the game of
chess itself is, you know, it is vibrant and

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:22.880
it is strong.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.650
And to me that speaks volumes about the competitive
aspects of chess.

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.110
Like, I mean, you know these are the best
players in the world squaring off.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.130
And it is not just about their knowledge or
their memorization; it is also about who they

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.320
are as people when they sit down to face their
opponent.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:39.180
It doesn’t matter if you are a man or a
woman or a boy or girl.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.759
When you sit down in a game of chess it is
your brain at that time versus your opponent’s

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:44.759
brain.

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:50.480
And it is the degree of competition, the level
of competition, demands that somebody, you

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.820
know, is going to make a mistake.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:55.560
It might end up in a draw; maybe you have
really good play from both people.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.750
But at the end of a tournament run, you know,
mistakes will happen.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.630
And that’s just the beauty of the competitive
aspects of chess.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.860
So this tournament even though it had the
highest ELO average of all time, we are still

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.930
shown that at the competitive levels, even
at the top competitive levels chess is still

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:12.930
a competition.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.040
There is winners, there is losers, there is
exciting stuff taking place.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.600
So that’s good because when you look at
the chess engines and you watch chess engines

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.280
play each other, those are the most boring
games you’ll ever go through.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:26.500
But when you are talking about the best in
the world at chess when it comes to people,

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.920
whether it is men or women, you know, there
is exciting stuff going on.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.650
There is wins, losses, draws, just it is great
stuff.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.319
And that’s what the game should always be
about.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:39.280
Anyway this is one of my favorite positions
from the tournament so far.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.760
And Magnus Carlsen was playing white and it
is white to move in this position.

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:48.020
Aronian just played the Pawn down to E5 attacking
Magnus’s Bishop.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.440
So if you want to pause the video and see
if you can figure out what Carlsen played

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:52.440
in this position.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.970
Definitely go ahead and do so and I am going
to take a look at both players positions and

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.769
then we will get into the move that was actually
played.

00:02:57.769 --> 00:02:59.030
So if you look at white first of all.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.590
So white’s King is nice and safe on G1.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.210
The Rooks are connected.

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:07.190
And white also has a very powerful presence
along this diagonal with the Queen supporting

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.340
the Bishop.

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.670
Now this Bishop here on D4 is being attacked
currently.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.340
So that’s definitely something to consider.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:17.870
But you’ll also notice that white is down
a pawn in material so far.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.569
But even though that’s the case white still
has a Bishop pair and the board is still fairly

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:22.599
open.

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:26.629
So that’s definitely an advantage for white
to have those two Bishops on an open board

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:28.020
to work with.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:32.990
So even though white’s down one point in
material from a technical standpoint, in terms

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.170
of piece activity and presence white’s definitely
got a good position to work from.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.190
Now if we take a look at black’s position
on the other hand it is definitely quite a

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.190
different story.

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.360
Like we have the Rooks that are connected
which is good.

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:47.130
But the Queen seems to be passively placed
here on B8 and it is kind of married to the

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.269
protection of this Pawn currently.

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.750
The Bishop is protecting the isolated Pawn
on the A file and it is also stopping the

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.280
Rook from impacting this file.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.099
The Bishop also has another purpose in that
it is kind of protecting this diagonal from

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:02.530
being used by white to deliver a check.

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.690
Which kind of brings us to the biggest weakness
of black’s position in that this King is

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:06.690
very exposed.

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:12.240
And when you are facing a Bishop pair supported
by a Queen and the Rooks are still on the

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.209
board, like having an exposed King like that
definitely can’t be a good thing.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.410
The Knight over on F6 doesn’t really have
a lot of jump squares that it can access currently.

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:24.050
A lot of them are just simply it would be
captured.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.160
So the Knight isn’t really serving a huge
function right now.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.630
Actually it is not threatening anything and
it is not really defending anything either.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:37.589
So black’s position is although black is
a Pawn up in material it is definitely inferior

00:04:37.589 --> 00:04:38.710
to whites.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.029
Now the question though is what did Magnus
come up with in this position as the white

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:44.770
player to capitalize on black’s position.

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.919
Well he came up with a really brilliant move
actually.

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:51.760
And even though his Bishop is being attacked
from the Pawn on E5, Magnus comes crashing

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:54.640
into the position and captures the Bishop
with his Rook.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.349
And when I first saw this I was, you know,
immediately I stopped and you think to yourself,

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.440
well, you know, he’s just… he’s sacking
his rook for a Bishop.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.310
What’s going on, you know, what’s the
plan?

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.612
And you try to find the plan and interestingly
enough, you know, at the beginning of the

00:05:08.612 --> 00:05:13.380
video I was talking a little bit about mistakes
and how they happen at the top levels of chess.

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.330
Well Aronian made a mistake.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.029
And actually went and captured the Rook.

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:22.860
And from here Magnus was able to launch a
series of attacking moves that were just…

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:23.860
you couldn’t stop.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:27.830
Like he even put this position on the computer
and it just… it is building up to a crushing

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.210
victory.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.229
From here Magnus just lands a check.

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:36.050
The King moves to E6 and then Rook to A1 is
just devastating.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.980
So black has to block.

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:42.430
Brings the Rook down to D6 and then from here
white captures the Rook and as you can see

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:44.590
the position is just falling apart.

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.720
From here King captures and Magnus comes in
and delivers a check.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.149
The computer actually liked an immediate Rook
to A8 instead of coming in with the Queen

00:05:53.149 --> 00:05:54.149
check.

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:58.380
So Rook comes down this way here and attacks
the Queen.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.640
But nonetheless what Magnus played worked
just as well.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.960
So he comes in hits the check.

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.779
The King moves off and then from here now
Magnus plays Rook up.

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:09.600
And as you can see like, I mean, blacks position
is just getting ripped apart.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.500
From here Aronian plays the Queen back to
D6 and Carlsen just captures because once

00:06:15.500 --> 00:06:18.780
King recaptures he can just come in and grab
the Rook.

00:06:18.780 --> 00:06:22.850
And it wasn’t too many moves after actually
that Aronian resigned.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.090
Now you might be wondering what mistake I
was talking about.

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:30.469
Well if we go back to when the Rook captured
the Bishop on B4, Aronian had another move

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:32.440
that he could’ve done here in this position.

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:35.940
And instead of capturing the Rook it was to
capture the Bishop.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:40.260
And the engines have the Rook coming over
and capturing the Pawn after black plays that

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:46.000
and gives white theoretical one Pawn advantage
in positional strength.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:49.450
In terms of actual material though it would
have been equal.

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.919
So there was definitely no doubt Aronian missed
the best move in that position.

00:06:52.919 --> 00:06:57.140
But, you know, credit's also got to go to
Magnus Carlsen because he must’ve, you know,

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.380
looked at both options either (a) his Rook
gets captured and he has a completely winning

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.380
game.

00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.610
Or (b) his Bishop gets taken, material is
now balanced so he’s no longer down a Pawn.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.979
And he’s got a better position to work from.

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:13.320
So, you know, that’s the beauty of chess
and that’s, you know, what it is all about.

00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:14.320
So take care.

00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:14.680
Hope you enjoyed the video and we will see
you next time!
