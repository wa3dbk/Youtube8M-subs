00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:20.919
It's definitely with mixed feelings that I
made the decision to retire after this season.

00:00:20.919 --> 00:00:25.730
I love those folks and I have loved my time
with them.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.919
I have loved working on this great repertoire
with them.

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:34.110
Every year is a great, wonderful privilege
to live with that music and those singers

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.600
and those players, that we can get past so
many technical things and go to the heart

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.600
of music.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.910
And I will miss seeing those folks on a regular
basis.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:47.010
"Take us.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.120
Take us.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:57.040
singing Power to the lord, power to the lord,
power to the lord.

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.040
Take us.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.040
Take us.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.910
You know how beautiful it is. and 1..."

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.930
A specific work that was very challenging?

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.350
There were several, including Elijah that
we're in right now in the middle of; challenging

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.460
in a different way, challenging because Elijah
just has a whole lot of music for the chorus.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.460
We have to tell a story.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.330
So it's not enough to know the notes and the
rhythms and the words; but we have to be able

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.750
to communicate that in a way that makes it
compelling.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.280
Because it is a story.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:36.850
It is all of these stories around Elijah's
life and his work, and so we are there, the

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.300
music has to come alive as if we were actually
there and in the course of the action.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.060
So, that's our challenge.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.670
The Choral Union tends to always rise to the
occasion.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:54.300
"It's not but the lord, it's singing: But
the Lord, But the lord.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:02.920
We are very very English and 1..." singing:
But the lord but the lord....

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:05.870
We've grown in numbers, the group has gotten
a lot larger.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:14.670
I would say we've grown in selectivity, how
we can make choices from those who audition.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:20.409
We have grown in balance, the balance is a
little better between soprano, alto, tenor,

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.990
and bass, than it was when I started.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:27.730
I didn't start things, the Choral Union had
been around a long time before me, it'll be

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:30.520
around a long time after me.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:36.100
If there's something that I could say to the
Choral Union as I leave them, and that sounds

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:42.819
awfully final because we still have a whole
lot of work to do.... would just be to let

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:49.460
them know how grateful I am to them for their
love, for their support, for their dedication,

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:56.030
for how many people drive so far and give
up Monday evenings so often and weeks as we

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.030
go into Detroit.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:59.220
It's wonderful, I'm grateful for that.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.490
It has been an honor to stand on the podium
in front of you every week, and to lead you

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:08.500
in Messiahs and to prepare you for other orchestras
and conductors; it's been a great privilege,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.610
a privilege that I will treasure for the rest
of my life.

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:22.230
So my motivation has been because I love that
repertoire; it's the repertoire that I have

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:29.599
spent my life studying and the opportunity
to do it consistently, to develop a chorus

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:47.060
who can do it with skill has been a real motivation.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:04:00.560
