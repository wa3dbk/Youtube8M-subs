00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.589
 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.480
Toronto is the fourth largest city in
North America with more people moving in

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:11.309
every day.

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.259
This city is growing and we need the
transit system to grow with it.

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:20.550
The TTC and GO are already overcrowded
and set ridership records every year.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.029
This is why Metrolinx develop The Big Move, a Regional Transportation Plan.

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.109
It's also why the Government of Ontario
is investing in new public transit

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.850
including a sixteen billion dollar
investment, the biggest transit expansion

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.280
in the history of the region.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.809
One part of this investment is that
the Eglinton Crosstown, 

00:00:37.809 --> 00:00:41.079
a nineteen kilometer light rail
transit line

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:44.629
LRT for short. Light rail is new
to Toronto

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:48.800
but is used all around the world. Light rail vehicles can run an elevated

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.190
structures, in tunnels like a subway

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.079
or where there's room, on the surface
where they are fully separated from

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:55.680
traffic.

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.410
They carry more passengers than streetcars or buses and light rail vehicle cars 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.750
can be joined together to meet growing
demand.

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:05.869
Where they're on the surface,
construction will include

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:09.619
bike lanes, widened shelter platforms,
along with new trees.

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:13.590
Stop spacing and speeds will be similar
to the subways downtown

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.780
providing convenient, speed and reliability. Light rail vehicles being built on Crosstown 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.659
are fully accessible

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:23.860
level boarding and 100 percent low floor
interiors

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.619
mean people with wheelchairs and
strollers can travel with ease.

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.650
Multiple doors and the use of proof of 
payment make it easier for passengers to

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.290
board quickly and efficiently.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.329
The system will use the PRESTO
automated fare card

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.540
in addition to the standard TTC methods of payment.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.350
They're also electrically powered with
no emissions so not only will they help

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.560
move people in the city

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.720
but they are also environmentally friendly. Work on the Crosstown is already

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.390
underway.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.270
When it opens in 2020 the Crosstown 
will move 53 million riders per year

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.159
and significantly reduce travel times,
providing Toronto with comfortable,

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.950
convenient, reliable and fast transit. To
