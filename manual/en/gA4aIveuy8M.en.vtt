00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:09.120
Okay, we're doing a deck assessment evaluation.
This deck is probably twenty-years old, a

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.839
lot of the boards are really quite well up
against the house but as you get out farther

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:21.060
way from the house you get more weather, more
sun and it just destroys the boards. We have

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.130
some twelve footers here that we're going
to take out the nails, thank God it just has

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.420
nails, we can pop out the nails and replace
some of the twelve footers here that are really

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:38.860
bad. When you come up to the joints a lot
of time the joints for the boards are spongy

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:46.120
and bad on the ends of them. So what I do
is I'll take them and chop out from one section

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:53.330
to another joint and just replace that where
the joint of the boards meet and in the end

00:00:53.330 --> 00:01:00.481
where they get spongy and rot out. The person
here does not like these big ugly knots and

00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:04.540
we were going to chop them off here, but on
second thought we can chop the six by six

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.939
off here and we?re going to run the railing
straight across the tops of these and were

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:14.640
going to replace all the railing because all
the railing is just all shot. Once we get

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.990
these chopped off we can run our tops two
by six rail all the way along make it all

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.540
nice and straight, nice and even. Okay, this
is the other side of the deck and again we

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:34.711
have spongy rotted two by six redwoods here
and a lot of times you can just cut out a

00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:41.030
four foot section and replace where it's bad
and of course screw that down. They've replaced

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:45.889
a couple boards in here which just look really
terrible, those have to come up and we're

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:50.310
just going to replace anything that is bad
in the deck so that we bring it back up to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.270
what it should be. Now over here we have a
big six by six that has come out away from

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.789
the house. It?s come out a three quarters
of an inch to an inch everything is out of

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.539
plum here and we are going to take and cut
these posts off to run the railing along here.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:15.970
So what we are going to do is to run an i-bolt
over here into the house and the sole plate

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:22.280
come along and just pull this post here over
level so that our railing has a straight shot

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:31.250
and looks well here. This deck is twenty years
old, it has had a solid stain on it many times,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.970
we're not going to change the color we're
going to stay with this black, we're going

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.130
to replace the boards that need to be replaced
when we do that we'll have new wood. I'm going

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:44.590
to take and run my pressure washer and clean
it up all real good and get off all the dirt

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:54.310
and lose debris and than I'm going to take
and spray and pat on two coats of a solid

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.100
stain. I do that because with any bare wood
you can't just put on one coat and expect

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.540
it to hold up. You need to put on at least
two coats on any bare wood.
