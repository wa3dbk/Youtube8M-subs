00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:01.849
 Asus MeMO Pad 7

00:00:01.849 --> 00:00:06.390
 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.790
Hi everyone. So today we're taking a look at the

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.780
Asus MeMo  Pad 7. Now this is a 7in

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.750
tablet retailing at under £99. It first came onto the market

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.800
in June 2014 so it's certainly no slouch

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.790
from a performance point of view packing
a 1.86GHz

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.070
Intel Atom quad-core processor Z3745.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.150
We've looked at this processor before  and come away impressed so we certainly should expect

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.400
reasonable performance from this Asus
pad. So let's run through Asus MeMO Pad 7

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.840
the rest of the specs. First of all, obviously this is a 7-inch tablet

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.860
with a 1280x800 pixel display. It's running a 2-megapixel front-facing

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:50.640
camera

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.810
just about good enough for doing Skype
on reasonably well Asus MeMO Pad 7

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:57.920
and a rear facing 5-megapixel camera
which produces reasonable shots for  a

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:58.980
5-megapixel shooter,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.980
around on par I think with the Nvidia Shield tablet's

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.470
camera. As I say, it's running the Intel
Atom Z3745 processor

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.729
clocked at 1.86GHz. Running Android
4.4

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:17.890
it also has  A2211 BG and N. No dual band support here that I can see.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.380
I'm afraid there's no GPS, Bluetooth, NFC,
 infrared

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:27.380
no DLNA, no wifi, and so on. There's no 3G here either. This is very much just a wifi

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:28.090
tablet.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.430
You will find an accelerometer and an
ambient light sensor in here

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.690
but none of the other additional items
that you could use for say, fitness

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.190
tracking.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:40.430
That said this is a £99 tablet so we
shouldn't expect Asus MeMO Pad 7

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.700
lots of bells and whistles here. What we
should expect is a

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.750
good quality tablet that provides good
performance

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:50.950
at a reasonable price.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.549
Well that's the hardware out of the way but what about the software?

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.490
Well just like the Zenfone 4 we took a look at a couple months ago

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.500
Asus have done a really good job here
creating a software suite you'd actually

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.710
want to use

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.220
in addition to the Google apps pre-installed. Now

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.000
what they've kind of done is taken all of those apps that you would use from Google

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.080
and created their own versions of them.
Now in past devices we've seen from other

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.810
manufacturers this has not gone particularly well usually.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.629
Usually you end up with apps that either
don't have a common look and feel  between

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:22.940
them like they've been developed by
different third-party developers and

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:24.140
bought by that manufacturer, Asus MeMO Pad 7

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.280
or worse still they actually have less
functionality

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.790
than their Google siblings. For Asus they've really pushed the boat out in creating a

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:32.920
software suite here

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.030
which feels intelligent, that feels like it's part of a suite

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.130
of tools designed to work with this tablet. It's really nice to see

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:43.329
and it shows a level of competency which we don't normally expect from Asus MeMO Pad 7

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.489
companies like Asus. Normally we expect
shove the hardware out the door

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:51.180
with a bit of software and that will
do the job. Asus have really pushed the

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:51.560
 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.790
boat out here and gone above and beyond I think really in creating

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.370
software

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.290
for the lower end of the market tablets.
It's really good to see

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.709
and these apps are actually very good to use as well. They all work

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.380
just as you'd expect. Now running Android
4.4

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.590
everything is pretty much the muchness here from an Android operating system  point of 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:10.010
view

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.450
but it's been given a lovely material
designed look and feel.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.730
Some might say way before Google even
started talking about material design

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.590
Asus was already there kind of delivering it. It's really nice and it

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.230
creates a feel to this tablet which is
unique

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.290
amongst all of those clone tablets out there as it were. Asus MeMO Pad 7

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.130
Seen one Android 7-inch tablet, seen them all.  Apart from on the Asus where

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:35.319
you haven't seen this before really. It's
slick, it's lovely to work with

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.900
and it feels integrated in just the right kind of way

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:43.120
never getting in the way of the functionality of Android but actually enhancing it's visual

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.959
look and feel.

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.130
In some respects I actually find using
this interface from Asus

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:50.419
easier than using the standard Google
Experience interface

00:03:50.419 --> 00:03:55.560
because everything just feels that much
crisper here. The performance of the Asus

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.549
tablet is Asus MeMO Pad 7

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:56.819
 

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:00.609
exceptional actually. Again we're seeing
these Intel chips coming through now

00:04:00.609 --> 00:04:04.299
and they really have plenty of power
under the hood. At no point did we find

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:05.629
the tablet slowing down,

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:09.620
stalling, lagging or anything like that. Its  gaming performance

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.219
is exceptional for a price point that
this is reaching.

00:04:13.219 --> 00:04:17.160
It really is very, very good. Now don't
expect this to be playing

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.169
the very latest say, Gameloft games at the
very highest quality bar

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:25.009
those games set. But do expect to get a solid frame rate at Asus MeMO Pad 7

00:04:25.009 --> 00:04:28.160
medium settings that you really cannot
grumble about

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:30.880
and that's probably the biggest thing
you can say here. There's nothing to

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.690
complain about with this Asus tablet.

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.599
It really is just beautifully made at this price point.

00:04:36.599 --> 00:04:39.940
It's quite a remarkable piece of equipment
in my opinion. Now

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:44.470
you could level some criticism at the
way the buttons have been positioned

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:48.090
on the side of the Asus tablet because
it's not

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:51.120
the best placement I've ever seen in my life. The Asus MeMO Pad 7

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.780
main grumble I have there is that the power button and the volume rocker feel like

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.960
they're switched round in comparison to every other tablet on the market.

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.990
But this is a minor quibble in what is
an excellent

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.449
Android device. If you're in the market
for a £99

00:05:04.449 --> 00:05:08.729
and under tablet you really should take a
look at this Asus MeMO Pad 7-inch

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:09.330
device.

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:13.060
It does feel to me like it offers fantastic bang for your buck.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.639
If you're not in the market for a
high-performance device but you just want Asus MeMO Pad 7

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:18.009
one that works competently,

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:21.560
that can handle all of the apps and games you throw at it and provides a

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:25.159
really nice interface for Android then do
take a look at this tablet.

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:28.180
It really is a corking piece of kit.
