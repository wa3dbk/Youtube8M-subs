00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Thing we has been hunting for a long time is finally in our hands!

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.000
It's Aspire S3 — the thinnest Acer laptop — one more rival of Apple MacBook Air.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Even with package, charger and other stuff it weights less than many other ordinary laptops.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Let's get it out of the box and look how much it weights itself.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Exciting moment!

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Yes! That's exactly what I expected to see!

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You're one fo those who see it opened first. Even I didn't see it yet.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I prepared short speech but while I was unpacking it I completely forgot what I wanted to say, cause' it's really cool thing.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Display diagonal is 13,3 inches. Frankly speaking I don't like glossy displays, but in this case I'm ready to turn a blind eye to it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And I really fond of the rest of the features. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Laptop has aluminium body, I hope it's made from solid brick as well as MacBook Air and Lenovo U300s.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
The opening angle of the lid is very big and hinges are rather tight.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Here we have island type keys, 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
On first impression it's easy to press them.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Touchpad with no buttons.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It has metal border around the display, web-cam — as in any other laptop.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Dolby home theater speakers.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:23.000
There is 2nd gen Intel processor inside it: Core i3, i5 or i7, 4 gigs of RAM, SSD and integrated Intel graphics.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Most of the ports are located on the back side of the laptop. We have here 2 USB ports with no 3.0 (why?), HDMI, power socket, audio jack, and a card reader.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
That's it. And here is cooling system.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
All the specs are written on this plate.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
And here is a pair of speakers.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
The thickness of the body in its thinnest place is 13,1mm and 17,5mm in the thickest.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:16.000
In case of MacBook Air this differense is really evident and Aser Aspire S-series has more smooth change of thickness.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
This laptop weights 1,3 kilos.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I want to buy it right now!
