00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.520
Inipi might be what grabs you and draws you into your culture.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.660
Language might be what grabs you and draws you into culture.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:17.820
Dancing

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:19.320
might be a part of

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:20.940
culture that takes you

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.540
into another area of culture

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.080
and you just continue to

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.640
dive deeper and deeper

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.280
into your culture

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.680
until you have a good balance within that.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.000
Whatever it is that they can be a part of,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160
I encourage them to be a part of

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.220
any ceremony because

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.180
the Inipi ceremony is what brought me

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.760
deeper into culture

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.520
and that continued to bring me deeper into

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:58.440
language,

00:00:58.940 --> 00:00:59.900
and learning,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.980
history,

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:02.200
ways...

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:05.540
anything that is tied to culture.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.180
So I hope that exposing our children to Inipi ceremony,

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.760
or any other type of ceremony that they might learn about,

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.260
will encourage them to continue to learn as well.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.120
I hope I get my regalia soon so I can dance in powwow.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:21.560
(You will!)

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.620
I missed last year's powwow

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.400
and I need a regalia.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.540
I want to dance this year.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.140
The significance of a powwow

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.220
is celebration.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.240
It's a coming together of spiritual leaders and people and families

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:48.940
in order to celebrate

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:50.400
the entire year-

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.700
what has happened,

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.720
regaining new relationships, building friendships

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.560
and just celebrating the culture and the people that we are.
