00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.260
Lemma is a parkour exploration game which
makes gamers immediately think of Mirror's

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.260
Edge.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.320
But is it any different or even possibly better?

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:25.430
Let's find out in the Lemma First Impression
Review.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.380
Let's identify what Lemma is and what it sets
out to do.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:34.030
It is a first person parkour game with mystery
and exploration in a surreal world.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.930
You start off in this strange floating platform
world in the sky not knowing who your character

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.060
is, where you are, or why you are there.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:55.339
It's a total mystery and that's the best part.

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:59.710
The game is developed entirely by one person,
Evan Todd, and he was kind enough to provide

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.340
a review code for this game.

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:05.670
I had a chance to play it for a few hours,
and I can definitely tell you about the gameplay

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.890
and whether it's worth your time.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.050
As you begin traversing you'll pickup notes
which seem very esoteric, but gives clues

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:13.710
to the world you're in.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:17.920
You'll also pickup a phone and begin communicating
with a mystery man that you have some sort

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:19.990
of vague relationship with.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.140
You jump with the right trigger, grab with
the left trigger, and roll or slide with the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:33.130
left thumbstick clicking in.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.020
The world seems daunting at first as platformers
are slim and far apart, but you will quickly

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.579
realize just how intuitive the game is.

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:45.479
The game teaches you without putting you through
a tutorial specific mission.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.570
Controls are actually very easy to pickup
and have varying degrees within their techniques.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.299
You quickly find yourself utilizing the moves
you learn to reach new areas.

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:58.250
And you begin to make your own conclusions
on how to solve puzzles.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:03.180
It does a good job of introducing you to a
new concept and then challenging you with

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.759
a much harder to solve situation.

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:10.840
That's video game basics, and surprisingly
this game excels where a lot of games fail.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:15.459
The game also has some innovation as you can
spawn platforms and challenge elements exclusively

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:17.040
with your steps.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.620
You can wall run and extend a wall.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.730
Slide and extend a floor.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:36.019
Or solve puzzles by stepping on an illuminated
surface.

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:39.819
The world design and art style of Lemma is
also surprisingly good.

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.849
A lot of the world is built with Voxel graphics,
those chunky 3D pixels and it adds to the

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:47.160
game's mystique.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.580
The world is truly huge as you can look out
at platforms far away and even look into the

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.379
vanishing point.

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.080
Everything from the ambient music to the large
spaces conveys how the game is really an isolated

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.269
and unknown world.

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.860
Everything about the game is very subtle.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:07.590
The way you learn the moves, the puzzles presented
to you, and the revelation of the story.

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:11.190
Even the graphic effects look nice, but there's
no crazy eye candy.

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.360
The game has slow but very balanced pacing
in every way possible.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.610
Lemma is very polished for an indie game.

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.560
As I've stated many times, everything is intuitive
and unfolds naturally.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:26.810
The game looks very attractive and it feels
very natural to move through this artificial

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:27.810
world.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:33.650
It even has oculus rift support which could
be very immersive for those oculus early adopters.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.959
My only complaint is that I wish there were
voice acting for the sections where you read

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.989
notes or text message on your phone.

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:45.180
Arguably this could be a game design choice
to make the character feel even more isolated.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.360
The game can also be a little slow, it's definitely
not an action combat game.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.730
It's exploration, mystery, and parkour movement.

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.099
I can highly recommend Lemma if you are interested
in an exploration and mystery game with intuitive

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.209
movement.

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:02.409
The game sets out to accomplish a unique design
and it is successful.

00:04:02.409 --> 00:04:05.069
If you don't have patience for a slower game,
you may want to look elsewhere.
