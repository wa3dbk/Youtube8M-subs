00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.640
This is Fieldsports Channel News.

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:12.580
A gamekeeper has been caught on camera by
the RSPB killing a goshawk.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.320
George Mutch form Aberdeenshire has become
the first Scottish gamekeeper to be jailed

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.570
for killing birds of prey. Mutch denied recklessly
killing or injuring a goshawk and illegally

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:28.529
taking away another two raptors but was earlier
found guilty of all four charges in the case

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.230
at Aberdeen Sheriff Court.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.360
He was sentenced to four months on each charge,
with the sentences to run concurrently.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:42.269
Since 2000, just 20 gamekeepers have been
found guilty of “raptor persecution”.

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:47.780
It's the start of the 2015 ShotShow in Las
Vegas and among the new kit there is the Winchester

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.460
budget XPR rifle.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.460
A couple of key features - it has a bolt release
right here so you can leave it on 'safety'

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:01.400
and just push that to let the bolt go, so
you are loading and unloading the rifle in

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.430
the safe position. When you are ready to shoot
you just push the safety forward.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:12.380
Another Winchester story this week and archaeologists
have found a 132-year-old rifle propped up

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.620
against a tree.
It's a .44-40 calibre ‘Model 1873’, manufactured

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.510
in 1882. It was leaning against a juniper
tree in Nevada. Nobody knows how it got there,

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.080
nor whether it has been there for all that
time, though its base had turned grey and

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.340
was partially buried.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.710
There is lots of research out this week. According
to Natural England, fieldsports generate 10

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.840
million visits a year to the English countryside,
while fishing generated another 14 million

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:42.840
visits.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.020
Meanwhile, a distribution map of BASC’s
membership of more than 140,000 shows people

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.940
who take part in shooting sports live in the
city, town, coast and countryside and dispels

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.080
any myth about shooting being a solely rural
issue.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.500
Our own research is throwing up some surprising
results which we will report in February - and

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.210
our survey is now available in Spanish, German
and French. Links are on the screen. If you

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.349
haven’t taken part, please do - and please
tell your friends.

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.810
Now, a Texas county has come up with a novel
way to try to reduce their hog numbers.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.760
The Wise County Hog Hunting Contest, which
now covers the whole of Texas, aims to help

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.730
get rid of the hogs and give a little bit
of bragging rights as well. The biggest hog

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:33.260
wins 50% of the entry fees, which are USD110
per team. If you live in Texas, take part

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:37.020
at Bit.ly/hogcontest

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.520
And finally, Fieldsports Britain's got talent!

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:44.920
This is Anthony Champ who posted the dance
of the frustrated fox shooter on Facebook

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.110
forum Lamping Foxes. He's certainly throwing
some impressive shapes and at this time of

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.300
year it's a great way to keep warm.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.570
