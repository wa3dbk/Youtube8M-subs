00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.460
Chiropractors take a comprehensive approach
to treating neck or cervical pain.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.950
The first thing a chiropractor will do is
a very careful case history and examination

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.990
not only of your neck but of your entire musculoskeletal
system.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.950
We want to understand how the rest of your
body is affecting your neck and what specific

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:29.509
structures in your neck - vertebrae, nerves,
joints, and muscles - might be causing your

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:30.509
pain.

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:34.920
A chiropractor will do an orthopedic and neurological
exam, and once your chiropractor understands

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.000
which structures are causing your pain or
discomfort there are many techniques available

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to treat it.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.300
The traditional chiropractic techniques involve
a very specific thrust applied to the vertebrae.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:50.379
In the cervical region you may hear a sound
that's a little louder than other adjustments

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.440
because it's so close to your ear.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.219
But the adjustments are actually very gentle,
and patients report that there is no pain

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:00.690
or usually very little pain associated with
these adjustments at all.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.140
Most patients report that they feel a tremendous
sense of relief right after the adjustment.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.840
And they'll also report an increased range
of motion, decreased inflammation, and relaxation

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.490
of the muscles.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.000
Chiropractors may also use other chiropractic
adjusting techniques that are more non-force

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.890
or gentle to restore the normal motion of
the vertebrae or subluxations in the cervical

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.120
spine.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.369
Chiropractors also employ a wide variety of
other modalities that they can incorporate

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.540
into your sessions to reduce pain and inflammation.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.939
Chiropractors may use heat or ice applied
locally to the muscles.

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.190
They may use ultrasound or cold laser.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:42.210
There are also stretching techniques and exercises
that they may recommend to restore the normal

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.780
biomechanics of the cervical spine.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.759
Chiropractors will also advise you on postural
issues that may be affecting your spine.

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.380
There are so many things we do every day from
carrying heavy handbags or backpacks on our

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:58.869
shoulders, sitting at a computer for long
hours, or using handheld devices.

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:04.530
Even sleeping positions, the choice of a pillow,
or how you sit when you read a book or watch

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:10.270
TV can play a major role in not only causing
neck pain but also your recovery as well.

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.770
It's really important to follow any recommendations
your chiropractor makes for home care.

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:18.830
The way you take care of your neck at home
can play a major role in how fast your neck

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.410
recovers, but it also can play a major role
in preventing problems in the future.
