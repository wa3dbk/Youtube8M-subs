00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.779
Hello everyone!!

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:10.540
In this video, I want to show you how you
can make the double crochet stitch, also

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.209
known as "PUNTO ALTO".

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:15.319
Here we have a foundation chain,

00:00:15.319 --> 00:00:17.949
I will start by showing you how to
start

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:19.089
crochetting

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:20.970
our first row.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.199
To beging, we will croche three chains.

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:29.659
these three chains, are going to be the high of the first stitch.

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.760
Then, take the loop and insert your hook in the forth chain.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.170
We get the loop,

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:38.770
We now have three treads, as you can see
here

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.360
with this..

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.859
we grab the loop

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:42.730
 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.920
and we pull through.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.680
we grab a loop again

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.630
and we get two threads

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:56.630
ok, now.. grab a loop again

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.530
we pull two threads

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.120
and insert the hook above the chain

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.190
we pull through, grab a loop now now, again
to take a thread.

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:10.900
whipple through it

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.380
we take another look

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.060
and the other two threats

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.090
the double christian some people also
call them bulldog item

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.260
pizza speech

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.800
otherwise to the left side

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.810
projects

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:25.620
it's a basic seach

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.609
its people

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:29.180
and you can make products we don't need
the associate

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.080
and they will be beautiful

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:41.080
usually the last of teach that we will
we have

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.660
we're wiling we are going to win these
lessons siege for d to see what happened

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.940
eve we with these point

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:58.270
care about the finish

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.670
but for israel

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:06.110
expanding here

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:08.399
speech here you frank

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.049
that read here

00:02:10.049 --> 00:02:12.809
it may fall apart

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:19.809
if they'd be on that aggression at the
flat

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:27.120
rabbi trend again here is where we get
the chain

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.699
from here

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:34.199
from here

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:37.259
working look depict how our project

00:02:37.259 --> 00:02:43.279
whale group

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:46.899
i wanted to see me to know how you want
to see your project

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:49.640
here at the three x that are

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.680
where we say are

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.529
each of the speeches

00:02:52.529 --> 00:02:56.719
we'd be is that we concede that we
didn't have kiev any instinct

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:57.879
so it was a small

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:03.569
fabric with double cliches teachers

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.979
how women can i say controlled

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:09.869
to began a second row

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:14.099
we will grab the loop

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:17.079
here will answer are croak

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.010
with corporate red

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:20.439
week cracked the loop

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.559
week hardcore project

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:23.409
we push it

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:30.409
three chains

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:33.489
grappling hook

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.909
ideas point we are not going to
instructor who opened the forest

00:03:37.909 --> 00:03:39.519
began to be the speech

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.109
you think we're going to the tree chains
we won't

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.729
to start their first

00:03:45.729 --> 00:03:46.630
fallen

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.569
hall if the first one that we will use

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:53.369
we insert are wilk

00:03:53.369 --> 00:03:57.679
we're grappling

00:03:57.679 --> 00:04:01.609
one

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:04.079
again revenue

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:08.799
that we have to email even speech that
is going to be is more with no increases

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:12.799
be things whether we are learning to do
to make a double cliche and remember

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.319
that when you were questioning it is
important that juries features arnett

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:17.539
friday night trap

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:20.989
so it is important to know that they can
separate red and it didn't suffer a

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:21.609
quote

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:28.609
we preach we will crush it

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:38.699
okay we're almost done through a second
rome

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:45.699
fears of my old home

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:48.489
where we will use a return cook

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:52.699
or france

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:55.479
and two

00:04:55.479 --> 00:04:59.869
seems that there are no more as teachers
that change

00:04:59.869 --> 00:05:01.379
we are anything but

00:05:01.379 --> 00:05:04.830
victory chains lead we want to start
pro-growth

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.429
studied the landmark speech

00:05:07.429 --> 00:05:08.780
incomplete count

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.409
how many things we have

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:12.500
we have one country

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.479
four five six seven eight dusty

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:17.080
camdensafe umbrella

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:20.680
that we are questioning now it will be
fad

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.259
into the street

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:27.599
four five six seven the speeches we need
glamorous landmark so he will be active

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:29.319
nope

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:32.699
we need to be saying we are going to
inside a hook

00:05:32.699 --> 00:05:39.699
well we are going to live here

00:05:40.339 --> 00:05:42.209
the graph in the loop

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:45.189
here is the whole

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:48.319
we got again

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:54.629
so he had two tracks we poured through
we take one

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:59.370
scout even started as a speech if you
look here you please call is on top of

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.840
the speech on the first row i think that
credit so i'm going to london this is

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.569
the tragic to see which is another
option but ideally you should not do

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.199
these classes teach here

00:06:11.199 --> 00:06:15.330
you can get your feet one technique
obscenity easter regiment

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:16.669
inc is the best

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:18.990
because look what happens

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:22.419
now he's not very obvious since we just
decided that project

00:06:22.419 --> 00:06:23.510
but after

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.239
as we have plans tonight

00:06:25.239 --> 00:06:27.159
here you will see a meal

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:30.740
and you will feel that if he has been
seized and because we are holding tiny

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.970
as single track

00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:35.429
he did the first brown

00:06:35.429 --> 00:06:37.490
the first row and perhaps

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:39.599
is that not civil

00:06:39.599 --> 00:06:42.229
ideally

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:44.439
their weight seems to me better

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:46.729
i want to show you

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:53.729
is to get that to threats

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.329
and then that they weren't control if
the thing we came out

00:06:58.329 --> 00:06:59.590
victory chains

00:06:59.590 --> 00:07:01.699
internet project back

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:03.169
i think that first call

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:06.669
because the tree chains are confident it
here

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:10.749
that and i think a whole week atlantic

00:07:10.749 --> 00:07:12.079
to and two

00:07:12.079 --> 00:07:14.539
and so on

00:07:14.539 --> 00:07:16.009
the speech

00:07:16.009 --> 00:07:18.089
there is no also asked them to a

00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:20.239
i dot or double questioning

00:07:20.239 --> 00:07:22.039
and goes standing with the irs

00:07:22.039 --> 00:07:26.900
can be transferred it to appreciate it
be easier on the video

00:07:26.900 --> 00:07:28.270
thank you so much

00:07:28.270 --> 00:07:30.020
and remember to suspect the make channel
