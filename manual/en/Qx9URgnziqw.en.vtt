Hi there! I'm MrRegy68, this is my channel and we'll talk about cinema!

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:16.606
First of all, I want to introduce yourselves some words

00:00:16.641 --> 00:00:19.868
that I'll use in all of my videos.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.019
First one: "Composition"

00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:31.000
the thing that usually
moves in movies is the composition
but for example now I'm the one who is moving.

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:34.633
Composition consists in every frames captured
with a camera from the man behind that.

00:00:34.634 --> 00:00:39.589
Shot. Most of people are conviced to know
the real meanning of this word… but…

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.171
let the camera roll on the floor it's not a shot!

00:00:44.172 --> 00:00:46.933
We have to think about what we have to compose

00:00:46.934 --> 00:00:47.934
A wide shot?

00:00:47.935 --> 00:00:53.664
Telephoto lens? Even Though this is not a  telephoto lens…

00:00:53.665 --> 00:00:58.705
A camera cart? I am doing the camera cart,
there is not a camera cart right now…

00:00:59.086 --> 00:01:00.522
Sequence?

00:01:00.523 --> 00:01:05.844
And so on… but we should talk about it individually!

00:01:05.845 --> 00:01:07.849
Let's talk about this Shining Sequence

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:15.164
An entire minute of this Sequence could be a problem here in Youtube
so i've just remounted it, let's see that!

00:01:58.215 --> 00:02:02.194
For the ones who doesn't saw this masterpiece of Kubrick,
I introduce a few things.

00:02:02.195 --> 00:02:10.881
We are in a hotel in the middle of mountains, we are in the seventies,
the husband is writing a book and his wife found what he is writing.

00:02:10.882 --> 00:02:19.037
So, the composition that we need to focus on
is the one of the wife browsing the pages with the phrase:

00:02:19.038 --> 00:02:20.848
All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy

00:02:25.782 --> 00:02:39.034
In this movie Kubrick decided to shot the same scene with the original language,
in fact in italian version you can read "il mattino ha l'oro in bocca"

00:02:39.035 --> 00:02:40.619
Do you remember what we just saw?

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:50.383
All of the scene is pointed in just one phrase and the entire concept is

00:02:51.052 --> 00:02:52.454
This man is totally mad!

00:02:52.455 --> 00:02:58.910
So that scene is the synthesize of the final act of the affirmance:

00:02:58.911 --> 00:03:00.426
That man is totally mad!

00:03:00.427 --> 00:03:03.818
I think i will talk a little bit more about  the concept of composition

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.643
Oh please! Just a little!

00:03:06.644 --> 00:03:10.360
The composition is just the shortest part of an entire film

00:03:10.361 --> 00:03:16.816
just like to make a building...
There could be a mason, a plumber, an electrician and so on…

00:03:16.817 --> 00:03:19.670
in a single composition there could be an intervention of:

00:03:20.122 --> 00:03:21.182
The Actor

00:03:21.655 --> 00:03:23.547
The Photography Director

00:03:23.548 --> 00:03:27.639
The Raw Sound,
that is the sound recorded directly on the set…

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:33.277
The music and… and… I don't recall other possible insider now!

00:03:33.278 --> 00:03:34.789
When you are shooting a scene

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.097
REMEMBER

00:03:36.098 --> 00:03:38.118
that all of your compositions must add

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:43.406
something to the principal story
and mustn't confuse the viewers

00:03:43.407 --> 00:03:46.146
Unless you really want to do that!

00:03:46.247 --> 00:03:47.244
Just one more little thing,

00:03:47.279 --> 00:03:52.486
if your shot isn't very good or is a little bit boring
you can cut it and fill the entire scene with some better shot.

00:03:52.487 --> 00:04:00.937
This way the spectator probabily will not be bored…
but be carefull… a boring shot remain a boring shot.

00:04:00.938 --> 00:04:02.155
A little spoiler about a new argument

00:04:02.156 --> 00:04:10.366
The film editing could be easier
if all shots are in armony with what we want to narrate

00:04:10.367 --> 00:04:15.436
but it could be easy too if you have bad shots with a good montage.

00:04:15.437 --> 00:04:20.128
But remember!
With bad shots there couldn't be a very good product.

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:23.090
Ok, that's all for today,
see you in next "Dietro la macchina"
