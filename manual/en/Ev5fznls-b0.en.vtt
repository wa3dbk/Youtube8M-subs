00:00:29.224 --> 00:00:30.341
(Cough)

00:00:32.056 --> 00:00:35.306
Shake shake, shake shake ya shake it.

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:37.126
So...

00:00:40.763 --> 00:00:44.583
My hair's a mess, holy f... _____ you didn't tell me, did you?

00:00:45.226 --> 00:00:46.939
It's actually a really nice day outside.

00:00:46.993 --> 00:00:51.561
The roads are kind of slippery, but for the most part, the sun melted it...

00:00:51.561 --> 00:00:53.377
...so I'm pretty excited.

00:00:54.953 --> 00:00:57.723
I'm going to be bored for the next 5 hours, because...

00:00:59.267 --> 00:01:05.743
I have a gap in my schedule from my math class to my graphic arts class.

00:01:05.743 --> 00:01:06.896
And that's two...

00:01:07.551 --> 00:01:10.970
I mean that, yeah it's going to be a pain in the butt you know.

00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:15.539
My throat's still kind of groggy, but I'm getting better.

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:16.916
I am.

00:01:17.368 --> 00:01:18.728
Slowly but surely.

00:01:19.617 --> 00:01:20.438
You want a wrapper?

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.556
I had to make sure nobody's behind me.

00:01:26.738 --> 00:01:28.956

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:34.853
Michelle Bray-yanch!

00:01:35.926 --> 00:01:41.206
Um, but my school, it's OK I guess for the most part.

00:01:41.603 --> 00:01:46.400
I think it's easier to get here than it was for my last campus.

00:01:47.943 --> 00:01:51.244
AHHH! I can't! I'm a duckling!

00:01:52.126 --> 00:01:54.397
...Moves it like this and I shake it like that.

00:01:54.616 --> 00:01:58.082
That's going to be stuck in my head all-day-long.

00:01:58.561 --> 00:02:00.221
I don't know what else to say to you!

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:03.365
I'm supposed to do my society homework.

00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:04.895
UhhhHHHHMM!!

00:02:05.584 --> 00:02:07.548
I need a candy, what about you?

00:02:10.314 --> 00:02:11.262
Hom!

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.433
Sexual candy!

00:02:14.336 --> 00:02:18.379
Geez, people are speeding to get to class and it's like only 12:18.

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:20.230
It's like, "Oh dear, I need to get to class!"

00:02:21.139 --> 00:02:22.928
I'm still waiting on Jessica.

00:02:23.303 --> 00:02:23.896
*Beep*

00:02:23.896 --> 00:02:24.768
Ooh...

00:02:25.457 --> 00:02:26.351
*Chime*

00:02:26.611 --> 00:02:28.625
Oh that's a beautiful sound!

00:02:28.625 --> 00:02:31.823
*Chime chime chime*

00:02:32.214 --> 00:02:33.183
Isn't it?

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.646
Agree with me.

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:38.555
Yeah but I'm like so tired because I didn't sleep last night.

00:02:38.555 --> 00:02:40.073
I didn't really sleep last night.

00:02:40.747 --> 00:02:41.539
And it sucked.

00:02:42.023 --> 00:02:44.818
Because the past couple of days, I was on Nyquil.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.575
And umm... I couldn't sleep without Nyquil.

00:02:50.166 --> 00:02:52.776
It's just like, "I need a sleep aid."

00:02:53.504 --> 00:02:55.128
If I don't have a sleep aid, I'll die.

00:02:56.362 --> 00:02:57.377
In the toilet!

00:02:57.887 --> 00:03:02.726
I bought a graphing calculator, it did not do what I wanted it to do...

00:03:02.726 --> 00:03:04.503
...but you know, I'm kind of getting used to it.

00:03:04.503 --> 00:03:09.479
The class is still foggy to me, I can't understand much of anything, really.

00:03:09.822 --> 00:03:11.295
I want to sleep.

00:03:12.477 --> 00:03:15.492
I am so freaking tired right now!

00:03:23.755 --> 00:03:24.458
Uh!

00:03:25.718 --> 00:03:26.583
What?

00:03:28.222 --> 00:03:30.307
Shhh! It's a secret.

00:03:32.304 --> 00:03:34.240
[Jessica]: "(Hey this is Jessica, leave a message!)"

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.282
I WILL!!!

00:03:36.725 --> 00:03:39.264
Everybody else is at school, at work...

00:03:40.423 --> 00:03:42.383
Busy doing something or another...

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.113
Playing with their hair...

00:03:46.443 --> 00:03:47.840
Their public hair...

00:03:49.187 --> 00:03:49.668
(Hic)

00:03:50.102 --> 00:03:52.161
I got the f___ing hiccups?

00:03:52.637 --> 00:03:56.735
Let's see, "Children can be killed or seriously injured by the air bag."

00:03:57.192 --> 00:03:59.245
"The backseat is the safest place for children."

00:03:59.781 --> 00:04:02.525
That's not true, because if you put your children in the backseat,

00:04:02.525 --> 00:04:07.824
And if they're under the age of 20, they could hit their head on the window.

00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:15.220
That guy is like bobbing his head up-and-DOWN like he's doing something with himself.

00:04:15.468 --> 00:04:16.574
He just looked at me.

00:04:16.574 --> 00:04:20.178
Ahhh! I'm so immature you guys.

00:04:20.514 --> 00:04:21.700
I should've brought my PSP.

00:04:22.487 --> 00:04:23.787
I wouldn't be so bored, would I?

00:04:24.718 --> 00:04:26.405
Nope. Apparently not.

00:04:27.323 --> 00:04:29.647
I don't even know what to do in society class.

00:04:29.914 --> 00:04:31.805
That looks like a girl!

00:04:32.707 --> 00:04:34.037
I guess they have class at 1:00.

00:04:34.938 --> 00:04:38.266
I don't have a class at 1:00. I wish I did. That way I wouldn't be bored.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:39.278
But I'm bored.

00:04:39.662 --> 00:04:41.039

00:04:42.051 --> 00:04:44.490

00:05:11.185 --> 00:05:12.557
Ow! My finger's stuck.

00:05:28.316 --> 00:05:31.608
I think it's safe-- No it's not, my eyes hurt.

Every time, you come near.

00:05:52.925 --> 00:06:00.157
"Easy Breezy"? These are like musics... music... I mean songs I listened to in 8th Grade.

00:06:06.156 --> 00:06:07.582
Don't smoke, children!

00:06:08.152 --> 00:06:09.745
Makes you nauseous!

00:06:10.262 --> 00:06:12.899
Everybody says how nauseous you are because you're nauseous.

00:06:28.096 --> 00:06:29.058

00:06:29.294 --> 00:06:31.138

(Kaka, kakakakakaka!)

00:06:54.625 --> 00:06:59.075
It IS kaka. Like the math, I don't really understand it.

00:06:59.075 --> 00:06:59.992

00:06:59.992 --> 00:07:04.203
UhhhHHHH, Trigonometry and Algebra.

(Like, yeah. I don't know that.)

00:07:06.906 --> 00:07:07.684
I know right?

00:07:07.684 --> 00:07:13.536
Basically, he's just going over like the basics. But I still don't get the basics.

00:07:13.536 --> 00:07:15.329
(You look like a basic! Ha ha ha!)

00:07:15.329 --> 00:07:16.766
I AM A BASIC!!

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:27.808
I'm finally done and it's cold outside!

00:07:30.084 --> 00:07:31.191
I'm all by myself.

00:07:31.191 --> 00:07:33.504
There's like nobody around right now.

00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.561
It's scary.

00:07:35.811 --> 00:07:39.263
