Alright, in this segment we're going to assemble
the exhaust so we can get it mocked up and

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.330
mount it into the bike and the first thing
you want to do is you're going to take your

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:26.680
collector here and this part of the pipe.
I'm just going to slide this in, right up

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:52.959
there. Take your bolt and your washer and
supply it. And we're going to take this and

00:00:52.959 --> 00:01:04.350
put it on to the header, put it all the way
in, make sure it's straight. And then we're

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:18.141
going to take our springs, and you're going
to put all the springs, they'd give you a

00:01:18.141 --> 00:01:25.730
cool little tool and this is for pulling the
springs. So you'll just hook it on there,

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:55.920
snap it on there like that, flip this over,
put on this one. That one's done. And then

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:08.110
one more. And that's it. Now this is all ready
to go. We'll get this put on the bike and

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.889
then we'll assembler the muffler last. And
that should be it.
