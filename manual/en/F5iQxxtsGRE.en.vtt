“Vitamin Supplements Worth Taking”

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.660
In terms of longevity,

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:09.630
there’s one last supplement
to consider: Vitamin D.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.429
Who votes shorter life?

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.530
Who votes the same life expectancy?

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:19.080
Longer life?

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:27.320
Vitamin D seems to be the only supplement
that can actually make us live longer.

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:31.070
Before we start the next round,
I want to note the two vitamins

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.780
that we can’t get enough of
from a healthy diet,

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.440
and vitamin D is one of them.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:43.970
Vitamin D is made mostly
by animals, such as yourself—

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.220
when you’re exposed to sunlight.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:50.090
The tiny amounts added
to cow’s milk or soy milk

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.789
isn’t enough for optimal health.

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:56.630
There are only two ways
to truly get enough—

00:00:56.630 --> 00:01:06.400
sun or supplements, and it
depends where you live.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:18.510
Basically, no matter how long you
sunbathe nude in December and January—

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:21.370
in our nation’s capitol, for example—

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.810
the sun’s rays are at such an angle
that we don’t make any vitamin D.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.250
So, the latest science supports
supplemental D during the winter

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.540
if you’re above LA/Dallas/Atlanta—

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:44.780
or, for anyone, anywhere,
any time not getting enough sun.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.400
All right, it’s time for a
lightning round question.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.220
Before I give you the question,
I’ll give you the answer.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.830
Anyone?

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:08.229
Okay, the question is: what is the
only other vitamin not made by plants?

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:09.229
Vitamin B12.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:13.380
It’s not made
by animals either, though.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.450
It’s made by little microbes,
bacteria that blanket the earth.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.100
These bacteria grow in the guts
of some of the animals people eat,

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.630
and so their bodies can be sources
of B12 for those eating animals.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.050
We likely used to get all the
B12 we needed drinking out of

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.550
mountain streams or well water,

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:42.390
but now we chlorinate our water
supply to kill off any bacteria.

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:48.120
So, we don’t get a lot of B12
in our water anymore;

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.610
we don’t get a lot of cholera either!

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:53.800
So, that’s a good thing.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:59.010
But in our sanitized modern world,
studies continue to show that those

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:04.620
eating plant-based diets are simply
not getting enough vitamin B12.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.120
Is this really a problem?

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.120
Let me review the medical literature

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:16.170
on B12 deficiency just
over the last year.

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.070
Keep in mind that it’s so easy to get B12,

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:25.790
from either B12-fortified
foods or supplements.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.940
But like everything else,
you actually have to do it.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.440
This young vegetarian
woman’s toes turned purple.

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.500
You can develop a polymorphic
maculopapular lesion.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.310
Her vitamin B12 deficiency
cause her nails to turn black,

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.430
and her hair to turn white.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.520
She was given some B12 and you can see

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.780
where her hair started
to grow back normally.

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:04.490
B12 also evidently makes
you put on lipstick?

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:11.520
But you can suffer cognitive decline,
or become suicidally depressed

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:18.970
because of B12 deficiency, as this
23-year-old lifelong vegetarian did.

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:25.060
This 38-year-old vegan was misdiagnosed
as a paranoid schizophrenic,

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:30.570
and institutionalized because of the
hallucinations and psychotic delusions

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:34.870
triggered by his B12 deficiency.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:41.780
As bad as all these examples are, though,
these folks were just hurting themselves.

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:47.490
But not taking vitamin B12
during pregnancy is inexcusable.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:53.940
It can cause infantile
seizures, for example.

00:04:53.940 --> 00:05:01.400
Vegan babies should be a lot of things,
but floppy is not one of them.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:08.020
It is these negligent vegans that led
this year to an official pronouncement

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:11.530
from the European Society
for Pediatric Nutrition:

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:17.230
“Infants and young children should
not be fed a vegan diet,” they wrote.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.050
Now, what they should have said is,
make sure vegan kids get their B12.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:28.100
I mean Dr. Spock even told us to
raise our kids with no meat, no dairy.

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.940
And the B12 recommendation
probably goes for everyone,

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:35.410
not just those eating plant-based diets.

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.890
New studies on the bioavailability of B12
suggest that animal products

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:42.960
are not great sources after all.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.090
Less than 4% of the B12 in scrambled eggs,
for example, is actually absorbed,

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:50.580
according to these new studies.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:54.340
In fact, in modern society,
only those eating fortified foods,

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:59.419
like breakfast cereal or supplements,
seem to getting enough for optimum health.

00:05:59.419 --> 00:06:03.590
So, there’s been a renewed call
for all grain products in the U.S.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:09.090
to be fortified with B12,
like they already do in Israel—

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.410
which could mean that by law,

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:15.640
all bread, all pasta, would have
to be enriched with B12, and then,

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:20.870
hopefully, we’d never have to
hear cases like this again.
