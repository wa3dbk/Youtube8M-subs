00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:10.980
Today on BRStv we have episode twenty of our
Neptune Apex series, the AFS automatic feeder.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.589
Hi I'm Ryan host of BRStv where each week
we cover a new topic related to reefing.

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:19.060
This week we are going to show you how to
set up your Neptune AFS automatic feeder.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.450
I would like to say two things about this
product right off the bat, even if it didn't

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:26.170
hook up to the Apex it would still be my favorite
feeder.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.919
It keeps the food dry and dispenses a predictable
amount using most common sized foods

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.460
Coupled with the Apex it means I can automatically
set it up to do a single rotation of a large

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.789
volume of food or multiple rotations of a
small amount and I can spread it out over

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:44.370
various periods of the day which means I will
absolutely be able to find the right volume

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.859
of food for the tank.

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:49.879
Inside the food cartridge is an adjustable
gate which you can adjust for the size of

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.249
food you are using as well as the volume dispensed.

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:56.719
Mounting it is simple, there is a clamp that
goes on the side if the tank, you can see

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.579
that it comes with two aquabus ports like
every Apex modules so you can daisy chain

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:02.579
other items.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.200
In this case it would be likely that the only
thing you would daisy chain off this module

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.930
would be a second feeder with different foods.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.110
For instance it wouldn't be uncommon to feed
two different foods of different sizes like

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.261
one that has some large pellets for the bigger
fish that gets fed once a day and one that

00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:21.900
has tiny pellets similar foods that are fed
multiple times a day for active schooling

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.000
fish like anthias and chromis.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.560
Two feeding points could it easier for the
less aggressive fish to have access to the

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:28.830
food as well.

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.720
That said be careful not to go crazy with
the feedings or you are going to run into

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:32.720
algae issues.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.130
So setting the feeder up in Apex Fusion is
super simple.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:39.830
Locate the virtual outlet called feeder and
click on the settings gear next to it.

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:43.520
Once you are in the configuration screen,
select control type feeder, when you want

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.950
the first feeding to start, the repeat interval
which is how often you want to feed after

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.270
that first feeding, how many times you want
the feeding drums to rotate in a single feeding,

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.330
feedings per day and the feed mode you want
associated with the AFS feeder.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.110
In this case I want my first feeding to be
at 10 am, because I have active fish id like

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.020
a second feeding at four pm which is six hours
or 360 minutes.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.330
I'd like two drum rotations, a maximum of
two feedings a day and I will tie it to feed

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:16.220
mode A so any time I trigger feed mode manually
I will also get a revolution of the AFS feeder.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.590
Send to Apex and I am done.

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.640
If you are interested you can see what code
the feeder configuration wizard wrote for

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.079
you by clicking the advanced tab and you can
see mainly what it is doing is using the oscillating

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:30.550
code and some time statements to set all of
this up for you.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:33.989
One last note, currently they can't make these
things fast enough.

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.639
We typically sell out the day they come in
so if you are interested and see them available

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:40.260
you might want to consider acting quickly.

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.150
