00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:06.220
General Exam Tips - You need to understand
that this is not a specialty exam.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:07.809
This is a core coding credential.

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:34.300
They are testing you on your general understanding
of coding principles.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.940
They say that really, you can figure out everything
from your manuals.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.980
It's nothing where you have to have it memorized,
but obviously if you're familiar with the

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.469
guidelines, you're going to know where to
go to look at and verify it.

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.750
So, it's a broad base of knowledge.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.010
How many are afraid VIR coding, vascular stuff?

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.969
Normally, I mention that up, "Oh!

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:00.329
Those are so hard."

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.420
There's 10 questions on the 30,000 series
which is one of the few that are shared by

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.909
two anatomical sections - Respiratory and
Cardio.

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.030
They are not going to have 10 VIR questions.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.880
They might have one and it's going to be broad.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.770
It's not going to be nitty-gritty detail where
you need to know the Vascular and Anatomy

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.550
like the back of your hand.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.680
So, relax a little bit on that.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:28.980
You don't need to know the nitty-gritty detail
of the entire CPT and ICD manual.

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.451
If you're currently involved in billing -- how
many are involved in billing right now?

00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:37.899
You are going to have to try and divorce yourself
from that billing and reimbursement knowledge

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.689
because it's going to throw you off track.

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.840
The board exam pictures you in the perfect
coding world, no one mess with the rules.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:51.280
If you play Monopoly, don't all families kind
of change the Monopoly rules a little bit?

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.149
They have printed rules.

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.390
So, you're being tested on the printed Monopoly
rules.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.680
Now your family might say, "Oh the money goes
in the middle.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.119
If you land on free parking, you get the money
in the middle."

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.790
That's not the rules, but...

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:06.140
So, the payers will come along and change
things.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.610
That might become your new family rules or
whatever, but what you're being tested on

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.630
are the printed rules.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.970
So, always go to the books, go to the manual.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.670
It's the guidelines that you're being tested
on.

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.860
Okay?

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:20.220
An example is with the colonoscopies.

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.630
In the CPT book, it says choose modifier 53.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.890
If you can't complete the colonoscopy because
the prep wasn't done right, or whatever.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:33.170
In the real world, most payers will tell you,
"Well code as far as you got."

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.860
Because colonoscopy goes all the way up, over
and down; so the whole shebang.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.720
They've also got proctosig which only go part
way up the colon.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.440
So they will say, that's as far as you got;
go to proctosig.

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.690
But, in CPT, it doesn't say that.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.940
We need to go by what CPT says, not by what
you might be experiencing in the real world.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.370
That's why I like teaching because I can stand
in the perfect coding world.

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.352
The last one is very key (confidence and time
management).

00:03:00.352 --> 00:03:08.310
I had a chat with someone about this recently
that your inner self-talk, I feel is probably

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.520
75% of you succeeding on this exam.

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.210
I really believe that.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:17.760
Part of going to a review class and all the
studying is really to increase your confidence.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.330
Yes, your knowledge, but it's really more
your confidence.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.800
You feel well prepared.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.510
I don't know if you all believe in that, but
I really do believe.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:27.510
Like the athletes.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.470
They talk all the time about visualizing your
moves.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:32.730
The pole vaulters, they visualize it over
and over.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.430
They are not pole vaulting all day.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.370
When they're not pole vaulting, they're rehearsing
it in their head.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.180
If you could change that inner dialogue to
instead of "I'm not a good test taker, I'm

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.730
not a good test taker" to "I'm really prepared
well for this.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:48.790
I'm ready for this.

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.620
I know it's going to be challenging but I
can do it."

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.530
It really does work.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.930
When you go and take that exam, you're going
to have an advantage than if you've been beating

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.060
yourself up and that negative self-talk.

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.070
To help that confidence, you need to have
time management.

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:12.900
Time management comes from learning a technique,
but then practicing the technique.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.160
You can learn techniques, but unless you've
actually had to put them through their paces,

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.690
it doesn't become a part of your habit of
how to do things.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:26.681
So, picture this, "You know what, surprise,
instead of the Review Blitz you actually are

00:04:26.681 --> 00:04:29.470
going to be taking the exam."

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:30.710
And you have no preparation whatsoever.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:34.780
I put the exam in front of you, you're going
to start with question one, and you're going

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:38.880
to have no feeling for how fast this should
be going because it's five hours.

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:40.940
You're like, "Okay, five hours, that's a lot."

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.940
You kind of go slow.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:45.500
You methodically, you really want to make
sure you get that first one right in.

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:48.460
That's what kind of happens.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:50.700
Then all of a sudden the proctor says, "Okay,
you have 30 minutes left."

00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:51.700
You're like, "What???"

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:54.210
And you're halfway through the exam.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.840
By having time management and having a system
"Okay.

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:02.353
I'm going to give myself one hour per column,
one hour per 30 questions, and I'm going to

00:05:02.353 --> 00:05:03.570
have a little timer."

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.150
I recommend you bring a timer with you.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.821
Unfortunately, I always use my cellphone for
a timer, but they're not going to let you

00:05:08.821 --> 00:05:12.120
have a cellphone now because you could maybe
look up something.

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:16.940
But, if you have a good old fashion digital
kitchen timer than can count down, I would

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:17.940
do that.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.220
Try to find out that's kind of quiet so you
don't upset your neighbors.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:29.990
I used to tell people ask your proctor, but
apparently, they're refusing to do it.

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:33.090
Because they get involved in their little
side conversations, and it's a long day for

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:35.870
them too and they're volunteering to be there.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.560
If you bring your own little timer that counts
down and put it on the table so you can see

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:43.990
that hour counting down, you'll get that adrenaline
going, you'll get going.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.900
You need that.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:53.180
After you go through this review, I highly
recommend you do practice exams.

00:05:53.180 --> 00:06:00.139
I will share with you -- I'll create slides
at the break but I'll also email everyone

00:06:00.139 --> 00:06:02.020
my recommended practice exams.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:05.490
My number one recommendation is the AAPC practice
exams.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:08.120
They have three 50 question-practice exams.

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.870
They call them version A, B, and C. Okay?

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:18.400
I would give yourself a 110 minutes, two minutes
per question to get used to that speed.

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:24.110
Do them one at a time and then see how you
did, score yourself on the first one.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:25.950
Maybe you got a 60, that's okay.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.840
Go over the ones you got wrong and even the
ones you got right because it gives you rationales.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:34.420
Give yourself some time, maybe study a little
bit more on the weak areas.

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:39.290
Then do practice exam B and then C.

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:45.010
If you get the CPC Study Guide, they've got
a little practice exam in there as well.

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:50.190
What I feel is truly most like the real exam
is the practice exams that they sell on their

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:53.500
website A, B, and C.

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.270
We have a 150 question printable PDF.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.720
You just print it and it has a little bubble
form you can practice filling out.

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:06.720
It's $37, but I would do that one last because
that you would want to sit down, if you could

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:11.200
at all, possibly you can five hours in a row
to really simulate the exam.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:16.560
The goal is, you want to be getting an 85%;
then you're ready for the real exam.

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:19.780
I've had many people call me, "Laureen, I
didn't pass."

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.030
I do one-on-one sessions with them and I'll
say, "OK.

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:24.900
What were you getting on your practice exams?"

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.340
"I don't know.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.139
I kind of took them, I did okay."

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:31.800
So they didn't do it in a timed way, they
didn't score themselves.

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.810
If they score themselves, they said they did;
I said, what was your score?

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.290
They give me the numbers and I said, "That's
a 60.

00:07:37.290 --> 00:07:39.560
You need a 70 to pass the real exam.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.710
If you're only getting a 60 on a practice
exam how could you honestly expect to pass

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:45.060
the real exam?"

00:07:45.060 --> 00:07:51.370
So, the practice exams would really help you
a lot, so make that a key part of your strategy

00:07:51.370 --> 00:08:03.710
for passing this exam.
