00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:05.180
bjbj\.\. What I thought I would do today is
take you through how we do a nosing and tasting

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.880
here at Highland Park. We will try and take
you through the basic principal of how to

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:14.810
do a nosing and tasting. It is very important
to know that you may have seen wine tasting

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:21.789
on television or on films but wine and whisky
tasting are two very different things. The

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.300
process is pretty much the same however you
take different information of each part of

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.370
the process. What I will do is just explain
the information we take and how to help yourself

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:36.360
along in that journey. To start with you first
of all you pour yourself a good healthy measure

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.030
into a nosing glass. A nosing glass helps
concentrate the flavours up your nose so it

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:46.239
helps get the flavour out of the whisky. Other
glasses are perfectly good for drinking but

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:50.879
for nosing and tasting a whisky this is the
sort of shape you want. First thing we do

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.489
is we look at the colour, we hold it up and
look at the colour. Now colour in whisky tells

00:00:54.489 --> 00:01:00.170
us absolutely nothing. Basically all you are
doing is making sure your glass is clean.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.150
A dark whisky is not older than a light whisky,
a dark whisky is not better than a light whisky,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:12.340
a dark whisky is just dark. The reason for
that is the majority of whisky companies add

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.010
caramel to their whisky to change the colour,
Thankfully here at Highland Park everything

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:22.420
that we do is completely and natural. All
the colours in all our whiskies are just the

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.000
effects of maturation and the wood that it
has been in. Once we have done that we turn

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.730
the glass 45 degrees and then spin it gently
once all the way round the glass like that

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.630
and then hold it up straight. What you are
looking for is this line of whisky that appears

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.060
across the top of the glass. After a couple
of seconds you get little beads or little

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.710
tears and legs that begin to come down and
those tears and legs tell you two things.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.120
The size of them as they appear on the rim
tells you the alcohol content. If they are

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.090
nice and fat like that that s 40% alcohol
if they are very small it is high in alcohol.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.380
If this was wine they would be really fat
and go down the side of the glass. Also the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.060
time it takes for those tears to come down
the side of the glass tells you, the viscosity

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.780
the thickness of the spirit. The longer it
takes to come down the thicker the spirit.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:18.350
The viscosity is made up of basically oils,
fats, esters, alcohol that s flavour. So the

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:22.140
longer it takes to come down the glass the
more flavour is in the glass. It doesn t tell

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:25.660
you whether it s good and it doesn t tell
you whether its bad it just tells you that

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.310
there are lots of it. All you are doing at
this point is preparing the palate, you are

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.170
giving your brain expectations of what type
of flavours to expect in the glass, therefore

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:41.860
your nose and mouth go looking for these flavours
as soon as it goes near it. Now the hardest

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:47.320
part and the bit where most people get confused
when they do whisky tastings. What you never

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.850
do in whisky tastings is this, you never swirl
the whisky. You swirl wine. Wine is between

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.240
12 to 14 percent alcohol, you swirl the wine
to agitate the liquid to get the alcohol to

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.900
evaporate and that carries the flavours up
the glass and up the nose. This is 40% alcohol

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:09.200
it does not need any help to evaporate at
all that s why I can smell it from away down

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.790
here. If you go into a room where there is
a wine tasting there could be thousands of

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.770
glasses of wine and you cannot smell any wine
at all. When you can walk into a room where

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:22.991
there is one glass of whisky immediately you
know somebody is drinking a whisky. So what

00:03:22.991 --> 00:03:28.930
we then do to make your life easier is keep
the spirit flat and then we sniff it 3 times

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:39.400
we go 1, 2, 3 The first time you smell the
whisky you get a tingling sensation in your

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.180
nose, this is your nose recognizing the alcohol.
The second time the tingling sensation goes

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.270
and you get a flavour and it is usually a
sweet flavour. The third time you get another

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:53.790
flavour and it is usually a fruit. How you
describe the flavours in whisky, wine, chocolate,

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:58.950
coffee and all the rest is entirely personal.
Please don t get led down a garden path by

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.810
somebody who says I can smell you know winter
berries picked on a Wednesday by left handed

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:08.330
people! it is not important, that is not how
it works. All you want to do is figure out

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.000
the basic flavours and then come down a level
if you can. So if we describe this flavour

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.900
as sweet, great. If you can go and describe
that sweetness in simple terms that perfect.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.810
That s all you want to be able to do. If you
swirl whisky you make that job very, very

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.600
hard because as you swirl whisky, all the
alcohol tries to evaporate at the same time

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:33.780
carrying all the flavour up the glass at the
same time and it hits your nose at the same

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.840
time. Which means unless you are very, very
good that alcohol is just going to burn the

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:44.530
nose and totally confuse it and then you get
the usual reaction of All whisky smells the

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.030
same to me! Basically, what your saying is
I don t understand it Keeping it flat makes

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:56.240
life a lot more simple. Then we come to the
tasting part because after all we do make

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.400
whisky to drink not to sniff. What I want
you to do is take a sip and chew the whisky,

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:10.640
bite it for 4 or 5 seconds and then swallow
it over the centre of your tongue, cheers.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:18.990
Chew it, chew it, chew it and chew it and
swallow. Then what I want you to think about

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.800
is whats happening in the mouth. Where is
that tingling sensation happening? How does

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.400
it the finish happen? Is it really, really
long is it very, very short is it bitter is

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.510
it sweet? Whats it doing? A lot of people
just drink whisky and then they swallow it

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.470
and then it s has gone forever. We spent 12
years a least making this lets give it a bit

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.860
of time in the mouth. With a little bit of
thought about what is happening you can experience

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.960
the whisky to its full. That is basically
how we do a Highland Park tasting Very, very

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:51.651
