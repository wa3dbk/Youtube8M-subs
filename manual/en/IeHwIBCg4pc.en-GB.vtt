The trail of his spaceship slowly faded into the night sky.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:36.300
I will never forget our promise from the summer of 2055. I, too, will be space traveler.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:44.440
"Only Human"

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.840
Summer, 2048.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.960
I have always dreamed of travelling to space.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.140
Yuta! Do you know about the Mars Project?

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.620
No, what's that?

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.360
It's been all over the news lately. 

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.120
They're going to build a city on Mars!

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.800
Oh, wow!

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.100
That's so cool! I want to go there someday.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.520
Yoko, we should try out for the Project.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:28.440
Do you mean the one looking to explore beyond Mars?

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.000
Yeah! we are going to go where no human has gone before.&nbsp;Just imagine, it’s a new frontier!

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.680
I'll be up there with Yōko!

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:49.200
We used to be so happy, dreaming about space...

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:05.800
But, I still haven't figured out how to achieve that dream.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.900
2054

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.780
Why are you leaving?

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.620
Whatever I say will just sound like an excuse!

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.200
That's so unfair!

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.400
I want to get out of here, too!

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.600
Yūta?

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.720
Yeah, I think he will do great things like you.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.680
He is a good kid. 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.400
But, he just doesn't have the aptitude like you.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.040
Will you be waiting for me when I come back?, I love you.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:02.040
I have no regrets. Everything I have done was not without meaning, even following my dreams.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:13.200
But after we broke up, I feel so lost.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.400
Will... Will you come back again?

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:27.160
Yūta, I believe in you. you can make your dreams come true.

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.120
This world that you long after, it will not bring happiness for humanity!

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:38.900
I'm going to do things my way. I know things will work out in the end.

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.420
Here, take this with you to him.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:48.880
Yōko!

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:51.760
Yūta! You can do it!

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:02.920
What will you be doing once I make it up there?

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:16.480
If you do make it up there, then we'll probably see each other again.

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.460
Only Human
