00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.410
say tenants are planning on rallying in
support of um... governor break scott's

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:06.309
new law

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:09.549
which are basically allowed students to

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.419
they in schools and public schools
selected as a graduation ceremony or out

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:18.590
of something happening at the auditorium
if a student wants to think died or do a

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.980
quick prayer before

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.310
accepting an award here she has the
ability to do so and that's because the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:24.740
senate bill ninety eight

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:29.370
and it says district school board's to
adopt a resolutions that allow prayers

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:33.910
by students at school he met so this is
one to rally in support of senate bill

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:38.350
nineteen which would allow the students
to pray at school events uh... and but

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.950
what i love about this is it's kind of
drawing attention to the fact that

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.560
okay you know i think that only
christians or maybe catholics are gonna

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.280
go up there and do their prayers

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.700
you don't consider the moslems you know
considered using your consider

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.770
statements street is still there like
that

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:57.930
his other like that

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.910
break the so if you're in favor of
prayers in school that means sickness

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:02.070
and in the same thing

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.940
it's true at the finding is that really
fundamentalist religious folks

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.460
might think that people who are not
religiously gable even save their lives

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.470
for

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:14.510
those

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:15.649
characters

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:17.520
or in your thoughts

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.060
lady not six and eighty s

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.979
we don't look good deals among composer
for or is it nor

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.549
trade harman will believe it any of that

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.150
there's your mood in the sun harborview

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.049
i'm community would turn around and go
well if you want to know blue

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.560
uh... you know something should do if
you straight through four

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.930
that they don't hand

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.500
perhaps for meetings

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.439
but that time

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:43.690
so at that time

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:49.090
so according to the asst tenet temples
website sickness are popular popularly

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:52.730
uh... denies as a result of
misunderstandings intolerance and

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.740
fear-mongering opportunism satan has the
compassion and wisdom of an angel

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.150
but these guys are grupos

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.810
i like it that the uh... eleven million
were being given us

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.090
well

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.260
you argue ridin so

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:10.119
impact it would seem a little bit right

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.909
indict ice indicating but if you were
kidding you really believe in saving

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:16.460
i don't know if you know this but

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.150
you lose a pet

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.779
but the becky so if you believe in the
bible i wouldn't go in that direction

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:25.560
my guess is they're largely kind cheek
