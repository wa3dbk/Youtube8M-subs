00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:02.523
- [Sam] As you become a leader,

00:00:02.523 --> 00:00:04.989
you do less and less personally,

00:00:04.989 --> 00:00:06.865
but you try to create an environment

00:00:06.865 --> 00:00:09.261
for other people to thrive and succeed.

00:00:09.261 --> 00:00:11.136
The word "we" is very important to me.

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.197
Both of my parents were
pharmacists in Australia.

00:00:16.197 --> 00:00:18.217
I loved biology in school.

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:20.239
There was just a gravitation
to the natural world

00:00:20.239 --> 00:00:22.257
and curiosity how things worked.

00:00:22.673 --> 00:00:25.254
I went straight from high
school into medicine.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.064
- [Jane] I met Sam when I mentored him

00:00:28.064 --> 00:00:30.920
in his orientation to the
University of Queensland.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:32.870
I was 19 and Sam was 17.

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.635
- And Jan and I both wanted to travel,

00:00:34.635 --> 00:00:36.608
particularly into Southeast Asia.

00:00:36.608 --> 00:00:40.228
We worked in a hospital right
out on the Chinese border.

00:00:40.843 --> 00:00:42.032
And then back to Australia,

00:00:42.032 --> 00:00:43.781
eventually settled on pediatrics,

00:00:43.781 --> 00:00:45.408
specifically newborn medicine.

00:00:46.884 --> 00:00:48.293
- It's been a wonderful journey

00:00:48.293 --> 00:00:49.333
to be with Sam.

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:51.086
He's incredibly generous

00:00:51.563 --> 00:00:56.382
and he's very curious and
very interested in people.

00:00:56.382 --> 00:00:59.289
- [Sam] We, as a family, I
think are a curious family.

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.899
We love to talk to a wide range of people.

00:01:02.468 --> 00:01:05.360
Jane's been an incredibly
accomplished social worker

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.422
for 42 years.

00:01:06.422 --> 00:01:09.136
Part of what made her such
an effective social worker

00:01:09.136 --> 00:01:11.205
was her compassion for people.

00:01:11.205 --> 00:01:13.712
Watching her do that work was great lesson

00:01:13.712 --> 00:01:15.305
for me in my line of work.

00:01:20.228 --> 00:01:22.098
When I'd finished my clinical training,

00:01:22.098 --> 00:01:24.341
I was supported to seek an experience

00:01:24.341 --> 00:01:25.628
in research overseas.

00:01:25.628 --> 00:01:28.125
My final stop was San Francisco.

00:01:28.125 --> 00:01:31.414
In essence, a two hour
conversation with John Clements.

00:01:31.414 --> 00:01:34.269
It was just a personal
chemistry that clicked.

00:01:34.484 --> 00:01:36.053
When we arrived in 1982,

00:01:36.053 --> 00:01:38.248
UCSF was just a magical place.

00:01:38.248 --> 00:01:40.191
Being in San Francisco in the Bay area

00:01:40.191 --> 00:01:41.802
is part of that magic source.

00:01:41.802 --> 00:01:44.319
The innovation, the
entrepreneurship, the inclusiveness,

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.218
and it's a community that is
a collaborative community.

00:01:47.525 --> 00:01:49.046
It's a diverse community.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.228
I hope I can accomplish

00:01:51.228 --> 00:01:53.658
a little bit about giving
back to the community

00:01:53.658 --> 00:01:56.398
that has given me so
much over so many years.

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:58.784
One of my major goals at UCSF

00:01:58.784 --> 00:02:01.514
is to make sure that a
30-year-old arriving tomorrow

00:02:01.514 --> 00:02:04.378
gets the same wow experience that I've had

00:02:04.378 --> 00:02:05.959
over the last 30 years

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:08.863
that could not have been
matched anywhere else.

00:02:09.355 --> 00:02:14.126
