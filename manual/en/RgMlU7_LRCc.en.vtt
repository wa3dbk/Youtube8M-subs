00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:06.660
How to Pest-Proof Your Yard Naturally.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.379
Rid your backyard of annoying bugs without
exposing your family to chemicals and toxins.

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:21.029
You will need Candles, both regular and citronella
Basil, mint, and thyme Plants that bugs hate

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.839
Fans Neem oil A birdhouse and deodorant.

00:00:27.839 --> 00:00:28.839
Step 1.

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.960
Light candles when you’re outside; research
shows that people who are near candles get

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.100
fewer bug bites than those without protection.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.170
Step 2.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.469
Sprinkle some basil, mint, and thyme around
your garden.

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.649
These herbs are so good at repelling ants
that many countries put them in bags of grain

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.149
to keep the little buggers out.

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:48.149
Step 3.

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.809
Get rid of standing water; it’s where mosquitoes
breed and lay eggs.

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.890
Empty any toys, buckets, plastic covers, or
planters that have collected rainwater, and

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.550
change the water in birdbaths and fountains
at least once a week.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:05.960
If you do get bitten, rub the area with a
little deodorant; the aluminum in it will

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.460
help counteract the sting.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.550
Step 4.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.840
Plant geraniums and pyrethrum; mosquitoes
hate their scent.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.970
Keep deer&amp;#8212;and therefore the ticks they
carry&amp;#8212;out by planting ferns, daffodils,

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.060
tiger lilies, snapdragons, and morning glories.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:21.750
Step 5.

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.360
Place a few mini fans around your yard.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.970
Mosquitoes stay clear of them because they’re
not strong enough fliers to handle the wind.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:29.970
Step 6.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:30.970
Buy some neem oil.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.920
Available in health food and garden stores,
it repels 200 kinds of insects, including

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.220
mosquitoes, whiteflies, gnats, and ticks,
and it causes no side effects at all.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.970
Just spray a little of it wherever pests like
to hang out.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:47.200
You even can spray it directly on plants to
prevent bugs from eating them.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.390
Pure neem oil is safe for your skin, but certain
neem oil pesticide mixtures have toxic additives,

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.000
so read labels carefully.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Step 7.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.090
Get a birdhouse.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.680
Birds love eating the same flying bugs that
make your life miserable, making it a win-win

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.680
situation.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.420
Did you know Most insects are attracted to
bright colors and perfume!
