Hi guys. A quick update on the situation.
First, I've added two new perks to the IndieGoGo

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:28.199
campaign. Its 1 $, called the Believer. And
5000 $ - The Miracle Maker. Which I've added

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:39.420
actually more for shit and giggles, then actually
me believing that anybody will donate that much

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:50.469
Moving to the next subject. Things on
Greenlight and IndieGoGo are not doing very

00:00:50.469 --> 00:01:02.079
well, but still... Listen. Regardless do I
succeed with this or not... I am witnessing

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:14.720
a miracle. And acts of astronomic friendship,
devotion and loyalty. All of you who support

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:30.790
it right now. My dear fans and friends. You
are f****ing amazing. And I am being left

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:41.570
speechless. The amount of feedback, all this
troubles you are putting yourself through

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:51.680
just to spread the word about me. In my whole
life, I did not had even one friend like that.

00:01:51.680 --> 00:02:03.200
And now, out of the blue - I have hundreds.
I don't know what to say. I don't know how

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:11.950
to express my gratitude. I wish I could do
that in form of, you know, developing Antumbra

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:25.140
2, and making it perfect. One day, if everything
will work out. I'll spend my own personal

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:36.770
money. And I will visit each one of you. Regardless
do you live in New York city or at the North

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:49.230
Pole. And I will personally hug you. I won't
forget. You are my wings, you keep on putting

00:02:49.230 --> 00:03:02.020
tears into my eyes, you make me grow and raise
above the sky and beyond. Right now, from

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:17.370
5 days already, I am sleeping about 3 to 4
hours per day. That's why I look like shit.

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:28.060
Sorry if/when I cannot reply to you instantly.
There's just me doing everything. And gosh

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:44.319
how much there is to do. The To-Do list is
like... jesus. Like the list of sins. Stay

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:54.480
with me, stand by me. I refuse to give up.
Not without a fight. Like, they've used to

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:05.470
say: "I've came to this world screaming and
kicking, and I am leaving the same way."

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:15.819
Watch me bend and twist. In a dance of rotten shadows.
Where the eye's pupil blinks. In a very barren meadow.

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:24.759
Will I run or will I cry. Following
this doted line. Through the night of starless motion

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:36.539
Beyond my mind. And out of proportions.
I've actually wrote that a moment ago. Okey, enough for now.

00:04:36.539 --> 00:04:46.680
Time to jump back. To the
battlefield. Where the combat still burns.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.000
Kudos.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.430
Stay with me.
