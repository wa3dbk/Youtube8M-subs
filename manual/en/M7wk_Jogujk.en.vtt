Thank you for joining us today.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.830
I’m Rudy Stebih and welcome to Episode 4
– Windows 8 Tablet Simulator here on Help

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.010
Desk TV.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.110
By now you’ve had a chance to look over
our Windows 8 videos featured on the desktop.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:30.060
But how would you like to experience Windows
8 on a Tablet.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.369
I know, I hear you.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:39.030
You were not one of the conference attendees
at Build that were treated to a Samsung tablet

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.199
to take with them to preview &amp; develop Windows
8 apps on.

00:00:44.199 --> 00:00:46.109
Not to worry though.

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:52.179
Windows 8 Development Preview comes bundled
with a Windows Tablet simulator.

00:00:52.179 --> 00:00:57.520
And all you have to do to experience this
is to:

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.739
Start the file explorer.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:31.530
And click on “C:\Program Files (x86)\Common
Files\Microsoft Shared\Windows Simulator\Microsoft.Windows.Simulator.exe”

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.660
program file.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:43.050
After a few seconds, the virtual tablet will
pop up giving you your very own virtual tablet

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:48.350
experience inside of Windows 8.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:56.640
First, before we go any further, make sure
you have clicked on the hand icon on the side

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.750
bar to start the touch simulation.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:07.570
You will notice that now your mouse icon has
a ‘+’ symbol surround by a circle attached

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:09.019
to it.

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:12.940
This we will call your ‘Finger Target’.

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:19.359
Essentially, anywhere you place this finger
target, and click the mouse button, will simulate

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:23.549
a finger press.

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:29.880
Following along those lines, if you click
the left mouse button on the tablet screen,

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.690
and hold the mouse button down, then swoosh
your mouse pointer to the left and letting

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:49.450
go of the mouse button near the end of your
swoosh, the tiles will scroll to the left.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:58.300
Doing this procedure in the reverse direction
will scroll the tiles to the right.

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:08.140
Now, to get at the ‘Charm’ menu, place
your finger target on the right side of the

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:17.760
tablet screen, and click-drag to the left.

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:26.549
Clicking anywhere on the screen will hide
the ‘Charm’ menu.

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:32.370
If you’d like to change the tablet screen
resolution, just click the little square box

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:48.099
on the side bar, and from the pop up menu,
select the screen resolution of your choice.

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:59.540
You can then drag one of the corners of the
tablet to resize the window as normal.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:06.349
Just above the tablet resolution button, there
are 2 buttons to rotate the tablet to simulate

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:10.659
a portrait orientation.

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:17.880
Selecting one or the other button will rotate
the tablet either in the clockwise or counter

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:27.910
clockwise direction.

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:34.670
By clicking on the big windows logo on the
bottom of the tablet, you will simulate pressing

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:42.880
the Windows key on the ‘Charm’ menu.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.660
Now comes my favorite feature.

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:53.820
Selecting the double arrow icon on the side
bar will activate the pinch/zoom feature.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:59.900
And you will now notice that your mouse cursor
has 2 ‘Finger Targets’.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:08.500
You simulate a pinch zoom by holding the left-mouse
button down while rotating your mouse scroll

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:20.320
wheel to either zoom in or zoom out.

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:26.850
After finishing zooming the page to your desire
magnification, left-clicking and dragging

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:39.770
the mouse around, will move the zoomed window
inside your tablet screen.

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:46.090
And now lastly, left clicking and dragging
from the left side of the screen will switch

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:58.380
between your active apps.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:00.990
I hope you enjoyed todays Help Desk TV.
