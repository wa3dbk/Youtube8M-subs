00:00:00.034 --> 00:00:01.296
Ron...

00:00:01.369 --> 00:00:04.132
come say a few words,
would you, please?

00:00:04.204 --> 00:00:05.796
Ron Kovic, ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:05.873 --> 00:00:08.808
He was born
on the 4th ofJuly, 1 946.

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:12.312
Give him a big hand
on his great birthday.

00:00:21.054 --> 00:00:24.147
I just want to say
for the guys in Vietnam

00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:25.656
that we're doing our best.

00:00:25.725 --> 00:00:28.489
It's not an easy situation,

00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:33.999
but the boys' morale
over there is real high,

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.500
and you can feel
confident that we are--

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:39.002
We are going to win that war.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.844
I served my country,

00:00:46.912 --> 00:00:50.279
and I don't want you
to feel sorry for me.

00:00:50.348 --> 00:00:52.282
Do not shed a tear.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.446
I have my hands,
my eyes, my ears...

00:00:56.521 --> 00:00:57.953
I have my heart...

00:00:59.857 --> 00:01:01.290
and I have...

00:01:01.358 --> 00:01:02.791
what I feel...

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.666
I have what I feel is...

00:01:11.735 --> 00:01:13.828
an unquen--quenchable...

00:01:48.036 --> 00:01:49.469
O.K. It's O.K., Ronnie.

00:01:49.538 --> 00:01:50.902
It's O.K., kid.

00:01:53.708 --> 00:01:55.005
I'm sorry.

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:57.242
I'm sorry.
