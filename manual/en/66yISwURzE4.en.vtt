00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Our Ford Ka in the workshop.. what a shame!

00:00:11.029 --> 00:00:13.909
I like it this way!

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.349
Honking..

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:26.429
For this time we have a Ford Ka to test

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.429
We're now testing the sand track-ability

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:33.920
Of course it's important for every family..

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.340
that your car handles well on sand tracks. We're driving 70km/h..

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.060
and the handling is excellent

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:46.580
I'm quite satisfied with this car

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:48.950
Here we are! The forest!

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:51.870
Anyway.. we can say this car isn't made for offroad use..

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.870
Let's see how the trail-ability is of this car..

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:08.930
Show it!

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:17.510
Of course.. a piece of fender

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:40.670
You're missing a few parts!

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:45.410
Handy!!

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.430
This car adapts itself to the track

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.150
Okay, let's proceed testing!

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:17.329
Not bad!

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.439
I think that too! This test was a success

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:23.709
I think we have a beer to celebrate

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.739
We have to check with the dealer if that's warranty

00:02:29.179 --> 00:02:32.649
In fact we just used this car like anybody else..

00:02:32.649 --> 00:02:39.649
This is not normal! I can't rememeber this notch was here before..

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:43.049
Me neither..

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.179
Ah it's a camera support!

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:47.280
Yes Bertus..

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.169
We showed how it's done..

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.419
I'm only used to big American cars..

00:02:52.419 --> 00:02:55.169
This is also a...uh

00:02:55.169 --> 00:02:58.309
Not an American and also not so big.. but it's a car at least.. go ahead!

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:29.280
Vegas driving!

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:55.069
Hurting your jaws? Because you're laughing all the time?

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:58.319
Our Ford Ka still drives..

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:05.319
This time is Koen going to drive.. .not a CApri but a KA

00:04:21.559 --> 00:04:23.080
These are made for offroading!!

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:30.080
Reliable!

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.570
You could choose what direction you wanted to go? It's now steering both directions at once..

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:58.680
How is that possible?

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:00.960
It smells a little...

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.559
That's the last time we borrow you a car

00:05:08.219 --> 00:05:10.870
Yes Verhoeven, our Ford Ka still drives..

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.800
Not for long!

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.800
I believe so, you even can't keep your Vitara on 4 wheels here.. So I'm curious..

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:30.240
Poor Ford Ka..

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.339
We really have to straighten that steering rod.. It's not possible to drive with it anymore..

00:06:04.339 --> 00:06:07.639
It goes everywhere.. if only it went straight, but that's even not possible..

00:06:07.639 --> 00:06:09.389
It chooses for itself where it goes..

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:11.680
Like Herbie!

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:13.619
This was a serieus car test!

00:06:13.619 --> 00:06:17.499
Next time we're going to test our nice new Renault Twingo!

00:06:17.499 --> 00:06:20.580
Let's see what the panel says!

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.839
The test panel!

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:24.319
Koen! 8

00:06:24.319 --> 00:06:31.319
I think it's worth a 6... this one? I think a 6 ~ 7

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:35.529
I think the Twingo won't beat the Ford, so I go for 7

00:06:35.529 --> 00:06:37.330
I would say: Subscribe!

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:39.040
Stay tuned! Next time we have to test a Twingo

00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:39.900
We'll see it!
