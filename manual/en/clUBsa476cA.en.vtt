00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:04.070
[Drum line and cheering.]

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:15.682
It's great to be here with
over 1,000 of our employees.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:17.450
We've been here for 21 years

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:21.454
and we wouldn't want to miss being here this year.

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:23.556
Well, Kaiser Permanente
and its history

00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.024
has been about inclusion.

00:00:25.024 --> 00:00:27.594
It's been about diversity
from the very beginning.

00:00:27.594 --> 00:00:30.697
We've had a partnership
with the Warriors

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:33.032
for the last several years

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:37.804
so it's great that we're here with them as world champions.

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:40.206
This is the biggest contingent
that we've had thus far

00:00:40.206 --> 00:00:42.175
and of course with our partnership with the Warriors

00:00:42.175 --> 00:00:43.676
that's a big part of that.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.279
But it's also showing that
it's a significant weekend

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:52.152
for gay rights with the
marriage equality decision.

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:56.322
I'm really proud of my family
and I'm proud to work for Kaiser

00:00:56.322 --> 00:00:59.459
and I wanted my daughter
to feel proud as well.

00:00:59.459 --> 00:01:03.396
We're just so touched by the--

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:07.033
we're just so touched
by the decision.

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:08.201
It's no longer gay marriage.

00:01:08.201 --> 00:01:10.303
It's marriage for everyone.

00:01:10.303 --> 00:01:13.072
It's an historic moment and
I'm so happy to be here

00:01:13.072 --> 00:01:16.609
and take care of patients,
transgender patients.

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:19.245
And we're just being supported
in more of what we do.

00:01:19.245 --> 00:01:20.847
It's great to be with
an employer that is

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:26.186
supportive and open and
allows us to be ourselves.

00:01:26.186 --> 00:01:29.389
Nobody walks the walk better than Kaiser Permanente.

00:01:29.389 --> 00:01:32.792
I'm an out gay man and
I feel so supported here

00:01:32.792 --> 00:01:37.030
at Kaiser Permanente, working here, getting my healthcare.

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.834
We place a lot of emphasis on
culturally competent care

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:44.170
and being an organization
that embraces all people.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.172
[woman blows whistle]

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:49.943
We're one community.
We are one.

00:01:49.943 --> 00:01:53.813
We take care of over 10 million
people from all walks of life.

00:01:53.813 --> 00:01:57.884
So when people come to see us
we have to be very clear

00:01:57.884 --> 00:02:00.620
that we have one agenda
which is to provide them

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.489
the best care possible.

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:04.090
Diversity gives us strength.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.292
Diversity gives us a better outcome on how we take care

00:02:06.292 --> 00:02:09.128
of our members and how we function as a team

00:02:09.128 --> 00:02:11.531
when we're providing care.

00:02:11.531 --> 00:02:14.000
And you can feel it
in the organization

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.970
what a difference it makes.

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:18.972
