00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.700
The year is finally on a roll and March saw
a solid block of releases that finally made

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.400
me have to pick and choose carefully.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.530
As always the judgment call on these is personal,
so let us know what had you excited in the

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:20.510
month of March.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.760
This is AppSpy's Top 3 iOS Games for March,
2013.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.960
While some have complained about the controls,
I only found they added an endearing quality

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.050
to the nameless robot your control.

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.280
He's just a little bit clumsy thanks to his
haphazard construction - that's my story and

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.530
I'm sticking to it.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.440
That said, for a game with such a limited
control scheme it manages to throw a whole

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.249
lot of interesting puzzles at the player,
making it well worth checking out if you haven't

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:49.179
already done so on the PC.

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:53.210
It's not often I find myself in a position
of actually empathizing with a main character

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.670
in an iOS title.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.050
Often this is not the fault of the developer
- there's only so much you can do with an

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.929
Arcade game - so I'm willing to be lenient,
however Fetch's incredibly simple yet heartwarming

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:07.780
storyline kept me plowing through its incredibly
detailed world.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.960
If you have a child or you don't mind games
that err on the easy side, you're sure to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.250
enjoy Fetch.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.360
Maybe it's unfair to award two adapted titles,
but it's hard to say no to a game like Nightsky,

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.260
especially when it feels perfectly suited
to iOS devices.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.640
With little more than tilting back and forth,
as well as the occasional tap, you'll need

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.920
to solve a series of fine-tuned puzzles centered
around the momentum of the orb you're controlling.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.840
This can range from flipping gravity to controlling
vehicles - it's surprising how much variety

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.250
there is and well worth checking out.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.360
Of course we can't cater to everyone's tastes,
so you might also find yourself loving titles

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.570
like:
Block Fortress and it's incredibly deep build-em-up

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.520
tower defense by way of Minecraft gameplay;
Super Stickman Golf 2 keeps the series running

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:56.200
strong and even manages to throw in a few
new surprises; Ridiculous Fishing had a rough

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.250
start thanks to Ninja Fishing stealing some
of its thunder, but this release proves it's

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:05.390
still the king of the hill; and lastly, Dungeon
Hearts won't be to everyone's tastes, but

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.410
a recent update has managed to balance and
stabilize the game, giving this wonderfully

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:12.849
unique genre hybrid a second chance at success.

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.210
