00:00:00.549 --> 00:00:04.769
 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.310
 

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:15.239
So at the end of the year, people always like to reminisce about all the great times that they had, and since Christmas just ended,

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:22.829
and because I'm in such a Christmas spirity mood, I'm gonna be telling you guys all the great wonderful reasons why 2009 sucked platypus sh--

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:24.829
(theme music, overlapping speech)

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.180
2009 is finally gonna be over. Thank God.

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.489
You're welcome, Ryan. Hehehe.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:45.280
The f--

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.349
Anyway, like I was saying earlier, people like to think about all the good things that happened in the year.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.169
But I'm a pessimistic person. I see the glass half-empty even when it's full. So here are a few reasons why 2009 sucked.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.480
Let's start off with one of the biggest events of all, that's right, Michael Jackson's death.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.400
And I'm not gonna be one of those people talking about

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.800
how sad

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.559
Michael Jackson's death, because everybody knows

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.509
how sad his death was. What about Farrah Fawcett? She died on the same day, in fact, before him. She was first.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.470
She won.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.119
Yet nobody gave a damn, because apparently Michael Jackson's death was more important, and I agree. Haha, just kidding!

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.279
But seriously, nobody gave a damn. Let me tell you, when everybody was crying over Michael, I stood up and I said, no!

00:01:20.279 --> 00:01:22.279
I...

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:28.319
I'm sorry. I don't even know who Farrah Fawcett is. Is that like a type of sink?
 Cuz if it isn't, it should be.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.220
Thanks to the new Farrah fawcett, your water will come out wetter than ever.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:33.990
I'm just playing.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:39.059
You should never make money off of someone else's death. That's horrible. I mean, really, who does that?

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.610
Hee-hee!

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:45.089
But anyway, moving on, another horrible death that took place this year, one of my idols, Billy Mays.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:49.619
You know who that is, right? The spokesperson that would always shout at you to buy his products. He was an inspiration.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.429
He didn't just make me want to buy OxiClean, he made me want to BUY

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.460
OXICLEAN! So I did. In my opinion, he was the best spokesperson, better than the ShamWow guy. Don't get me wrong.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.179
I love the ShamWow guy too, but imagine if they worked together. They would have been unstoppable.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.323
Hi, Billy Mays here, and this is the Farrah fawcett! Vince?

00:02:07.323 --> 00:02:08.819
Alright. This is gonna

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.919
be fast. Make sure you keep up. We got your faucet.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.729
We got your lever. We lift the lever, the water comes out. Boom, you're done. You getting this, cameraman?

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:15.800
Uh, what?

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.680
Are you getting this?

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.340
What?

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.750
Are you getting this, cameraman?

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:19.740
Oh, yeah.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.800
Great. So let's try this again. You lift the lever, the water comes out. It's all wet. You're done.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.800
You'll be saying "what the (bleep)" every time.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.160
Yeah, maybe that wouldn't work out so well, but you know what I mean. Anyway,

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.809
there's so many other horrible things that happened this year. Brittany Murphy died. Chris Brown beat Rihanna.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.009
Patrick Swayze died. Taylor Swift picking on Kanye. All my guppies died.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:43.530
Asian Kid is number one on YouTube. And even Tiger Woods cheating on his wife with a bunch of other women. Then again,

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:46.270
he was just following Nike's slogan. You know? He just did it. Anyway,

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.759
there's a lot more, but it would take forever to get through them

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.450
all. I don't want to leave on a bad note, so I'm gonna tell you one good thing that happened this year.

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:58.239
I've finally been reunited with my big green ball, and guess what. That's right. It's a boy!
