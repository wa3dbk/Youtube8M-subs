00:00:05.586 --> 00:00:07.011
Hi, I am Francis, 

00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:09.633
the host of this show "Cooking with Dog."

00:00:16.638 --> 00:00:20.230
First, let’s make the sauce for the roast beef.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.443
In a pot, combine the dashi stock, 

00:00:24.713 --> 00:00:25.897
soy sauce 

00:00:28.627 --> 00:00:29.945
and mirin.

00:00:31.854 --> 00:00:33.421
Turn on the burner.

00:00:34.709 --> 00:00:38.790
Use a small, deep pot so the entire cut will fit.

00:00:39.203 --> 00:00:41.078
When the sauce begins to boil, 

00:00:41.078 --> 00:00:42.949
turn off the burner.

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.070
Now, lightly sprinkle the salt over the entire surface of the bottom round roast.

00:00:59.661 --> 00:01:02.366
Likewise, sprinkle on the pepper.

00:01:03.326 --> 00:01:07.350
Bottom round is a relatively lean, inexpensive meat 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.388
and the slices are often used for sukiyaki and shabu shabu.

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.118
Heat a pan 

00:01:15.777 --> 00:01:17.701
and add the vegetable oil.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.674
Swirl to coat it with the oil.

00:01:25.725 --> 00:01:28.076
Place the beef into the pan 

00:01:28.076 --> 00:01:30.571
and saute it on high heat.

00:01:40.854 --> 00:01:43.957
Once the entire surface is browned, 

00:01:43.957 --> 00:01:45.513
turn off the burner 

00:01:46.451 --> 00:01:48.022
and reheat the sauce.

00:01:51.832 --> 00:01:54.370
Then, place the beef into the pot.

00:01:56.897 --> 00:01:58.732
Bring it to a boil 

00:01:59.516 --> 00:02:03.345
and then reduce the heat to the lowest possible level.

00:02:07.075 --> 00:02:11.485
Ladle the sauce over the beef to help it cook evenly 

00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:14.730
and simmer for about 15 minutes in total.

00:02:20.531 --> 00:02:24.326
Flip the beef over 2 to 3 times while cooking.

00:02:26.364 --> 00:02:31.646
Browning the surface on high heat will help it to retain the savory juices 

00:02:31.646 --> 00:02:35.660
and simmering on low heat will allow it to cook slowly, 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.866
making the roast beef tender.

00:02:40.446 --> 00:02:43.590
Now, let’s check if the inside is ready.

00:02:44.328 --> 00:02:47.115
Pierce the beef with a metal skewer, 

00:02:47.115 --> 00:02:50.228
leaving the tip at the center for 10 seconds.

00:02:51.984 --> 00:02:52.898
Remove 

00:02:52.898 --> 00:02:56.942
and place the tip just below your lip to check the temperature.

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.235
If it is warm, 

00:02:59.235 --> 00:03:03.079
the center of the beef should be the desired pink color.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.197
Turn off the burner 

00:03:05.197 --> 00:03:07.953
and allow it to sit until cool.

00:03:08.988 --> 00:03:11.831
And now, let’s serve the roast beef.

00:03:12.292 --> 00:03:18.101
Soak the thinly sliced onion in a bowl of ice water for about 5 minutes.

00:03:18.535 --> 00:03:22.548
Then, remove the excess water using a paper towel.

00:03:24.168 --> 00:03:28.197
Place the onion onto a plate along with the shiso leaves.

00:03:30.592 --> 00:03:34.449
Now, remove the roast beef from the pot 

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:37.007
and place it onto a cutting board.

00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:42.141
Slice it into about one eighth inch slices.

00:03:57.804 --> 00:04:02.352
For better presentation, carefully fold each slice 

00:04:03.784 --> 00:04:05.852
and arrange them on the plate.

00:04:09.233 --> 00:04:11.438
Top with the broccoli sprouts.

00:04:15.483 --> 00:04:18.111
Finally, pour the sauce into a bowl.

00:04:20.332 --> 00:04:24.244
Use wasabi or karashi hot mustard as a condiment 

00:04:24.244 --> 00:04:27.020
and enjoy the roast beef with the sauce.

00:04:27.691 --> 00:04:30.644
This is a perfect dish to entertain your guests 

00:04:30.644 --> 00:04:34.424
during the busy year-end and New Year holidays.

00:04:40.527 --> 00:04:45.812
Roast beef is also used as a bread filling or salad ingredient.

00:04:45.812 --> 00:04:47.567
Good luck in the kitchen!
