Hi this is Laura Turner and today I'm going
to talk to you about how to write an ode.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:16.080
An ode is the poem that is addressed to raise
up loftily a person or an object. First what

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.910
you want to do is you want to decide what
you'll like to write your ode about. And by

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.730
doing that you need to find something that
you are passionate about that you would like

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:32.910
to spend several lines with writing a poem
on. I have chosen today as an example, the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.070
poem, the ode, ode on a Grecian urn by Keats.
And what we'll do is we'll actually look at

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:44.470
this and I'm going to show you the proper
format for making an ode. Because that' s

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.320
one thing that I really can do, what I can't
do is I can't tell you what you want to write

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:57.460
about. So standard format for this kind of
a poem is to write ten lines stances in this

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:11.240
particular ABABCDECDE format. And as we see
here, with ode on a Grecian urn, thou still

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:20.710
unravish'd bride of quietness. The first line
rhymes with the third line. Silvan historian,

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:29.479
who canst thus express. So quietness , express.
The second line, thou foster child of silence

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:36.700
and slow time is a B rhyme or the second word
that is going to rhyme in the poem, rhymes

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:45.090
with the fourth line, a flowery tale more
sweetly than our rhyme. So time, rhyme, quietness,

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:52.400
express. And as we go down through the poem
we see shape, shape rhyming actually, cause

00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:01.479
we have to skip to get to the C again. Escape,
so if we see how that works both, loathe,

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:09.899
Arcady, ecstasy. And so we see how we don't
have to rhyme with every other line. We can

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.840
actually skip around a little bit and it gives
the poem a kind of nice shape to it in that

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:23.560
it's not just you know rat, bat, cat, sat,
mat, right. That it's actually playing with

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.340
words, so you want to give yourself the opportunity
to free yourself with this rhyme and not use

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.340
it as something that is constraining you.
Because I think it really does seem like a

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.830
very fun rhyme to write in. And you can actually
make your ode as long as you would like. I

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:47.879
have read odes that are as long as whole entire
books. But probably a good length you know,

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:54.620
would be whatever you would like it to be.
So go ahead and have fun writing your ode.
