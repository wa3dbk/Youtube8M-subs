00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:10.870
[music intro]

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:34.329
Hey guys, Jeff Cavaliere, from athleanx.com.

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:45.080
Here with Ben May, the winner of the first
Mister X of the year.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:51.230
An award for his transformation that he made
in the last, basically he followed the program

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.700
about seven months ago, really he did an amazing
job, you can read all about it over the blog,

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.000
from ATHLEAN-X, about his specific numbers
and his ability to drop almost, what, 15%

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.369
of body fat, or 16% body fat and really transformed
himself to get more muscular and lean.

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.160
Well, Ben is here, he's been flown in here
as a part for his award for being, you know

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.310
for his accomplishments, to the X-Box, spending
a couple of days with me.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.219
We wanna take the opportunity to sort of create
an abs exercise.

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:26.930
We'll do something for you guys that you will
find valuable I think.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.909
Now, Ben wants you to program one his I guess
favorite or one of those that he worked on

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.880
it, I don't know if favorite is the right
word, but worded his abs was the canoe exercise,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:37.880
right?

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.079
&gt;&gt; Jeff: Show me the canoe exercise.

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:43.299
&gt;&gt; Ben: So the Canoe is like this, as if you
were sitting in a canoe and then you pretend

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:44.299
to have...

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:45.299
&gt;&gt; Jeff: Right.

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.640
So you're working your obliques , you're working
your abs, you gotta hold yourself sort of

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.600
that unsymmetrical position but at the same
time you're working there.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.429
We kind of talked about, he started to master
that and get a little, have that become a

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.619
little easy, but the nice thing I like to
think about ATHLEAN-X is that the exercises

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:03.369
that are in this program not only are they
unique and most of all very different from

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.530
the products and things you've done in the
past or you were used to doing, but I can

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:08.530
think they're open ended.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:14.110
And what I mean by that is, this are exercises
that can always be made to be harder to adapt

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:21.340
to your level of strength, so we came up with
an exercise up here to modify the canoe and

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.780
make it quite a challenge.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.750
&gt;&gt;Jeff: I didn't see you throw up for the
first time, ok?

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.270
So I don't even know how you wanna call it,
maybe something called a torture but really

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.190
what we're gonna do is: go ahead and come
back down.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.400
We're gonna start and he's gonna combine what
we know as the roll up from the Pilates, so

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.629
roll up and be coming up here, trying to get
some flexibility back here, roll up now, you

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.410
actually go back piece by piece on the ground,
right?

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.099
One vertebra at the time, really working your
abs.

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.780
Now I'm gonna stop you, now you hold that
position, I know you're really working your

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:52.159
abs because I can see you shaking.

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:57.000
Lift the legs up, put your hands up on your
head, now I want you to rotate down to the

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.689
ground and rotate down to the ground.

00:02:58.689 --> 00:02:59.850
Just like that, but no cheating.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.860
You can't go and drop your elbows.

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.280
You gotta actually rotate your shoulders 40
times, 20 and 20.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.650
Alright, now cranking out a little bit of
a pace, here you go.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.319
Good, feet are up still, abs are engaged,
still having rotation, still have that component

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:16.319
of the canoe.

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.719
&gt;&gt;Jeff: I haven't been counting.

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:23.680
When you get your 20 and 20 let me know.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:24.680
&gt;&gt; Ben: 35...

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.680
40.

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.329
Now, he's gonna come straight up again, feet
can touch the ground.

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:35.710
He's gonna stretch, one stretch, come back
down, keep it there, stop again, another forty.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:37.879
&gt;&gt; Jeff: Guess how many rounds we'll be doing
Ben?

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:38.879
&gt;&gt; Ben: Many.

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.780
&gt;&gt; Jeff: We're doing five rounds with these,
so you're going to do 200 reps, ok?

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.530
This is going to be quite a challenge so I
want you to crank it out, keep it going, I'll

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:50.550
sort of comment on how out of breath you are
and how much more close to death you are,

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.849
but I'll give it to them play by play.

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.730
But you just keep crank out the exercise.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:56.730
&gt;&gt; Ben: Forty!

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:57.870
&gt;&gt; Jeff: That's forty, that's two rounds.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.050
Come up and gets his stretch, he's also gonna
get better stretch each time, because that's

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:07.680
one of the principles of Pilates, as you continue
to actively go through these motions you will

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:10.110
increase your flexibility to your back.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.650
So he's in the middle of the third round here,
and he's gonna get over the hump when he can

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:16.280
finally get through this one.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.550
Good, he's not cheating.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:21.359
A cheat would be just to drop that elbow on
that rotation.

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:23.020
&gt;&gt; Jeff: Come on, hang in there!

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.319
Two more.

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:25.770
Here you go.

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.780
He's getting his fourth round of forty.

00:04:29.780 --> 00:04:36.400
He's still keeping good, he's still good posture,
he's keeping his good technique, dropping

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.110
just elbow to elbow, down to down.

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:40.240
Good.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:48.150
He's burning, now I see winches in his eyes,
so he is getting towards the end.

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:51.670
&gt;&gt; Jeff: Come on, forty more!

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.992
&gt;&gt; Jeff: Now threat these ones as the most
important ones, right?

00:04:55.992 --> 00:04:58.810
Because these are the ones that are in the
most amount of fatigue, these are the ones

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:59.810
that count.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.740
All other rounds are reps that get you to
this point; you know they're just there to

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:09.529
get you to the point that really matters.

00:05:09.529 --> 00:05:13.630
&gt;&gt; Jeff: There you go.

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.800
Now, how much easier is this that the canoes?

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.780
&gt;&gt; Ben: Easy I wouldn't call them.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:23.620
&gt;&gt; Jeff: Basically we took an exercise like
the Canoe that you were doing a great job

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:25.980
on, but we've just elevated it to a whole
another level.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.980
&gt;&gt;Ben: Yeah!

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.650
And that's the whole thing about ATHLEAN-X
guys, is that, you know, when you start the

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:34.300
ATHLEAN-X program there is no, this is a life
style change, so there's no end to this, there's

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:40.910
not like you started, you're done and then
you get back to being overweight, without

00:05:40.910 --> 00:05:41.910
shape.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.440
It's a life style and it's something that
evolves with you.

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.670
If you've been on the fence about, wondering
about if this program works for you or whether

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:52.819
you will outgrow the program trust me guys,
you won't outgrow the program.

00:05:52.819 --> 00:05:56.490
You knew, I will make sure that Ben never
outgrows this program, he'll always fell it

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:02.610
challenges him, but that's just one way we
have with this open exercises to be able to

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.040
modify and make them even more difficult.

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.270
So, Ben thanks again, you did an unbelievable
job.

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:11.080
We're gonna actually come back here again,
we have two videos with Ben this week, a really

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.780
cool workout that he wanted to do.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.430
He said; hey Jeff, what if I have like a mid
class I'm going to school.

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:20.370
I need to knock out everything in one workout,
like a total body workout.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.699
What would you recommend?

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:23.680
How would you structure that and come up with
something really good.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:27.449
So we're gonna come back with that later this
week in a whole new way.

00:06:27.449 --> 00:06:31.250
So, the Double X Destroyer, I think it's called
this one.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.830
So we'll show you exactly what that's all
about.

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.440
