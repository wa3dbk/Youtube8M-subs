Hi. This is Marty from Blue Lightning TV.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.400
I'm going to show you how to create
smooth, blemish-free skin from a photo.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:24.720
This isn't update of a tutorial I did on an earlier version of Photoshop.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.180
Open a photo you'd like to retouch.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:30.240
I downloaded this one from Shutterstock.com.

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.020
The first step is to make a selection of
your subject's skin.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.980
There are many ways to do this, so choose the method that works best for you.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.180
For example, you could use your Quick Selection tool

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:44.330
and drag over the skin to select it.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.780
To remove areas at the selection, press
and hold Alt or Option as you drag over it.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.630
Go to Select and Refine Edge.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:11.650
I did an in-depth tutorial on Refine Edge, so I won't be going over all the details here.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.850
Check Smart Radius and increase the Radius a little bit.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.380
Brush over the areas where the hair overlaps the skin

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.460
and output it as a "New Layer with Layer Mask".

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.360
Click the box next to your original photo to make it visible

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.460
and go to Filter, Blur and Surface Blur.

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:46.909
For this image, I'll make the Radius: 16

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.260
and the Threshold: 12 levels, however,

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.080
you may want to adjust these amounts
depending on the size and resolution

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.140
of your photo. Choose a combination
that smooths out the skin

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.200
just enough to hide most blemishes and imperfections.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.300
Don't be concerned about its texture yet.
We'll take care that in a minute.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.940
Next, we'll restore back the areas of
the face that we don't want smoothed out,

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.760
such as the eyes, eyebrows and lips.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.060
To do this, click the Layer Mask to make it active

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:18.879
and open your Brush tool

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:21.440
and your Brush Picker.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.450
We'll take care of the size in a moment.
Make the Hardness: 0%

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.740
and the Opacity and Flow: 100%. Than, press Enter or Return.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:39.820
To make your brush larger or smaller, press the right or left bracket key on your keyboard.

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.219
Brush over any areas you want to reveal back the original unretouched photo

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:48.680
 and adjust the brush size accordingly.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.800
I'll brush inside the eyebrows, eyes and eye lids

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.740
lips

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.460
and fine hair overlapping the forehead.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.820
If you have areas of the face where the
skin pores didn't smooth over,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.900
let's blur them a bit, so they'll blend into the face.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:15.479
Make the face layer active

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.720
and open your Blur tool.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.550
Make its Strength: 100%

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.820
and adjust its size accordingly. Brush over those areas to blend them in.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.820
Next, we'll remove any spots left on the face.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.820
Open your Spot Healing Brush.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.260
Make sure the Content Aware button is active.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.620
Adjust the size of your tool a bit larger than the blemish and brush over it.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.470
Continue until all the blemishes, scars and other imperfections are removed.

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:01.670
When you're done, go to Filter, Noise and "Add Noise".

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.440
Tick "Gaussian" and check "Monochromatic".

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.180
Drag the sider to an amount that results with the grain that matches the rest if your image.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:16.280
I'm using an amount of approximately one
and a half percent, however,

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.500
your image may require a different
amount depending on its size and resolution.

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:29.580
This is Marty from Blue Lightning TV.

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:30.800
Thanks for watching!
