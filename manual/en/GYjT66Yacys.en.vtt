ANNE MOONEY: Hi, I'm Ann Mooney. I'm a personal
chef here in Orlando in Winter Park, Florida.

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:11.800
I'm also a food columnist for Simply The Best
Magazine in Delray Beach, Florida, and today,

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:19.570
I'm here on behalf of Expert Village to talk
about risotto, one of the most classic, simple,

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.970
and nutritious Italian dishes there is. It's
becoming very popular in the United States.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.689
Now, as we about talked before, you need five
basic ingredients. You need a short-grain

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:40.590
Italian rice, sushi rice is not going to do
it. It should be either arborio or carnaroli

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:45.019
rice, and they are available at your local
grocery store. You don't have to go some place

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:52.239
special. You need a couple of tablespoons
of either onions--oops--or shallots or some

00:00:52.239 --> 00:01:01.510
garlic, maybe. You need some olive oil, probably
about three tablespoons of it, white wine--nothing

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:10.270
is worse for white wine; everything is better--and
five cups of any kind of stock you happen

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.140
to have on hand. Now, all of these ingredients
can be in your pantry at all times. So if

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.140
you come home late from work and you're just
exhausted, and you don't mind spending 27

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:30.310
minutes at the stove, you have a nutritious,
wonderful, comfort meal right here at your

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:41.140
finger tips. The other thing that's very important
that you have is the right pan, and the pan

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:49.820
that is the best for this purpose is--what
I have here is a sort of a skillet wok but

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:58.310
it's a wide pan but it's deep enough to allow
the rice to absorb the liquid while it cooks

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:04.210
and not have the liquid evaporate off too
quickly. So if you have all this stuff, you

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.460
can make risotto and you have a wonderful
last-minute meal.
