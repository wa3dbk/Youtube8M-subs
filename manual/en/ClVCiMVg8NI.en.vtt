00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.990
so in dallas texas their work sumanth we
tried to steal

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.500
the money that these two girls scouts
made off of selling cookies in front of

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.500
a grocery store right uh... and move and
it it was a rotten move so they sold two

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.000
hundred dollars and they tried to get
into the get-away vehicle however uh...

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.109
one of the girls

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.050
clenched the driver in the face

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:23.480
whereas the other girl uh...

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:25.610
went to that passenger side

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:30.349
and she held onto the vehicle as they
were driving away she got injured

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:31.990
yet look

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.500
for the store and love of course the
likelihood for survival the what

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.910
but i think those are girls that you
don't mess with

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.510
although they don't do it then did not
have a car that's a terrible idea that

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.090
cookies are worth

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.640
and they got away with a decent amount
of money apparently two hundred dollars

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.360
yet i'm not so make you some of that
which is part of the story

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.390
did you know that the crossed out policy
is that you are responsible for the

00:00:58.390 --> 00:00:59.620
money lost

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.530
so these girls have to pay back the two
hundred dollars tackled the gross

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.700
cultural importance of paralleled we
make an exception here because i can

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.670
understand the policy they want to make
sure people like stealing previously

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.020
mike i would like i'd be in the car is
in my car on my way to south africa

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.390
as economy that is a pretty good parts
of it but it is anything have to make an

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.300
exception

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.270
well idea that i see people already
raising money for these girls on serious

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.470
to make sure that they that they don't
appear pocket

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.590
contract was he'd read every week i
began to get through steals from the

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.270
growth spurts

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:39.590

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.010

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.550
rolling again bob

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.759

enjoy is that these as much

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.080
right because he might have you know

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.619
injunctions inconsolably grossed out
what

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.220
pat

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:04.969
when she heard

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:10.269
at one of these emotional highly-visible
right now the unheard-of

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.579
how much you have slipped in the midst
of minerals daylight hours again to make

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:15.119
this point and say

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:19.439
economy is so bad that it's not class
warfare it's the middle class going

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:20.630
after one another

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:24.640
like were all fighting for nichols' and
dimes dragged to the point where you

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.690
have these two losers doing two hundred
dollars from girl scouts i'm sure it's

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.849
happened before the economy was really
bad being here more and more of these

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.400
stories like people stealing cars
stealing tires off the car like

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.110
stripping it of everything that they
could possibly sell people stealing like

desperate stories
