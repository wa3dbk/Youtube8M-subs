00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:09.980
Today I'm gonna show you how to

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.300
do a Furazone sweat. Your going to need a few things before you start.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:15.880
First is a role of cotton

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:20.760
you can either use paper towel or
sheet cotton. A twelve inch no bow

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.000
for the front, ten to twelve inch depending on your horse and if you're doing the hind

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:29.540
12 to 14 inch, again depending on the horse

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.970
You also need standing bandage. You need a roll of saran wrap

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:36.800
need Furazone, gloves and electrical tape

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.309
and if you are going to do a DMSO Furazone sweat then you need

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.350
a can of gel or liquid DMSO

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.530
the first thing you're gonna wanna do is put on your gloves

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.420
so you're going to need a generous amount of furazone

00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:00.300
Then

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:07.300
I apply with my hand and rub it in. Make sure you get whole joint capsule

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.229
you can also go up to the knee

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.950
to do this you just do what I am doing now but you cover the knee as well.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:22.570
and then when you apply the paper you
just put the paper on the knee first

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.280
and then put your bandage on and that will hold it up

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.790
and then put your plastic on and that will keep it.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.670
now apply furazone on his leg

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.900
remove my glove. Now if you were doing the DMSO sweat

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.020
now would be the time you add DMSO or  if you have a can you can mix the two in

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.210
you could premix it and it would you make your job a little bit easier right now

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.149
now you can take your cotton

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:59.149
starting on the inside go across the shin first

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.460
I'm using paper towel

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.090
but if you're using cotton, that's actually better. You're gonna take your No Bow

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.110
and put it on inside on the cannon bone

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.100
and come forward across

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:30.100
keeping consistent pressure

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:39.510
then you're gonna take your bandage

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.870
and start it a couple fingers down from the top

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.160
again...

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:53.160
consistent pressure

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.490
overlapping

00:02:56.490 --> 00:03:01.280
about half and you can judge that
depending on the

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.050
the bandage and how much left in your you have in your hand. You'll get

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:12.050
the feel for it, the more you do it. Then you take the saran wrap or cling wrap.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.830
again start

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:22.459
on the inside.

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:29.459
If you were doing the knee, you come up higher

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.980
and when you break the cling wrap never pull it

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.269
always break it with your fingers. If you
pull that you could

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.489
shift everything in your bandage and put undo pressure

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.870
tendons and ligaments. Then take your
electrical tape

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.950
and I usually put one strand of it

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.390
over the velcro where velcro goes. Make sure you

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:58.299
do this loose. There should not be any pressure on this because it puts

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.360
pressure high on your horse's tendon and and you can unwillingly bow them.

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.430
so if you're not confident that it's loose

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.880
don't be afraid pull it off and do it again until you feel you have it right.

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:14.670
And the last thing I do is put my hands over the shin and pull back

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:20.560
This just takes

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.560
any pressure pressure that might be
on your horse's tendon off

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:34.810
here and sweaty in it are is another
thing you can do you know if you have a

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:35.240
horse

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.380
you think is gonna play with the bandages and might want to pull it off or chew on it

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.990
you can also get

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.220
cayenne pepper from the spice section in the grocery store

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:48.310
and make a paste out of it with water

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:51.310
again using a glove rub it

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.750
on top the bandage down here on the back

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.479
and that way they will leave it alone.
