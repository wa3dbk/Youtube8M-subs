00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:31.300
welcome everyone .. in todays video i'm gonna teach you how to make a good looking paper sniper rifle that shoots

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.000
first you'll have to make 11 paper rolls with different shapes and sizes

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.480
i know it's alot of work but this will make the process much easier

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:51.300
to make the first type of rolls get a sheet of paper and roll it with a pencil then fix it with some tape and use a small stick to push the pencil out

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:01.040
to make the second one get a tube of paper glue and roll a sheet of paper with it then fix it with tape and then take the tube out

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:08.840
for the biggest ones get three sheets of paper  and roll them together  and you know what to do next

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:18.120
now we'll start the process by taking  4 paper rolls and put them together like that  fix them together with some tape

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.000
make sure you leave the area at the end untapped so that you can hold the trigger and the grip in place

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:34.060
after that press on both ends of the rolls and push it to the inside then take the biggest two rolls and stick both ends inside each roll

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.440
as you can see it will look something like a ninja stick

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:46.320
next take one paper roll and cut it equally in half

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:53.520
take one and press on it's tip to flatten it out then stick it between the rolls at the untapped area that i told you about

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.040
take the other one and glue it right behind the first one

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:08.860
now we need to make a cover for the grip so we'll cut a sheet  of paper in half and then fold each one this way

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.880
fold the top of each piece until it fits  with the grip then cut any excess paper you may have

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:22.340
after that glue each cover on both sides of the grip

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:32.540
you can leave it like that or you can put some tape around it to make it looks better

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.620
take a nother piece of roll and glue it at the bottom of the barrel

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.160
now we will make the stock by taking a piece of roll and gluing it back at the bottom

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.580
then cut the excess piece of roll and keep it for now

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.700
take another piece of roll and cut it equally in half

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.580
glue one piece at the top , the cut the other in half and glue one piece at the bottom

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:19.040
after that take a sheet of paper and fold it in half both ways , then fold the corners as if you're making a paper plane

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.840
take that and cover the stock with it then glue it in place

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:41.100
pressing on the rolls at the back and the front and making a progressive slope to it would make the rifle looks better

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:46.040
you can also keep it in place by putting some tape a round it

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:58.380
now lets make the scope starting by taking a sheet of paper and folding it in half then cut it into two pieces

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.260
fold the biggest one in half then take the remaining paper roll and roll the paper at the edge

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.320
fix the roll with tape then take the other piece and repeat the same steps you did for the first one

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:27.480
you can adjust the size of the scope the way you want also you can add more paper rolls if you want to shape it in a good way

00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:33.680
you can also put some tape around to hide the connecting lines between the rolls

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.080
take the  piece of roll that we kept before and glue it up to the middle of the scope

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.740
after that put a strip of paper around the stock and fix it with tape then glue the scope on it

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:56.580
if you feel that the scope is quite shaky fold a small piece of paper and glue it up with the connecting roll

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:04.220
you're able now to rotate the scope either right or left , this way you can prevent any contact might happen with the trigger

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.980
finaly we need to make one last piece of roll and cut it into three pieces

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:16.840
take the smallest one and fold it like this and glue it at the front

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:27.600
take the middle size piece and fold it reversely like this then make an angled cut at the top

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:36.020
after that get a rubber band and put it around it this is gonna be the trigger

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.220
stick the trigger  between the rolls until it gets out from the other side

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:50.600
now take the remaining piece and shape it as a trigger guard then glue it in place

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.320
put a piece of tape infront of the trigger to prevent the it from slipping

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:06.780
then make a side cut to the roll at the front to hang the rubber band on it

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.680
this way whenever you pull the trigger the rubber band will pull it back

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.060
now it's time to make some  shooting

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:18.460
first rotate the scape aside then stretch a rubber band between the front sight and the trigger

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:23.300
once you pull the trigger the rubber band will be released
