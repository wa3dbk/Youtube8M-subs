00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:06.459
On January 18th, 2015, Argentine prosecutor
Alberto Nisman was found dead in his Buenos

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:10.690
Aires apartment the day before he was due
to give testimony about an alleged government

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.850
cover-up of a terrorist attack.

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.630
Reports suggest that Nisman had committed
suicide but investigators are treating his

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.630
death as suspicious.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.360
So if he didn’t kill himself, then who did?

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.510
Alberto was the lead prosecutor on an investigation
into the 1994 bombing of a Jewish community

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.310
center in Buenos Aires, which left 85 people
dead.

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.720
Reports suggest that Nisman believed that
Iran had planned and financed the attack.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.750
And just before his death, he accused Argentinean
President Kirchner and other government aides,

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.050
of sabotaging his investigation.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.040
During the inquiry into the terror attack,
Nisman intercepted phone calls that the Argentine

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.030
government had made to Iran.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.010
It’s reported that Argentinian and Iranian
officials had attempted to make a secret deal

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.629
which would have shielded Iran from any legal
action for the bombing, in exchange for oil.

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.180
Nisman was due to present his accusations
to Congress the day after he died.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.570
A draft for the President’s arrest was also
found in his trash.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.170
Facing accusations that Nisman’s death was
a political cover-up, Kirchner proposed legislation

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:14.030
that would dismantle Argentina’s premier
foreign and national intelligence agency agency,

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.030
the Secretariat Intelligence.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.229
But why would the President want to dismantle
it’s leading intelligence agency?

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.549
Well, Kirchner has suggested that the agency
may be responsible for Nisman’s death, claiming

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.299
that intelligence agents used Nisman for the
investigation to blame her for the terrorist

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.560
cover-up, but then decided to kill him.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.200
Reports suggest that Kirchner is pointing
the blame at a former S.I. agent called Antonio

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.200
Stiusso.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.040
According to experts Stuisso was one of Argentina’s
most powerful spies largely due to his expertise

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.200
with phone tapping.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.549
It’s reported that Stuisso helped Nisman
during his investigation to eavesdrop on secret

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:51.409
conversations between Argentina and Iran.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.490
However, in December 2014, Stiusso was abruptly
discharged from the S.I. after almost four

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.300
decades of service.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:02.080
Despite leaving the S.I., it’s reported
that the two men remained in contact.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.430
The lead investigator into Nisman’s death
has told reporters that phone records indicate

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.849
that Stiusso called Nisman hours before he
died.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:14.159
Nisman’s death remains unexplained but the
formal investigation is just beginning.

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:18.750
And as more information about the government’s
deal with Iran is revealed, experts are concerned

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.510
that Argentina might be on the verge of a
political crisis.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:26.709
Iran’s role in all this might be murky at
this point, but the secretive nation does

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:28.219
play a unique role in the world.
