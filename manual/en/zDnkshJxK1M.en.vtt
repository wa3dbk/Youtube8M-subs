00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.040
just finding out Adrian Peterson
Minnesota Vikings

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.000
football player his 2-year-old son
pronounced dead

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.639
up allegedly at the hands up his babies
mothers

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:14.900
new boyfriend I just got nearly 37 years
old and has a long history

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.330
it looks like up this type of abuse he's
out he was convicted

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.880
love actually pled guilty to a simple
assault concerning

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.640
domestic abuse I involving a juvenile I
think this is just

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.689
awful apparently he was the only person
found along with this kid

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.820
and he call by 11 so he actually called
I 11

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.649
alleging there was a choking incidents
when makes came on site

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.680
they say that they sought trauma to the
head and injuries that were inconsistent

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.059
with accident

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.360
and that is what led to his arrest he
was actually arrested on Thursday

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.920
in court earlier today on seven hundred
fifty thousand dollar bond when they

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:49.910
thought it was just

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.070
and aggravated assault now you know as

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.530
just moments ago on this young
two-year-old boy just passed away

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:59.930
nearly took him off life support those
he was never really apparently that have

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.590
a chance at all so you know now that I'm
a parent

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.680
I i've always been anointed like you
know if you're a parent you would know

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.280
kinda so I hate that right

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.920
but but when your parents something gets
the activated at least it did for me

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.930
you know in your DNA and like so every
kid I want to look out for

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.060
to ten times more than I did even before
before I think Emma I but said no but

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.720
seriously

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.960
and so I here two-year-old beaten into
an inch of his life a minute he lost

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.549
like

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.340
what kind of Munster would do that how

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.400
and then I think you know and I know
where to attach the celebrities nah not

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.619
really our friends but

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.590
you know Adrian Peterson in some ways so
a big probe of and has been a part of

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.689
our lives for many years now right

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:46.100
I don't know me personally but I I feel
horrible

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.210
a two-year-old losing a two-year-old son
a literally can't the

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.930
anything worse I i just i three you know
expected to play on Sunday

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.040
he says he's got a boy yeah he's we went
back he was there

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.100
yesterday and it did this happen in
South Dakota

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.610
he went back to Minneapolis I today
practice today

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.729
so he's gonna play on Sunday he says
that you know for pauses you know way to

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:09.709
cope with things and

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:12.670
yeah he's always done it so I know it's
tough to get there when he was on life

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.510
support I wonder if he'll play now that
the first time that it that way

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.190
I have to tell you guys I'm with you get
100 percent I can't even fathom this

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.800
but as a woman not to be too hard on the
mother here because I can only imagine

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.739
what this process is like for her

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.890
but I do believe when you were single
parent you have a responsibility

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.260
to vet your partner she moved in with
this guy

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.989
case took a two year old son and herself
themselves and

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:39.450
in that though the well-being the
caretaking at this guy who is a

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.330
convicted

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.680
criminal on these types ok charges me
this guy's I just like a drug dealer

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.540
physical assault battery domestic
charges already

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.550
I don't know that that's just published
a question just back

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.459
background on this no was this a a
former girlfriend appears that he had

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.050
the baby with was it a one night stay
and he has known Adrian Peterson yes

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:03.390
the I'm not sure the details of that
relationship Osos

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:06.690
ex-wife this story is really new
obviously given

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.550
what happened here it's hard to figure
out although boo all we do know that

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.920
Adrian Peterson's dad confirm that it
was a computer since Sun

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.860
so you know there's that issue they
weren't living together she was in South

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.310
Dakota and and Peterson obviously
doesn't live there

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:23.230
et cetera so but any way you slice it
it's a son then I

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.370
he went to go to obviously be with him
at the hospital before he passed away in

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.549
the needed pass away

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:33.709
and in look as far as the the mom is
concerned I i hear exactly what you're

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:34.200
saying

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.390
its it we don't on that we don't have
enough information as well

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:40.470
like if he touched the kid before that
I'm

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:45.680
a 128 percent with you you know if he
had many had some criminal background I

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.489
don't know then you know at them

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:50.730
there maybe we're being too harsh by
judge in the mom I don't like to be

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:51.190
harsh

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.670
I mean yeah of course a leg and its you
know it's incredibly raw II

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.890
whatever mistakes worship and service
now well

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.959
at you know and and you know and
whatever when you

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.610
you know people make dumb decisions when
they fall for somebody and you look past

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.420
their faults these were false that the

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.760
obviously should not pass but let's not
lose sight of who committed the crime

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:11.010
there

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.120
apparently give yeah now and and if he's
of course guilty then

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.680
a I think I mean look if a is

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.959
I think it's life sentence right but I
don't think you'll get a life sentence

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.430
a I think that they'll say well he
didn't intend to kill the kid

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.509
a me your former prosecutor Avenue
anything yet %um for tickets or

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:32.610
um I US$10 tentative

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.540
ok to kill the kiddo RJ you went into
the action that's kinda like it some

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.240
you know that's not the way that the
riveting cuz they view it in the actions

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.110
that he intended to to physically

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:45.960
hurt this kid anyway don't have to
intent to murder don't have ten ten

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.500
the consequence so basically your cock
whatever the consequences are they

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.620
follow the action so

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.620
I don't know about life since I think
you might be right but but certainly

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:55.820
something twenty

00:04:55.820 --> 00:05:00.660
20 ish plus years on this here i know i
over-emphasize but I always think if

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:02.530
Stephanie George use in life

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.870
in prison for some 160,000 drugs got
three kids are grown up without her

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:09.949
she is a life sentence if this guy
doesn't get a life sentence you know

00:05:09.949 --> 00:05:13.380
with the Jets yeah I W no need to
compare like that injustice for her

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:16.330
son's exists independent if we do to
anybody else

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:20.880
now I hear you n look of course the jury
has to see

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:24.000
what happened that day and it could have
been that he

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.120
you know it could've been a hundred
different scenario
