00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
In this video you will learn

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
how to make a balloon elephant.

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.500
[balloon deflating]

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.000
You will want your balloon inflated

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.500
with about four fingers width

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.000
left over at the end.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Start twisting your design

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.390
at the nozzle end of the balloon.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.190
Begin with a bubble

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.000
that is approximately

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
one and a half hands width in length.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.030
While holding on to that first bubble

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.000
so it does not untwist,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.700
Make a loop twist to form

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.460
one of the elephants ears.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.970
Taking care to always twist

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:35.270
in the same direction.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.070
Now, make another loop twist

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.070
the same size as the first

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.650
and lock twist the the two loop twists together.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.280
Then make a two finger bubble

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.580
for the neck.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.080
Make a three-finger bubble.

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.870
Twist another three-finger bubble.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.530
Lock twist the two

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.530
three-finger bubbles together

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.520
to form the front legs.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.550
Make a three-finger bubble

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.060
for the torso.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.140
Make another three finger bubble.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.210
Follow this with yet another three finger bubble.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:55.410
Lock twist the second and third

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.040
three-finger bubbles together

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:59.090
to form the back legs.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.300
To make the trunk curve,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.930
simply bend the balloon

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.170
in the direction you wish

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.130
and hold for a few seconds.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:28.800
And that is how to make

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.560
a balloon elephant.
