00:00:00.821 --> 00:00:08.873
Without words, I mount alone the western chamber.

00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:16.359
The moon like a hook,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.614
The wu-tong tree solitary,

00:00:24.082 --> 00:00:31.756
A clear Autumn locked up in the deep courtyard.

00:00:32.088 --> 00:00:39.899
Cut - still unservered; cleaned - still a mess;

00:00:40.136 --> 00:00:47.155
A sorrow of parting,

00:00:47.669 --> 00:01:04.335
And a strange taste lingering in the heart.

00:01:06.855 --> 00:01:10.740
Without words, I mount alone the western chamber.

00:01:11.776 --> 00:01:13.880
The moon like a hook,

00:01:14.954 --> 00:01:16.731
The wu-tong tree solitary,

00:01:17.297 --> 00:01:19.772
A clear Autumn locked up in the deep courtyard.

00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:23.890
Cut - still unservered; cleaned - still a mess;

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:26.090
A sorrow of parting,

00:01:26.748 --> 00:01:30.498
And a strange taste lingering in the heart.

00:01:30.961 --> 00:01:36.670
Cut - still unservered; cleaned - still a mess;

00:01:37.277 --> 00:01:42.986
A sorrow of parting,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:56.373
And a strange taste lingering in the heart.

00:01:56.932 --> 00:02:03.016
Without words, I mount alone the western chamber.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:08.687
The moon like a hook,

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:15.608
The wu-tong tree solitary,

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:22.065
A clear Autumn locked up in the deep courtyard.

00:02:22.395 --> 00:02:29.554
Cut - still unservered; cleaned - still a mess;

00:02:29.879 --> 00:02:35.170
A sorrow of parting,

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:52.063
And a strange taste lingering in the heart.
