00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.166
We want the Color Sensor to find the edge of the line by going from white to black...

00:00:10.166 --> 00:00:19.832
We can do this by stopping one motor, and having the other motor going forwards

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:21.033
 

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:29.466
Start up Lego MindStorms EV3

00:00:29.466 --> 00:00:33.032
Left-click on "File"

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:37.733
Left-click on "New Project"

00:00:37.733 --> 00:00:40.466
Make sure the green rectangle is raised

00:00:40.466 --> 00:00:45.599
Drag the "Move Tank" command up to the Command line

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.966
To make the Robot turn, we will set one of the motor speeds to zero, and...

00:00:50.966 --> 00:00:57.666
and the other motor to our favourite testing speed of fifty percent.

00:00:57.666 --> 00:01:10.166
We do not know how many wheel rotations will be needed for the color sensor to find the edge of the black line, so...

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:19.232
So we will set Rotations to "On"

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:27.666
One motor is stopped, and the other motor stays "On" at fifty percent

00:01:27.666 --> 00:01:31.666
These motor speeds will turn the Robot around...

00:01:31.666 --> 00:01:35.666
But we can not download this to our EV3 to test, because...

00:01:35.666 --> 00:01:39.666
because this command will take only  a tiny fraction of a second to run, and...

00:01:39.666 --> 00:01:43.666
and our Robot will not move!

00:01:43.666 --> 00:01:47.299
We need to put a "Loop" around our motor command.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.800
Make sure the orange rectangle is raised, and...

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.800
and drag a "Loop" to the command line.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:58.800
move our motor commands inside the Loop.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.800
The Loop will cause the EV3 to keep running the motor command continuously

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:13.333
It will keep obeying the motor command until you turn the EV3 off.

00:02:13.333 --> 00:02:19.699
BUT we wanted the motors to stop when black was reached.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.133
How can we do that?

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:34.866
To make the color sensor work, make sure the orange rectangle is raised, and...

00:02:34.866 --> 00:02:43.199
and drag the "Switch" to the command line.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.733
There is not much room, so close the "Document your Work" window.

00:02:49.733 --> 00:03:00.733
Left-click on the "Pan" option and use the "hand" cursor to drag your work into the middle of the screen.

00:03:00.733 --> 00:03:08.066
Then left-click on the "Select" option to get the Arrow cursor back.

00:03:08.066 --> 00:03:16.232
The Switch is set up to use the touch sensor, we do not want to use the touch sensor.

00:03:16.233 --> 00:03:21.199
We want to change the Switch to use the "Color Sensor" option,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.200
the "Compare" option, and...

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:32.266
and the "Reflected Light Intensity" option; left-click.

00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:42.132
The "switch" now does different things if the Color Sensor reading is big (white) or small (black)

00:03:42.133 --> 00:03:54.366
We usually use the &gt; "Greater" or "Greater or Equal to" options

00:03:54.366 --> 00:03:58.366
and we have to work out a Color Sensor value that separates white and black.

00:03:58.366 --> 00:04:02.366
To do this we click twice on the right button to get to "Port View"

00:04:02.366 --> 00:04:07.032
then click on the centre button to get the Sensor Readings view, and...

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:15.233
and click on the right button three times to get to the Color Sensor reflected reading from EV3 sensor port 4.

00:04:15.233 --> 00:04:19.233
To read the black value, put the color sensor over the black line, and...

00:04:19.233 --> 00:04:26.833
and read the reflected light value on the EV3 screen (four percent). Yours will be different.

00:04:26.833 --> 00:04:32.466
To read the white value, put the color sensor over the white background, and...

00:04:32.466 --> 00:04:38.666
and read the color sensor reading of seventy-two percent. Yours will be different.

00:04:38.666 --> 00:04:42.666
To calculate the light value to put in the switch...

00:04:42.666 --> 00:04:46.666
calculate the average of the black and white color sensor readings, that is...

00:04:46.666 --> 00:05:04.432
(4+72)/2 = 38; type 38 instead of the default 50 (Your readings will be different.)

00:05:04.433 --> 00:05:14.899
Your values will be different, because the light in every room is different - you will need to calculate this value each robot session.

00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:18.933
In my room, if the color sensor reading is greater than 38, the color sensor is over the white part of the arena. so...

00:05:18.933 --> 00:05:22.933
So, when it is on the white, we want the Robot to turn around. So...

00:05:22.933 --> 00:05:30.066
So we can drag the motor commands we already have, up into the "white" (greater than 38) portion of the Switch.

00:05:30.066 --> 00:05:49.299
So when the robot is over white, the EV3 keeps going around the motor command loop, as long as the color sensor reading is greater than 38.

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:55.700
Eventually the black will be reached, and the EV3 will go to the lower Switch command line - which is empty.

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:07.600
Let us download this to our Robot EV3 to test our commands.

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:16.500
What we want to happen is that our Robot will swing around towards the black line, like this...

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:20.500
What actually happens is that our Robot turns in the opposite direction!

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:24.500
Because this video is getting long, we will show you how to fix this in our next video tutorial...
