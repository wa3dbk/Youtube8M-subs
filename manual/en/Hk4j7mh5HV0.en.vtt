00:00:08.479 --> 00:00:12.499
If you've purchased a quality BLANCO
stainless steel sink, you've made a smart

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:14.319
investment in your home.

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:19.460
Stainless steel is virtually carefree, but it can be harmed by using the wrong

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.100
products to clean it.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.539
In this video we'll give you tips and tricks
on how to clean and maintain your

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.640
stainless steel sink to keep it looking
great.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.620
We recommend that you clean your sink
after every use with a dry, clean cloth.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.050
This will inhibit water spotting.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.420
To protect your sink, avoid abrasive
cleaners like bleach, scrub pads, and

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.640
steal wool which can dull or scratch the
surface.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.370
You can use mild non-abrasive cleaning
agents like Bar Keepers Friend,

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.760
Bon Ami,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.370
Gordon's miracle shine,

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.580
Zud, or soft scrub,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.080
which can all be found in any hardware
or grocery store.

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.370
BLANCO also sells BLANCO Clean,

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:08.080
a mild and effective stainless steel
polish.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.110
Using grids that are made especially for
your sink can also help to protect the

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.300
finish.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.420
Stainless steel is a material that does
scratch overtime with use; that's just

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.960
part of its nature.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:25.600
The scratches become part of the patina of the sink.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.020
To minimize the appearance of scratches,

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.240
take the soft side of a scotch brite pad or sponge

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.659
Wet it thoroughly, then apply a mild
cleanser like Bar Keepers Friend to the

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:38.580
sponge to make a wet paste.

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.770
Be sure to rub with the grain of the sink and be sure to cover the entire service of the sink.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.720
Going against the grain could ruin the
finish of your sink.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.399
Be sure to rinse thoroughly after cleaning.

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:57.390
After you've done this, this will blend
the scratch into the patina.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.940
Multicolored stains or residue on the
bottom of the sink

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.790
are most commonly traced to minerals
contained in your water

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.469
or by salts from water softeners.

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.149
These stains can be removed

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.180
by using a cleanser like Bar Keepers
Friend, in most cases.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.239
Rinse well and then dry to sink to see
what happens.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:23.359
Stainless steel sinks don't rust but
may appear to.

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:28.239
Traditional orange or red rust marks in
high quality stainless steel sinks can

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:34.849
almost always be traced to one of three
sources: steel wool pads used for cleaning,

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.559
tin steel cans or cast iron pots,

00:02:39.559 --> 00:02:44.409
or iron deposits that actually are found within the water.

00:02:44.409 --> 00:02:49.509
The rust stains are not part of the stainless steel. They are simple deposits on the

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:51.629
surface of the sink.

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:55.949
Scrubbing these stains with a cleanser
along the grain lines of the finish, will

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:59.719
almost always immediately solve the
problem.

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:03.229
Thank you for taking the time to learn how to care for your sink.
