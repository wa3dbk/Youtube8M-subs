Hi! I am Melanie McLeroy with Taurus Training
for Expert Village and today we are going

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:10.950
to talk about training dogs. So let us talk
about rewards. Many people wonder why they

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.180
have to reward their dog; they feel their
dog should obey them because they said so.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.760
Well sure, you have to obey your boss because
he said so, but is not nice to get your paycheck

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.650
every couple of weeks. So if you reward your
dog during the training process, then those

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.510
behaviors are really going to stick and it
will teach your dog that you are in control

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:41.699
of resources and it will give them a job to
do that is worth doing. So an important thing

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:54.640
to remember when you are rewarding your dog
is to be very, very quick, to mark the behavior

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:06.720
and then reward intermittently. It is not
a good idea to reward constantly. You do not

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.690
want to give your dog a reward every time
they do something right and also be careful

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.690
not to reward your dog unless they have done
an appropriate behavior that is a mistake

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:34.780
a lot of us make. Keep your rewards intermittent
and keep in mind in a couple of years when

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:47.049
your dog is not behaving quite as well, pull
the treats out, it will really help. Now the

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:52.110
type of rewards you give your dog could be
anything, from a piece of dog food, to a piece

00:01:52.110 --> 00:02:02.530
of cheese, to a carrot, just something else
that motivates your dog. Some dogs are motivated

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.719
by praise and petting but for the most part,
they prefer something a little more dog like.

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:14.930
Labradors are walking stomachs and they love
chasing balls. Certain terriers love squeaky

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:24.230
toys, so figure out what your dog really likes
and allocate those resources when they are

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.230
behaving themselves.
