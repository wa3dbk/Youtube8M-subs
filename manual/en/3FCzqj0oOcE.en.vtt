00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:14.740
Welcome to this shocking Hero overview of
Cygnus, Master of the Order.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.570
Cygnus does high single-target damage and
relies on his Lightning damage to deal area

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:25.320
of effect damage to clear minion waves. Cygnus
plays very differently from other Heroes and

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.970
players must always keep an eye on his mana
bar. Now, let’s check out his skills.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.350
“Rift Lord” is Cygnus’ passive and gives
him incredible bonuses to his damage dealt

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.550
and damage resistance. Cygnus will always
have a protective shield of mana surrounding

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.550
him to reduce the incoming damage he takes,
thanks to “Rift Lord”. As you cast spells

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:52.470
and your mana bar depletes, Cygnus will begin
to take more damage per hit. This is why keeping

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.329
an eye on your mana bar at all times is important.
“Rift Lord” also increases Cygnus’ damage

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:02.530
dealt and his health and mana regeneration
near friendly Rifts and “Rift Shards”.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.369
When you see Cygnus glowing blue, he means
business!

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.030
Cygnus’ primary attack, “Voltaic Charge”,
is a projectile that deals single-target Lightning

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.100
damage to enemies hit. When enemies are killed
by Lightning damage in Orcs Must Die! Unchained,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.729
they explode, dealing additional Lightning
damage to nearby enemies. “Voltaic Charge”

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.700
costs Cygnus a small amount of mana to use,
but typically should not be fired rapidly.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.539
Cygnus’ secondary attack is called “Chain
Lightning”. “Chain Lightning” hits the

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:37.319
initial target instantly for high Lightning
damage and then will bounce to up to three

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:43.459
nearby enemies.
“Chain Lightning” is also affected by

00:01:43.459 --> 00:01:49.049
two of Cygnus’ weaver upgrades. At Tier
I Conductive Materials allows Cygnus to cast

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.109
“Chain Lightning” on his Buff Pylon to
increase the bonus damage to traps by an additional

00:01:54.109 --> 00:02:00.350
20%. At Tier IV, Get Off the Lawn allows “Chain
Lightning” to bounce an additional 2 times

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.880
(for a total of 5) when Cygnus’ “Rift
Lord” passive is active.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.660
Cygnus’ near-death experience after slipping
in some Kobold blood a while back hasn’t

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:13.970
deterred him from fighting to keep the Rifts
safe, but it did give him another tool to

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.580
use when he’s in a pinch. “Feign Death”
is Cygnus’ first ability and makes him invulnerable

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.360
to damage and control effects as he flops
to the ground. Cygnus will stand up on his

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.020
own after a short time or when manually moved
by the player.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.280
“Feign Death” is also affected by one
of Cygnus’ weavers at Tier III. Dead Useful

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.450
allows Cygnus’ allies to teleport to him
from the team’s Rift while Cygnus is feigned

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.470
on the ground.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.190
For his second ability, “Rift Shard”,
Cygnus tears open a hole in the Rift web,

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.110
creating a miniature, yet unstable Rift at
his location. Allies gain health and mana

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.190
regeneration when close to the “Rift Shard”,
which accelerates when not taking damage.

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:59.080
Cygnus also gains his “Rift Lord” passive
ability when near these shards. When an enemy

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.260
minion touches the “Rift Shard” they take
massive damage and destroy the shard.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.440
All of Cygnus’ Tier II weaver upgrades affect
“Rift Shard”, starting with Paternal Instinct

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:17.500
which keeps his “Rift Shard” active for
20% longer. Also at Tier II is Elderly Urging

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.370
which reduces the cast time for “Rift Shard”
by 20%. Riftway is the final Tier II weaver

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.660
upgrade and allows your teammates to teleport
to the main Rift when using a “Rift Shard”.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:34.850
Finally, Cygnus’ unique trap is his Buff
Pylon. Placing the Buff Pylon near friendly

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.250
traps will increase the damage they do by
twenty-five percent. Enemy players may disable

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.980
the Buff Pylon by attacking it, but it will
reset and continue to boost friendly traps

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:50.890
again after a short time. Another thing to
note is the Buff Pylon only takes up 1/4th

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.370
of a single trap square, allowing its placement
in tight spots.
