00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:10.139
Out of all the different non-verbal behaviors,
I think that spotting attraction is without

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:11.200
a doubt the easiest.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:16.020
We are very emotional creatures and when we're
attracted to somebody, it's very, very difficult

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.020
to hide.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.079
People think they're hiding it, but things
always slip.

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:21.800
One of the ways they slip are essentially
the eyes.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.480
There are a lot of different ways you can
use the eyes to determine whether or not someone's

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.560
attracted to you.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.830
The first thing is essentially eye contact.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.739
For the most part, usually we make eye contact
with people that we're interested in or people

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.450
that we're attracted to.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.450
Right?

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.600
But this is not entirely true.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.710
Some people are shy or anxious and they're
not going to make eye contact.

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.789
So what you're looking for essentially is
a deviation in eye contact.

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.449
So one of the ways you can use eye contact
and there's a little trick that's very, very

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:52.449
reliable.

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:56.859
So what you're going to do is if you look
at somebody in a bar or restaurant or on the

00:00:56.859 --> 00:01:00.620
street and they break eye contact vertically,
so they look down.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.519
So you make eye contact with them and they
break eye contact vertically and then within

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.770
20-30 seconds they reestablish eye contact,
approach them.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:11.770
They like you.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:13.530
It's a very, very reliable thing.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.530
Essentially what they're doing.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.530
You stare at them.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.979
They're submitting to you and then they take
a little second glance to see who you are.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.090
It's very, very, very reliable.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.851
The opposite of that would be if you look
at somebody and they look at you and they

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:28.119
immediately go and break eye contact.

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.880
Nope, not interested.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.590
But what is reliable is they break eye contact
and they come back.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:34.030
Break eye contact and then come back.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.770
Break eye contact and then come back.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.770
It's very interesting.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:37.770
And don't let it wait.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.090
If you see that, go right away because the
more and more you wait.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:42.040
The more and more eye contact becomes very,
very awkward.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.280
One of the things that I do in one of my classes
is I have people stare each other in the eyes

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.960
for three minutes without saying anything.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.240
They just stare each other in the eyes like
this.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:51.240
Try that.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.670
Go out and try to stare somebody in the eyes
for even 90 seconds.

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:56.450
I guarantee you can't do it.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.450
It's awkward.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.729
It's so awkward because humans are not really
at a level intimacy.

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.560
When you stare somebody in the eyes is so
awkward when you're doing it with a stranger.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.500
Studies will show that if you stare somebody
in the eyes for 90 seconds to three minutes,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.030
all of a sudden you're going to like that
person a lot better than everybody else in

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.800
the room because you kind of shared this emotional
connection.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.640
So eye contact is important in that respect.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.790
The second thing you can look for essentially
is blink rate.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.790
Now, this is really cool.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.669
So blink rate correlate with emotional excitement.

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:30.120
When we are emotionally excited, our blink
rates tend to increase.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.120
Right?

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.470
Average blink rates tend to be below 20 blinks
per minute.

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.250
For most people it really depends on where
you are, but it's really hard to nail down

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.019
what the average blink rate is.

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.880
But in my experience, it seems to be around
10 blinks per minute.

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.880
Right?

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.829
So you see, whenever you see a sudden spike
or a bunch of sudden spikes in somebody's

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:50.530
blink rate in can be an indication of attraction.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.520
In my dating studies you see blink rates through
the roof because the person across the table

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.050
from you has an emotional response.

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.700
You're attracted to them.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.400
The third way of kind of using the eyes to
determine attraction is dilation.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.240
It's very interesting.

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:06.790
Our eyes dilate when we're attracted to something.

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:07.790
Right?

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.970
Go out and find a Maxim magazine or a Playboy
magazine or any cover that's predominately

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.070
men focusing.

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:18.019
Every single woman will have her eyes dilated.

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.070
You never, ever see them constricted.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.550
The reason why is because men perceive women
with dilated eyes more attractive than women

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.780
with more constricted eyes.

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:30.440
To the point of back in the day prostitutes
used to put a specific toxin in their eyes

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.349
to make them dilate.
