(energetic music)

00:00:06.197 --> 00:00:09.234
- I'm Doctor Ryan DeBell
from The Movement Fix.

00:00:09.234 --> 00:00:10.837
This is Movement Fix Monday.

00:00:10.837 --> 00:00:12.675
What I want to show you guys today

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:15.525
is two common deadlifting errors,

00:00:15.525 --> 00:00:17.044
especially in someone
learning the deadlift

00:00:17.044 --> 00:00:18.310
for the first time.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:21.189
And two exercises or drills that we can do

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:22.696
to fix these errors.

00:00:22.696 --> 00:00:24.907
So the first error that we see typically

00:00:24.907 --> 00:00:26.530
with people when they're
learning how to deadlift

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:29.477
is that the bar comes off of their body

00:00:29.477 --> 00:00:31.088
during the descent and ascent.

00:00:31.088 --> 00:00:33.830
So instead of keeping it
nice and close to their body,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.508
what they'll do is that they'll
just let it come out here

00:00:35.508 --> 00:00:36.341
like this.

00:00:36.341 --> 00:00:38.992
And so we need a way to drill that,

00:00:38.992 --> 00:00:41.222
not using words but using other cues,

00:00:41.222 --> 00:00:43.292
so they can learn what
it feels like to do that.

00:00:43.292 --> 00:00:44.392
So that's number one.

00:00:44.392 --> 00:00:46.512
And the other common mistake that we see

00:00:46.512 --> 00:00:48.906
is that people will do
they'll come down like this

00:00:48.906 --> 00:00:52.484
and their knees will bend
too early in the deadlift

00:00:52.484 --> 00:00:54.061
and they'll have to go around the knees

00:00:54.061 --> 00:00:56.249
rather than keeping the knees kind of back

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:57.733
until we transition past the knees.

00:00:57.733 --> 00:01:00.143
So what I'm gonna do for this first drill,

00:01:00.143 --> 00:01:02.098
and this is really
specifically going to help

00:01:02.098 --> 00:01:04.693
with keeping the bar close to the body,

00:01:04.693 --> 00:01:06.829
and how to engage the shoulder

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:08.953
while you're descending and ascending.

00:01:08.953 --> 00:01:10.170
So I'm gonna take this band,

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.315
I'm gonna put my dowel or my
broomstick through the band,

00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:16.125
and then what this does is it

00:01:16.125 --> 00:01:19.617
because the tension of
the band pulls the dowel

00:01:19.617 --> 00:01:22.334
away from me, it cues me to pull it in,

00:01:22.334 --> 00:01:24.038
which can be a better way for someone

00:01:24.038 --> 00:01:27.202
to learn how to do this versus
using words to cue them.

00:01:27.202 --> 00:01:29.101
So feeling something is much more powerful

00:01:29.101 --> 00:01:30.923
than hearing words.

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:32.249
So I'm gonna pull this in here

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:35.289
and then I'm just going to
descend down into the bottom

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:37.925
of the deadlift and then
I'm going to come back up.

00:01:37.925 --> 00:01:40.110
So I would have the person
drill that a few times

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.578
just until they get the feel of it,

00:01:41.578 --> 00:01:44.036
so that way they can learn
how to correct that error

00:01:44.036 --> 00:01:44.869
in the deadlift.

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:47.819
So that's drill number one
which we're using to help cue

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:49.542
not being away from the body.

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:51.009
For the second problem
that I talked about,

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:53.090
which was going around the knees,

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.680
kinda premature knee bending.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.132
What we can do is a drill
where we use the dowel

00:01:59.132 --> 00:02:03.066
and instead of holding
the dowel with the hands,

00:02:03.066 --> 00:02:05.980
I kind of pin the dowel against the body

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.141
with an open hand.

00:02:07.141 --> 00:02:09.623
And what that does is it makes it so that

00:02:09.623 --> 00:02:12.819
if you get down to here,
and your knees go forward,

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:14.905
you literally cannot go around your knees.

00:02:14.905 --> 00:02:18.690
And so, I will have this
person just have an open hand,

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:22.467
they'll slide down and then
once they get past the knees

00:02:22.467 --> 00:02:25.463
then the knees can bend
and then on the way up

00:02:25.463 --> 00:02:27.119
they can kind of grab
on with their fingers.

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:29.492
So the second drill
there, the open palm one,

00:02:29.492 --> 00:02:31.157
actually will do both things.

00:02:31.157 --> 00:02:35.058
Both pulling in as well as
cueing the knee position

00:02:35.058 --> 00:02:35.961
because guess what?

00:02:35.961 --> 00:02:38.778
If your arms come off your
body, the dowel is gonna fall

00:02:38.778 --> 00:02:41.269
so it's an automatic self-correcting drill

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:44.885
to teach someone how to keep
the bar close to the body

00:02:44.885 --> 00:02:45.786
during the deadlift.

00:02:45.786 --> 00:02:48.040
So that's what I got for
you guys for this week

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.298
on Movement Fix Monday.
