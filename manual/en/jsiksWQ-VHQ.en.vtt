00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:13.879
A wetland is an area where water sits for
all or part of the year.

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:19.450
This time of year we'll see water in puddles
in many places, in fields and permanent wetlands

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:20.930
like this.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.970
So they range quite a bit in how permanent
they are but anywhere that holds water and

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.000
it tends to be defined by the presence of
water, vegetation and soil.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.320
During the winter months, they're pretty quiet.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.629
It's mostly bacterial activity and many of
the small aquatic invertebrates are dormant

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:47.760
in the mud, but with that water and heat come
life.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.319
Spring is an important time for wetlands because
they're kicking into their lifecycle again

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:59.640
of very productive systems and as the snow
melts and they fill with water, all the biological

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.730
life comes active again and the cycle begins.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:11.000
At this time of year as the wetlands are thawing,
it's exactly the time the birds have arrives

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.860
and they are making full advantage of the
life cycle that's kicked into high gear with

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.990
the availability of food and water and they're
ready to set up a home.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.580
This particular wetland, well there's a couple
of geese that flew off of it when we arrived,

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.990
they'll breed here, and a variety of waterfowl
will breed here, ducks of different kids like

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.380
mallards and blue teal, and many other marsh
birds too.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.500
Through my long career with Ducks Unlimited
I've noticed that there's a real change in

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.320
perception about wetlands.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.780
They used to be places that weren't valued
but now we've come to see that they provide

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.750
many values and society does care about wetlands
and we've seen action by the government to

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.810
be proactive and protect them.
