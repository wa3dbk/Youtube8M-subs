00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.440
Today, we're reviewing the new Xbox One Wireless
Controller with those sought after feature

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.530
upgrades such as the 3.5mm audio port, improved
bumpers, and over the air updates.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.420
Let's take a closer look at the new features
in this hardware review.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.870
Most people know about Xbox one controllers
by now so we're talking exclusively about

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.320
the new features.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.470
First off it has wireless over the air updates
which is an improvement over the last controller

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.000
which required a micro usb connection for
updates.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.260
It's a good feature, but that's more of a
technical fix.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.960
Comparing the two controllers, they look identical
with the exception of the new port.

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.600
The most obvious advancement is the addition
of the 3.5mm audio port which will let you

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.810
connect any standard headphones no matter
how crazy they look.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.979
And there's menu settings for adjusting the
sound and chat volume from the controller.

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:00.900
So if your headphones don't have a built in
volume adjustment, you still have control.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.620
The other feature is improved bumpers.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.270
Many gamers complained that the Xbox One bumpers
felt good for clicking, but actually holding

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:11.370
them down felt difficult due to the pushback.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.200
Although they look identical, the pushback
has been reduced on these new controllers

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:27.570
and you can definitely hear an audible difference.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.420
Testing it out with Sunset Overdrive, it's
a great option to be able to have headphones

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.369
plugged in to my control and it sounds fine.

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.380
You'll most likely get the best audio over
HDMI or optical, but that's not an option

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.880
for everyone.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.229
The bumpers feel better, but it's not exactly
game changing.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:48.490
The players who would notice it the most are
the ones who probably play shooters competitively,

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:52.750
and those players are much more likely to
use an Xbox Elite Controller.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.870
The controller is still great so it gets a
good rating from me, but as an upgrade for

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:01.000
those already own the older model there's
really not much of a difference.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.310
The bumpers are better, but not paying $60
for an upgrade better.

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.810
The 3.5mm audio port is handy, but at $60
you could probably just buy a dedicated Xbox

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:12.530
USB headset.

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.230
If you are in the market for a new controller,
then definitely pick this one up over the

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.459
old model.

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:20.860
But don't toss out your old controller for
this revision.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.750
It's also included in newer bundles of the
Xbox One, so if you don't even own a console

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.760
yet you'll most likely get this new controller.
