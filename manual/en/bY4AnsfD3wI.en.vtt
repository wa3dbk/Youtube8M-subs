00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.402
-Boom shakalaka! We've got breaking news!

00:00:03.402 --> 00:00:04.488
-That's right, Orange.

00:00:04.488 --> 00:00:06.173
Law enforcement officials have confirmed that

00:00:06.173 --> 00:00:08.869
there is a cereal killer on the loose.

00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:13.172
Lonny the Lion, Commander Cookie, and Oaty the Oaty-Oat

00:00:13.172 --> 00:00:14.439
have all been murdered.

00:00:14.439 --> 00:00:16.405
-Cereal killer, huh?

00:00:16.405 --> 00:00:18.606
Get me... the Buddy Cops.

00:00:18.606 --> 00:00:21.405
-Can't do it, Chief. We're in the middle of a stickup.

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:23.653
-Hey, that's push-up. [gunfire]

00:00:23.653 --> 00:00:25.039
-Backup?

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:28.155
What kind of backup do you need, Detective Midget?

00:00:28.155 --> 00:00:29.605
-[groans] I told you.

00:00:29.605 --> 00:00:31.606
It's not Detective Midget. It's...

00:00:33.713 --> 00:00:35.590
...and I've got all the backup I need.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:36.740
Isn't that right, buddy?

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.476
[gunfire]

00:00:38.476 --> 00:00:41.055
-Bullets taste like candy! Hehehehehe!

00:00:43.317 --> 00:00:44.842
[explosion]

00:00:45.827 --> 00:00:47.289
-(Chief Lemon) About time the Bosom Buddies

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.256
made it back from the ice cream social.

00:00:49.256 --> 00:00:51.890
-Come on, Chief. It's not like we were lollygagging.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:54.428
-Yeah! It was more like a lollipop! [giggles]

00:00:54.428 --> 00:00:55.439
-[groans deeply]

00:00:55.439 --> 00:00:57.473
-Fun time's over, Pufnstuf,

00:00:57.473 --> 00:01:01.255
'cause behind that sheet of glass, it's our prime suspect.

00:01:01.255 --> 00:01:03.256
Now, I want you two to get in there

00:01:03.256 --> 00:01:05.141
and make this scumbag sing.

00:01:05.141 --> 00:01:07.206
-Yay! I love singing! First verse:

00:01:07.206 --> 00:01:09.156
The kitten says meow, the puppy says woof

00:01:09.156 --> 00:01:11.269
The cow says moo, the pig says oink

00:01:11.269 --> 00:01:12.747
-[groans deeply]

00:01:12.747 --> 00:01:15.808
-What you talkin' about? I didn't kill nobody.

00:01:15.808 --> 00:01:18.007
-We're not buying it, Bran Ram,

00:01:18.007 --> 00:01:19.506
if that is your real name.

00:01:19.506 --> 00:01:20.906
Where were you Wednesday

00:01:20.906 --> 00:01:23.120
between the hours of 7 and 9 PM?

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.992
-I was in my cupboard like always.

00:01:24.992 --> 00:01:27.790
-I think he's lying. What do you think, Marshmallow?

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.072
-I think cereal is great!

00:01:29.072 --> 00:01:30.674
Hey, do you have a prize inside of you?

00:01:30.674 --> 00:01:32.274
-What? -Is it a toy bunny?

00:01:32.274 --> 00:01:33.623
-No. -A rainbow?

00:01:33.623 --> 00:01:35.206
-No. -A toy bunny rainbow?

00:01:35.206 --> 00:01:37.891
-I don't have anything inside of me. Just cereal.

00:01:37.891 --> 00:01:39.658
-Ooh! Is there marshmallows inside of your cereal?

00:01:39.658 --> 00:01:40.808
I love marshmallows!

00:01:40.808 --> 00:01:43.707
-No, I don't have marshmallows inside of me.

00:01:43.707 --> 00:01:46.721
No toys, no rainbows, and no marshmallows.

00:01:46.721 --> 00:01:48.602
Are you two cream puffs for real?

00:01:48.602 --> 00:01:51.509
-Hey, watch it, bub. Just tell us what we want to know.

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:53.125
-I ain't talkin', pig.

00:01:53.125 --> 00:01:54.759
-Oh, piggy! Second verse:

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:56.707
The piggy says oink, the cow says moo

00:01:56.707 --> 00:01:58.370
The giraffe says mraaahhh

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:59.992
-Marshmallow, this is serious.

00:01:59.992 --> 00:02:03.275
-Really? 'Cause I thought this was "serial." [laughs]

00:02:03.275 --> 00:02:05.162
-Orange, what are you doing in here?

00:02:05.162 --> 00:02:07.745
-Duh. I'm a reporter. I'm here to get a scoop.

00:02:07.745 --> 00:02:10.312
Maybe even two scoops. [laughs]

00:02:10.312 --> 00:02:12.290
-Dude, that's the one with the raisins.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.979
-[gasps] You've got raisins inside of you?

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:15.877
I love raisins! Two scoops!

00:02:15.877 --> 00:02:18.163
-(Orange &amp; Marshmallow) Two scoops! Two scoops! Two scoops!

00:02:18.163 --> 00:02:20.295
-Agh, shut up, shut up, shut up!

00:02:20.295 --> 00:02:21.694
-[growls] That's it!

00:02:21.694 --> 00:02:23.695
Officer Grapefruit, get him out of here!

00:02:23.695 --> 00:02:25.112
-Move it, hippie.

00:02:25.112 --> 00:02:26.407
-Oh, come on, officer.

00:02:26.407 --> 00:02:28.856
Can't you give it "a-rest"? [laughs]

00:02:28.856 --> 00:02:31.527
-Oh, my God. You guys are all insane!

00:02:31.527 --> 00:02:33.979
What kind of operation are you running here, anyways?

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:36.646
-One where I ask the questions, thank you very much.

00:02:36.646 --> 00:02:38.328
-Hey, ask him if he likes rainbows.

00:02:38.328 --> 00:02:40.579
-No, that's a stupid idea--

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.465
Wait a second. Bran, are you the cereal killer?

00:02:44.465 --> 00:02:47.325
-[nervously]: No! I didn't kill nobody!

00:02:47.325 --> 00:02:49.377
-Is that all you've got to say for yourself?

00:02:49.377 --> 00:02:51.211
-[chuckles] -'Cause I thought you were gonna tell us

00:02:51.211 --> 00:02:53.112
how much you hate rainbows.

00:02:53.112 --> 00:02:55.294
-What? -Or maybe you want to tell us

00:02:55.294 --> 00:02:57.229
how cloud-gazing is for losers.

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:59.264
-Well, that's true, I guess.

00:02:59.264 --> 00:03:01.360
-[grumbles] -Or maybe you want to tell us

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.328
there's nothing more stupid, more lame, more useless than...

00:03:04.328 --> 00:03:05.662
a unicorn.

00:03:05.662 --> 00:03:07.812
-Aw, come on. Those aren't even real.

00:03:07.812 --> 00:03:08.979
-[grumbles loudly]

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:10.461
-Wuh-oh. Time for my coffee break.

00:03:10.461 --> 00:03:11.877
Hey, why don't you take over, buddy?

00:03:11.877 --> 00:03:13.612
[giggles] Yoinks!

00:03:13.612 --> 00:03:15.149
-Hey, don't leave me here!

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:19.361
-YOU MAKE MARSHMALLOW ANGRY!

00:03:19.361 --> 00:03:20.781
[Bran Ram shrieking, electricity sparking]

00:03:20.781 --> 00:03:22.912
-Well Chief, looks like another case closed.

00:03:22.912 --> 00:03:24.896
-Not so fast, detective.

00:03:24.896 --> 00:03:28.294
According to this, the cause of death was...

00:03:28.294 --> 00:03:29.996
the Soggies.

00:03:29.996 --> 00:03:32.111
-(Marshmallow) I love unicorns!!

00:03:32.111 --> 00:03:35.195
-Drowning? Then this wasn't a case of sour grapes.

00:03:35.195 --> 00:03:36.343
It was a case of...

00:03:36.343 --> 00:03:37.794
-Sour milk.

00:03:37.794 --> 00:03:41.031
-[hard rock shriek]

00:03:41.031 --> 00:03:44.412
-Hey, guys. Wazzup?! Dane here.

00:03:44.412 --> 00:03:46.012
Thanks for watching the brand-new video.

00:03:46.012 --> 00:03:47.211
Hey, that "like" button--

00:03:47.211 --> 00:03:49.158
it's been saying some really nasty things about your mom,

00:03:49.158 --> 00:03:50.479
so you better smash it in the face!

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:52.263
Punch it good, 'cause it deserves it.

00:03:52.263 --> 00:03:54.959
Make sure to follow Annoying Orange and me, as well,

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.318
