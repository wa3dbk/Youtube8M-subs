00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.960
In the UK, we buy more Audi TT's than any
other country in the world. So, can this all-new

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.690
third-generation T continue our love affair
with this stylish coupe? Well, let's find

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:19.710
out. OK, so the new Audi TT. I's ready to
be ordered in your dealership now, so let's

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.460
run through the range to start with. There
are currently three models you can choose

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.159
from. There's this car, the 2.0-litre TFSI
petrol turbo, now you can choose that with

00:00:28.159 --> 00:00:33.330
quattro and the S tronic dual-clutch gearbox,
or, as is the case with this car, front wheel

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:39.020
drive and a six speed manual gearbox. The
2.0-litre TDI Ultra diesel only comes with

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:44.790
the front wheel drive and the manual gearbox,
and that only emits 110g/km. And then there's

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.860
the TTS, the top of the range, more powerful
version of the 2.0-litre petrol engine. That

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.990
won;t come to the UK until next year and I
think the order book opens in November. OK,

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:58.380
so that's the range covered, so what's our
first impression? Well, this is an S-Line

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.460
model, so the exterior styling is a little
bit more racy, and when it comes to the styling

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.789
this is unquestionably and obviously this
car is a TT, so it's very much an evolutionary

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:13.100
step in terms of the exterior styling. Much
like the MINI or the Porsche 911, the TT now

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.100
seems to be car that just gently evolves leaving
that familiar TT look. But if you were slightly

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.579
disappointed that the exterior isn't more
different, then you will be blown away by

00:01:22.579 --> 00:01:27.200
the interior because the cabin in this car
is simply sensational. It's got a lovely,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.969
very slender beautiful dash design, and the
reason that Audi have been able to do that

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:36.319
is that all of the controls, there's no separate
sat nav screen, no separate touchscreen, everything

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:43.759
is in this new Audi Virtual Cockpit system
here, and that is crystal clear. You can change

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.930
the type of view you have, you can have the
speedo and the rev counter quite big with

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.520
the sat nav or the trip information in the
middle quite small. Or, you can go and have

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.729
a much much bigger mapping, ad if you switch
to the audi or the telephone or any of those

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:59.219
functions, they appear in that screen. There
are no other screens around the car. And what's

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.320
really clever is you can control it by the
latest MMI controller down here, but everything

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.240
can also be controlled by this fantastic multi-function
steering wheel. So the cockpit is really,

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.080
really spectacular as you'd expect all the
materials are fantastic and there's lots of

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.150
really nice touches like the air vents have
got like a jet engine turbine effect in the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.900
vents, and the actual controller for the temperature
and the vents, the little digital display

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.050
is in the middle of the vent, so it's really
nice. Everything you touch is top quality,

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.640
there's lots of nice inlays, a really nice
feel to all the switchgear and the steering

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.760
wheel and the gearlever are really really
nice. So what's it like to drive? That's the

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.980
first question. Well, if we start from the
ground up, the new TT is based on the VW Group's

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.730
MQB platform, so that's the platform used
by cars like the Audi A3 and VW Golf so it's

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.840
obviously a pretty good starting point. This
still retains that unique TT Audi space frame

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.460
technology so you've got steel used low down
in the car, but higher up in the car most

00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:00.540
of the material is aluminium, so the car's
quite light - it's 50kg lighter than the outgoing

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.770
car, 25% stiffer torsional rigidity and the
centre of gravity is a centimetre lower. That

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:11.820
means the car is quite impressive when you
get into a corner. Obviously this is a front

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:17.600
wheel drive version so it does feel very much
like a hot hatch, and not in a bad way, it

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.370
has that sharp, pointy sort of engaging nature
that you'd find in a good hot hatch like the

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.800
Golf GTI for instance. Audi have got progressive
steering system on the TT which means the

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.990
ratio changes as you apply more or less lock.
It does give the car very very sharp, very

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.400
pointy, quite accurate steering. It's quite
light but it's nicely weighted and really

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.650
does give you plenty of feel. In terms of
traction, these Spanish roads in this temperature

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.900
are quite low grip, so with the front wheel
drive you've got real emphasis on traction

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.460
and actually it's not that bad, given how
low grip these surfaces are. So, the traction

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.010
control works very very smoothly, there is
an electronic differential as well, so the

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:04.970
car, overall, is really nice to drive. It's
a pretty big step forward from the old car.

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.340
It feels more agile, lighter and the rear
end feels livelier as well, just feels a bit

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:14.070
more alive than the old car, which is a good
thing. The six-speed manual gearbox is really

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.299
nice, the exhaust note as I said is good and
the engine delivers really good, punchy performance

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.220
same as it does in the other places that it's
used like in the golf GTI. So all in all,

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.450
it's a really enjoyable experience but like
the TT has always been, it's very good at

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.760
just being a very useable, easy car to live
with day to day. The ride is much better in

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.320
this car than the outgoing car. You can order
magnetic ride as an option on this model.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.500
This car we're driving today doesn't have
it, but I have to say although it's hard to

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.950
judge on sort of smoother Spanish roads, it
doesn't ride that badly, even without the

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:55.420
magnetic ride. It certainly rides better than
the outgoing car. So what's out first impression

00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.450
of the new TT? Well, I've only driven it briefly
but I'm itching to drive it some more and

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.460
that's certainly a good sign. This car does
everything the old car did, just that little

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.980
bit better. The boot's a fraction bigger,
and it handles sharper, it's got more performance,

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:13.169
it's cleaner than ever before and it rides
better than the old car. And thanks to that

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:17.310
stunning cabin, it feels special every time
you get behind the wheel. If you want to see
