00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:02.529
Today we are working on a 2008 Ford F-350.

00:00:02.529 --> 00:00:08.450
We will be installing a front mount hitch
by Draw-Tite part number 65049.

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.710
Here are a couple of measurements that will
assist you with ing accessories for your new

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.880
hitch such as a snow plow, a draw bar or a
winch mount.

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.210
From the center of the hitch pin hole to the
outer-most point of the front bumper is 4-1/4

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.529
inches and from the top of the receiver tube
to the ground is going to be 14-1/4 inches.

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:29.529
Now let us go ahead with the installation.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.449
0:28
Now is a good time to get an extra set of

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:35.610
hands to help you hold the hitch in place
while you mark out the air dam.

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.430
This will need to be cut in order to put the
hitch in position.

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.090
Now that we have our width marked out I am
going to go ahead and take a measurement and

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.230
I am going to cut it out the depth to start
at 2 inches.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.800
Then we will put our hitch back in place to
see if the depth is going to be enough.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:58.410
I am going to be using a Dremel to cut out
the air dam.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.200
If you worked at it you could use a utility
knife to get through it also or maybe a hacksaw

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:09.789
or saw-zall.

00:01:09.789 --> 00:01:14.250
With our hitch in position we are going to
install a bolt and flat washer from the inside

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.680
of the frame out.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:23.509
Then on the outside of the frame to fasten
our bolt we will just install our fasteners

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:27.530
finger tight this time until we get all of
them in place.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.819
That completes the passenger side.

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:44.539
I will repeat 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:02:35.530
the same process on 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.830
the driver side.

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:38.760
