00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:08.610
From the sixth century a book hand called
the "Insular half Uncial", these guys, they

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:16.390
are luscious. The book of Kells, here is the
back cover to the book of Kells this is the

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:24.160
initial letter "P" o.k. we could conceivably
call this a versal. Look at the unbelievable

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:30.019
elaboration of this, I can't even begin to
tell you how long this must have taken and

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.120
how many people must have worked on this.
There's the design, there's the first you

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:40.620
have to you have to get the sheep or the goat
and kill them and and fix the skins and then

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.450
you have to make all the paints and then you
have to have all the very special tools and

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.680
you have to design this thing and then you
have to paint it in. It's just an extraordinary

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:59.640
piece and way down here is some little tiny
lettering and this is the lettering that I

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:05.050
want to show you now. It's quite wonderful
but keep in mind once again right what I'm

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.580
going to show you is a very generic idea of
what the Insular half Uncial character is

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:21.890
so you mustn't, I guess what I mean to say
is you mustn't take me too literally. The

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.970
there's an interesting thing that's happening
with the "A" and that is that is has what

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.830
is called a "pulled curve" so that's the first
stroke of the "A" maybe it goes around to

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:39.290
about there and then it goes like this. It's
basically and then it comes around like this

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:47.680
and then it comes off like that so it's a
bit odd looking. It's basically you can consider

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.900
this well it's still pretty much considered
capitals even though it's starting to look

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:02.490
more like small letters, now. It's sort of
half way in between.
