00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It is a great handling fanning device

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.500
It shows you pretty pictures of escape routes,
oxygen masks and floatation devices.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.000
It also shows you the famous brace position you must adopt in the event of a emergency landing.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Our Aircraft Boeing 737-400 is got eight emergency exit and a super crew do Maccarena dance once again 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and point them out to you now two doors in front, four on the wing exits and two doors right at the back.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Sing: Hey Maccarena..

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
For the folks who cannot find the way to the exits there is a sign there say exit on each cover (?)

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
And there is a floor lighting at floor level in the isle, disco style.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
In the unlikely event of Bafana Bafana winning the worldcup Eish!

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
In the unlikely event of in a loss of cabin pressure oxygen masks will drop automatically from the ceiling panel above you on your left as well as on your right hand side.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Stop screaming; give them with a quick snap at the mask, pulling towards you, quickly covering your nose and mouth and continue to breathe normally.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000
In the unlikely event of water landing you find a very old quicksilver lifejacket under your seat

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:29.000
On instruction from the crew you remove your jacket from this pouch, put it over your head fasten it safe sidely around your waist, you will only inflate your jacket so when you leave the aircraft by pulling on the right tags “psssssssssst”

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Ladies this will you make like Pamela Anderson looking.
For inflation you got a valve and could with contact you’ve got a light.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:52.000
This light of course is to shines the damage sharks and not to Blue Bulls.
Cellphones and so clusterphones ??? in the inflight mode, Rasberrys, Blackberrys and Blueberrys ???.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:03.000
You’re welcome to use your lawnmowers, I-Pods, MP3- players, PSP´s, Washing Machines or hairdryers only during the cruise phase of the flight.
This is a non smoking flight, truthful.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:11.000
And our toilettes are monitored by smoke detectors, tampering with the smoke detector is considered a SERIOUS offence

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Thank you so much for your patience, we would you like to sit back, relax your feet, enjoy this “lekker” flight with us to Durban.
Thank you folks, enjoy!
