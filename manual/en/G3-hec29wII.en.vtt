00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.410
Tricks training is a wonderful activity to
participate in with you and your dog.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.480
It is both mentally and physically enriching
for your dog and it improves your skills as

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.110
your dogs trainer.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.610
an easy trick that you can get started with
would be paw, or some people refer to that

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.020
as shake and what you want to make sure you
do with tricks training is keep the training

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:26.790
fun and positive for your dog.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:33.340
A good recommendation I'd like to give everyone
is to resist the temptation to grab whenever

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:38.340
training any behavior - you want them to think
it through and in order for them to do that

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.940
you need to break it down into small achievable
steps so you're not necessarily looking for

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:49.550
the end result you're looking for anything
that's moving in the direction of that.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.620
So for paw I'm not going to grab at his feet
because he might not like that he's also not

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.240
using his brain if I'm doing the work for
him so dogs if they often cannot get something

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:07.210
with their mouth they use their feet so I'm
going to put a treat right on Jack's nose

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.322
and I'm going to have my hand ready when he
tries to knock them out of my hand because

00:01:11.322 --> 00:01:15.350
he can't get them with his mouth and I'm just
going to wait for that - I'm going to wait

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:22.470
for any paw movement whatsoever - he moved
his left paw just a little bit so that was

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.660
a nice baby step - good I got a lot of movement
out of the right one - I'm going to try again

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:37.960
- good - I say the word good every time he
does the behavior correctly and slowly it

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.229
seems that I will be able to shake with his
paw.

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:50.841
The repetition of hearing the word good when
his paw touches my paw so he makes that association.

00:01:50.841 --> 00:01:58.680
So now I think I'm ready to take the treats
away - good - he ois still going to get one

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.560
but I don't necessarily want to put them up
front anymore and then we can work with a

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:08.399
little duration so he can hold it there - oh
beautiful - good and now that he's doing that

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:16.520
readily if I'd like to put a verbal que on
it I'm going to be able to say - Jack - paw

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.370
- good - and now I've taught my dog to give
paw.
