00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:08.320
VO: Nineteen junior high and high school girls
spent a week learning how to design, build

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:10.000
and program LEGO robots.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.070
VO: 2013 marked the second year for the Aquabots
Summer Camp, put on by the University of Kentucky

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.660
and the Kentucky Girls STEM Collaborative
Project.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.060
VO: The goal of Aquabots is to encourage girls
to consider science and engineering careers.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.570
In addition to completing series of challenges
to create LEGO robots to float on and below

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.790
water, the girls get to work with female mentors
who are studying engineering at UK and talk

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:37.260
with women engineers who work for Lexmark
and Lockheed Martin.

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.680
Melissa: When I was in 9th grade I took a
robotics class using the LEGO mindstorm program

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.089
and the NXTs, and that's actually what got
me interested in engineering.

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.620
Kayla Shoa: There's only like 1 or 2 girls
in my classes, I'm in Computer Science and

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.050
so it's good to go out there and teach these
girls that it's ok to become an engineer and

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.150
to show them like, I'm an engineer and you
guys can do it too.

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:02.510
Melissa Crawford: people aren't pushing girls
to be engineers or doing anything in the STEM

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:03.510
fields.

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.510
So if you get girls interested at a young
age and if they develop a passion for it then

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.180
that's something that they're going to want
to keep doing and they'll take it for the

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:11.180
rest of their lives.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.360
Bruce Walcott: I like it because it really
puts me in a position that a lot of our young

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.250
ladies in engineering are in.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.390
I'm the only male.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.070
And, and I think I get to feel a little bit
of the intimidation that our young ladies

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.760
feel that go through engineering, who are
historically underrepresented.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.810
Bruce Walcott: So the concepts that we teach,
we do mathematics through robotics.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.670
We talk quite a bit about programming, and
that is an area where ladies are definitely

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.750
needed.

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.700
And it's not just programming for programming's
sake, there's an application involved and

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.820
you get immediate feedback, does it work,
does it not work.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.600
'Oh you lost your propeller'

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.409
Ashlyn Dowdy: They get really frustrated whenever
something goes wrong, you have to kinda make

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:03.920
them set down and go through the process of
brainstorming and you know, coming up with

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:08.420
a new design of the program, and it's really
cool to watch their faces light up when they

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:11.480
finally get it right and they succeed in their
mission.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.480
Camper: That's perfect.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.210
Bruce Walcott: Oh that's perfect, yes!

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:19.310
Keziah: I learned, like how, like what kind
of controllers to use, what kind of pieces

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:24.230
to put on the robot go in the water and float,
not float, and tip and stuff.

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:30.180
Mary: the most challenging part was getting
the boat to float properly, which did require

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:32.150
a lot of trial and error.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.050
Daniela: So far I've learned about the buoyancy
and how about even it must be and how to get

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:39.260
it even.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.970
Along with programming it so that it can drive
around in the water.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.981
Elizabeth: Get the gear trains to work with
it right and getting it all stabilized to

00:02:46.981 --> 00:02:47.981
where it stays and works.

00:02:47.981 --> 00:02:53.410
I've done computer programming before but
I've not done it to, make something to move.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.010
Mary: It's all the testing, designing the
things and then realizing it doesn't work,

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.170
then redesigning it until you get a product
that you like.

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.190
Natasha: You've put forth many ideas and you
want to see if it's worked.

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.690
Science is definitely one of my most, the
most interesting subject to me, there's so

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.630
much, you can never learn too much science.

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.090
Caroli: The fun part is getting the challenge.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.540
You just want to be challenged, you don't
want to give up, you want to move forward

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.840
and complete it.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:29.420
Mary: There's just so much to learn and no
matter how much you learn, we're always learning

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.930
more and more about the world and everything.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.569
So you can never stop learning and that's
the most interesting part.

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.340
Elizabeth: I want to be an engineer when I
grow up and I'm not really sure what kind

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.989
I want to be yet, and so I'm trying to go
to as many camps and things as possible so

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.910
that way I can figure out if I want to be
mechanical or electrical or even biomedical.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.770
Yulien: I love math and science and I think
engineering, and I like to use robots.

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:57.769
I'd like to be a teacher, but after coming
to this camp I feel more like being an engineer,

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:02.400
because they're kinda like, engineering is
awesome, and now I feel like engineering is

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.739
awesome.
