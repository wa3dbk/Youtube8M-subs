00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.620
Welcome to Revelation Unraveled, I'm your
host, William Tapley,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.790
also known as the Third Eagle of
the Apocalypse and the Co-Prophet

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.100
of the End Times.  Well, here in the United
States, we are

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.660
in the middle of our holiday season

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.859
starting with Thanksgiving, then Christmas
and New Years,

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:22.199
and people do tend to eat a little too
much

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.160
at this time of year.  And just yesterday,
across the

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.390
internet, came a very interesting 
article called

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:36.520
the "Daniel Diet," and this comes from the
great, Old Testament prophet,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.590
Daniel.  And I thought I would

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:42.860
mention a few words about this diet and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.600
show you that it is related to Bible
prophecy.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.739
So, let's read this particular article:
"'Turning to the

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:55.449
Bible for Weight Loss With the Daniel
Diet.'

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:59.600
The new Bible for dieting is for many

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.719
the Bible: the 'Daniel Diet'

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:05.820
inspired by the biblical prophet Daniel.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.299
According to two passages in the Bible,

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.890
Daniel fasted twice.  During the first
fast,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.290
he ate only vegetables and water to set
himself apart for God.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.240
For the second fast," now this is the fast
we're going to talk about today,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.729
"mentioned in a later chapter,"
this would be chapter 10,

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.869
"Daniel stopped eating meat, wine,
and other

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:36.720
rich foods."  But what is the significance
of this fast?

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.300
"Pastors across the country are
encouraging

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.470
their congregations to participate

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.390
in similar fasts or diets inspired by
these passages

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.869
to kick-start weight loss and to
strengthen their faith.

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:58.030
In Hawaii, the First Presbyterian Church
of Honolulu,

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.619
holds an annual, 21 day

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:05.950
Daniel Fast for congregants to not only
encourage

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:09.900
healthy eating but to help people keep their faith

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:11.780
by refocusing their attention

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.780
on their diet.  And the Saddleback Church,

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.520
which has a congregation of at least
20,000,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.110
has launched a website and book

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.500
co-written by head pastor, Rick Warren,
to promote

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.650
a long-term version of the diet

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:34.730
renamed 'The Daniel Plan.'"  Well, this is
all very interesting.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.560
And now, I thought I'd take a look at the
biblical significance

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:45.560
of "Daniel's Diet."  And this fits very
nicely with my last video

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.790
in which I explain that Daniel:10 and
Daniel:12

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.450
are actually the same chapter, and the
verses in Daniel:10

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:59.409
explain the prophecies in Daniel chapter
12.  And this

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:04.220
diet passage is from Daniel:10 verse
number 3:

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:10.099
"I ate no pleasant bread, and neither flesh,
nor wine

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:14.599
entered into my mouth, neither was I 
anointed with ointment

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:17.650
until the days of three weeks

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:22.500
were accomplished."  And Daniel is not
actually prophesying

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.459
about a diet here,

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.980
although I'm glad people are dieting
according to what Daniel said,

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.760
because this will bring this passage 
into more prominence.

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.650
This is a prophecy of the End Times and
when Daniel says, "I

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:43.489
ate no pleasant bread," it means
that this "pleasant bread" will be taken

00:03:43.489 --> 00:03:44.980
away in the End Times.

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:48.150
And in the End Times, this "pleasant bread"

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:53.420
is the Holy Eucharist; "and neither flesh,
nor wine entered into my mouth,"

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.239
means that neither the Body, nor the
Blood of Christ will be allowed

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:01.799
for any Christian, and this will be taken
away

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:05.840
by the False Prophet.  In other words,
"neither was I

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:10.140
anointed with ointment," the person
who takes this

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.180
Holy Eucharist away from all Christians,

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.030
will not be truly "anointed with ointment,"

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:22.290
he won't be legitimate.  "Till the days
of three weeks were accomplished,"

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.949
and these three weeks refer to the
three years

00:04:25.949 --> 00:04:30.160
of  Great Tribulation.  And this passage

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:33.720
explains chapter 12, verse number

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:38.139
11:  "And from the time when the daily
sacrifice

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:41.300
shall be taken away," this verse

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.250
in Chapter 10, verse number 3
explains

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.330
what this "daily sacrifice" is, in other words,

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.780
the Holy Eucharist.  "And the abomination
unto desolation set up,"

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.820
this False Prophet who was not 
"anointed with ointment,"

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:01.190
is the one who will set up this
"abomination of desolation"

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.100
in all Christian churches which
practice the Holy Eucharist.

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:09.500
They will all be affected, especially the
Roman Catholic Church,

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.050
which is my denomination.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:15.120
"There shall be 1290 days."

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.600
The 1290 days is the same as
the three weeks

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.360
or three years of Great Tribulation.

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:26.830
And so, in conclusion, for all you
Christians who are

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.960
practicing the "Daniel Diet," mainly
probably

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.580
to lose a few of those pounds you gained
over these holidays,

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.389
I hope you appreciate my very short
explanation of the

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:41.910
significance of the "Daniel Diet" in

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.900
Bible prophecy.
