00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
You ask about how the behavior of a person who may experience disability 

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
following a brain injury, may be misinterpreted. 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It can be misinterpreted many ways. 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We talk about problems of awareness for people who

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
experience disability following brain injuries, and 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I see awareness as a person can't perceive,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
understand, and react to a situation like

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
other people in that situation do. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It doesn't take a brain injury to have a lack of awareness.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
You walk into the wrong party, you walk into the wrong situation, 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
and you're not going to know all the factors and you're

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
going to be sort of the odd person out. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
But we also have to talk about people and programs who

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
are trying to work with that individual about their lack of awareness. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
And what I mean by that, they don't understand

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.000
how the person of focus is understanding the situation. 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
And much as we talk about the person

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
who may experience disability following a brain injury not getting it

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
because they don't understand the context of the 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
situation or the goals and everything, 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
those of us who are trying to help that person,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
we have to understand the world as that person sees it. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
They're not acting insane. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
They're not acting delusional. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
They're acting according to the information

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.000
that they're receiving and understanding. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So if a person has problems with attention, 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
or they have problems with memory, they don't

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
have the same information that somebody else may have,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and so we need to understand that and we need to understand

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000
the capacities of the individual and to work within those capacities. 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
For example, if 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
you and I spoke two different languages, we couldn't have this discussion right now,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
so we would need a support, which would be

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
an interpreter. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
So one of the things we can talk about is being able to 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
interpret for a person,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
helping to provide information to  the person.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We call those 'Cues' or 'Setups', and things like that, 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
that make sense to the individual. 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
And we do that with everybody. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
It's not just with brain injury.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
When we get on an airplane we get cues and guides of what to do 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
to have a nice, safe flight, but just in case it isn't, 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
this is what's going to happen and this is what you have to do. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
That's actually called preteaching. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We find out the person's strengths,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and we work with those strengths.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And again, that's no different than anybody else.
