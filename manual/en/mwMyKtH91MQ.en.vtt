00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:12.480
&gt;&gt; We'll show you step by step how to make
this spoon dolly but you can use your imagination

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.540
to make a whole cast of colorful characters.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:26.409
You can even put on a spectacular spoon show

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.390
Step 1

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:41.160
Cut shapes for the hair, dress and handbag
out of felt or old fabric.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.300
Make two cut outs for the dress, one for the
back and one for the front.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.369
Step 2

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:55.029
Cut a piece of ribbon and lace about 5 inches,
or 12cm, long and glue on to the bottom of

00:00:55.029 --> 00:00:56.340
the dress.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:02.309
Squirt blobs of glue onto the dress and stick
on sequins.

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.620
Step 3

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.830
Spread glue onto the spoon and stick on the
felt hair and the front of the dress.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.310
Step 4

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.350
For the arms, cut a length of pipe cleaner
about 8 inches or 20cm long and tape onto

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.150
the back of the spoon.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.260
Then glue the back of the dress on.

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:30.510
Step 5

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.870
Give your spoon a face.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:41.070
Stick on goggly eyes, then draw a nose, mouth
and rosy cheeks.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.540
Step 6

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:48.260
Glue sparkly accessories onto the pipe cleaner
arm and around the neck.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:55.090
Hook the felt handbag onto the pipe cleaner
arm.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:59.700
