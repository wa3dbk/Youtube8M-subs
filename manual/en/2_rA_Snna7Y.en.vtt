[MUSIC CHARITY VANCE, "Icing."]

00:00:04.315 --> 00:00:04.940
-Hey, everyone.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.120
I'm Mindy from Cute
Girls Hairstyles,

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.930
and today CGH#4 and I are going
to show you how to do this

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.800
great crossover Dutch braid.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.940
But before we do that, I
just wanted to remind you

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.330
that Monday, December 30th,
at 8:00 PM on Nickelodeon

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.130
is the show called, "Webstars,"
and Brooklyn and Bailey

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.010
are being featured.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:22.950
So make sure and check it out.

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:23.860
Now onto the hair.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.130
OK, what we've done to start
is, here's her normal part line,

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.970
and I have sectioned off a
little tiny, maybe half inch

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.080
section hair, right to the
left of her normal part line.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.395
So you can see, here
is the new part,

00:00:38.395 --> 00:00:39.810
and here is her normal part.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.610
And then I've just
pulled everything else

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.260
into an elastic, so that
it's out of the way,

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.960
and I'm not accidentally
grabbing that hair.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.940
Now I'm going to lay
it back where it goes,

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:56.200
pick up a section in the
front, and begin a Dutch braid.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.090
Now, on a Dutch braid,
you know on the top piece

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.010
we're going to
add a little hair.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.577
And then we're going to
go ahead and cross it in.

00:01:03.577 --> 00:01:05.660
But on the bottom, normally
we would add this hair

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.760
into this bottom
piece, but I'm actually

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.800
going to reach up and over,
grab a section of this top piece

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:12.929
instead.

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:14.970
This is the only tricky
part, just because you're

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.510
trying to do it
all with one hand.

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.350
I'm going to give
it a little twist.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.550
I like the texture
the twist adds.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.050
And I'm going to
go ahead and add it

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.887
right into that bottom
piece, and then cross it.

00:01:25.887 --> 00:01:27.970
So you can see I have this
little tiny piece going

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.070
right there.

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.610
Now on the top, again,
I'm going to pick up

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:35.460
hair from this normal
section, cross it in.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.130
One more on the bottom again.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.915
Grab a little section from
here, and give it a twist.

00:01:47.156 --> 00:01:52.640
Go ahead and add it into the
bottom section, and cross it.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.350
We're going to do
this a few more times.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.646
From the top, reach over,
pick up a little piece.

00:02:00.646 --> 00:02:04.550
Like I said, this is
the only tricky part.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:05.200
Twist it.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:10.900
Out of the way.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:12.746
And add it in.

00:02:12.746 --> 00:02:13.245
Cross it.

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.100
Add in hair like normal.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.100
Go ahead and reach over.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.590
Can you see why I secured
that hair underneath?

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.356
So we're not accidentally
grabbing that stuff.

00:02:26.356 --> 00:02:27.760
Makes it a lot easier.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.631
Twist.

00:02:29.631 --> 00:02:33.290
Go ahead and add it in.

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.980
And on the top, like normal.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.795
I think we've got two more
little twists right here.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.290
Go ahead and give it a whirl.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.520
How are you doing?

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.280
-Good.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.011
-Good.

00:02:53.011 --> 00:02:53.510
OK.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:54.009
One more.

00:02:58.574 --> 00:03:00.820
She's playing with
that rubber band.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.490
OK, last piece.

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.540
Give it a twist.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.130
We have the others.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:10.075
Go ahead and add it in.

00:03:10.075 --> 00:03:18.570
And then finish it off in
normal-- just braid down.

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.660
This kind of actually ends
up looking a little bit

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.135
like a lace braid
on this one side.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.140
Except that it's
not a lace braid

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.190
because we did put
pieces in that bottom.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:33.640
I'm going to just finish it off.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:37.810
Add an elastic at the end
that matches her hair.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.520
And then we can
release this hair.

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:49.520
You can loosen these just
a little, if you want,

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.960
by tugging on them.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.480
And you have this
great finished hairdo.

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.063
We straightened her
hair today, but it

00:03:56.063 --> 00:03:58.980
would look great with straight
hair, or curls, or waves,

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.680
or anything like that.

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.934
Now tip your head.

00:04:01.934 --> 00:04:03.350
Tip it just like
this a little bit

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:06.446
so they can get a really nice,
pretty shot of how that looks.

00:04:06.446 --> 00:04:07.450
Isn't that fun?

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.810
Kind of different.

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:11.370
I think it's very cute.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.370
-Don't forget to like, comment,
and favorite on this video.

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.341
See you next week.

00:04:16.341 --> 00:04:16.840
Bye.

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:17.620
-Bye, guys.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.640
And again, I'm just
going come-- and we

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:22.170
can deal with these in a minute
with some spray-- finishing

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:22.770
spray.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.120
