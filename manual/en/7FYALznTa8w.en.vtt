00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:23.890
The 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.020
Legend of Zelda is a classic series, and for
good reason.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.390
It has seen entries on every Nintendo platform
with each of them being considered, if not

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.680
the best on the platform, one of the best.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.090
This trend is continued with The Legend of
Zelda: Oracle of Ages.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:47.010
This was released to Gameboy Color, as a sister
game to Oracle of Seasons, with each of them

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.860
acting like one half of a much larger experience.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:01:06.390
And while the game may be just part of something
larger, it is still a solid entry on its own.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.060
Link awakes in a strange land outside of Hyrule.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.659
He quickly meets Nayru, who turns out to be
the Oracle of Ages.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:19.890
Nayru is then kidnapped by Veran, who is out
to conquer the world.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.130
This throws the world into chaos and it is
up to Link to save it.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.600
To do that, Link must find several Essence
of Time, which are hidden throughout the land.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.689
This starts the normal Zelda adventure, with
Link traveling to different dungeons, fighting

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:36.880
enemies and solving puzzles.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.749
The interesting part comes with the new items.

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:44.079
The game is played from the classic top-down
Zelda perspective, and is brought to life

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.060
with some very impressive visuals for the
Gameboy.

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.920
The colors are bright and the worlds detailed.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.090
It is how you interact with the world that
is more impressive.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:58.060
Each Zelda game introduces new items that
need to be learned and used to solve the puzzles.

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.590
The main theme is traveling to different ages.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:06.299
You will use the Harp of Ages to traveling
back and forth from the past and present,

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:09.380
with your actions in the past effecting the
present.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.370
If you go back in time and plant a seed, when
you go to the present it will be a fully grown

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.780
tree.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.629
This brings back good memories of A Link to
the Past, where you have to think in both

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:21.909
worlds.

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:25.269
The game works as foil to Oracle of Seasons.

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:31.700
While the Seasons was a much more action oriented,
Ages focused much more on puzzles.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.270
Don’t think that means there is not any
combat.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:39.920
You will still have to frequently use your
sword to deal with the game’s enemies, but

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:45.310
for the most part the dungeons will test more
your ability to think rather than your ability

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:46.810
to fight.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.230
Even though the game is suppose to be played
with Oracle of Season that doesn’t mean

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.030
it does not stand on its own.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:58.640
This was suppose to be the swan song for the
Gameboy, and I can not think a much better

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:07.530
way for it to make its exit.
