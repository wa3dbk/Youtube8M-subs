00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:11.520
Oh, hi there!

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:17.760
Cricket's the name - Jiminy Cricket. Have you ever heard of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves?

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.710
Peter Pan? Dumbo? Or Alice in Wonderland?

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:28.360
They're all in this book. Would you like me to read you a story?

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:35.360
Er ... I kinda need some help.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:43.809
On a dark and rainy night ... a long, long time ago ...

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.120
In a kingdom far, far away ... in a quaint little cottage ...

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.879
Deep within a beautiful enchanted forest, there lived a ...

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:04.220
Oh, pardon me. It's just that I've been reading these stories for so many years ...

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.900
say, I have an idea.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.160
I'll pick out each of the happy ending pages. Then you can guess which story to put them back into.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.020
Sort of like a game.

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:34.239
Ah, Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Now there's a happy ending for yeh.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.420
Snow White and the Prince live happily ever after.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:49.600
In the happy ending to Dumbo, Dumbo the Flying Elephant is finally reunited with his mother Mrs. Jumbo.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:58.620
In this happy ending Alice travels to Wonderland but makes it back home - and without losing her head.

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:04.880
In the happy ending to Peter Pan, Captain Hook is chased off by Tick-Tock the Crocodile.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.820
Peter lives on as feisty as ever. And he never ever has to grow up.

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.530
We better put this one on the shelf. At
least until someone can shed a little

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:25.970
light on this situation.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.460
Well as I live and breath ...

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.260
The Blue Fairy!

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:44.500
Sir Jiminy ...

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.660
You are an official conscience - entrusted
with a duty of helping

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.490
others choose between right and wrong.
Did you do something wrong tonight?

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.710
No! Well, I mean I did tear out these pages but ...

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.110
I was just trying to ... I mean, it's just a book.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:04.450
Jiminy, once a story is read

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:09.690
it becomes alive in the imagination of the person who heard the story/

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.600
By removing the happy endings,

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.980
the heroes were left in peril and the villians put in control.

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.900
Huh, some conscience I turned out to be.

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.620
My friend and I'll put the pages back.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.620
No, no. The villains have already started to change the stories.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.200
You are going to have to travel into the stories to fix them.

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:32.340
We can do that M'Lady.

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.500
I hope.

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:44.449
Hello there!

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.820
Oh ... hello.

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.520
I'm Out. And you're out too.

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.280
No I'm not. My name is In. How could you forget that?

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.160
I live right next door to you ... Oh don't start

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:58.120
I meant our new guests here are OUT.

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.520
And you probably went to go in. Inside the stories that is

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:04.240
Now why would you want to do that?

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:07.520
Haven't you heard all of the villains have taken over?

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.400
Well, perhaps our guests can help.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.700
What'd you mean? Help the villains? No, no. Helping the villains would be wrong.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.880
Our guest must do what's right and help
the storybook heroes.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.580
Oh yes.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:23.669
But before we let you enter, we must make sure that you know

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:26.209
what the heroes look like.

00:05:26.209 --> 00:05:31.460
OK, let's all look for Pinocchio. When you find him, point to where he is.

00:05:31.469 --> 00:05:36.080
Excellent! There's Pinocchio. Now for something a bit more difficult.

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:39.569
Let's find Tick-Tock, from the story of Peter Pan.

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:44.311
There he is. Hey Tick-Tock, you're late on the rent again!

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.840
Now let's look for Peter. Here's Peter Pan now - Hi Pete!

00:05:49.340 --> 00:05:51.720
Now it's time to search for Jiminy Cricket.

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.169
Hey, I'm right here. There's Jiminy.

00:05:55.169 --> 00:05:58.620
I say, that was like trying to find a needle in a haystack.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:03.189
Actually it was more like trying to find a carved cricket on a wood door if you want to be precise

00:06:03.189 --> 00:06:06.449
Yes. Well next we have to find Alice

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:12.249
from Alice in Wonderland. Hello Alice. Now we must search for another fair maiden

00:06:12.249 --> 00:06:17.729
by the name of Snow White. Mirror, Mirror on the Wall who's the fairest of them all?

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.380
There she is - it's Snow White.

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:23.020
Now it's time for you to find Dopey.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:26.919
That's Dopey. There you go again, making fun of our

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:31.370
talented guest. Now it's time to find little Tinkerbell.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:36.120
There you are Tinkerbell. You're the light of my life.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:40.410
Now here's a tricky one - you have to try to find the Cheshire Cat.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:44.970
There's the Cheshire Cat. Now we have to look for Grumpy from Snow White and the

00:06:44.970 --> 00:06:46.160
Seven Dwarves.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:52.420
There's Grumpy. Ooo, he doesn't look happy. You just need to find a few more of our friends

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.830
and then you'll be ready to enter the stories.

00:06:55.830 --> 00:06:57.320
Let's look for Sleepy.

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.840
There's Sleepy. Well what do you know he's sleeping - there's a big surprise.

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:04.120
Now we have to find the White Rabbit

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.850
because he's late for a very important date.

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:12.760
There's the White Rabbit. Good, now let's look for Dumbo.

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:15.500
There you go again - calling our guest names.

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.980
There's Dumbo. Now you've to find Doc.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.420
Er, would it be possible? ...  I mean, could it be alright with you? ...

00:07:23.460 --> 00:07:28.820
I mean can't you just let us bask in the glory of finding ... for one measly little second before

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.320
barking out the name of the next missing person? Would that be alright

00:07:32.320 --> 00:07:33.789
with you?

00:07:33.789 --> 00:07:37.980
We're on the last one. Oh! OK, never mind.

00:07:37.980 --> 00:07:40.480
Hey, what's up Doc?

00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:43.100
Try to remember who we work for.

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:45.419
Our guest has just proven

00:07:45.419 --> 00:07:48.529
that they know what all of the storybook heroes look like

00:07:48.529 --> 00:07:52.309
and they're ready to enter. We'll swing open

00:07:52.309 --> 00:07:56.039
and let you go in. But I don't want to go. I meant

00:07:56.039 --> 00:08:00.279
THEM! Ooo, well somebody woke up on the wrong side of the door today.
