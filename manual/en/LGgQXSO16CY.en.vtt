00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:04.660
We are at our new favorite restaurant in George
Town.

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.129
It is called Kapitan.

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:07.129
Restaurant Kapitan.

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:09.599
They serve up amazing Indian food.

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:13.872
If you like rich savory curries and buttery
naans you have come to the right place.

00:00:13.872 --> 00:00:25.679
Over here we have a tandoori set which I got.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:40.320
It came with a buttery naan bread and some
nice curries.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:59.850
We also have Alo Ghobi over here with potatoes
and cauliflower and some extra Naan because

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:10.670
we just like it so much.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.579
We need double the portion.

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:15.579
That chicken is superb.

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:16.579
It is juicy on the inside and crispy on the
outside.

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:17.579
Wow!

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:18.579
What flavor.

00:01:18.579 --> 00:01:19.579
How is the curry?

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:20.579
It's so good.

00:01:20.579 --> 00:01:21.579
So so good!

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:30.110
Aside from being a great restaurant in terms
of the quality of food, the other thing we

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:41.710
really like about coming here is that it is
so affordable.

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.259
You can just pick a whole bunch of different
dishes, mix and match and you'll get a great

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:48.259
meal.

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.200
One of our absolute favorite dishes so far
has been the Palak Paneer, which is really

00:01:51.200 --> 00:02:07.439
delicious and we've also really enjoyed the
Tandoori chicken which is always fresh, crispy

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.180
and the butter naan.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.620
That is good.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:39.970
This is a 24 hour restaurant and we like it
so much we're considering coming for breakfast,

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:50.909
lunch, dinner and maybe even a snack.
