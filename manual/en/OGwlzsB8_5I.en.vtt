On this episode of the Green Ninja show,
Paul from San Antonio, Texas asks:

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.859
People say you have to be selective
when buying fish.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.300
I love fish! What's the big deal?

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:39.000
Well, chum. That's a whale of a subject!
Let's see if we can reel in some answers!

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.900
Hi, I'm looking to find a good fish.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:50.540
Then I've got just what you need!

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It's time for: The Baiting Game!
Here's your host, Dick Periwinkle!

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Thanks, Al! Today's guest is Shiela.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.489
And she's in the market for a good fish!

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:07.590
Shiela, we've got three fish for you to interview.
What's your first question?

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.000
Uh... Okay. Fish number one,

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.300
have you been caught or farmed
in environmentally friendly ways?

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:22.800
Oh yeah. Nothing crabby about me.
This is one fish that's never been battered!

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.000
Oh my cod.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Fish number two, have you
been checked for mercury levels?

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:37.069
Don't be "koi," baby.
My mercury levels are off the charts!

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:39.500
Holy mackerel.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:44.200
Fish number three, I was really
in the market for a tuna. Are you a tuna?

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:53.489
Oh, most dolphinately.
I wouldn't squid around with you!

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:57.179
Wow. My head is swimming.

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.049
Okay, let's make it o-fishal!
Who's it gonna be?

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.000
I've made my decision!

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
I am not going to buy anything without
consulting with a reputable fish salesperson.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Or referring to my pocket sustainable seafood guide!

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Well, there you have it everyone!
Shiela's making some wise seafood choices.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.200
Be sure to join us next time on:
The Baiting Game!

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So there's the "reel" answer, folks.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.500
You don't have to be a brain "sturgeon"
to make good shopping decisions.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.239
I can't stand this punishment.

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:48.000
