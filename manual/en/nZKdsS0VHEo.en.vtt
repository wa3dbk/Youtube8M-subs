00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:06.700
Welcome

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.600
One of the most important questions that come to every parents’ mind during the school year

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.120
is “when is it alright to allow our child to skip school?”

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.060
OR “when is it alright for enforce our child to home stay or a bed stay?”

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:27.920
Lets agree on a list of cases that require the child to skip school in case of their appearance 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.000
First case:  High fever 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.320
With children, high fever is often associated with a contagious disease 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.380
The cause for high fever could be a sore throat 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.960
It could be caused by inflammations in the respiratory system 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.640
It could be caused by cold or flu 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.860
It could be caused by inflammations in the digestive system or even in the urinary system

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.080
And there are many different causes for a high fever

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.000
In case of high fever, children should get a home rest in an attempt

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:59.480
To stimulate the immune system to perform at full force in order to fight those microbes 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.060
To prevent the spreading of the disease in case of a contagious one

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.660
So that other children at school would not catch the disease

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.140
How to act during a child’s fever?

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.580
which medications should be used and how exactly to deal with them?

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.520
All these topicswill be mentioned in details specifically in a separate episode of our show which can be viewed on this link

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.200
The second case where a child should be allowed for a home rest is: 

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.460
If the child suffers from both, diarrhea and vomiting

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:26.180
We should then impose home rest on the child, not only to facilitate frequent bathroom visits,

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.640
But also to be able to compensate the child’s body system with liquids that have been lost

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.380
Also, to allow the immune system to fight the microbes or poisons causing the diarrhea and vomiting fit

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.340
Kindly note, 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.260
the child should get a full 48 hour home rest, which is the most preferred duration

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.060
Presumably, 48 hours usually allow the child to regain his/her full health

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.880
Those 48 hours are to be calculated starting the last time the child suffered from diarrhea or vomit

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.260
Also note, 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:57.400
In case of a bloody diarrhea,

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.320
Meaning finding blood mixed with the child’s feces

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.600
or a lot of mucus,

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.920
Do not hesitate to ask for medical guidance
