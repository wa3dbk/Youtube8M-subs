00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:13.000
My name is Walt Reynolds, I have been a trainer for 23 
 years, I have logged over 28000 training sessions in that time

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I believe that movement and function are a part of 
 everyone’s life’s and should be part of everyone’s life’s.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
And I help people to train, to move 
 and  function better, every single day.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Common form runners typically demonstrate heel strike first landing on a straight knee,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
landing with the foot well in front of the hips, a 
 position we often refer to as the check mark.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:55.000
They demonstrate a slow cadence of turnover with their feet, something 
 in the order of 140 to 160 steps per minute.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And they also typically demonstrate very little in the way of lean.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Bare form runners typically demonstrate a midfoot strike landing on a bent knee

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
with the foot closer to being underneath the hips.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
They demonstrate a higher cadence of turnover in order 
 of 180 steps per minute or faster,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
at all running speeds and typically demonstrate a slight lean forward from the angle.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We begin bare form running by doing what we call the posture reset.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Interlock your fingers and raise your arms directly overhead,maintaining a 
 tall posture, lower your arms to your side,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000
bend your elbows half way then go halfway again. 
 Place your elbows slightly behind your body

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and swing your arms in a small compact motion.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Move to the mid foot and jog in place. Make a conscious effort to 
 land on the ball of the foot just slightly ahead of the heel.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Set your metronome or other cadence device at 180 beats per minute, 
 and match the cadence of 180 as close as you can

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
The Lean from the ankles drill begins with the posture reset,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.000
with the elbows held flexed and slightly behind the body and 
 the running position.. shift your weight backwards from the heels,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000
bring your body back to center, shift your 
 weight forward and then return to center
