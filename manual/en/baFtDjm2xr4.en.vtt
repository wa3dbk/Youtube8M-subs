00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Sofrito is the base of many delicious dishes.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Each country has its own version.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Do you know how we make it in my native Puerto Rico?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'll show you.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The ingredients I need are those you see here.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Here's my hot skillet.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I'll pour in some oil.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Then I'll wait a few seconds,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
and I'll add the onion.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I'll continue with the garlic and cook these for a couple of minutes.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I add the green peppers,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
the red ones,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
and then, the tomato sauce.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
I mix everything well,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and now I'll add the culantro,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.000
chopped cilantro

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
and a good amount of salt.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We can't leave out the sweet peppers.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And now, my personal touch: 1/3 teaspoon of dry oregano,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
and one tablespoon of stuffed olives,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
one teaspoon capers,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and, if you'd like, you can add small pieces of cooking ham.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Another one of my secrets: a little bit of achiote oil

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
to give it a reddish color.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Now, I'm ready to cook my favorite dish.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Mmm! My mouth is watering.
