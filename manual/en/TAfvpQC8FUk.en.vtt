00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.539
So we blended the filling for our pineapple
cheesecake, now we're going to assemble it.

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:21.880
We got a 9x9 inch baking pan and we'll just
spray it with a thin coating of canola oil

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:33.899
cooking spray. Just get it nicely thinly coated
there to make it easier to serve. Now we're

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:42.079
going to pour in our graham cracker crust
and I like a bit of a thicker graham cracker

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:58.650
crust and makes it easier to serve. So we'll
just spread this in evenly, pat it down and

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:05.880
the beauty of this meal is that it's all nice
and quick and it doesn't require tons of time

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:24.420
in the kitchen. So it's a nice meal on a summer
hot day and finally we'll pour in our filling

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:37.390
and spoon it over and now it's gotten a really
nice fluffy creamy texture and we'll let this

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:45.850
chill in our fridge for a few hours or overnight
if you want it to get it a nice and cool and

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:53.310
firm. And you just spread this over evenly,
you'll serve it in slices and if you want

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.700
to garnish it, you can garnish it with a little
bit of whip cream or a little bit of fresh

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.590
pineapple to go with the pineapple in the
cheesecake.
