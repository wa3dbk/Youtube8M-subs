00:00:10.554 --> 00:00:12.394
Why's this furniture here?

00:00:12.394 --> 00:00:14.280
Previous owners left it behind.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:15.860
So...like it?

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.120
I like our OLD house.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.220
I had your prescription transferred over to the local pharmacy.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.275
We just moved in across the street.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.200
I'm Rose.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.240
I mean like honestly, how can you live in that house?

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:33.217
Why would she say that?

00:00:33.217 --> 00:00:34.900
Did something happen here?

00:00:40.255 --> 00:00:41.535
Don't come near me!

00:00:41.535 --> 00:00:43.960
I'm Noah, we were hired to work on your house!

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.600
We didn't think anybody was home...

00:00:46.054 --> 00:00:47.414
God, I'm so sorry...

00:00:48.194 --> 00:00:49.314
- Here. - Thanks.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.880
Well, I should probably -

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.260
Absolutely, Rosy-Rose.

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:56.434
Sorry again for the intrusion.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:00.000
Hey.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.320
I was gonna say we should be friends

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.514
but, uh, I see you already found someone.

00:01:05.554 --> 00:01:08.514
Rachel left without saying a word to anyone.

00:01:08.514 --> 00:01:10.000
All her stuff was here.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.060
And she had just...disappeared.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.620
Help me!

00:01:14.184 --> 00:01:15.624
In one of the bedrooms

00:01:16.386 --> 00:01:19.106
the windows were completely boarded up.

00:01:19.106 --> 00:01:20.039
From the inside.

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:21.840
Whatever was inside that room

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.935
wasn't supposed to get out.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.220
Dad!

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:27.837
I saw someone in the basement!

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:32.200
I know what I saw.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.200
I'm not making it up.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.400
I want you to be honest with me.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.020
Are you taking your meds?

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.780
He did something to her, didn't he?!

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.000
Don't come over here acting like you know something about it

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.500
cause you DON'T.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.220
This is not my imagination!

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.120
I'm not some crazy person, it's not my emotions running wild!

00:01:49.431 --> 00:01:51.191
Don't make me mad at you...

00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:58.540
Rose?!

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.200
DAD!!!!
