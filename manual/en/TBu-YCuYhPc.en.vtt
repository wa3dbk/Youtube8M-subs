00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:05.369
So they made a big mistake in the second hobbit
movie in terms of the music. Let's find out why.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.300
So when you hear this song, what comes to

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:19.880
your mind?
Probably lightsabers and darth vader and starships

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.949
and all that jazz.
Okay, how about this one?

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:28.310
Gandalf, Aragorn, they're walking on mountains,
the Fellowship.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.270
Okay, last example.
Harvey Dent: Can we trust him??

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:38.910
All of these have what I call Emotional Capital.
They're all the main themes of these movies.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.520
And when you think about it, whenever that
song is played in the second and third movies-

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.120
kind of, the memories that you associate with
it, that you developed throughout the series,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.580
come back to you.
So for example, the first time we hear that

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:57.580
Lord of the Rings Main Theme in all its glory
is

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.250
So what happens is, our minds associate with
the images, the characters, the emotions that

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:15.120
we're feeling at the time. So then the director
is able to kind of use that emotional asset,

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:20.610
that emotional capital, and then say in the
third movie, when Aragorn looks back at everyone

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.060
and he says "For Frodo"- then when they start
running they put that music back in and we

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:29.880
get

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.030
When that music plays, subconsciously we are
connecting back to all the scenes, and the

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:47.470
gazillion hours of the first two movies of
the Lord of the Rings, in terms of the emotional

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.930
connection we had during the times of those
scenes.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:54.350
It shows how powerful recurring main themes
can become.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.990
And so without wasting an extra frame, the
director is able to just put this music in,

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.240
and get this powerful emotional effect that
we wouldn't get if it was just some other

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.390
random song.
So what does this have to do with the Hobbit

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.170
Trilogy? Well, before the first movie came
out, we got that trailers, and we were introduced

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:17.170
to the main theme, which was
"Far over the Misty Mountains Cold"

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.710
And that's a really cool song!

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:32.880
Turns out it was actually not made by Howard Shore, but by a musicians collective called
Plan 9.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.750
And Howard Shore just saw that it was really
awesome, and he introduced it into the main

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:43.750
theme, so then we get scenes like:

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:52.500
But then we get to that part, where Thorin starts singing. And it's epic.
And this song isn't about some sort of morality

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:57.370
tale of doing the right thing or whatever-
no, this is about getting gold back! You know

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.420
and going to the mountain- like this is really
a window into dwarfish culture. This is really

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.040
something that makes you feel like you're
back in Middle Earth.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:10.280
In the second movie, I remember watching it,
and afterwards I remember feeling like something

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.080
bothered me; the music kind of, didn't stick
with me a lot.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.989
And as I watched it again at home, all of
a sudden I realized: the Main theme- the song

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:25.470
that they set up to be the main theme
song for the Hobbit Trilogy- just like they

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.910
do with the Lord of the Rings, or with Batman-
the total amount of times they put it in the

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:36.170
second (And Third!) movie amounts to: Zero!
That's kind of like George Lucas saying: You

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.010
know what, that main theme for Star Wars,
let's not use it at all in The Empire Strikes

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.750
Back. Or Steven Spielberg saying: You know
what, let's not use that main theme for Indiana

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.930
Jones, yeah let's not use it at all in the
Temple of Doom. No.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.430
The thing is, The Desolation of Smaug not
having that main theme, doesn't necessarily

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.690
make it a bad movie, but they do miss out
on HUGE emotional capital that they've built

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:05.250
up in that first movie, and in that whole
marketing push of making this the main theme.

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.680
And in my personal opinion, the part where
it would have been perfect for them to play

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:14.690
that song would have been here.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:19.120
I mean that's when they first see the Lonely
Mountain, their goal, the thing they've been

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:24.800
talking about throughout the entire first
movie and up to that point in the second one!

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.080
So imagine watching The Desolation of Smaug
for the first time, and then when you get

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:36.080
to this scene, instead you get this:

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:52.500
That would have been awesome, right? It would have emotionally brought you back
to the images and the faces and the scenes

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:56.240
where you felt that music in the first movie.
And it would have brought us back to that

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:03.229
reality of the culture and the ancient aspect
of the Dwarvish People- coming to get their

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:05.740
gold.
And regardless, I'm really looking forward

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.129
to the last movie- I've really loved what
Peter Jackson has done- and this is something

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:14.819
that I really think Directors should keep
in mind. The fact that music can really emotionally

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:20.289
anchor us in something, and can act as a connecting
thread between movies, so that we really feel

00:05:20.289 --> 00:05:24.809
like we're back in that same universe, back
and caring about the images, the characters,

00:05:24.809 --> 00:05:28.219
and the stories that we're seeing.
So let me know what you think. Do you agree,

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:31.849
do you disagree?
Did Peter Jackson miss out on this big opportunity

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:37.249
to bring back that emotional capital he's
built with that song, that they spent a lot

00:05:37.249 --> 00:05:41.129
of money on in doing that first movie and
getting us to associate with those images

00:05:41.129 --> 00:05:43.569
and with that song?
Or do you think it was right? Do you think

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:46.439
that they should have left it out for some
other reason?

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:50.990
Let me know what you think, and thanks again
for tuning in to Soundtrack Reviews. And I'll

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:53.350
see you next time.
