Hello and welcome back to another video where
we can play with the hottest and fastest die-cast

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:24.260
cars and in this video we're going to use
pieces of tracks and make different layouts

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:39.360
and the tracks are from Track Sets like Mega
Jump Track Set or Cobra Cave and others ofcourse.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:47.660
I don't have a booster so im trying to combine
the tracks to make different fun layouts and

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:58.280
we're going to use cars like : the Batmobile,
Twin Mill 3 , Retro-Active and Lotus, offcourse

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.670
the MR11 also.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.110
As always you can leave your feedback and
let me know what you think about this, if

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.760
you enjoy these "Playing with Hot Wheels"
videos and maybe we can make more and hopefully

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:17.030
in the future I can find a booster somewhere
to buy so we can play and make different fun

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.100
layouts.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.689
This is the first layout and we made a circle,
offcourse the tracks are to straight, to vertical

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:33.060
so im not sure if the cars are going to stay
on the tracks to much but lets give it a try.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:03:08.410
The first one, the Batmobile ... This is a
heavy car, so it is not going to last 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:04:25.710
to much ... And the last one, it's the Marco
Reus MR11 ... So this is the first layout,

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:34.400
I think is pretty fun, to bad the cars don't
roll very much, because of the track layout.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:39.910
Let me know what you think about this and
leave a comment and let me know which car

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.840
was the fastest on this layout.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:50.220
The second layout is a half loop and we're
going to use each car and see which one stays

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:51.580
the most in movement.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:06:22.690
Let's start with the Batmobile ... 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.520
These are all the cars for today, let me know
in the comments which one you think stayed

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:28.900
the most on the track.

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:36.890
My personal opinion is the Batmobile and the
green/black Retro-Active stayed the most.

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:42.040
keep in mind that they all started at the
same height, this is all the fun for today

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:47.699
with the Hot Wheels cars, thank you for watching,
don't forget to leave your feedback and Merry

00:06:47.699 --> 00:06:56.230
Christmas everyone, happy holidays, don't
forget to have fun, be good and wait for Santa

00:06:56.230 --> 00:07:00.440
Claus, who knows, he might bring you some
Hot Wheels.

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:03.949
Thank you for watching, have a great day and
happy holidays.
