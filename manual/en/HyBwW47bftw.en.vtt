00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.520
Today's engines do have a tendency to
get congested with deposits, and the

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.420
source of those deposits is actually in
the fuel, not the engine.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:22.140
Environmental regulations have created a
demand for cleaner-burning fuels, which

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.629
sounds great and is for the environment,
but it's not so great for your engine

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:30.899
because these new fuel formulations tend
to be waxy

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:34.430
and like to leave deposits in a couple
of critical areas.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.890
And with this video scope,

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.950
I can show you some of my cruddiest home
videos. Come on, let's take a look.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.479
It's time for Cruddiest Home

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:48.220
Videos with Dr. John.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.430
Here's one area right here at the top of
the piston.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.750
There's not a lot of clearance between
the top of the piston and the top of the

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.180
cylinder

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.570
as they cycle up.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.309
If you get a build-up of just twenty
thousandths of an inch,

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:03.810
your engine may suffer a loss of power.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.619
This buildup is very typical and can
begin at about ten thousand miles.

00:01:08.619 --> 00:01:10.850
Now this is the fuel intake.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.440
Get even a small amount of deposits on
the valves, forts, and injectors here,

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:18.890
and you can begin to restrict the flow
of fuel through the enginem

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.410
You'll have the feeling of pumping the
accelerator and getting no acceleration.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.120
Of course, fuel and air are inseparably
linked together in the operation of your

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:31.830
fuel induction system, particularly in
today's engines.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.780
That's because of this valve,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.240
called an EGR, for exhaust gas
recirculation.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.860
The EGR actually redirects that
portion of the fuel which has been

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.330
converted to exhaust gas

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.670
back into the air intake system

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.600
to mix with the engine's air supply.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.450
But the exhaust gas is obviously not as
pure as the air coming in from outside

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.440
the engine,

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.700
and those impurities can form still more
deposits,

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.939
this time in this area called the plenum.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.979
The result can be a choking off of some
of the system's air and a corresponding

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.579
loss of performance.

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:13.199
So with all those opportunities for a
buildup to form, what can we do about it?

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.949
"It keeps valves like this

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:16.779
from getting like this!"

00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:20.159
That's what today's fuel system
cleanup is really all about.
