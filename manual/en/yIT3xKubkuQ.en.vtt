00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.510
Hey there, this is your Pal Pallie and welcome
back to Git Er Raid.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.160
Onward ho!... through heroic Siege of Orgrimmar.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:18.920
Next up is heroic Sha of Pride.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.750
This encounter has you moving constantly to
avoid crap on the ground and playing Pacman?

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.940
Yes Pacman.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.519
This fight can be 2 or 3 healed, but as usual
we ended up 2 healing it here.

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:38.420
There are two additional mechanics on heroic,
one that appears once per cycle for the boss

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.760
and the other is there constantly throughout
the fight.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.520
So lets get to the cyclical one first, the
Pacman one!

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.579
Essentially, soon after the adds spawn but
before Prisons, one of your dps or healers

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.850
will get transported into another realm.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.390
It is your job to kill the add that is left
behind by them and then they are broken out.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.420
Basically kind of like Garrosh's mind controls.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.030
Switch quickly and get em out.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.840
But what happens to the person who is sucked
out of the raid.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.180
You land in the same room but with a maze
and some Sha adds running around.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.570
You are forced to walk forward and if you
hit the edges of the room you take damage.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.960
If you run into one of the patrolling Sha
adds, you instantly die.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.750
So you have to run around not hitting walls
and not running into anything until your raid

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.380
breaks you out.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.820
This usually takes just 5 or 6 seconds at
most.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.640
The fun part is that you can run into these
golden orbs and if you do you'll be healed

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.580
to full as well as buffing your raid to break
you out faster.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.430
I wish the maze was more complicated but the
basic strategy is to take your first left

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.770
and then turn left again.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.229
If you reach this orb, turn around and go
back the way you came.

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.320
If you aren't back into the normal realm by
the time you get back to the junction, scold

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.110
your raiders for not switching targets to
you soon enough.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.360
This mechanic of sending someone into this
banished realm happens once per cycle for

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.429
the boss so about every minute.

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.370
The only real difficulty you might have from
this is being able to pick out the add to

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.190
kill in the normal realm if there are a bunch
of adds up previously from the self-reflection

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.560
part.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.580
Get a targetting macro or something and target
Corrupted Fragment.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.640
The other major mechanic change for heroic
is these rifts all around the room.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.190
One of them opens up every 8 seconds or so.

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:37.360
Each one of them spews a sha bolt towards
your raid.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.390
If you get hit by it, you take some damage
and gain 5 pride.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.140
Obviously thats a bad thing so watch your
feet for the little exploding indicator under

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:48.510
your feet and move quickly.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:53.730
If you've done Dark Animus, its a similar
mechanic to Anima Font.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:59.520
You might be thinking, wow, a rift every 8
seconds thats going to get out of hand quickly!

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.420
And, if you do nothing, that is indeed the
case.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.700
But you are able to run over the rift to close
it.

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.459
You take some damage but more importantly
you get a debuff for 1 minute that doesn't

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:14.260
allow you to close any more rifts.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:19.209
So the basica strategy here is to have your
raid be aware of nearby rifts and close them

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.310
when they can.

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:26.220
You can get 100% of the rifts, but its probably
not worth having almost your entire raid doing

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.910
this as the rifts get spread out.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.830
At the very least, your tanks can grab one
when they aren't tanking and all of your dps

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.190
can rotate through grabbing the rifts.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.659
Be very careful though.

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:43.319
If you are out of range of healers and have
the nasty dot in there, you might die from

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.170
closing the rift if you aren't topped off
or aren't near a healer who can get you back

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.810
up quickly.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:52.640
The hardest part of this mechanic is just
remembering to go back out and do this again

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.900
and again after your debuff expires.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.940
Use some kind of WeakAura or just remember
about the same part of the boss' cycle that

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.700
you did it last.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:07.319
So if you closed a rift after the prisons,
then do it again next cycle.

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:11.530
Thats it for mechanic changes so lets talk
strategy.

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.950
As always with heroics, you will have to be
tighter in your execution so that things don't

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:17.590
get out of hand.

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:22.620
For example, the Gift of the Titans was a
“nice to have” buff in normal mode.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:27.160
In heroic, its pretty essential to getting
through the fight especially when it comes

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:30.820
to it granting your raiders immunity to gaining
pride.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.870
This is true in two particular instances here
on heroic.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:39.750
First off, healers should only dispel if they
have Gift of the Titans.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.530
And it should be top priority to dispel.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:47.460
If you go wily nily about dispelling, you
will make things worse later on.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.680
Secondly, you may not have even known this
mechanic existed but when the Manifestation

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:59.180
big guy in the back dies, he shoots out some
pride to the nearest two people to him.

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:04.400
Not a big deal on normal mode but on heroic,
you'll want to avoid this so you need to have

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:09.911
at least 2 people with Gift of the Titans
stack up on the add as it dies so that it

00:05:09.911 --> 00:05:12.720
will shoot that pride at them.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.300
We designated this Purple raid marker as the
stack point for the add and for the people

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.930
with Gift.

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.590
Side note, this is actually how the achievement
is done for the boss so do it right!

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:29.090
And of course, in general you should keep
the people stacked who have Gift so that they

00:05:29.090 --> 00:05:33.780
can get Power of the Titans and do 15% more
damage and healing.

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:36.889
So with that, here was our raid positioning.

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:41.460
We generally were in the area of this green
triangle marker except for tanks who were

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.480
up front around Blue Square.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:50.050
People with gift of the titans would be in
the area of Yellow Star and as aforementioned,

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:55.750
the purple diamond was for Gift people during
the time when the big add was out.

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.560
Beyond that, people would individually go
off and close rifts.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.780
The raid as a whole would focus on the back
half of the room for the most part.

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:09.150
The melee, tanks and myself would occasionally
hit a rift up front but we seemed to keep

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:13.979
the number of rifts pretty low using this
approach.

00:06:13.979 --> 00:06:18.030
The last major thing to mention is the damage
of Swelling Pride.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.240
With our raid dps, which I'll show at the
end, we had 4 swelling prides before we pushed

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.320
into the last 30% phase.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.389
And of course, you'll at least get one more
swelling pride beyond that.

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:32.530
So plan your raid CDs accordingly.

00:06:32.530 --> 00:06:35.610
The Swell comes every minute or so.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:41.350
I planned to use my deterrances for each one,
but failed for the most part.

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:46.990
Other 1 minute defensive CDs should be used
and raid CDs coordinated.

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:52.069
And of course, you should review what happens
when you get higher and higher levels of Pride.

00:06:52.069 --> 00:06:57.610
You may have never seen a projection in normal
mode but its highly likely on the 3rd or 4th

00:06:57.610 --> 00:07:00.449
Swelling pride you may have one.

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:03.419
Lust is still best used in the same place.

00:07:03.419 --> 00:07:08.490
Hit 30% and beat the crap out of him while
he aoes you right back.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:12.840
We chose to not continue closing rifts and
just dance around everywhere.

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:16.919
Our shadow priest LOVED it let me tell you.

00:07:16.919 --> 00:07:21.449
Don't panic in this phase, just take care
of all the normal mechanics and survive.

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:27.020
Oh one more quick thing I forgot to mention,
the adds that spawn from the ground should

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:29.979
likely be tanked as they do a bit more damage.

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:34.970
They'll probably get mowed down in nothing
flat but you might as well avoid raid members

00:07:34.970 --> 00:07:36.810
getting gibbed.

00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:42.030
So if you break people out of the pacman game
quickly, avoid all the missiles from rifts

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:47.880
and consistently close rifts, that should
be all you need to get this thing done.

00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:51.380
