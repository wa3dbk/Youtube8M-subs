00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.490
Hello and welcome to the complete guide to
using your Android Lollipop Nexus 6. Today

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.070
it's data usage basics.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.699
To get a quick view of your mobile cellular
data usage, swipe down from the top of the

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:21.810
screen with two fingers to display quick settings
and then tap on your signal strength bar on

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:28.289
the left hand side. This will give you a snapshot
of your data usage in the current cycle.

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.610
Most people will have a monthly data allowance
on their phone and you can set this by pressing

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.160
on more settings from the quick data usage
option. On this screen you can view previous

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.280
monthly data usage and change the dates of
your cycle by tapping on the month to month

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.420
option on the left side. You have two options
with data limits, The first is the top orange

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:55.330
line which, when hit, will cut off mobile
data on your device. You can drag this line

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:02.670
up and down or press the number on the left
side to type in a MB limit. The black line

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.900
sets up a warning limit so that a popup appears
on screen when you reach it. Obviously the

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:14.220
black line has to be underneath the orange.
Also note, this does not track WIFI data usage,

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.470
only data used by your cellular mobile network.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.900
On the same data screen you can view the list
of applications that use data with the hungriest

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.780
ones at the top. If you press on an app you
will be taken through to a screen where you

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.720
can do something called restrict background
data. This will stop the application doing

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.840
things like syncing with the app, downloading
updates and other things that require a data

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.890
connection. Instead it will do these things
when the app is being directly used by you

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.950
on when connected to Wi-Fi. Now this can have
unpredictable results so it's best to experiment

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.909
at first, but it is worth checking out as
some apps do a lot sneaky stuff without you

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.350
realising.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:59.060
If you want to take a more extreme approach
you can restrict background data on all you

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.880
applications on your device by pressing the
three dots in the top right of the screen

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.340
and selecting Restrict background data. If
you do this, however, be prepared for some

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.900
interesting experiences.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.300
You are almost certainly going to end up with
a lot of apps on your phone and each once

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.450
constantly gets updated and that requires
new downloads from the Googleplay Store on

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.480
a frequent basis that are done automatically.
You can stop this from occurring on your cellular

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.580
connection however. To do this, go to the
Google Play Store app and then swipe from

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.291
the left side of the screen. Choose settings
and then the Auto-update apps options. Make

00:02:38.291 --> 00:02:43.370
sure this is set to Auto-uodate apps over
Wi-Fi only.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.940
If there is definitely one thing you want
to avoid that's data roaming charges where

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.510
your cellular connection will attempt to find
alternative sources for data when your usual

00:02:52.510 --> 00:03:01.720
one is not available. This can cost a fortune.
So to make sure it's turned off go to the

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:06.800
data usage screen, press the three dots in
the top right hand corner and choose mobile

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:11.599
networks. Make sure you toggle data roaming
off.

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.310
If you use Youtube quite a lot on your cellular
network that can use a lot of data so to limit

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.370
how much it uses, go to the Youtube app and
press the three dots in the top right hand

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.550
corner of the screen and then choose settings.
Next, select general and then make sure Limit

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.530
mobile data usage is ticked so that it doesn't
stream video in HD.

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.330
If you are also a Youtuber and create your
own videos you can set the upload option to

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:43.739
only upload vidoes when you are connecting
to Wi-Fi.

00:03:43.739 --> 00:03:49.019
If you use Google+ as a social media platform
there are a few tweaks you can make to it

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:54.660
to conserve data. As usual it's those three
dots in the top right that will help you out.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.050
The first and most obvious option is conserve
data usage that you can check for low quality

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.050
images.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:06.519
The second is auto-backup. The most ideal
situation would be to have this off completely,

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:11.280
but if you do want it on, in the backup settings
you can ensure that backing up photos and

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:16.959
videos only takes place when you are connected
to WIFI and that it doesn't backup when and

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.350
if you are roaming on a data network.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.400
A lot of applications require accounts such
as Facebook, Twitter, Gmail, games and productivity

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.970
apps like calendars and note taking. That
means your phone is constantly using data

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.990
to make sure these accounts are in sync. You
can turn off auto syncing by going to settings

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.880
and then accounts. If you press the three
dots in the top right hand corner you will

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.830
see an auto-sync data option.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.370
Turning this off will save you a lot of data
but you will lose a lot of benefits such as

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:52.110
no notifications for social media and emails
and anything else really. You will have to

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:57.590
manually sync everything which is a pain so
I advise only using this option if you are

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:26.960
really short on data allowance.
