in this video

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.389
we will show one or more of these icons

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.180

your first step is to remove the top
panel screws

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.369
and set the panel aside

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:34.500
next depress the tabs on the control
panel

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.360
and pull it off

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.410
disconnect the wire harness

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.430
remove the screws to release the
circuit board bracket

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.560
remove the control bracket screws

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.740

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.070
now remove the screws located at the
base of the dryer

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.370
pull the lower panel out and then down
to detach

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.990
reach into the lower cabinet to
disconnect the door switch and moisture

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.990
sensor wire harnesses

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.229
remove the screws at the bottom

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:21.510

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.050
remove the mounting screws located
inside the door

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:30.580
and pull the panel off

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.320
remove the lower bulkhead mounting
screws

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.250
and loosen the upper screws

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.960
remove the mounting screws from the
blower housing

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.610
lift the bulkhead off the upper mounting
screws and set it aside

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.490

the pulley to release the tension and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.030
unthreading the belt from the pulley and motor
shaft

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:58.690

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.040
if it's still intact remove the old
seal

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.880
and clean up excess residue

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.890
prepare the new felt seal for
installation by first applying the high

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.230

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:16.019
reattach the front panel by lining it up
on the cabinet

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.689

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:57.719
reinstall the control panel bracket

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:04.009
reattach the circuit board bracket

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:09.510
reconnect the control panel's wire
harness

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:13.809
and snap the panel back into place

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:18.349
replace the top panel

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:22.979
secure it with the screws

00:04:22.979 --> 00:04:25.059

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:26.599
to make sure it's functioning properly
