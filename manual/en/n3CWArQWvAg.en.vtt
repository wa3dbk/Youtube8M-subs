00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:05.070
As a first-time competitor, Stanford seeks
to bring its innovative spirit to the homebuilding

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:06.070
industry.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.190
By providing sustainability at the push of
a button, the Start.Home will reshape how

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:15.030
people interact with buildings, seamlessly
integrating engineering solutions with intelligent

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.030
design.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:21.970
The Start.Home is built around a core that
makes sustainability simple, elegant, and

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:22.970
affordable.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.510
Imagine purchasing a product which has been
designed from the inside out to be customizable

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.160
and energy-efficient -- enclosed in a beautiful,
sleek shell, and delivered ready to start

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.640
being net-zero from day one.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.479
The house you build around it, therefore,
is free to reflect your personal lifestyle.

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:44.059
For the competition, Stanford has designed
a home for a young couple from Palo Alto,

00:00:44.059 --> 00:00:45.059
CA.

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.680
They have designed their home to capture the
spirit of innovation which they bring to their

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.519
careers in the Silicon Valley, while also
being a place for social gatherings, relaxation,

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:54.519
and starting a family.

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:58.890
It’s the start of a new sustainable chapter
in their lives.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.370
The core nestles into the face of the home,
and a mechanical shed can be accessed from

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.420
the front garden.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.020
Through the front door, we can take off our
shoes, hang our coat, and check-in on the

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.440
welcome panel to see how much energy we’ve
produced during the day, and set the core

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.250
to eco-friendly mode for the next hour.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.090
This side of the home is the living room,
with comfortable couches and an entertainment

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.320
center that is popular with guests.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.650
The living room, kitchen, and office at the
end are part of one large open space which

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.150
receives shaded views from the south and natural
daylight from the northern clerestory.

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.450
When windows on both sides are opened we can
get a natural California breeze all day.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.369
This face of the core features the kitchen
counter and appliances.

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.250
The flexible kitchen island and dining table
is a perfect place for cooking, eating together

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.939
with friends and family, or just hanging out.

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:49.031
We round the corner to the more private areas
of the home.

00:01:49.031 --> 00:01:54.109
The inside of the core features a laundry
closet and a bathroom lit with natural daylight.

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:58.060
The master bedroom is a more intimate space
that is perfect for a quiet getaway as the

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.079
day comes to an end.

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:03.131
More bedroom modules can be easily added to
the Start.Home as the family grows.

00:02:03.131 --> 00:02:07.750
Various elements of the great room can be
easily configured depending on whether we’re

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.980
having a dinner party or a movie night, but
the most flexible space of all is the office.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:19.200
This space has been designed to maximize creativity
and productivity when working from home.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.830
It’s the perfect space for arts &amp; crafts,
a group hobby, or even the next big startup.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.580
Doors to the backyard deck mean that we’re
always connected to nature.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.000
The greywater/rainwater irrigated planters
are great for home gardening, and the large

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.030
sliding doors even let us have an outdoor
picnic.

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.362
From the very beginning the Start.Home was
designed around the core principles of simplicity,

00:02:37.362 --> 00:02:42.200
flexibility, and elegance, and it has never
been easier to create a more comfortable,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.640
sustainable home.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.930
We no longer have to be experts to lead more
environmentally-conscious lives.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:52.180
If the core were available on the market today,
what kind of home would you create?

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.490
There’s no better time to start than now.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.750
Start.Home.
