00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
2 days ago I started doing fight caves

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.100
Because I was going for the new jad pet

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.120
and it was very easy

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.900
like I was surprised how easy the fight caves were in old school

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.760
I was like man "in Runescape 3 it's actually harder to do it"

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.260
but that was becasue

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.680
it was glitched out

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.120
the position of monsters

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:21.100
would never change

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.660
so if 180

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.320
you know the level 180 spawns in this position

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.080
it is not going to change

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.300
so you can easily predict where

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.380
someones going to spawn

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.020
and you can even afk

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.940
one time I tired to go like for the fastest time

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.280
and it was 35 minutes I think

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.420
after that I did not even try

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.360
I was afking the whole time

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.220
and if you afk it was uhh

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.280
like 41 minutes maybe

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.700
just by afking

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.700
I'm not talking about fully afk-able

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.580
because the way I said this

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.460
was like " yeah you just go in and you  just go to sleep"

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:56.640
no it wasn't like that

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.020
but it was like 95% of afking

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.140
very nice, but uhh then they fixed it

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.240
after uhhh, after

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.020
12 capes that I got

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.140
there was a system update and they fixed the fight caves

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.420
yeah, they "fixed it"

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.500
and this is what happened what when I logged in after the update

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.200
I had a black screen

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.400
I couldn't see shit

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.320
I could only hear the sounds and the mini-map was also fucked up

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.380
like it shows uhh, that I'm standing in the middle

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.320
but no monsters are around me

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.280
even though I am getting attacked

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.940
so what happned is I went from

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.540
level or wave 50 to almost jad wave(62)

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.520
and only one monster was left to go

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.520
until jad

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.340
I had no brews

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:41.480
but I was really looking forward

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.360
to fight jad

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.240
without even seeing it

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.220
and I just died because I moved somewhere

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.220
and he meele'd me

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.620
and even though on the minimap you can see that I was far away

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.560
but apparently

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.460
even the minimap was glitched

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.780
and uh yeah I could not fight jad

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.760
and oh by the way the fight caves are

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.320
64 thousand ranging experince an hour

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.080
I was tracking my whole progress

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.800
for the whole day and this is what I got on average

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.780
by using a blow pipe

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:11.820
and addy darts

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.420
so unfortunately

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.160
I did not manage to get a pet

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:18.720
but what I did get

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.720
is umm let me just take them out

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.680
I did manage to get full inventory of fire capes

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.060
and you can go for another chance of

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.500
pet, if you sacrifice a fire cape to this guy

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.920
So I'm going to go and exchange

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:35.920
I have 28 try's

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.040
I'm gonna, like I don't have a fire cape in my bank now

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:40.940
because I only have 28

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.540
so if I sacrifice the whole inventory

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.520
I will have no fire cape, I'll have to do this umm

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:49.140
oh yeah you can sell

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.640
uhh

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:52.260
for 8 thousand Tok'Kol if you want to do that

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.640
yes I know I won't get my cape back

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.960
you're not lucky

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.720
oh man

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.640
I will never see the lucky sign I can already see this

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.260
It just kinda sucks that you have to go through a lot of dialog's

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.900
"you're not lucky"

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.100
*sigh*

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.820
alright.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.440
"you're not lucky"

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.060
I really hate seeing that line

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.060
when he says you not lucky

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.360
I really hate it

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:22.700
I have 1 cape to go

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.780
one last chance

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.900
and uhh

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.500
he's gonna say "you not lucky"

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:29.900
NOOO!

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:31.680
WHY?!?!

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:34.060
my capes are gone

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:39.920
Yeah I should of kept one cape just cause I have to do the fight caves to get it back

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:40.960
and it's gonna suck

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.400
I don't like this place anymore

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:46.220
after grinding it for 25 kills I think I'm done

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.520
uhh I had, uhh 3 capes

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:49.500
before

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.240
you know in my bank

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.060
and I have 25 TzTok-Jad

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.860
or TzzzTok-Jad

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.480
sucks

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.640
all of this work for nothing

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.940
like I don't have a single pet

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.660
in neither games

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.400
like I never had a pet

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.400
I'm talking about boss pet's you know not just

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.400
a cat or something

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.940
but uhh yeah

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:12.440
unfortunate
