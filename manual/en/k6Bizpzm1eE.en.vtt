00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
How's it going. Ando again from Sensei Ando.com.

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.560
So, the other night I took a really good
knee to the head and it gave me two things--

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.030
one, a splitting headache and two, the idea that it's time to make a video on

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.710
how to take a punch.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.199
Now, if you do a search on that topic
you'll find a bunch of good videos

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.439
already out there. They'll tell you to
keep your jaw shut,

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:22.769
keep your chin down, stay loose, and
always roll with that punch.

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.329
That's all exactly right. But what do you
do when you can't slip it and you can't roll?

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.740
What do you do when you actually take
the shot and get rocked? Today, I'm gonna

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.649
give you two training tips that will not
only help you take a punch,

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.549
they'll help you get back into the fight.
But first, here's my name in really big letters.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.620
Please remember, I am not a medical
professional.

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:53.129
I'm just a guy who's been clocked a lot. So,
take my advice and practice at your own risk.

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.869
Okay, so you get rocked. BAM. Tip number one is probably the best piece of advice

00:00:57.869 --> 00:00:59.850
I've ever gotten in the martial arts.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.809
Here it is. When you get hit, focus before
you quit.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:08.549
Let's say you take a kick right to the
face. "Hold it, hold it!"

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.549
Let's say someone jams their fingers right
into your eye. "Ow! Stop, stop!"

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.640
You see the problem there?

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.960
Look, life will not stop for you. Time
will not stop for you.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.280
Bad guys will not stop for you. When you
get rocked you've got to do something to

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.690
get your focus back.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:30.060
Take a breath. Take a step. Get back into
your stance. Throw a punch. Do something

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.959
to help you move through the moment
instead of trying to stop it.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.610
Once you get your focus back, then you
can stop. When I got kneed in the head

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:39.600
the other night,

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.709
my partner stopped himself. He's like, "Oh,
sorry, sorry." But I said no, it's okay, just

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:44.819
keep going. Keep going.

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.450
Now, I didn't go for 10 minutes, I just
went long enough to clear the cobwebs

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:51.119
and put myself back into a strong
position.

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.539
So, let me be clear. I'm not telling you
to ignore your pain or fear.

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.560
I'm telling you to control it. The next
time you get jammed in the eyes, you

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.800
break a finger, you tweak your knee, take an elbow in the face,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.040
don't freak out. Take a breath, protect
yourself, and get your focus back.

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.159
It may sound crazy, but the moment when
you get rocked or even injured,

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:14.489
that's the closest you're gonna get to
the feeling of a real fight. That makes

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:17.129
it the most valuable moment in all of
your training.

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:21.450
So, don't waste it. When you get rocked,
you get a glimpse at the real you.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.260
Who are you when you get hit? Are you a
quitter or are you a fighter?

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.220
Do you lose your mind or can you keep
your cool? Just know this-- if you are

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.900
training to quit and give up every time
you get rocked or hurt, you my friend, are

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.959
training a habit that's going to get you
killed in a real fight.

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:41.279
So, last time-- when you get hit, focus
before you quit.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.440
Tip number two: give yourself a trigger
word.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.049
You know how security dogs are trained to attack when they hear a secret code word?

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:52.230
One second they're lying there licking
themselves, then you say, "Sauerkraut!"

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.159
Suddenly, they turn into a killing
machine. Well, you can do the same thing.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.740
Not the the licking part, I meant just...
Moving on. When you get rocked, it's

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.200
easy to get lost in a fog of pain and
panic. If you want to survive, you've got to

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.650
clear those clouds as fast as possible.
And repeating a trigger word?

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.569
Well, that's one thing that works for me.
When I get rocked, I used to say, "Go, go, go."

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.140
And then I started using, "Fight, fight,
fight." It doesn't really matter what you

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.200
pick. You can say Shazam.

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.420
You can say Inuk Chuk. You could say, "Die, mother%$#! Die!"

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:28.569
it doesn't matter. Just pick something
that fires you up.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.549
Make it your mantra. Make it your battle
cry. Now, this is important stuff because

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:35.879
even though you may start the fight with a
lot of confidence and bravado, but

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:40.109
once you take a shot, the voices in your
head can easily start turning on you.

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:43.530
You're going to hear them shouting,
"Ow! Run! Hide! Mommy!"

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:50.300
You can't let that happen. Remember this--
you can't control a fight, if you can't control your mind.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:53.879
So, give your mind something to focus on.

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.950
One word is all it takes to get you back into the fight. Of course, there's a life lesson here.

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:01.260
We all take hits every day.

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:05.400
Your girlfriend's cheating on you. BAM!
Your business partner's stealing from you. POW!

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.769
You're stuck in a traffic jam.

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.269
You lost your job. A friend dies. You slam
your fingers in a car door.

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.690
There's no more whipped cream at
Starbucks. Every day, all day, you are

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.579
taking hits big and small.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:22.119
Don't forget that each hit you take is a
chance to strengthen your fighting spirit.

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.979
Don't let anything or anyone take away
your balance.

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:30.150
Don't let anything or anyone take away
your breath. And don't let anything or

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.370
anyone make you tense up, curl up, or give up. No matter what happens out there,

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:36.389
when you get rocked,

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:39.750
face it, take a breath, assess the
situation,

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.490
make a decision, take action, and follow
through.

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:48.300
No joke-- the most important habit that
you can develop is to control your mind.

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.889
When you take a hit,

00:04:49.889 --> 00:04:54.300
train yourself to keep breathing, keep
thinking, and keep moving.

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.940
That's not just a secret to winning a
fight, that's the secret to winning at life.

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:02.020
Okay, did you pick out a trigger word yet?

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.160
You haven't? Do that right now. Give
yourself a trigger word. Put it into your

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.530
practice and then let me know how it
goes.

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:12.250
