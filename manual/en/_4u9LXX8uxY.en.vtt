00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.540
The schoolyard here isn't made of stone. 
The classrooms don't have walls and doors and don't smell musty.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:10.350
The pupils get lessons in this three-storey building 
made of bamboo. It's 100% environmentally-friendly.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.400
Besides the regular courses, they learn how to interact with nature. 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.110
There aren't many schools as open 
and environmentally aware as this one. 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.470
I think it's important for children to be aware of nature at a very young age. 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.250
-How do you teach them environmental awareness? 
Everything is very hands on.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.420
We have natural materials. 
We're always at one with the environment. 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:42.040
There are no doors or walls in our classrooms. 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.670
The Green School wants to become entirely self-sustainable.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.620
This river, for instance, will soon be harnessed 
to generate electricity. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.740
The pupils plant pawpaw trees, 
cassava and rice. 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.480
The Green School in Bali was built three years ago 
by a couple who made their fortune in jewelry. 

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.480
They want to realise their dreams.

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.570
I enjoy it. It's interesting to be in a place 
that's completely different from what I'm used to. 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.760
It's new. 
-What do you learn about the environment? 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.260
How to protect nature. 
What's happening on planet Earth. 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.480
And how we can help. 
-Is it better than a Dutch school?

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:48.150
It's just as nice. 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.430
But the school isn't just about idealism.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.780
It's not cheap. A year's tuition at the Green School 
costs between 6 and 12-thousand dollars.
