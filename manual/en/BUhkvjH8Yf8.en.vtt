00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.030
And that, folks, is the end of our series
exploring the Kimberley -- along the Gibb

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:36.539
River Road and beyond.

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.640
We’ve had quite an adventure this time around.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.399
Starting from the Eastern edge of the Kimberley,
we visited some amazing places.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:46.899
The needles at Cape Dommet.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:48.670
Pretty impressive piece of rock.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.579
The Pentecost river, fishing for barra...

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:52.620
I'm pumped.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.660
...and catfish.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:55.770
And being defeated by the Carson River track.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.120
I think we've met our match on that one.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.960
But then we finally made it to the Berkeley
River, and how great was that?

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.159
We saw King George Falls from the air.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.930
And bashed through the track up to Pago Mission.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.350
And of course, our time spent fishing around
Beauty Point.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.750
That's a horse!

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.100
And the Drysdale River gave us some of the
best barra fishing of the trip.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:21.350
That is an absolutely awesome barra.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.180
That was where we met up with Don and his
mate, Coddly.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.479
That would be that fish.

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.320
&gt; Did he get you?

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.320
Yeah!

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.320
&gt; That's the fish!

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.840
We got bogged at Honeymoon beach, and made
it out to the Admiralty gulf...

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:33.840
Australian customs.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.540
Because our boat's aluminium, they don't bother
with us.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.020
...where we fought off the sharks at Long
Reef.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.430
Get away!

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:49.330
The Munja track gave us some major headaches,
but it was worth it to get to Walcott Inlet.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:53.560
And here on the Dampier Peninsula we fished
Pender Bay and King Sound.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.549
Now we’ve made it all the way to Broome
at the Kimberley’s Western edge.

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.409
And we’re glad to have had you with us.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.259
Well, guys, that’s the series.

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:07.050
The Gibb River Road and beyond.

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:08.050
We survived.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:09.299
Only just, mate.

00:02:09.299 --> 00:02:10.299
Only just.

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.230
Hey, I see you’re still alive.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.390
And I’ve got my arms and legs.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:15.720
Mate, The Kimberley.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.360
It is absolutely breathtaking place.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:21.280
And I think we barely scratched the surface.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.560
Yeah, I think we’re gonna have to come back,
mate.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.560
Oh definitely.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:26.560
All 4 Adventure’s comin’ back.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.160
So we’ll see you guys next time somewhere
off the beaten track.
