00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:12.520
Sure, Alien Breed by Team17 may have been
a bare-faced attempt at re-imagining the Aliens

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.560
franchise as a top-down shooter, but if you
never had a chance to experience the classic

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.670
on an Amiga, you haven't lived.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.740
That last statement may be hyperbolic (just
a tad), but players were subjected to claustrophobic

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:31.939
corridors, quick-moving aliens that continued
to appear seemingly out of nowhere and (best

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.560
of all) had to deal with severely limited
resources.

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.630
The sense of fear and tension was ahead of
its time, and as such, is ripe for re-releasing

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.030
in a modern setting.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:47.320
However, some tweaks must be made to accommodate
for mature gaming sensibilities; notably the

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.250
graphics have been given a Retina quality
polishing and the controls now feature the

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.780
dual-stick shooting freedom we've come to
know and (in some cases) love.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.440
Of course you can switch to 'classic' mode,
complete with the original visuals, soundtrack,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.449
audio and controls, but you can save that
for when you're after a harder challenge - as

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.200
it is you're going to need all the help you
can get.

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.720
This is, in-part, thanks to the way in which
each level plays with a gamer's head - turning

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.071
expectations against them and forcing a player
to make decisions such as 'do I really need

00:01:16.071 --> 00:01:20.170
to get through that door or will I need it
to survive the final run to the exit?'.

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:24.520
Keys, ammunition, credits and even 'health'
are in short supply, dotted around the map

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:28.890
behind closed doors or protected by hordes
of enemies willing to soak up your precious

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.050
ammunition.

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:34.030
Thankfully judicious use of your resources
will keep you alive, but beware the instant-kill

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:37.510
pits and doors waiting to suck up those spare
lives.

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:42.300
Team17's re-release features not only the
original Alien Breed, but the subsequent 'Special

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.120
Edition' complete with added levels and new
version of the weapons you may have already

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:47.120
unlocked.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.630
Credits, lives, ammunition and keys all carry
on between these modes, so it's in your interest

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.909
to start off with the brand-new Convergence
and work your way up to the epic 'Special

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:56.909
Edition'.

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.440
Pulling off the rose-tinted glasses for a
moment, there are a few issues that can't

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.440
be ignored.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.670
For starters, the twin-stick controls destroy
the challenge of the game - being able to

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.090
run-and-gun makes it so much easier to deal
with bad situations instead of being forced

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.019
to stand your ground in the classic mode.

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.879
Also, while the special effects weren't exactly
amazing in the original, the repetitive squawking

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.489
of the aliens as they die in the updated version
isn't much better.

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:23.870
Lastly, should you manage to waste your resources
your only options are either to start fresh

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.310
and try to be more conservative, or cough
up money to purchase credits via IAP.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.129
Ultimately, these are only quibbles, but worthy
of fixing in future updates.

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:38.140
Whether you're a returning fan or an iOS gamer
after a top-down shooter that isn't afraid

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:49.480
to stack the odds against you, Alien Breed
is definitely worth grabbing.
