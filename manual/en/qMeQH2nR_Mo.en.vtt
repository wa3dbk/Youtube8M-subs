[THEME MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.185
FELICIA: I'm here at the Third
Street Dance Studio with my

00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:20.230
friend, Kevin.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.020
KEVIN: Hello, Felicia.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:21.920
FELICIA: Hello.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.080
KEVIN: I see that you
have a poodle skirt.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.240
FELICIA: Yeah, where's
your poodle skirt?

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.970
KEVIN: I forgot it.

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.430
I know, I left it at home.

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:27.775
Next time.

00:00:27.775 --> 00:00:28.322
FELICIA: Or your 8-bit bow.

00:00:28.322 --> 00:00:29.130
KEVIN: Or the 8-bit bow.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.770
I like your 8-bit bow, too.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:31.165
FELICIA: Yay.

00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:31.560
KEVIN: Yay.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.630
We're robots.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.130
FELICIA: OK.

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.150
KEVIN: We're going
to go dance.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:36.424
FELICIA: So this is Larisa,
and she's going to be our

00:00:36.424 --> 00:00:37.720
swing instructor today.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.110
So is there a potential
to be injured here?

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:40.910
Is Kevin going to injure me?

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:42.120
LARISA: No, of course not.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.480
So let's start with our feet
about shoulder width apart.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:45.860
FELICIA: I have a problem with
my rights and my lefts.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:47.440
I'm just going to establish
that right now.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.710
I just have to go like
this in my head.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.640
LARISA: But Kevin's going
to take care of you.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.420
KEVIN: I'll take care of you.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:53.460
FELICIA: Is this a
chauvinist dance?

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:54.150
Because--

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.570
LARISA: You know, it is the one
place in the world that he

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.560
is allowed to be in control.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.170
So--

00:00:59.170 --> 00:00:59.986
KEVIN: Whoa.

00:00:59.986 --> 00:01:00.372
LARISA: But this is
a good thing.

00:01:00.372 --> 00:01:01.190
This is a good thing.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.450
We get to relax.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.920
KEVIN: Whoa, power position
right now.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:04.900
FELICIA: I don't know
if I like this.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.390
Can I learn the man part?

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.097
KEVIN: She can't be a man.

00:01:06.097 --> 00:01:07.840
She has a poodle skirt on.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.270
LARISA: I think you'll find the
submission actually kind

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:11.394
of a good thing.

00:01:11.394 --> 00:01:12.302
I know that sounds weird.

00:01:12.302 --> 00:01:12.756
FELICIA: What the hell?

00:01:12.756 --> 00:01:13.210
KEVIN: Just do it.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:16.050
FELICIA: That is not going to
ever earn you a lady vagina.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.660
LARISA: OK.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.850
Slow, slow, a quick, quick,
slow, slow, quick, quick.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.040
How easy, right?

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.230
KEVIN: How easy.

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.765
LARISA: Whoa.

00:01:25.765 --> 00:01:26.715
KEVIN: Wait--

00:01:26.715 --> 00:01:27.665
FELICIA: He did it wrong!

00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:29.090
He did it wrong!

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.515
LARISA: No finger
pointing here!

00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:31.465
KEVIN: No finger
pointing here!

00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:32.875
We're a team, and if
she doesn't get

00:01:32.875 --> 00:01:34.210
it then I push her.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.190
LARISA: Well, yeah, actually.

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.660
FELICIA: What?

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.498
Wait, what?

00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:37.976
KEVIN: We're rotating.

00:01:37.976 --> 00:01:40.844
FELICIA: I have a tendency
to lead.

00:01:40.844 --> 00:01:41.800
KEVIN: Too bad.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.110
FELICIA: I need you to submit.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.048
KEVIN: Too bad, you're
submitting right now.

00:01:45.048 --> 00:01:46.530
FELICIA: I'm not submitting!

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.810
KEVIN: Slow!

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.810
Ah!

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.810
No, don't hurt me.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.310
LARISA: Should we be switching
roles now?

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.310
KEVIN: I am the man!

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:56.310
FELICIA: Ow!

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.982
LARISA: So don't forget we're
in a swing class, hence the

00:01:58.982 --> 00:02:00.145
poodle skirt.

00:02:00.145 --> 00:02:02.470
So we're back to a
closed position.

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:03.410
KEVIN: Hey, let me--

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.320
I'll make sure she does--

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:07.180
FELICIA: I don't think
by myself.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.758
I'm a submissive soda
can, Kevin.

00:02:09.758 --> 00:02:11.377
LARISA: And then back with
the left foot and

00:02:11.377 --> 00:02:12.060
tap with the right.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.350
This routine--

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:13.636
FELICIA: Oh, this is
the Charleston.

00:02:13.636 --> 00:02:14.950
My mom taught me this.

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.452
LARISA: And a forward, forward,
and kick and back and

00:02:20.452 --> 00:02:23.650
tap, and forward and kick
and back and tap.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.150
Good.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.060
So now--

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.790
KEVIN: What just happened?

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.160
FELICIA: I got excited!

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.460
LARISA: And a slow, slow--

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.053
FELICIA: Oh, I was
waiting for you!

00:02:33.053 --> 00:02:34.442
KEVIN: What are you doing?

00:02:34.442 --> 00:02:35.831
Let me do this!

00:02:35.831 --> 00:02:37.683
FELICIA: This is me at 90.

00:02:37.683 --> 00:02:38.880
LARISA: So I'm just going
to count for you.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:39.670
Here we go.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:40.778
So ready--

00:02:40.778 --> 00:02:41.594
He's going to--

00:02:41.594 --> 00:02:43.275
KEVIN: Hey I didn't turn you!

00:02:43.275 --> 00:02:43.760
FELICIA: [BEEP]

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.853
LARISA: I'm going to show you
what to do, and then I'm going

00:02:45.853 --> 00:02:48.660
to tell you what the name
of this is after.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.140
So you want to be flat as a
board and go all the way down.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.760
You're right knee's bent.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:54.250
FELICIA: What?

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.720
Like that?

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.210
LARISA: Here.

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.910
FELICIA: I don't trust
this at all.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.700
Like basically like--

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:59.200
LARISA: Whoa!

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:00.700
Whoa!

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.405
And pull her up.

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:06.866
FELICIA: I dropped my butt.

00:03:06.866 --> 00:03:07.108
LARISA: Over!

00:03:07.108 --> 00:03:07.838
Over over!

00:03:07.838 --> 00:03:08.324
KEVIN: I forgot to step.

00:03:08.324 --> 00:03:10.754
LARISA: Ah!

00:03:10.754 --> 00:03:12.212
I'll help you up.

00:03:12.212 --> 00:03:12.698
FELICIA: Thank you!

00:03:12.698 --> 00:03:15.128
He's like screw her!

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:17.810
LARISA: Step over with your left
leg, pull her up on the

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:18.480
other side.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.470
Pop.

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.965
KEVIN: Whoa

00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:22.940
LARISA: Done!

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.290
Now we tell you the
name of it.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:25.010
FELICIA: What is it called?

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.910
LARISA: Death drop.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.600
KEVIN: Death drop!

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.870
LARISA: So are you guys
ready for your finale?

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.170
FELICIA: Yes.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.730
KEVIN: Yes.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.430
LARISA: Maybe we can kind of
keep Kevin just the cool guy.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:37.610
FELICIA: Here we go.

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.800
Hey cool man.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.080
KEVIN: Hey, doll.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:04:24.275
[SWING MUSIC PLAYING]

00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:25.840
LARISA: That was pretty good.

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:27.632
FELICIA: Thank you very much.

00:04:27.632 --> 00:04:29.759
That was like the funnest
thing I have

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:30.087
done in quite a while.

00:04:30.087 --> 00:04:31.215
KEVIN: That's the
biggest workout

00:04:31.215 --> 00:04:31.540
I've gotten in a while.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.770
FELICIA: It was a learning
lesson to let the man lead.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:34.616
KEVIN: I know.

00:04:34.616 --> 00:04:35.260
Did you learn something
from that?

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.100
FELICIA: I don't think it
transfers to real life at all.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.350
So OK, bye.
