[BACKGROUND NOISES]

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.640
Welcome to DIYTryin.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.565
Bring something new.

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:16.470
I'm Patrick Norton.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.390
And I'm Michael Hand.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.930
And we need more coffee.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.560
This is your fault, Tested.com.

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.190
3 a.m., the October
cast, Will Hansby,

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:24.190
a tube filled with the
black blood of the earth.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:25.860
It is potent, but smooth.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.820
It is the ultimate in
cold-brewing excess,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:29.900
vacuum-extracted--
go to Funranium Labs

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.729
to learn more about the
world's most dangerous coffee.

00:00:32.729 --> 00:00:33.420
Coffee.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:33.545
Coffee.

00:00:33.545 --> 00:00:34.040
Got it.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.375
I had no idea what you
were talking about.

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:35.820
Not spiders.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.016
No.

00:00:36.016 --> 00:00:36.213
No.

00:00:36.213 --> 00:00:36.606
No.

00:00:36.606 --> 00:00:37.106
Coffee.

00:00:37.106 --> 00:00:38.180
It's amazing stuff.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.763
Here, though, we're
going to teach you

00:00:39.763 --> 00:00:41.462
cold brewing,
steeping, and fusing.

00:00:41.462 --> 00:00:42.920
It doesn't matter
what you call it.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.544
It basically means
letting cold grounds

00:00:44.544 --> 00:00:46.330
sit in cold water for hours.

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:49.310
So I had no idea this was
an actual thing that people

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:51.960
did until I found, on
Amazon, they sell, like,

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.260
concentrated coffee syrup--

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.760
Mm-hmm.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.310
-- basically.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:56.060
And I was like, oh,
we should try this.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.780
And then, you were like,
why don't we just make it?

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:00.120
Yeah.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.500
This is pretty easy, actually.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.670
And I've got to say, Will was
the one who basically told me

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:05.075
how easy it was,
and I realized I

00:01:05.075 --> 00:01:07.200
had been seeing people
make cold brew for years

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.700
around cafes and restaurants.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.770
It eliminates most of
the acids and bitterness.

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.610
It's a lot smoother,
some people call sweeter.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.840
The aroma and flavor
are not quite as intense

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:16.980
as hot brewed coffee.

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.270
So this doesn't have to be
just for ice coffee, right?

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.450
No.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.408
A lot of people actually
will either heat it up

00:01:21.408 --> 00:01:22.730
or add hot water to it.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:23.230
OK.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:25.590
So there are a lot of fancy
ways of making cold grew,

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:28.160
but pretty much every
barista or chef I've ever

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.760
seen dumps grounds into a glass
container or a five-gallon food

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:33.480
service bucket of
cold water, then let's

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.770
it sit for 12 hours or 18
hours or 24 hours of 72 hours

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.840
or just-- whatever their
crazy ass internal recipe says

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.630
it should be.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:46.790
This is not orthodox, but
we're not an orthodox show.

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.020
So now that it's mixed,
we just let it sit, right?

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.520
Yeah.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.230
For the next day
or two or three.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:53.740
And then, you filter
the grounds out.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.310
I'm using a Melitta, designed
to pour water straight in

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.780
or pour over straight
into a thermos bottle.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.770
People, for cold brew,
they use toddy systems,

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:03.103
they use French presses, they
use these weird overpriced

00:02:03.103 --> 00:02:05.317
creations for making
cold brew-- sold

00:02:05.317 --> 00:02:07.150
at the kind of foodie
shops that sell vegan.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.313
Turnip twaddlers!

00:02:08.313 --> 00:02:10.729
But most pros I've seen just
use a wide-mouthed container.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:13.450
I saw a cool thing where
someone took an AeroPress

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:15.500
and then they cut the
top off of a bottle--

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.000
Mm-hmm.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.208
-- or the bottom of a bottle.

00:02:17.208 --> 00:02:19.490
And they put a
hole into the thing

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:21.110
so that it would just drip down.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.850
So, like, after four hours,
the water dripped out.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.670
And then, it was ready to go.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.110
Most cold brew recipes
call for the medium roast

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.890
coffee of your choice
and around a 5-to-1 water

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:33.655
to grounds ratio.

00:02:33.655 --> 00:02:34.980
The quality of the
coffee, the grind,

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:36.530
the ratio of grounds
to water, the time

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.321
it steeps, whether or
not you stir or shake

00:02:38.321 --> 00:02:40.385
the grounds in all
influence the final product,

00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:42.760
including whether or not you
keep a power cyrstal near it

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.440
at all times.

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.930
There's a lot of variables here.

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:45.430
Yeah.

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.180
And most of them really
don't change much.

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.270
Most recipes say coarse grind.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.380
Fine grind?

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:51.590
I like to fine grind better.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.830
It was stronger, at least.

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.920
I guess if you're, like,
doing double the amount that

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:58.510
is on the package, then it
probably doesn't matter.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:02:59.600
And then, you're going
to be stuck with, like,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.471
a syrup anyway.

00:03:00.471 --> 00:03:00.970
Yeah.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.730
I mean, I think the
really biggest impact

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.960
is how long it
steeps up to a point.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.760
Mmm.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:07.914
I'm leaning towards 24
hours, this month's.

00:03:07.914 --> 00:03:09.330
This batch has
only gone 12 hours,

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.650
so it's going to be a tad
weaker than it could be.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.810
I think we should
drain the rest of this

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.715
so that we can share it
with the studio crew.

00:03:16.715 --> 00:03:17.590
I think you're right.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.180
Yeah!

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:20.940
Watching coffee filters.

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.620
Like watching grass grow.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:23.155
Hmm.

00:03:23.155 --> 00:03:24.655
Well, while you're
waiting for this,

00:03:24.655 --> 00:03:26.904

Go to lynda.com/DIY.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.140
You could learn
something new instead

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.667
of watching coffee filter out.

00:03:32.667 --> 00:03:33.792
That would be a good thing.

00:03:33.792 --> 00:03:35.310
Did you finish that
Photoshop you drew up?

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.920
I did.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:38.127
And I feel much more
comfortable because I

00:03:38.127 --> 00:03:39.460
have to make the thumbnails now.

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.960
Ooh.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.580
That's why they're
just screenshots.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.110
And I am actually
watching coffee filter.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:55.320
It's just like watching
paint dry, but better.

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.240
So this is pretty
good just as-is.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.740
Yeah.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.260
I think it's because we only
used two tablespoons per cup.

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.650
A lot of recipes tell you
that you should experiment

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:04.620
with one to three
mixes of concentrate

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:05.840
to cold or hot water.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.580
I don't if it's
either my origins

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.950
in bonus cups and
Jersey diner coffee,

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.370
but maybe we just
didn't use enough coffee

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.593
to make it the scary
stuff that we read about.

00:04:15.593 --> 00:04:17.180
I've tried some
that-- it literally

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.350
doubles the amount of coffee
that you put in there,

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.020
and that was a very,
like, almost syrupy.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.350
You've also experimented
with tea and cold brewing.

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:25.850
Yeah.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:27.750
So that was-- I'm
more of a tea-drinker.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:28.250
Mm-hmm.

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:30.390
And I use this,
like-- usually, it's

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.940
really acidic Irish
breakfast tea.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:36.030
And I just put, like,
five or six bags in there,

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.765
and then it tasted
completely different.

00:04:37.765 --> 00:04:39.311
It was almost, like, lemony--

00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:39.810
Oh, funny.

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.705
-- when you don't get
that flavor at all when

00:04:41.705 --> 00:04:42.580
it's actually brewed.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:44.190
It was pretty awesome.

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.515
Have you ever made sun tea?

00:04:45.515 --> 00:04:46.182
No, I haven't.

00:04:46.182 --> 00:04:47.515
We're going to need to fix that.

00:04:47.515 --> 00:04:48.015
OK.

00:04:48.015 --> 00:04:49.170
We want to hear from you.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.420
I'll say it again.

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:11.920
Yay!

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:12.420
Yay!

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.800
Coffee.

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.334
It's good.

00:05:21.334 --> 00:05:21.833
Wow.

00:05:21.833 --> 00:05:23.670
It's a lot better
than I thought.

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:28.430
Thank you.

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:30.138
You know, I get that
reaction really more

00:05:30.138 --> 00:05:32.290
than I expect on this show.
