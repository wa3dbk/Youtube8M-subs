Hey, all, Adam Small here from My Music MasterClass,
and I want to tell you about a music talent

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:26.020
contest that we're hosting. Featuring insane
prizes from Yamaha, Rode, Presonus, and more.

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:29.450
So if you're interested in winning these great
prizes, all you have to do is film yourself

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.220
either solo or with a group, in any style
you want, we don't discriminate. This is an

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:39.580
international competition. So, if you're great
at what you do, bring it on. Remember, this

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:45.300
is a talent contest, so you don't need $2,000
cameras or professional lighting to win this

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.940
thing. I mean, you can even record the whole
thing on a smart phone, if that's all you

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.420
have. And if you need some tips about how
to record quality video with limited resources,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.290
check out my blog at AdamSmallMusic.com. Once
you make a video that you're proud of, all

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:04.390
you have to do is upload it to youtube, and
then enter the URL of your video on our contest

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.200
page. And then just spread the word because
votes are what is going to get you into the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.249
finals. So this is how it's going to work.
The top 14 most voted videos will make it

00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:17.869
to the finals. Then our 7 acclaimed judges
are going to take over. They're going to pick

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:23.960
the 3 best videos out of that top 14, but
they're also going to pick 3 runners up out

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.329
of the entire entry pool. So there's more
than enough prizes to go around. Alright,

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:33.189
so here's some really important points about
the competition, so pay attention or you might

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.729
be disqualified. 1st. The video can only be
3 minutes max, so don't exceed that limit.

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.069
2nd. Your video has to be original to this
competition, so it can't be reposted from

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:48.529
anywhere else. 3rd. To ensure that your videos
are original to the competition, and that

00:01:48.529 --> 00:01:53.310
you are, in fact, who you say you are, you
must say the words "My Music MasterClass"

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.649
within the video. For instance ... Hey! moZus

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:04.719
MasterClass talent competition. And finally,
