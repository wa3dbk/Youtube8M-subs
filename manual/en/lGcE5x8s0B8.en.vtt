[MUSIC]

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:09.090
You've fired up the grill, set up the badminton
net, are those dark clouds on the horizon?

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.830
Don't check your phone, your nose knows!

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:20.960
[MUSIC]

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.550
Our noses can detect up to a trillion different
scents, and many of them are deeply tied to

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.220
our memories and our emotions. Like your grandma’s
house, your first dog, or . . . the smell

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:33.470
of rain.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:37.930
Storm winds carry an orchestra of separate
smells, but the earthy odor that precedes

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.790
a storm can be traced to three chemical sources.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.720
Before a thunderstorm, you’re probably smelling
ozone, which interestingly gets its name from

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.730
the Greek word meaning “to smell”. The
electrical charge of lightning high up in

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:55.620
approaching storm clouds splits oxygen gas
into separate atoms, some of those can reform

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.960
into ozone. It’s swept ahead of the advancing
storm by windy downdrafts, and down to your

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:02.800
nose level.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:08.230
As rain begins to fall, a new smell springs
from the soil: the pleasantly pungent perfume

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.340
we call “petrichor”. Petrichor gets half
its name from the ethereal essence that flowed

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:18.300
through the veins of Greek gods and half from
the stones of the Earth, which pretty much

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.870
captures both its science, and the powerful
feels I get when I smell it.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.150
When decomposed organic material is blown
airborne from dry soil, it lands on dirt or

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.680
rocks, where it’s joined by minerals and
the whole mixture is cooked into a magical

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.120
medley of molecules. Falling raindrops then
send those chemicals airborne right into your

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.210
nostalgic nostrils.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.540
When there’s no rain around, those same
chemicals remain in the soil, where they signal

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.570
plants to halt their roots from growing or
prevent seeds from sprouting when there’s

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:54.570
no water to drink. Petrichor: it’s for the
plant that’s tired of waiting . . . to germinate.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.880
Bacteria in the soil also contribute to petrichor
by releasing a chemical called geosmin, that's

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.740
the same compound that gives beets their earthy
flavor.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:08.759
There’s other purposes for petrichor besides
showering us with emotion. It thought to attract

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.420
camels to desert oases, who slurp up and transport
the soil bacteria across the sands. Petrichor

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.310
that’s washed into rivers and lakes also
seems to signal fish that it’s time to spawn.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.760
There’s nothing like a rainstorm to spark
a little romance, I guess.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.110
So next time you smell a summer storm a-coming,
take a minute to think about what that rock

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:33.120
over there is trying to tell you.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.870
Stay curious. And smell ya later.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:46.870
Why are sharks so scary? Bloodthirsty beasts
just waiting out there in the waves to feast

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:50.940
on human flesh. if only we could get rid of
these guys our vacations would be so much

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.130
safer, nothing to worry about while we're
surfing and frolicking out there in the ocean.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.900
Except that's not the case.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.410

Crimson Eleven Delight Petrichor

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:09.990
Whoa!
