00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.680
In this video weíre going to look at using
burnt-in timecode (BITC).

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.250
Now just to be clear, Iím talking about the
8-digit time reference for hours, minutes,

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:17.880
seconds and frames, which is superimposed
or 'burnt' into the video. Now, why would

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.489
you want the timecode burnt into the screen?
Well, there are two reasons why I use BITC.

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:28.119
Firstly, you might want to use it where your
video isn't ready for release yet. So, if

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:33.160
you're sending rough cuts with BITC it just
makes it very clear that the video isn't

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.609
ready for publishing.
My second reason for using BITC is for reference

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:42.129
on rough cuts where your client isn't sat
next to you during editing. You might be thinking

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:46.390
that most media players have a run-time display,
why not use that? Well, you could but I will

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.850
give you two quick reasons why you shouldn't.
Firstly, it's highly unlikely that the person

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.839
watching your video has a media player that
displays proper timecode that includes frames,

00:00:55.839 --> 00:01:00.120
and seeing as video is made of frames, we
need to see them, especially if it's a fast

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.960
paced edit. Secondly, the media player might
not have run-time displayed by default, or

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.610
it might start in full-screen mode, especially
if it's a native Windows 8 app.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.390
Now let's look at how it's done. Itís very
simple, but it is something I've been asked

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:16.900
many times.
Iíve got this project ready in Premiere Pro

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.750
CC and I've got some nice stock footage from
Pond5.com. You can use the Timecode on a per

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.390
clip basis, but here I'm just looking at
getting the timecode from the sequence across

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.420
the whole video. So I'm going to start off
by dragging a box around these three clips,

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.220
and I'm going to hit the 'full stop' key
or the period key if youíre American. As

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.100
you can see we've got his clip here of a
business man looking for his hotel, some wheat

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.320
and a clock. So the first thing I'm going
to do is right-click in the bin and choose

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:54.720
&gt; New Item, then &gt; Transparent Video.
The default settings are going to do, so we

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.950
click OK. Then we drag the transparent video
to the top layer in our sequence so that the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.880
timecode sits on top of everything else. Drag
it out to the duration of the sequence and

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.140
as you would expect there is no change there
because it's transparent video.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:16.610
We want to get the timecode onto this transparent
video. So head over to &gt; Effects &gt; Video effects

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:22.790
&gt; Video, and thereís the Timecode. So we
drag that over to the transparent video; and

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:28.690
you can see it appears over here. So now we
want to go over to the Effect Controls. Now,

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.300
hereís the Timecode Settings. You can see
we've got this little indicator here and

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.980
that's for fields and seeing as our timeline
is progressive, we donít need that so I'm

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.980
going to turn off the Field Symbol. And the
next thing, you see that there's a semi-transparent

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.180
box around the timecode, now that looks OK
on that clip, but if you go over to something

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.760
that's got a white background, it's not
quite as visible, so I'm going to change

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.760
the opacity on that from 40% to 60%, just
to make it a little bit clearer.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.690
Now the next thing I want to change, I want
to make it a bit smaller because it's a bit

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.860
obtrusive stuck right in the middle there.
So the default is 15%, I'm going to change

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:17.270
that to 8. So there we go, that's much more
like it. Now I want to move it over into the

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:23.260
corner so it's even less obtrusive, so I'm
going to use the slider to get that over to

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.440
there, and move it down a little bit; and
that is fine.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.580
If we go to the beginning of the timeline,
you'll see that our timecode is all zeroes

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:39.450
there as it should be, but up here it says
one hour; let's see what's going on there.

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:44.300
If you come to the effect controls, you'll
see that there's a setting called Timecode

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.700
Source, at the moment that's set to Media,
we need to put that on Regenerate, and you'll

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:56.700
see that, that now matches the timecode over
here. That is what we want. That represents

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:04.500
the timecode in our sequence, we're now ready
to export and send our draft edit off to the

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.700
client.
