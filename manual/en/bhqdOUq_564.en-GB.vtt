00:12
COMM: Elephant at Perth Zoo have been showing

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.260
their artistic side, and are even selling
their work with some large paintings fetching

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:21.270
sums of over one thousand Australian dollars.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:24.640
00:22
COMM: Painting is just one of the activities

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:28.850
the elephants take part in to keep them mentally
and physically stimulated.

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:36.070
00:31
COMM: First, some exercise.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:43.969
00:38
COMM: Then a bit of a kick about.

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:56.559
00:55
COMM: Next, it's time to get clean.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:02.230
01:02
KEEPER: Good girl.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:11.950
01:10
COMM: But after bath time, the elephants are

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.930
picking up a very different type of brush.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.230
01:17
COMM: 58-year-old Asian elephant Trisha is

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:24.180
the matriarch of Perth Zoo. And something
of a local celebrity.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:30.140
01:28
COMM: She loves painting and either uses a

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.420
brush, or blows the paint out of her truck
as Australian TV presenter David Whitehill

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.420
discovered.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.420
01:38
DAVID: Wonderful.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.930
01:39
COMM: According to the zoo, elephants are

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:44.590
natural artists and have been known to draw
in the dirt with sticks.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.360
01:47
COMM: If you want to get your hands on an

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.740
elephant original, the artwork is available
to buy, and pieces can cost from forty five

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.840
Australian dollars to well over a thousand,
depending on size.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.280
01:59
COMM: However, one hundred percent of the

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:17.230
funds raised from the sale of the paintings
goes to help threatened species in the wild.
