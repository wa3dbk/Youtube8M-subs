[Elliott Hundley: Evoking Emotions]

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.260
I'm staging imaginary operas.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.900
One of the things I find appealing about opera
is it's kind of a ludicrous proposition.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.900
[LAUGHS]

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.640
It's a convention that we all read as normal,
but it's a funny convention.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.789
I like how artificial it is.

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:48.420
But being so artificial, it definitely strives
to evoke strong emotions.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.500
The music is the vehicle for the intensity
of the emotion,

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.100
and that's the priority, I think.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.100
That's definitely my goal--

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:11.130
creating some sort of emotional response from
the work that I make. Absolutely.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.320
During the day, I spend my time collecting
all of this stuff.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.980
And that I can do with help.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.280
It's easier to work when I'm by myself,

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:38.469
when it’s quiet.

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:43.369
And there's also no time limit, you know,
when you work in the evening.

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:51.400
Collage has been one of the most relevant
forms of art making.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.679
I think it's resonant because it is made of
the stuff that we see every day.

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:59.759
So it's familiar. It reflects our reality.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.640
And it's self-evident.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.860
There's no esoteric technique to make a collage.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.680
Because some of my subjects or the things
that I'm trying to make

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.480
are maybe trying to get at something mysterious
or something unknown

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.500
or something emotional,

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.629
I think what's appealing to me about collage
is the fact that it's so straightforward--

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.509
that it's a good foil to my subject.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.280
I use stories to get the picture started,
or to find components,

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.360
or to locate a compelling narrative--

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.200
or a compelling situation. Maybe that's even
a better word.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.480
Or a compelling psychology.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.060
And I'm interested in staging--

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.189
you know, all the tricks of creating the scene.

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:21.480
I don't know for what high school musical
this backdrop could've possibly been made.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.580
It's called "Sci-Fi Office".

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.220
I got this backdrop just for the photo shoot;

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.459
I rented it.

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.799
--[HUNDLEY, OFF CAMERA] It looks good...

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.160
--Three, two, one...

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.280
--Perfect.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.760
I like to include images of the people in
my life.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:55.200
All my friends know this about me, that I
spend a lot of my energy asking their opinions.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:02.019
What's important to me about including my
friends and family is that it raises the stakes;

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.180
that they’re not just images.

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:06.649
It's not just color.

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:08.840
It's not just a model.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.480
But it's people with identities.

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:22.040
I think that if someone encountered my work,
they would not necessarily know

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:29.830
that the model in my photograph or painting
was someone important to me.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.870
But I do think that it changes my attitude
towards the subject,

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.970
and I think that ultimately that's what changes
the picture.
