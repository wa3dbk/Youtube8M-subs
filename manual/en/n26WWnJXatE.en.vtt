00:00:09.869 --> 00:00:14.240
One of the things we always kind of laugh
about is every minute of the whole week, 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.310
somebody, somewhere in this world is 
working on Assassin's Creed IV.

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.500
When you're just receiving emails from
someone who's several thousands of miles away,

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.429
You know nothing about the person,
it’s hard to read between the lines

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:27.499
and if you've met the guy, had a 
couple of beers or gone for lunch, 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:30.829
then you'll understand his personality.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.910
We have seven studios working in collaboration
on Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.779
It's not Montréal versus Singapore 
versus any other studio, 

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:47.840
it's US working on the same game.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.759
When we met to form the team, we really
decided to be focused delivering 

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:57.929
a game which would be really fun, fluid
and epic and focus on the quality of it.

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:01.220
Working on Assassin's Creed is very 
exciting, it's very dynamic...

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.180
there's a lot of collaboration, 
communication,and we're all working very hard 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.150
to make the best possible game we can.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:12.850
We test everyday, everywhere around the world.
We have a studio dedicated to testing,

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.810
and we also doubled the number of tests.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.190
I'll be the first to tell you, this is one
of the hardest things to do in game development,

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.290
is to create a vision and have people 
believe in it, it's very difficult.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:24.920
When it happens, it's gold.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.920
The thing I'm the most proud of is probably
the achievement to create this huge,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:36.600
very varied and diversified world, that we really
pushed the exploration feeling to its limits.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.940
It's incredible when you have so many employees,
and we're talking like hundreds,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:49.100
when they all believe in the vision and they
all push behind it, the results are spectacular.
