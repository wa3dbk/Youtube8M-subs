00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.400
I'm really quite embarrased

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.100
of how simple the New approach is,

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.100
but it's not it, it's letting go

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.300
of the safety of the whole thing,

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:11.700
that's what is difficult

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.200
that's what's difficult

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.600
because we want to be safe

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.500
and that's stronger than I can say

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:20.100
and the only thing I can say

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.700
is that if every time in the morning

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:25.300
you put these things in order,

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.100
absolutely in order,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.400
it would take you half an hour.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.500
That's all it would take

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.400
then you play the way you ever play.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.000
I have a lot of people from abroad,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.000
and I can't change their lives

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.800
with a six or twelve lesson course.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.000
I can show them how to work themselves,

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.300
how to go by,

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:45.700
and that's what helps

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.400
to give themselves further lessons,

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.700
not to chat, try to change.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.200
The tendency is...

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.900
OK, there is the violin,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.300
and turn it over,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.000
to play, turn this here

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.900
and turn this over.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.900
If you do that,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.200
I can't even go between the fingers.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.100
If you go with the giving hand,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.600
and give... play lightly,

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:05.400
just open,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.700
soften, soften,

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.500
No, we are not going to play the violin...

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.900
You see then?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.800
So, these are intervals

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
If you do that you have no intervals.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:21.200
As a result, you lose the interval sense,

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.900
you look at the music and it gives you notes

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.200
and that's why you don't hear the music,

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.000
that's why I can't go to the composer.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.000
You have to find out with the fingers,

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.000
of what the composer is saying,

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:36.200
because we are not free,

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.200
because we want to do it with the bow.

00:01:38.235 --> 00:01:39.500
May I have your hand?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.300
You see, this is what the tendency is
Yes

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.800
and what you want to do is open, like this,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.000
see, if you do that, I can't go between the fingers

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.400
if we do that,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000
just open

00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:56.500
forget violin playing
OK

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.700
and soften, and soften,

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:03.900
(she blows on the player's hand)

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.702
soften

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.100
Generally speaking,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.700
can you imagine you have

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.300
a tiny little creature

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.099
in the middle of your hand...

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:13.500
and you have to keep it warm.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.000
Children love it,

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.200
Just keep it warm,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.500
not with the fingers, with the hand,

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:19.900
with the hand.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.400
And keep it soft here

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.400
OK

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Yes, that's the tendency,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.800
and then I can't put my fingers,

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.000
now you open it

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.800
Thank you

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.800
There you are

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.600
You could play in three
positions all at once

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.900
OK

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.700
then soften,
and you love it, OK?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.100
Thank you

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.700
Would you like to try it?

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.000
That's difficult,

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.700
and this is easy.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.700
and... nice and soft here

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.800
Yes,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.900
yes and the violin doesn't have any weight

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.700
and we just go...
swing those intervals.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.200
As you say, that's it.

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.000
And you have only three intervals

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.500
You know what an interval is?

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.500
yes

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.100
You learned that?

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.000
It's a space between two notes

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.800
and you have only...

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.000
You have to know this,

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.900
that you have only three intervals in your hand,

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.700
only three intervals in your whole hand.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:30.500
And we make such a...

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:31.500
When you look at the music

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.200
you see lots and lots of fingers,

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.800
new fingers, new notes
you never saw before in your life

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.800
and it's only three intervals in the hand.

00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:43.300
So, you go into the notes,

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.000
instead of onto the notes,

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.300
and connect them.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.900
What are the three intervals, please?

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.700
What are the three intervals, please?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Well, I call them in my own way,

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.600
What are the notes in C major

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.000
on the G string?

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:07.900
What are, the names?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.500
G A B C D

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.400
Thank you.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:13.300
What you say, G A B C D

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.500
forget the G because it's an open string

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:19.200
But it is... Can you say ABCD?

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.100
ABCD

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.800
Now, can you throw your hand out,

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:26.000
in the shape of ABCD?

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.100
That's right

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.600
So, that's a whole step, half step
and a whole step, three intervals.

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.000
Soften, soften

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.300
That's right

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:40.800
Now, if I say, G...

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.400
A major, sixth position, G string

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.100
...the thumb doesn't do anything

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.100
The thumb comes here, attracts...

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.700
At least you know how to prevent...

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:57.800
Are you with me?

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.700
That's how you teach a beginner

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.100
to have a musical knowledge with the hand

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.700
and not just the first finger is the A,

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:09.800
the second finger is the...

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:13.000
no first, second and
you don't even say note names

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.700
first, second, third, fourth fingers,

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:17.500
which has nothing to do
with music, rhythm...

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:22.700
or the sense of the space between the notes,

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.200
the important sense of musical sense,

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:28.500
because the music happens between the notes.

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:30.000
Does that make sense?
Yes

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.100
In the space, in the swinging intervals

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.400
and if the fingers can't do that,

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.300
then it's in your way,

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.700
and it's as simple as that.
