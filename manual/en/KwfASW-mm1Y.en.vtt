00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:02.360
This is Teddy.

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:04.200
I know we've introduced Teddy a couple of times.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.400
We believe that Teddy here is half shih tzu,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.370
half Lhasa Apso.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.530
And Shawna, my girlfriend, saw him, brought him over one day

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:21.050
and he had been in six different houses,
didn't know up from down,

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.290
didn't know who his mommy and dad were,
and we fell in love with him.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.680
And so here he is.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.040
He's been around for a long time

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.150
and he's absolutely awesome and we love him to death.

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.150
And every time I see him I just want to grab him
and I want to squeeze him

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.420
and I want to hug him

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:35.210
because you're so good looking.

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:37.400
I never thought I'd be one of these guys that would rescue a dog.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.420
I always thought you get the high-end dog,

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.260
pay big dollars, make sure they're perfect animals

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.890
and that you check out the mama and the papa.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.570
I never thought I'd have a little dog.
I wasn't really a little dog guy.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.760
I had German shepherds and collies growing up.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.800
But this little guy was a total stranger
and there wasn't one owner that wanted to keep him

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.750
which is insane to me.

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.590
We just love this guy oh so much.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.740
Look at how passive and cool he is. Watch. Watch this.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.480
Right there. Are you kidding me?

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.800
How many dogs do this?

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.870
Yeah, chillin. Yes, oh yeah.

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.770
Uh-oh, come on, don't prove me wrong.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.240
Hanging out.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.540
You good boy, yes, you are.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.570
Clean you up.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.400
But look at that.
If that doesn't relax me, I don't know what does.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.860
If you don't have an animal and your kids want an animal,
you know, look into it.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.730
And rescuing doesn't cost much.
You know, it really doesn't.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.980
And look what we got. We got the Teddy here.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.150
We couldn't be happier with this animal.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.300
You can always check out Teddy at Instagram.
He's got that one photo.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:31.700
We've got to get some more up.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.860
Before you know it, he's going to v a bigger fan base than me

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.350
which, you know, look at him.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.640
Hey, let's take him outside and run around.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.020
Shake it up.
Here we go, come on, come on.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:48.130
Oh, snack first, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.830
You still thinking treat, aren't you?

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.600
Oh, oh, oh.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.270
Yeah, dude, go dude, rip it!
