00:00:09.442 --> 00:00:11.886
Kyle von Hasseln:
This is a 3D printed dress.

00:00:11.886 --> 00:00:15.302
The designer uses
wearable, flexible plastic

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:18.684
to create incredible detail 
and volume in her clothes.

00:00:20.245 --> 00:00:23.512
This is a 3D printed tracheal brace.

00:00:23.512 --> 00:00:26.632
Doctors from the University of Michigan
created custom support

00:00:26.632 --> 00:00:30.091
for the airway of a baby who was born 
unable to breathe on his own,

00:00:31.487 --> 00:00:33.496
Its made from bio-adsorbent plastic, 

00:00:33.496 --> 00:00:36.704
so it will disolve over time 
as his airway reforms around it.

00:00:39.474 --> 00:00:41.541
And this is a 3D printed prosthetic leg.

00:00:42.746 --> 00:00:46.757
The designer, Scott Summit 
uses resin and plastic and metal,

00:00:46.757 --> 00:00:49.617
to craft tremendously personal designs.

00:00:49.617 --> 00:00:52.873
They go way past the idea
of just replacing a limb,

00:00:52.873 --> 00:00:56.503
and become an expression
of individuality.

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:01.993
These 3 projects are examples
of the best thing about a 3D printer,

00:01:02.083 --> 00:01:03.894
and that's really saying something 

00:01:03.894 --> 00:01:06.914
because there are a lot of 
amazing things about a 3D printer.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.873
A 3D printer can make 
something very accurately.

00:01:09.873 --> 00:01:11.663
It can make it very fast,

00:01:11.673 --> 00:01:14.745
it can make it with very little material
and very little energy,

00:01:14.812 --> 00:01:17.389
and it can make it exactly 
when and where you need it.

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:20.361
But it can do more than that.

00:01:20.361 --> 00:01:23.023
A 3D printer is more
than a 3D photocopier,

00:01:23.694 --> 00:01:25.685
at its best it does not copy,

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:28.944
it makes something 
that has never existed before.

00:01:30.404 --> 00:01:33.813
So the dress, the airway brace, 
and the prosthetic leg,

00:01:34.273 --> 00:01:38.527
the key to those innovations is that
their authors saw the 3D printer

00:01:38.527 --> 00:01:40.741
as more than a manufacturing device, 

00:01:40.741 --> 00:01:42.268
as more than a replicator.

00:01:42.368 --> 00:01:43.657
They asked themselves,

00:01:43.657 --> 00:01:47.903
"What can I do with this tool,
that has never been possible before?"

00:01:49.373 --> 00:01:52.208
We asked ourselves a similar question
a couple of years ago,

00:01:52.208 --> 00:01:55.476
we had promised to make our friend Chelsea
a cake for her birthday.

00:01:55.586 --> 00:01:58.514
And as the day approached, 
we went shopping

00:01:58.514 --> 00:02:01.015
to get all the ingredients 
to bake it from scratch,

00:02:01.015 --> 00:02:03.859
and we brought them home
and unpacked all the groceries

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:07.535
in our tiny graduate studio apartment
that we had just moved into.

00:02:07.535 --> 00:02:10.814
And as we were standing there 
in the kitchen,

00:02:10.814 --> 00:02:15.378
we suddenly realized, 
that we actually didn't own an oven.

00:02:15.937 --> 00:02:19.829
(Laughter)

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.066
We didn't own an oven 
but we did own a 3D printer.

00:02:25.847 --> 00:02:29.675
And so, naturally, we wondered,

00:02:31.177 --> 00:02:35.048
"Would it be possible to just 
3D print her a cake instead?"

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:38.323
And we tried, and we tried 
recipe after recipe,

00:02:38.938 --> 00:02:41.866
and using every kind of sugar 
that we could find 

00:02:41.866 --> 00:02:45.037
mixed together in every ratio 
that we could think of,

00:02:45.219 --> 00:02:47.553
and after months of that experimentation

00:02:47.745 --> 00:02:50.655
that actually lasted 
well past her actual birthday,

00:02:52.372 --> 00:02:55.882
we finally managed to 3D print
Chelsea a tiny cupcake topper

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:58.183
that spelled her name in cursive sugar.

00:02:58.183 --> 00:03:00.665
She loved it and we realized that

00:03:00.665 --> 00:03:02.801
other people would 
probably love this too.

00:03:02.801 --> 00:03:06.251
So when we graduated about a year ago,
we founded the sugar lab,

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:09.692
a custom design firm 
for 3D printed sugar.

00:03:09.692 --> 00:03:11.981
Using the same process
that we had developed

00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:14.270
for Chelsea's cupcake topper,

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.560
and that process is actually
really simple at its core.

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.246
Its essentially just
adding water to sugar.

00:03:19.246 --> 00:03:22.802
So if you've ever made frosting, 
and left the bowl in the sink overnight,

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:24.683
you know that the next morning

00:03:24.683 --> 00:03:27.233
the bowl going to be
impossible to scrape out.

00:03:27.233 --> 00:03:30.281
And thats because when you add 
water to sugar it solidifies,

00:03:30.281 --> 00:03:33.334
we just add the water 
in a very precise way.

00:03:36.006 --> 00:03:37.997
Liz von Hasseln:
Here's how we do that.

00:03:37.997 --> 00:03:39.385
We start with a digital,

00:03:39.395 --> 00:03:43.474
3 dimensional model of the object 
we'd like to 3d print in sugar.

00:03:43.474 --> 00:03:47.972
We run that model through software
that slices it into layers.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:51.345
These layers will be fed 
to the 3d printer one at a time,

00:03:51.345 --> 00:03:54.180
starting with the very bottom one.

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.990
When that happens the printer 
spreads out a very fine layer of sugar,

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:01.600
and it uses an inkjet printhead 
just like the one you would find

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:03.580
in your desktop 2D printer,

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.800
to paint that bottom 
most crosssection of the object,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.800
onto the layer of sugar,
only using water instead of ink.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.371
Then the printer spreads another 
very fine layer of sugar

00:04:14.371 --> 00:04:15.790
on top of the first one,

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.226
and it paints the next cross 
section with water.

00:04:18.334 --> 00:04:21.564
And it repeats this often 
many thousands of times,

00:04:21.614 --> 00:04:24.964
until every layer of the object 
has been printed,

00:04:25.101 --> 00:04:26.641
one on top of the other,

00:04:26.641 --> 00:04:29.941
from the very bottom layer,
up to the very top layer.

00:04:31.524 --> 00:04:34.870
At that point the digital model
that a few hours earlier

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.790
we could only look at
on our computer screen

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:39.610
has been printed layer by layer

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.270
into a physical, material sugar object.

00:04:44.192 --> 00:04:47.626
This particular sugar object 
we designed as a cake topper,

00:04:47.626 --> 00:04:50.818
which makes this essentially
3d printed frosting.

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:53.863
But you can tell right away
that this frosting

00:04:53.863 --> 00:04:56.027
is doing something different,

00:04:56.027 --> 00:04:58.192
now the frosting can be structural

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.215
it can be sculptural,

00:05:01.995 --> 00:05:05.247
it can be geometric
and mathematically precise.

00:05:06.204 --> 00:05:08.584
It can be intricately perforated,

00:05:09.845 --> 00:05:11.776
or it can just look like a duck.

00:05:11.776 --> 00:05:13.857
(Laughter)

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.362
This frosting can basically look like 
almost anything you can think of

00:05:18.362 --> 00:05:20.846
and it can be used in as many ways.

00:05:21.485 --> 00:05:24.744
So you can 3D print custom 
sugar party favors,

00:05:26.044 --> 00:05:30.184
or crazy little curly sugar cubes
for your coffee.

00:05:30.517 --> 00:05:33.647
Or later in the day,
you can print a sugar lattice

00:05:33.647 --> 00:05:35.987
to complete a cocktail recipe.

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:41.070
Sugar, when it's 3D printed,
can also start to really exceed

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.611
its usual roles of decoration
and sweetening.

00:05:45.338 --> 00:05:48.702
This is a wedding cake we designed 
with Charm City Cakes in Hollywood.

00:05:48.702 --> 00:05:52.410
And you can see that once the sugar 
becomes this structural material,

00:05:52.852 --> 00:05:56.852
it can start to define or even support 
the form of the cake itself.

00:05:58.348 --> 00:06:02.514
In this case we decided to 3D print 
the actual cake stand in sugar,

00:06:03.204 --> 00:06:06.108
in addition to the topper, 
and other decorations,

00:06:06.224 --> 00:06:10.014
which is not something you can usually
choose to do with frosting.

00:06:11.004 --> 00:06:14.574
That's been the most exciting part for us,

00:06:14.580 --> 00:06:16.600
expanding what's possible,

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.600
pushing the technology of 3D printing
into a completely new genre,

00:06:20.877 --> 00:06:24.877
and looking for what it can do there
that couldn't be done before.

00:06:26.643 --> 00:06:28.402
What's important to us

00:06:28.402 --> 00:06:30.559
about the sugar parts
we've shown you today,

00:06:30.559 --> 00:06:34.500
isn't that they're beautiful,
but that they were so recently impossible.

00:06:34.922 --> 00:06:39.472
We hope you see them as an invitation, 
maybe even a challenge.

00:06:41.279 --> 00:06:44.489
Take 3D printing and 
apply it somewhere else.

00:06:44.543 --> 00:06:48.543
Bring it to a new design space,
a new field, a new discipline.

00:06:48.658 --> 00:06:51.018
Bring it somewhere 
that's important to you,

00:06:51.018 --> 00:06:54.768
and see how it can expand 
what's possible there.

00:06:55.133 --> 00:06:57.913
That's the best thing 
about a 3D printer,

00:06:58.076 --> 00:07:01.206
you can use it to print 
something impossible.

00:07:02.494 --> 00:07:05.275
Kyle and Liz: Thank you.
(Applause)
