00:00:00.716 --> 00:00:03.215
Voiceover: Now that we're
familiar with the idea

00:00:03.215 --> 00:00:06.048
of allele frequency, let's build on that

00:00:06.048 --> 00:00:11.064
to develop the Hardy,
do this in a new color,

00:00:11.064 --> 00:00:13.715
and actually, let me
do it right over here,

00:00:13.715 --> 00:00:20.880
the Hardy Weinberg
principle, which is a really

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.430
useful principle for thinking through what

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.347
allele frequencies might
be, or what probability

00:00:28.347 --> 00:00:32.130
you would have if you found someone,

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.710
what percentage of the population might be

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.433
homozygous recessive,
or homozygous dominant,

00:00:36.433 --> 00:00:38.451
or might be a heterozygote.

00:00:38.451 --> 00:00:39.750
And it really builds on the work

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.967
we've already seen with
allele frequencies.

00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:43.451
Now before we go into
that, we're gonna make

00:00:43.451 --> 00:00:45.884
some assumptions, and these
are all just assumptions

00:00:45.884 --> 00:00:49.368
that get us a stable allele
frequency in the population

00:00:49.368 --> 00:00:51.417
from generation to generation.

00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:55.618
We're going to assume
that there's no selection,

00:00:55.618 --> 00:00:59.818
no natural selection is, or
even unnatural selection,

00:00:59.818 --> 00:01:02.351
is going on that would change
the allele frequencies.

00:01:02.351 --> 00:01:05.735
So it's not like people with
one of the alleles or another

00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:07.151
are going to be more or less likely

00:01:07.151 --> 00:01:10.216
to reproduce and have viable offspring.

00:01:10.216 --> 00:01:14.151
We're also going to assume no mutation,

00:01:14.151 --> 00:01:16.966
so we're going to assume that
one of these alleles can't,

00:01:16.966 --> 00:01:18.984
isn't from generation to
generation turning into

00:01:18.984 --> 00:01:22.567
another one, or turning
into maybe a different,

00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:25.734
a new type of trait,
whether it's green eyes,

00:01:25.734 --> 00:01:27.734
or whatever else it might be.

00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:32.168
And we're also going to
assume large populations.

00:01:32.168 --> 00:01:34.535
So that would definitely
throw out the example

00:01:34.535 --> 00:01:36.850
that we looked at in the last
video, which I did just to

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.818
understand the notion of allele
frequencies, where we said,

00:01:39.818 --> 00:01:44.984
hey, look, one out of
the four of the genes

00:01:44.984 --> 00:01:47.067
in this population, or
one-fourth of the alleles

00:01:47.067 --> 00:01:50.402
in this population,
are the dominant brown,

00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:54.683
while three-fourths, or 75
percent, were the recessive blue.

00:01:54.683 --> 00:01:57.318
We're gonna assume large
populations, so many, many, many,

00:01:57.318 --> 00:02:00.451
and so that's so that if you
have very small populations,

00:02:00.451 --> 00:02:02.801
you can imagine that, depending
on how these reproduce,

00:02:02.801 --> 00:02:06.701
it's very easy to get to
changes in frequencies,

00:02:06.701 --> 00:02:09.485
but at larger populations, that
helps us make the assumption

00:02:09.485 --> 00:02:12.153
that we have stable allele frequencies.

00:02:12.153 --> 00:02:13.985
So once again, this is also that we have

00:02:13.985 --> 00:02:21.520
stable allele frequencies.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.001
Now based on that,
we've already seen if we

00:02:23.001 --> 00:02:27.452
take the frequency of the dominant trait,

00:02:27.452 --> 00:02:30.701
which we can denote with
p, and to that we add

00:02:30.701 --> 00:02:32.600
the frequency of the recessive trait,

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.619
of the recessive, I
should say, allele, let me

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:37.117
be very careful here, the frequency of the

00:02:37.117 --> 00:02:40.166
dominant allele, and to
that we add the frequency of

00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:43.617
the recessive allele,
what's that going to be?

00:02:43.617 --> 00:02:46.151
Well, you see in this case,
it adds up to 100 percent, or

00:02:46.151 --> 00:02:49.451
one, and it's always going to
add up to 100 percent, or one.

00:02:49.451 --> 00:02:50.986
Because we're assuming that there's only

00:02:50.986 --> 00:02:53.683
one of two alleles in the population,

00:02:53.683 --> 00:02:57.500
so you have 100 percent chance
of getting one of these two,

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.136
that whatever percentage is going to be,

00:03:01.136 --> 00:03:02.867
whatever the frequency here is,

00:03:02.867 --> 00:03:06.200
100 percent minus that is
going to be whatever q is.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.432
So these two things are going to be

00:03:07.432 --> 00:03:10.133
equal to 100 percent, or equal to one.

00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:11.368
And now we can start to do a little bit

00:03:11.368 --> 00:03:12.583
of interesting mathematics.

00:03:12.583 --> 00:03:14.117
It'll allow us to start thinking about

00:03:14.117 --> 00:03:17.383
things like homozygotes and heterozygotes,

00:03:17.383 --> 00:03:20.283
and so to do that,
let's square both sides.

00:03:20.283 --> 00:03:22.299
So let's square both sides of this,

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.868
a little bit of algebra in biology class.

00:03:24.868 --> 00:03:26.451
And so when you square the left-hand side,

00:03:26.451 --> 00:03:29.334
this is just squaring a
binomial, you might want to

00:03:29.334 --> 00:03:33.333
review it if this looks like
Latin to you, there's many

00:03:33.333 --> 00:03:35.850
algebra videos on Khan
academy that go into this,

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:49.883
this is going to be p
squared, plus two times pq,

00:03:49.883 --> 00:03:52.084
plus q squared, and of course one squared

00:03:52.084 --> 00:03:54.783
is still going to be equal to one.

00:03:54.783 --> 00:03:56.783
Now what are each of these terms here?

00:03:56.783 --> 00:03:58.617
What are each of these terms?

00:03:58.617 --> 00:04:00.850
Well, let's just think about something.

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:05.535
p squared is the same thing as p times p.

00:04:05.535 --> 00:04:09.149
Well, p is the frequency
of your dominant allele.

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:10.867
So this is the frequency
of your dominant allele,

00:04:10.867 --> 00:04:13.467
the percentage of the
allele population, I guess

00:04:13.467 --> 00:04:16.466
you could say, the allele
frequency, that is dominant,

00:04:16.466 --> 00:04:17.752
and you're multiplying
that times it again.

00:04:17.752 --> 00:04:19.283
Well, another way to
think about p, is this is

00:04:19.283 --> 00:04:22.867
the probability, if you
were randomly to pick

00:04:22.867 --> 00:04:28.583
one of these four genes,
and here I'm using my

00:04:28.583 --> 00:04:30.217
over-simplified population, of course,

00:04:30.217 --> 00:04:33.267
the truths that we're about
to surface to be true,

00:04:33.267 --> 00:04:35.467
you're going to have to
assume a large population,

00:04:35.467 --> 00:04:37.867
but in this one right over
here, one way to view p is

00:04:37.867 --> 00:04:41.750
what's the probability if I
were to pick a gene at random,

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.316
what's the probability
that it is the variant,

00:04:44.316 --> 00:04:47.966
or it is the dominant allele,
what is the probability

00:04:47.966 --> 00:04:50.451
that it represents the brown variant?

00:04:50.451 --> 00:04:58.150
So that's one way to view
p, so, the probability

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:03.883
of getting a, let's
just write it that way,

00:05:03.883 --> 00:05:07.216
a capital B, a dominant brown allele.

00:05:07.216 --> 00:05:08.751
So what's p times p?

00:05:08.751 --> 00:05:12.583
That's the probability of
getting two dominant alleles.

00:05:12.583 --> 00:05:15.932
Or another way of thinking about
it, this is the probability

00:05:15.932 --> 00:05:22.451
for someone in the population
to be homozygous dominant,

00:05:22.451 --> 00:05:25.466
so it's the probability of someone

00:05:25.466 --> 00:05:33.833
being capital B and capital B.

00:05:33.833 --> 00:05:37.868
And so by the same
logic, what is q squared?

00:05:37.868 --> 00:05:39.932
Well, q squared, that's just q times q,

00:05:39.932 --> 00:05:43.133
q is the probability of
getting one recessive allele,

00:05:43.133 --> 00:05:45.951
so this is the probability of
getting two recessive alleles.

00:05:45.951 --> 00:05:48.417
One from your mother,
and one from your father,

00:05:48.417 --> 00:05:54.983
so this is the probability of,

00:05:54.983 --> 00:05:57.882
if you were kind of randomly
born into this population,

00:05:57.882 --> 00:06:01.266
of getting two recessive alleles.

00:06:01.266 --> 00:06:05.617
Now what is this middle
term, right over here?

00:06:05.617 --> 00:06:11.535
Well, p times q, so pq, so
one way to think about it,

00:06:11.535 --> 00:06:14.084
if you said, what's the
probability that from your mother,

00:06:14.084 --> 00:06:17.001
you get, randomly, you
know nothing about them,

00:06:17.001 --> 00:06:20.118
or if you pick a random
mother and a random father,

00:06:20.118 --> 00:06:23.083
what's the probability, I
have to be careful here,

00:06:23.083 --> 00:06:26.600
so if you're just
randomly getting alleles,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:28.550
what's the probability
that from on one side

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:30.417
you're gonna get the dominant, and

00:06:30.417 --> 00:06:32.700
from the second side you're
gonna get the recessive?

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:41.700
So that would be pq,
that would be p times q,

00:06:41.700 --> 00:06:44.549
so that's getting it from,
say, from one parent,

00:06:44.549 --> 00:06:45.751
and then that's from the second parent,

00:06:45.751 --> 00:06:47.200
but what about the other way around?

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.951
From the first parent,
you have a q probability

00:06:49.951 --> 00:06:53.750
of getting the recessive one,
and from the second parent,

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.000
you have a p probability of
getting the dominant one.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.334
So there's two ways of
becoming a heterozygote.

00:07:00.334 --> 00:07:03.367
And so if you add these two
probabilities, what do you get?

00:07:03.367 --> 00:07:04.882
These are both pq, I'm just changing

00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:06.464
the order of multiplication.

00:07:06.464 --> 00:07:12.017
You sum these two, you get two pq.

00:07:12.017 --> 00:07:22.933
So this is the probability
of being a heterozygote.

00:07:22.933 --> 00:07:25.382
So this is a pretty neat result.

00:07:25.382 --> 00:07:27.083
Just by making a few assumptions,

00:07:27.083 --> 00:07:29.800
and reasoning through this
notion of allele frequency,

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:33.983
we're able to come up with this expression

00:07:33.983 --> 00:07:37.417
that actually is fairly
powerful in thinking

00:07:37.417 --> 00:07:40.849
about allele frequency in
a population, and actually,

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:44.417
the different genotype
frequencies in a population.

00:07:44.417 --> 00:07:46.899
You see it all makes sense,
these all add up to one.

00:07:46.899 --> 00:07:50.300
The probability of someone
being homozygous dominant,

00:07:50.300 --> 00:07:52.700
plus the probability of
someone being a heterozygote,

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:53.951
plus the probability of someone being

00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:57.952
a homozygous recessive, they're
gonna add up to 100 percent,

00:07:57.952 --> 00:07:59.400
because someone's going to have to be

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:01.682
one of these three things.

00:08:01.682 --> 00:08:03.049
Now I'm gonna leave you
there in this video,

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:04.816
and the next video,
we're actually gonna use

00:08:04.816 --> 00:08:09.583
this Hardy Weinberg equation
to actually come up with

00:08:09.583 --> 00:08:13.540
some very interesting
results about a population.
