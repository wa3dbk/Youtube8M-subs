00:00:00.781 --> 00:00:02.441
- Hi! It's Parris from Rainy Day Dreamers

00:00:02.441 --> 00:00:04.301
and people have asked me
to do some more stories

00:00:04.301 --> 00:00:06.980
about traveling around the
world and Japan adventures,

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:08.706
so here's one for you.

00:00:08.706 --> 00:00:11.522
When I first moved to
Japan, the very first year

00:00:11.522 --> 00:00:14.982
I was chosen to be a judge in an

00:00:14.982 --> 00:00:17.862
international music competition.

00:00:17.862 --> 00:00:20.522
Both the World Popular Song Festival

00:00:20.522 --> 00:00:24.862
and Band Explosion '87 in Tokyo! Really!

00:00:24.862 --> 00:00:27.442
How did this happen? Let me tell ya.

00:00:27.442 --> 00:00:31.562
♫ Rainy Day Dreamers

00:00:31.562 --> 00:00:34.082
♫ Rainy Day Dreamers ♫

00:00:34.082 --> 00:00:36.202
Just in case you think I'm making this up,

00:00:36.202 --> 00:00:37.942
and I wouldn't blame you
for having your doubts,

00:00:37.942 --> 00:00:39.922
here's the letter I was sent

00:00:39.922 --> 00:00:42.001
inviting me to go for a take listening.

00:00:42.001 --> 00:00:44.701
Which was basically a test
a bunch of us had to do

00:00:44.701 --> 00:00:48.342
to see whether or not we had
good enough musical sense

00:00:48.342 --> 00:00:50.602
to be judges in the competition.

00:00:50.602 --> 00:00:52.961
So yes, I really was a judge at an

00:00:52.961 --> 00:00:55.968
international music
competition in Tokyo, Japan.

00:00:55.968 --> 00:00:57.708
Now, the way it happened was

00:00:57.708 --> 00:01:01.029
a combination of luck and circumstance.

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:02.501
Which is how most good things in life,

00:01:02.501 --> 00:01:03.951
I've found, tend to happen.

00:01:03.951 --> 00:01:05.971
You just have to be in the
right place at the right time

00:01:05.971 --> 00:01:07.630
and looking in the right direction.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.910
I was looking in the classified
ads of the newspaper.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:11.133
I saw an add that said,

00:01:11.133 --> 00:01:13.476
"Hey, if you're reading this,
you're probably a foreigner

00:01:13.476 --> 00:01:16.396
and we're looking for
some foreign judges to

00:01:16.396 --> 00:01:19.116
judge a music competition in Tokyo.

00:01:19.116 --> 00:01:23.248
So write us a letter and
give us your information,

00:01:23.248 --> 00:01:25.368
your musical background,
something like that."

00:01:25.368 --> 00:01:26.350
So I wrote out a letter and said,

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.990
"Yes, I would like to participate,

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.010
and this is the kind of music I like,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.450
and I played piano in high school."

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.489
I don't remember what I said.

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:35.566
This was 27, 28 years ago.

00:01:35.566 --> 00:01:37.766
So, sent the letter off.

00:01:37.766 --> 00:01:39.106
Didn't know if anything would come of it,

00:01:39.106 --> 00:01:41.606
but a few weeks later, in the mail,

00:01:41.606 --> 00:01:45.046
I found out I was selected
to go for further testing.

00:01:45.046 --> 00:01:46.946
A bunch of us from
countries around the world

00:01:46.946 --> 00:01:49.066
were seated at, maybe 30, 40 people,

00:01:49.066 --> 00:01:51.026
were seated at these big, long tables

00:01:51.026 --> 00:01:54.286
and they had a tape player,
cassette tape player,

00:01:54.286 --> 00:01:56.566
and they would play musical selections

00:01:56.566 --> 00:01:58.606
and we had to write whether
we liked them or not,

00:01:58.606 --> 00:02:00.905
and what we thought about the music.

00:02:00.905 --> 00:02:02.765
Now, I don't have any musical training,

00:02:02.765 --> 00:02:05.201
but I like what I like,
so that's what I wrote!

00:02:05.201 --> 00:02:06.259
I picked the ones that I liked

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.552
and I wrote why I liked them.

00:02:07.552 --> 00:02:09.187
We turned that in and they said

00:02:09.187 --> 00:02:11.421
they would be in touch with
the people they were interested

00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:12.846
in having continue in the process.

00:02:12.846 --> 00:02:15.126
And said, "We want you to be
one of the foreign judges,

00:02:15.126 --> 00:02:18.086
we need you to come down for
the rehearsal of the event.

00:02:18.086 --> 00:02:21.626
And I'm to see how it's all
going to work, dress nice!"

00:02:21.626 --> 00:02:23.705
Well, I had my suit for
going out on job interviews.

00:02:23.705 --> 00:02:27.174
So that was good, so I dressed up fancy,

00:02:27.174 --> 00:02:30.150
followed the subway
directions they gave me.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.483
Again, at this point I'd only been

00:02:31.483 --> 00:02:33.163
in Japan four or five months.

00:02:33.163 --> 00:02:35.182
Spoke almost no Japanese, yet

00:02:35.182 --> 00:02:38.463
and had trouble reading some
of the train station signs

00:02:38.463 --> 00:02:40.242
to know where to get
off and change trains.

00:02:40.242 --> 00:02:42.583
In Tokyo, a city of 10 million people.

00:02:42.583 --> 00:02:45.523
Anyway, I went down to the Budokan.

00:02:45.523 --> 00:02:49.924
It's a big event hall in Tokyo

00:02:49.924 --> 00:02:51.988
and met the other people who were gonna

00:02:51.988 --> 00:02:54.355
be the foreign judges and
they showed us how it worked

00:02:54.355 --> 00:02:57.335
and we went in and actually
listened to the bands

00:02:57.335 --> 00:02:59.791
rehearsing, prior to the day that

00:02:59.791 --> 00:03:01.444
they did the actual performance

00:03:01.444 --> 00:03:02.644
and we did the actual voting.

00:03:02.644 --> 00:03:04.603
So that was kind of nice to get some idea.

00:03:04.603 --> 00:03:07.034
Let me show you who those bands were,

00:03:07.034 --> 00:03:08.714
and see if you know any of them.

00:03:08.714 --> 00:03:10.075
Here's the brochure for the event,

00:03:10.075 --> 00:03:12.892
the World Popular Song Festival, 1987.

00:03:12.892 --> 00:03:17.032
Now, two of them I recognize now.

00:03:17.032 --> 00:03:19.596
At the time I didn't know any of these.

00:03:19.596 --> 00:03:23.923
But one that became a big
favorite of mine is Erasure.

00:03:23.923 --> 00:03:25.643
That's this duo right here.

00:03:25.643 --> 00:03:28.483
I bought their cassette
tapes while I was in Japan,

00:03:28.483 --> 00:03:30.724
and CD's since, I love that group.

00:03:30.724 --> 00:03:32.679
And then, another one
that I didn't realize

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:35.940
'til looking at this today, Mijares.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.640
Now, we weren't the only judges

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:39.892
because this was a world festival,

00:03:39.892 --> 00:03:42.202
they decided they wanted to
have foreign judges there,

00:03:42.202 --> 00:03:44.202
but the people who got all the attention

00:03:44.202 --> 00:03:45.662
were the celebrity judges.

00:03:45.662 --> 00:03:47.425
Those were the ones, at the actual event,

00:03:47.425 --> 00:03:49.645
they announced, "And
our judges for tonight,"

00:03:49.645 --> 00:03:52.085
and there was three or four
and the spotlight hit them.

00:03:52.085 --> 00:03:53.365
And they may have said,

00:03:53.365 --> 00:03:55.528
"And our panel of international judges."

00:03:55.528 --> 00:03:57.108
There were like 16, or 18 of us.

00:03:57.108 --> 00:03:59.480
A few Japanese who had traveled
abroad, and spoke English,

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.434
but the rest were people
from different countries,

00:04:01.434 --> 00:04:03.074
and maybe the spotlight went shoop,

00:04:03.074 --> 00:04:04.394
but that was about the extent of it.

00:04:04.394 --> 00:04:07.143
Now I don't know, maybe I was on T.V.

00:04:07.143 --> 00:04:09.043
in Japan, in 1987.

00:04:09.043 --> 00:04:11.043
The problem was that this was before,

00:04:11.043 --> 00:04:12.903
I was there, bein' at the event,

00:04:12.903 --> 00:04:14.113
there was no way I was gonna have

00:04:14.113 --> 00:04:16.788
a chance to DVR it and see it later.

00:04:16.788 --> 00:04:19.287
Now, the other event, and
they're both sponsored by Yamaha,

00:04:19.287 --> 00:04:21.169
which is probably why I ended
up going to both of them,

00:04:21.169 --> 00:04:23.915
was this Band Explosion '87.

00:04:23.915 --> 00:04:25.515
Now, these were bands that

00:04:25.515 --> 00:04:27.455
had never been signed to a contract.

00:04:27.455 --> 00:04:29.935
Ameture bands from around the world.

00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:32.515
And I still have my notes of how I voted,

00:04:32.515 --> 00:04:34.554
here, for each of them.

00:04:34.554 --> 00:04:36.395
I'll try to pull this across slowly, here.

00:04:36.395 --> 00:04:37.802
You can see the names of the bands.

00:04:37.802 --> 00:04:40.922
I don't recognize that any of these bands

00:04:40.922 --> 00:04:43.401
went on to great fortune and fame,

00:04:44.954 --> 00:04:46.752
but maybe somebody out there recognizes

00:04:46.752 --> 00:04:48.572
one or more of them.

00:04:48.572 --> 00:04:51.232
Apparently this is the
band that I liked the best.

00:04:51.232 --> 00:04:53.652
I gave them a four and a
half, five, out of five

00:04:53.652 --> 00:04:56.772
and a big star next to
it, Chinese Folklore.

00:04:56.772 --> 00:04:59.572
I've still got the little
gift bag at the end,

00:04:59.572 --> 00:05:01.072
that they gave to all the judges.

00:05:01.072 --> 00:05:02.432
I don't remember the other things in it,

00:05:02.432 --> 00:05:04.936
but I did get a Swatch, which,

00:05:04.936 --> 00:05:07.630
at that time were very
expensive and all the rage.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.211
The Swiss company that
makes Swatches, very unique.

00:05:10.211 --> 00:05:12.211
This one was a watch
that you could actually

00:05:12.211 --> 00:05:15.731
see through into the gears
and mechanisms inside

00:05:15.731 --> 00:05:18.070
with a clear, plastic strap.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.751
Had it for many years, I
can't seem to find it now.

00:05:20.751 --> 00:05:23.811
And here are the bands
that I saw the next year,

00:05:23.811 --> 00:05:26.923
and made notes about, but
didn't actually get to vote on.

00:05:33.003 --> 00:05:35.103
Any groups here that you know?

00:05:35.103 --> 00:05:37.343
Now, we didn't get paid
anything for being judges,

00:05:37.343 --> 00:05:39.158
other than that little
gift bad they gave us

00:05:39.158 --> 00:05:42.161
and I didn't see the
people who I judged with

00:05:42.161 --> 00:05:43.910
or most of these bands ever again.

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.810
But it's a nice memory that I
have from my years in Japan.

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.770
From my crazy youth, doing
all kinds of wild things,

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:52.550
and the reason I got to do this was,

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:54.430
there was a thing that said,

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:56.830
"Try out, you might get to."

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.370
So I tried out.

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.030
And a lot of times in my
life, I've found that,

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:03.709
seeing that there's an
opportunity and you go and give it

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:05.700
a try, there's no guarantee
you're going to get it,

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.180
and you may fail most of the times,

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:10.220
but the times that you succeed,

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:14.020
the times you're selected,
or based on some funny skill

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:16.780
that you have like my
musical listening ability.

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:19.260
You get selected to do
something that most people

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.900
in the world will never
get the chance to do.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:24.999
You just have to not worry so
much about losing and failing.

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:27.680
The people who fail and lose out the most,

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:29.360
I think are the people who never try

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.920
for these kinds of opportunities.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.524
How would I ever have ended up

00:06:32.524 --> 00:06:34.583
in air traffic control school,

00:06:34.583 --> 00:06:37.383
being an airport commissioner for a town,

00:06:37.383 --> 00:06:39.482
going to Japan and teaching English,

00:06:39.482 --> 00:06:41.323
going to Japan and being an

00:06:41.323 --> 00:06:43.595
international music competition judge,

00:06:43.595 --> 00:06:45.027
traveling around the world,

00:06:45.027 --> 00:06:47.617
meeting Mother Teresa in Calcutta.

00:06:47.617 --> 00:06:49.865
You don't have to be
anything special to do that,

00:06:49.865 --> 00:06:51.085
you just have to say,

00:06:51.085 --> 00:06:52.825
"Hey, I'm gonna try!"

00:06:52.825 --> 00:06:54.564
A lot of times people may say,

00:06:54.564 --> 00:06:56.424
"Yeah, I don't think so.",

00:06:56.424 --> 00:07:00.584
but if you know on 100 doors,
two or three will open,

00:07:00.584 --> 00:07:02.627
and if you don't know on any at all,

00:07:02.627 --> 00:07:04.582
you just stand out there in the rain.

00:07:04.582 --> 00:07:07.661
So if I can, with one
year of high school piano

00:07:07.661 --> 00:07:10.302
with Mr. Doyle, Mr. Doyle,
you're a great teacher,

00:07:10.302 --> 00:07:13.942
be a judge at an international
music competition

00:07:13.942 --> 00:07:16.322
in Tokyo, Japan, you can do the same

00:07:16.322 --> 00:07:17.955
kind of things in your life.

00:07:17.955 --> 00:07:19.214
You just have to get out there

00:07:19.214 --> 00:07:21.036
and start knocking on the doors.

00:07:21.036 --> 00:07:22.416
No doors down below this video,

00:07:22.416 --> 00:07:23.855
but there is a subscribe button.

00:07:23.855 --> 00:07:24.835
Click that and you'll be notified

00:07:24.835 --> 00:07:26.414
when our daily videos go up.

00:07:26.414 --> 00:07:28.604
You'll also join the Dream Team,

00:07:28.604 --> 00:07:31.184
and dreams is where it all starts.

00:07:31.184 --> 00:07:32.885
♫ It's raining at our house

00:07:32.885 --> 00:07:35.564
♫ Is it raining where you are?

00:07:35.564 --> 00:07:37.525
♫ Kind of day to stay in and play

00:07:37.525 --> 00:07:39.665
♫ Or eat a big chocolate bar

00:07:39.665 --> 00:07:40.765
♫ Hang out with friends

00:07:40.765 --> 00:07:42.004
♫ 'Til the weather ends

00:07:42.004 --> 00:07:44.344
♫ And you don't have to go too far

00:07:44.344 --> 00:07:46.144
♫ Rainy Day Dreamers,

00:07:46.144 --> 00:07:49.623
♫ We're always where you are ♫
