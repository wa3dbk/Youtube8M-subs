00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.650
Engage Null Space flight, and
surround the Giant God.

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:03.290
But the Giant God is already...

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.720
You should be prepared for the worst!

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:06.890
Strengthen the encirclement further!

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:08.260
Roger!

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.630
Cosmo, quick! The shooting star
is coming!

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:16.800
"Comet!"

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.580
- He's not going to make it!
- Quickly! Cosmo!

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.420
Be a good boy, Lou!

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.290
Now is the time to show us your power!
Don't you think so?

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.700
Damn this... Are we gonna die
because of some stupid hatch?!

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.300
- I believe that isn't so!
- What?

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.340
- Cosmo! Hurry up! The comet!
- Yeah! I know!

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.010
Cosmo, the righteous hearts
that we have raised...

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.680
shall be inherited by
the next generation!

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.110
Inherited by the next generation?!

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:08.250
Women! Being able to think of
the future at a time like this!

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:09.490
We can get it out now!

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.630
Cosmo... Does he intend to
destroy the comet?!

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.730
- Huh? It's Sheryl!
- What?!

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:28.370
- Cosmo!
- Ms. Sheryl?!

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:29.170
What?!

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.440
Kasha! What are you doing?! Protect her!

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.810
Huh? What?! Ms. Sheryl?!

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:37.350
Ide, answer me!

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.480
This innocent child only acts in pure
defense, and he fears death!

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:48.520
Oh Ide! It is your duty to respond
to this pure heart's fear!

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.960
Lou... He is calling for
the baby inside me!

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.630
- Baby inside you?
- Baby?

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.870
Karala!

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:13.720
If Lou's pure heart is an
indication of the power of Ide...

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.290
Oh why? Why do you lead so
many people to their death?!

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:21.890
Shouldn't your duty be
to allow life to live?!

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:25.760
Lou!

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.000
Oh Ide!

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.340
The Ideon Gun is ready to fire!

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.640
Power is good and ready, Cosmo!

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:03.370
- Did... Did we succeed?
- So I thought, but...

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.770
What is that light?! That strange glow?!

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.870
Gije! Gije!
