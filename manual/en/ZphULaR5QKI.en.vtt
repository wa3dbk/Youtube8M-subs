00:00:00.178 --> 00:00:00.428
- What?

00:00:00.428 --> 00:00:01.117
- Like I thought it was violent,

00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:02.945
but I didn't know it was this messed up.

00:00:02.945 --> 00:00:04.821
(fast-paced music)

00:00:08.228 --> 00:00:10.158
- My thoughts when people
say pro-wrestling is

00:00:10.158 --> 00:00:11.296
it's not professional.

00:00:11.296 --> 00:00:12.962
- Why does anyone watch wrestling?

00:00:12.962 --> 00:00:14.445
- I think fake.

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:16.030
- Is she giving birth to a pro-wrestler?

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.310
Is this how it all began?

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.915
Is this the start of a soap opera?

00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:20.987
- How does this relate to what's going on

00:00:20.987 --> 00:00:21.739
in the ring though?

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:23.607
- It's a, it's a hand.

00:00:23.607 --> 00:00:25.497
- A hand was in her vagina.

00:00:25.497 --> 00:00:26.634
- She was masturbating too much.

00:00:26.634 --> 00:00:28.789
- That looked like one of the
people from "Golden Girls"

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.658
- I like this, oh on thumbtacks.

00:00:30.658 --> 00:00:32.345
- Ooh, oowie!

00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:33.299
- Fake blood.

00:00:33.299 --> 00:00:35.677
- Okay, so like, that
is absolutely insane.

00:00:35.677 --> 00:00:36.957
It just shows you that this,

00:00:36.957 --> 00:00:38.318
some of this must be real, right?

00:00:38.318 --> 00:00:42.341
If you throw someone off
like, a 15 meter thing,

00:00:42.341 --> 00:00:43.233
like, that hurts.

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:44.270
- These are real crimes.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:45.672
- That's the back flip.

00:00:45.672 --> 00:00:46.749
That's what I want to see.

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:49.228
- That was a pretty amazing
flip, though, I have to say.

00:00:49.228 --> 00:00:49.898
- Uh..

00:00:49.898 --> 00:00:51.239
- That was a good, that was a good move.

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:52.601
- That was impressive.

00:00:52.601 --> 00:00:54.492
- Why is he in a funeral home?

00:00:54.492 --> 00:00:56.757
- Don't do something
weird to the body, don't.

00:00:56.757 --> 00:00:57.366
- Oh God.

00:00:57.366 --> 00:00:59.807
- This is like very "Pretty
Little Liars" right now.

00:00:59.807 --> 00:01:01.389
- He just said, you look better dead.

00:01:01.389 --> 00:01:02.790
- Is that a boob grab?

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.051
Was that a corpse boob grab?

00:01:04.051 --> 00:01:05.432
- That's like a really bad example

00:01:05.432 --> 00:01:06.854
to set for the young people.

00:01:06.854 --> 00:01:09.515
- Don't grope corpses, kids.

00:01:09.515 --> 00:01:10.674
- Who watches this shit?

00:01:10.674 --> 00:01:13.225
- What the (beep)?
- Is that?

00:01:13.235 --> 00:01:14.266
- He's getting naked.

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.562
- How does this? How does? What?

00:01:16.562 --> 00:01:18.451
(gasping and screaming)

00:01:18.451 --> 00:01:20.177
- That's fu (beep) ed.

00:01:20.177 --> 00:01:22.500
(slow piano music)

00:01:28.893 --> 00:01:31.453
- This is cool, this is nice.

00:01:31.453 --> 00:01:32.896
- Aw, this is just too nice.

00:01:32.896 --> 00:01:34.345
- Aw, that's beautiful.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:36.618
- Aw.

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:42.161
- I didn't come here for this,
I didn't come here for this.

00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:45.036
- Oh, you got me.

00:01:45.036 --> 00:01:46.047
- Oh, me too.

00:01:46.047 --> 00:01:46.878
- Aw.

00:01:46.878 --> 00:01:50.840
- I think that wrestling,
obviously has the ability

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.840
to give people a lot of hope

00:01:56.331 --> 00:01:57.441
when it comes to,

00:01:57.441 --> 00:01:58.804
like it's an escapism thing.

00:01:58.804 --> 00:02:01.126
(fireworks bursting)

00:02:06.748 --> 00:02:09.469
- I think that my views
on wrestling have changed.

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:12.030
- I've been confirmed
that it's a soap opera

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.164
with like, a little bit more violence.

00:02:14.164 --> 00:02:16.744
- A lot of people aren't just watching it

00:02:16.744 --> 00:02:19.791
for the sex with dead bodies.

00:02:19.791 --> 00:02:21.883
And the gratuitous violence.

00:02:21.883 --> 00:02:25.846
But it's also, it's about
entertainment for everyone.

00:02:25.846 --> 00:02:27.531
And they get to have just
a bit of fun with it.

00:02:27.531 --> 00:02:28.751
- Still think it's dumb.

00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:29.950
(laughing)

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.824
- After watching that,

00:02:30.824 --> 00:02:33.323
I think that there are some
massive aspects of wrestling

00:02:33.323 --> 00:02:34.623
that are very problematic.

00:02:34.623 --> 00:02:35.964
And something that I
probably wouldn't want to

00:02:35.964 --> 00:02:39.092
expose my own children,
or even myself, to.

00:02:39.092 --> 00:02:40.047
- Whatever works for you,

00:02:40.047 --> 00:02:42.648
just don't go around
doing that in real life.

00:02:42.648 --> 00:02:44.807
(upbeat music)
