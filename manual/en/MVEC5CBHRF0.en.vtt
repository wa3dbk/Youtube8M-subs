Ron Colby with Gary Yamamoto Custom Baits.
What we’re going to talk about now is snag

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:22.890
proofs Bobby Barrett’s signature frog. This
bait is a bait you want to be using in some

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.099
of the nastiest thickest brush and weeds.
Any place you’d be afraid to throw anything

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:35.690
like a Sammie or a popper, spinner bait, or
something like that. This thing will stay

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.330
weedless. It’ll stay across the surface,
it’ll catch some of the biggest fish I’ve

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:46.510
ever caught. What you want to be doing is
using braid with this because the braid will

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.170
get around the brush. When you pull it tight
it’ll cut threw the brush where will usually

00:00:51.170 --> 00:01:00.049
break or get an abrasion on it and cut off,
so use braid. This is a 60 pound braid with

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:05.260
about a 10 diameter, so it’s very easy to
cast, plus it’ll float and help keep this

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:12.870
bait up on the surface for you. Use a very
long rod with this bait. This is a 7’ 8”

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:17.450
flipping stick, and you want to use a very
long rod, because when the fish takes this

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:21.810
bait down into the grass, you’re going to
have to really come up on them really hard

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.560
and get a pretty powerful hook set to get
them up out of that grass. I always recommend

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:36.950
an over 7 foot rod, something extremely heavy
and stuff to use this bait. You cast it out

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.000
there. We’re in a little bit of open water
right now. This bait works very well in open

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.999
water. Just let it set, pop 2 or 3 times.
Get the nose chugging out of the water like

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:57.550
it’s a little frog hopping along the surface.
Stopping, he’s checking to see where he’s

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.250
going to go. Every once in a while you can
just pop it like that and he’ll even kind

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.340
of do a little zigzag, walk the dog.
