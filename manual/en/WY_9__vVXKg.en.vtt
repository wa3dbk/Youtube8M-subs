00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:03.870
[music]

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.870
Hi guys, it is Louis Smith here.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.930
You have joined me in the gym and
I am going to try and give you my top five

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:11.769
wit tips for training
and trying to be a high level sportsman or

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:12.940
just even having fun.

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.800
So, the first one being is dedication.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.779
Obviously, it is going to
take a lot of hard work to get to the top

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:22.100
or to get to reach your
goals.

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:25.930
For me, you know, I have dedicated twenty
years of my life

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:26.930
to the sport.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.750
My mom has dedicated a lot of hours, taking
me to and

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.750
from competitions and things like that.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.000
So, It has been a lot of
dedication involved, no just from my part,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.039
but from others as well.

00:00:37.039 --> 00:00:41.480
My second top tip, for gymnastics or for training
or sports or

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.980
whatever it is that you want to do is hard
work.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.379
What you put into
your sport, or your hobby, or your job, is

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:49.780
what you are going to get
out of.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.079
So, you have to put in the hours, you have
to put in the hard

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.079
work.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:56.890
It is not going to be an easy job to get where
you want to be.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.969
It is a necessary thing, and it is an obvious
one as well.

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:01.269
So, hard
work is my second tip.

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:03.719
My third top tip, is targets.

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.370
Having goals.

00:01:05.370 --> 00:01:06.820
As a gymnast.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.020
We have always
been set targets and goals.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.680
And, realistic goals as well.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.350
There is no
point going out there and setting something

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:15.350
a bit ludacris.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.330
So make sure
you set your targets.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.780
Know what you need to do to be able to achieve
each

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:20.530
step and each goal.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.010
And then, obviously make you next goal and
target

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:24.330
realistic as well.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:29.830
So, my top tip for number four is, sacrifice.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.090
If you are willing to push
yourself to the next level and really start

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.380
taking your sport or whatever it
is, what you are doing very seriously, there

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.070
is going to be a level of sacrifice
involved.

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.350
For me, I spend a lot of time away from friends,
family, and going to

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.680
competitions abroad.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.410
Going to training camps, sacrificing nights
out and parties,

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.410
and things like that.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.850
All with the end goal, knowing where I wanted
to be, which

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:53.110
was the Olympic games.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:56.800
So, a big part of being successful is being
willing to

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.800
sacrifice.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:04.630
My last and final top tip, from my top five,
kind of, hints, I guess, would be,

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.680
to have fun.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.240
You'll see videos of me training and stuff,
and having a lot of fun,

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.240
during training.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.040
Obviously, there is a time and a place, and
obviously we take certain

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.760
sessions more seriously than others.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.769
It is important to enjoy what you do, and
to

00:02:18.769 --> 00:02:22.180
make yourself want to carry on doing it again
and again.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.689
For me, I think, to top it off,
is to have fun.

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:27.900
As much as you can, and really enjoy yourself.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.040
