00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
For the last few years I've become 
more and more interested in and 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
concerned about our relationship with nature.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
As individuals and as a society, 
I really feel that we as human beings 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
have become to remote from the natural world.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
I have photographed landscape 
ever since I have had a camera. 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Over 35 years now and I still 
find it endlessly beguiling, 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.000
and at times frustrating, 
but mostly inspiring. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I have used dozens of cameras, mainly film cameras 
of course, 35mm, medium formats, large format. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Now I have a Linhof Techno view camera, 
also a Phase One 645DF camera and on both 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
I'm using the Phase One IQ180.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
For a lot of the landscape photography I do, 
I tend to do quite extreme near-far focusing effects, 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
and for that kind of work 
a view camera is ideal, 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000
because of the fact that 
you can tilt the lens like this, 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and so manipulate the plane of focus. 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
And that makes it a superb instrument.
Its quite a skilled process.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:40.000
This is a Linhof Techno, a very up to date .... 
of a very old camera design, essentially. 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
It works very well with a Phase One back.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:54.000
The subjects of my latest project has the 
working title "Awakening the Senses" 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and the idea is to convey 
the physicality of nature.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Its textures and colours, 
the cold or feeling of warmth, 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
wet or dry surfaces, 
sense of space and atmosphere.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Its a pretty broad approach, really, 
but I'm aiming to get as close, 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
emotionally, as I can, and convey those 
ideas an feelings in my pictures. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Landscape photographers are 
creatures of the light. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
We often get up in the dark 
and come home in the dark, 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
because we need to use the early 
and the late light very often to get 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
certain kinds of landscape images. 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
I like to to think of it as 
going with the flow with the light. 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:53.000
You can't fight the light, it will always 
win if you try to force a situation.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I think the essence of being a successful 
and happy landscape photographer is to learn 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
the characteristics of 
the light and go with that.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.000
The tide, especially in Britain, is a really 
interesting opportunity and also a challenge 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000
to work with as a landscape photographer 
because it moves so rapidly.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:22.000
If you have a tidal reach of 5-6-7 meters, 
then especially in the mid-tides, 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
the ebbe and flow of the tide are profound.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
So an idea that looks right in one moment, 
once you've set your tripod up, 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.500
within five minutes, 
the idea will have changed. 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:36.000
You'll either be flooded out potentially, 
or the tide will have disappeared from your 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
picture and you don't have 
the water surrounding the rocks, 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
perhaps, in a way that 
would have worked previously.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Its a real tricky one.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.000
The art of working with the tide is 
to anticipate what is likely to happen.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
You have to learn to go with the 
flow just as you do with light.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.000
If you try and force the issue or make 
a picture that depends on the tide being 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.000
in the fixed position that you see now, 
you are likely to fail because its going 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.500
to change to quickly. 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.000
So learning to anticipate is the key.
