00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:07.129
Okay. Before we get started potting our plant,
I'd like to discuss some of the basic tools

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:11.679
and materials that you're going to need in
order to pot your plant. Obviously you're

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:17.130
going to need a plant to work with. And you'll
need the container that you've chosen that's

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:22.720
appropriate for the plant. Now you're going
to need a good supply of good quality potting

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:30.550
soil. Most potting soil that you get at your
local nursery or garden supply center will

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.550
be fine. As long as it's labeled potting soil.
It should have the right formulation for container

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.610
gardening. You could also mix your own potting
soil, and just making your own formulation,

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:50.239
and mixing in some compost into some used
potting soil for example. Something like that.

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:56.440
It's really helpful to have a watering can.
Rather than try to pour water out of a cup

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:03.510
or something like that, the watering can really
helps you to get that potting soil really

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.119
saturated. It can be a pour spout, or a sprinkle
shower spout. Either one is fine. But, it's

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:17.229
really a lot easier than trying to pour water
out of a glass or something like that. Now

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:25.229
I also have here gloves. You're going to need
gloves in order to do potting. If you want

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.679
to protect your hands and get prevent the
dirt from getting into your fingernails and

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:35.939
what not. These gloves are great. Disposable
gloves are easy to work with because they're

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:42.920
nice and thin, but sometimes you're going
to need a heavier work glove. Work gloves

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:48.429
are great when you're dealing with a really
sharp plant like a cactus, and I'm going to

00:01:48.429 --> 00:01:54.789
demonstrate that later. I've also got a good
supply of different sizes of rocks. Some are

00:01:54.789 --> 00:02:01.380
decorative, and some are just plain rocks.
I use the rocks for all different purposes.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.039
Especially for plugging the drainage holes,
and preventing too much soil from coming out

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:11.250
of the pot. And we've got some other various
sized rocks. We can use them for decoration

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:18.299
or propping the plant up even. And more on
that later. And I've got stakes also to prop

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:24.620
the plant up. I've got different types of
pruners and scissors. And I've got some small

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.879
hand shovels in different sizes. You'll find
that for different jobs, one shovel might

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:39.599
be way better than another shovel. So have
a couple to choose from. So, here I have described

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:44.590
most of the basic tools and materials that
you're going to need in order to pot your

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:44.750
plant.
