HONEST TRAILER : PARANORMAL ACTIVITY

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:10.990
NARRATOR
In 2009, a screening was held.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.680
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
This audience was the first to experience

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:16.289
a new horror phenomenon.

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.230
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
What they saw... left them...

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.630
BORED.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.110
REALLY, REALLY BORED.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.289
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Paranormal Activity.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.919
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Get ready to experience the cheaper, less

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:33.260
interesting version
of The Blair Witch Project.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.750
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Behold the terror of a film so easy, anyone’s

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.949
dad could have shot it.

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.760
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
And so cheap, it’s created a genre of handheld

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.760
crap.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.120
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Prepare to be terrified...

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:56.210
By a marketing department so effective, they
actually made cities demand this tedious home

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.210
movie...

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.470
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
that substitutes shaky camerawork for legitimate

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:00.470
horror.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.789
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
With a premise that they’ll milk for at

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.440
least five more movies.

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.430
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
A movie for an audience so gullible...

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.560
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
they think that a moving sheet is scary.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.220
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Featuring a guy that can’t stop acting like

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.710
a total douchebag…

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.530
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Who plans to fight an invisible demon by yelling

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:22.530
at it.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:23.530
MICAH:
“Show yourself!”

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.820
NARRATOR:
And a less hot Katy Perry, who basically just

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.850
cries a lot.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.520
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Together, they will confront the terrifying

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.869
question of why he’s filming so much.

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:33.920
KATIE:
“Put the camera away.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.299
KATIE (CONT’D)
You and your stupid camera are the problem.”

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.800
KATIE (CONT’D)
“Maybe we shouldn’t have the camera.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.110
You have to turn off the camera.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.610
Will you stop following me with the camera!”

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.740
NARRATOR:
A shocking tale where characters point out

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.740
what’s scary,

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.180
MICAH:
“Door is freaking moving by itself.”

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.740
NARRATOR:
Walk through an empty house, and sleep.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.750
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
For, like, 60 percent of the movie.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.320
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
With a mystery so deep, you’ll be constantly

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.320
asking...

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.920
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
is she hot or is it just her big boobs?

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.332
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Brace yourself for 86 minutes of…

00:02:01.332 --> 00:02:02.332
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
a Guitar.

00:02:02.332 --> 00:02:03.729

A door.

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:05.340
NARRATOR (CONT’D)

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.130

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:10.440

A chandelier.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.440
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Some Blinds.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.930
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
An attic door.

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.099
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Stairs, stairs, stairs, stairs…

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.099
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Juliet from Lost?

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:19.300

and stairs.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.300
NARRATOR (CONT’D)

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.390
NARRATOR (CONT’D)

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.580
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Paranormal activity.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.569
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
I guess I’ll go see it this Halloween.

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.140
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Nothing else is playing.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.280
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
Maybe we should friend each other on facebook.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.360
NARRATOR (CONT’D)
The link’s in the doobly-doo.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.660
