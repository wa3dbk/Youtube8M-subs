00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.030
Now, we're going to give you some general
driving instructions while towing a trailer.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.559
First thing's first, always wear your seat
belt.

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:15.769
What do you do when whipping or sway does
occur?

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:20.300
If sway or whipping does occur, always let
off the gas pedal and hold the steering wheel

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.080
in a straight ahead position.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.770
This will allow the trailer to stop swaying
naturally.

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:27.340
Never brake or speed up.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:29.810
This will make the whipping worse.

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.000
How much braking time or following distance
do I need?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.329
Your car and trailer combination is longer
and heavier than your car alone, requiring

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:40.039
more time to stop or pass.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:45.399
Always leave extra time and distance to react
or brake to a stop, when towing a trailer.

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:48.430
A good rule of thumb is to follow the four
second rule.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.300
If bad weather or poor road conditions exist,
use five seconds or more.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.470
Simply watch the vehicle in front of you as
it passes a fixed object, and count.

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:03.100
One onethousand, two onethousand, three onethousand,
four onethousand, and so on.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:08.610
A car-trailer combination also requires more
time and distance to pass.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.650
Have plenty of clear highway ahead of you
before attempting to pass another vehicle.

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.430
Never pass on hills or curves.

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.730
How do I tell going up and down a hill?

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.130
Always slow down before going down a hill.

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.740
Shift into a lower gear to help maintain your
speed, and never ride the brakes on downgrades.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.220
This will overheat the brakes and cause them
to malfunction.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.700
A good rule of thumb is to go down the hill
in the same gear that you used to go up it.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:41.090
Vehicle stability decreases when you go downhill,
and speed tries to increase.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.250
So be sure to slow down first.

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:48.850
What about turning sharp corners, like in
city traffic, or at a gas station?

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.920
Turning sharp corners requires wider than
normal turning radius to prevent the trailer

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.410
tire from hitting or running over the curb.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.060
To do this, drive slightly past your normal
turning point, then turn to the outside of

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.750
the lane you are entering.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.070
A little practice will show you how to do
this.
