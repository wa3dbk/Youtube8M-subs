00:00:13.854 --> 00:00:17.090
So we give tours to
approximately 41,000 people

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.050
every year.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.120
Our busiest months are
months of July and August,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.840
during which a lot of
families are visiting colleges

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.280
with prospective students.

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.510
In fact, over 90%
of our visitors

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.950
are prospective students
of MIT and their families.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:29.450
And.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.970
In this sense, the tours
for a lot of people

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.520
are, if not their first
impression of MIT,

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.680
one of their only
impressions of MIT.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.390
So even if these
students do go on

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.520
to get admitted and
become students here,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.390
it's oftentimes their
introduction to the school

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.416
and what it means to
be an MIT student.

00:00:45.416 --> 00:00:47.040
And what it means to
go to school here.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.180
And gives an idea
as to how important

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.700
the tours are for forming
people's outward impressions

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.960
of the school.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.530
And also in terms of correcting
the popular misconceptions

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.050
and such that MIT is
often labeled with.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.780
So, for example, when I was
looking at MIT as a school,

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.370
I pictured it as a
place where people

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.530
did science and
engineering all the time

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.385
and no one really had
any fun or even smiled.

00:01:09.385 --> 00:01:11.510
And really nothing could
be farther from the truth.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.940
So, in my tours, I really
like to show people

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.360
the MIT sense of humor and also
to talk a lot about student

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.520
life and show that
there's much more to MIT

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:20.930
than just academics.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.270
So tour guides are a
self-selected group of people.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.640
We don't actually
advertise for tour guides.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.150
Pretty much all of our guides
became part of our group

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.404
by word of mouth from
other tour guides.

00:01:31.404 --> 00:01:33.320
We have people from all
different departments,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.450
all different
majors, people who do

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.540
all sorts of different kinds
of activities outside of class.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.460
And what's cool is
that everyone who

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.070
does everything is incredibly
passionate about it.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.990
And one role that we
have as tour guides

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.360
is to share our passions
with prospective students.

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.360
So I talk a lot
about my experience

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.530
on the wrestling team and
about how that's really

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.480
been such a great
thing for me to do,

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.150
in addition to my academics
and help balance that out.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.327
But my fellow tour guides
will talk about theater,

00:01:58.327 --> 00:02:00.410
they'll talk about arts,
they'll talk about music.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:01.868
And I think that's
one thing that's

00:02:01.868 --> 00:02:04.310
so great about having such a
diverse set of tour guides,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:07.130
that we really represent all
the different range of interests

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.960
that students have
across the Institute.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.860
So we can really give people
a well-rounded perspective.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.350
Right now, we are
standing in Lobby 7.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.470
This is actually where a
lot of our tours depart.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.290
So this is actually one of
my favorite places at MIT.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.300
And it's a place that
I really actually love

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.910
talking to people about
when I give my tours.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.150
This is also normally where I
talk about the history of MIT.

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.490
Because this is where the
replica of the MIT seal is.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.790
And also, this is where
the information office is.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.430
So a lot of our tours will
definitely stop through here.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:40.340
And I think this provides
a very good starting point

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.900
for a lot of tours.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.840
It provides a good way
of dividing the campus

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.800
into two sides.

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:48.380
One side that's very residential
and the other side that's

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.460
completely academic.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.700
All right, so if you
want to head this way,

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.670
the next stop on our tour is
going to be Killian Court.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.240
So this is actually another one
of my favorite places at MIT.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.180
And if you've ever
been on MIT's website

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.010
or if you've ever seen
a postcard of MIT,

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.290
you've probably seen this shot.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.630
So one of my favorite
parts of the tour

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.960
is the ability to tell a few
stories about MIT's history,

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.065
whether they be about our
campus itself, or some

00:03:15.065 --> 00:03:17.360
of our famous hacks,
or things like that.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:19.820
I think it adds another
dimension to the tour,

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.810
and really gets the group
involved with the tour itself.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:26.810
And it's not like you're
just pointing out landmarks

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.440
and giving out random trivia.

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.355
You're involving them in
a little piece of the MIT

00:03:32.355 --> 00:03:32.855
experience.

00:03:32.855 --> 00:03:35.420
So now we're going to go ahead
and talk about athletics.

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:37.400
This building right
next to me over here

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.360
is the Z Center, MIT's
main athletic facilities.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.790
We actually have 33
different varsity sports,

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:45.440
which is the most
out of any division 3

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.850
institution in the country.

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.220
And we have everything from
field hockey and football

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:50.990
to water polo and fencing.

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:54.320
A lot of people think
that MIT is nerdy.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.110
Or that everybody just
studies all the time

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:58.880
and doesn't do anything else.

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.070
And it's really great when I
can give a tour to somebody,

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:06.830
and I can watch them change
as I'm talking to them.

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.170
I watch their
self-confidence rise

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.480
as I tell them what I looked
like when I was in high school.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.040
And I really think that one
of the best parts about being

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.930
a tour guide is that
you really get to change

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:22.357
the way people see MIT.

00:04:22.357 --> 00:04:24.440
The one thing that's cool
about being a tour guide

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:25.986
is every single tour
you give, you're

00:04:25.986 --> 00:04:27.860
going to be with a
different group of people.

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.350
And so you really get a
sense of the number of people

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:31.750
who are interested in MIT.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.360
We can literally have 300
students signed up for one tour

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:38.420
and we'll fill up the
entire main lobby of MIT.

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:40.334
And we'll have 15
different tour guides there

00:04:40.334 --> 00:04:42.500
and we'll have to divide
up all the groups of people

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.270
into different ones
and organize it.

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:46.550
And it can be a little bit
of a logistics challenge.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:48.080
So it's kind of
fun, and it really

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.300
does give you a sense of
MIT's place in the world.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:53.680
And just how lucky
we are to be here.
