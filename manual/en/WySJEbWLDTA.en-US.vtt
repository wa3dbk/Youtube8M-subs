00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:10.000
Tankmen's novels.

00:00:13.501 --> 00:00:19.000
Developments in Europe made the Americans construct severe and powerful tanks, that would make the enemies shudder with horror.

00:00:20.001 --> 00:00:29.000
Eventually, we have considered the experience of the previous failures, put away all the unnecessary stuff and kept only the tower and the track...

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:33.000
... added a pinch of armor. It's rather heavy, but that way of doing it.

00:00:33.001 --> 00:00:35.000
Ok, John, start the engine.

00:00:38.001 --> 00:00:39.000
John, let's go!

00:00:39.001 --> 00:00:41.000
Jason, we are already going!

00:00:41.001 --> 00:00:43.000
Do you really think so?

00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:47.000
Guy's, you don't move. The tank turnes the planet!

00:00:47.001 --> 00:00:49.000
Examine it, find the decision and go to the battle!

00:00:49.001 --> 00:00:50.000
Sir, yeas Sir!

00:00:52.001 --> 00:00:56.000
Assault superheavy tank for unhurried justice and democracy propagation!

00:00:56.001 --> 00:00:59.000
Destructive firepower... if it reaches...

00:00:59.001 --> 00:01:01.000
Yearly subscription of crosswords presented!

00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:07.000
Guys, we're going for two days already! The Cola is off.

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:09.000
Jason, where are you going?

00:01:09.001 --> 00:01:13.000
I'll go to McDonalds, while we are still not far from the base. I'll be in a moment!

00:01:13.001 --> 00:01:17.000
Ok, and take a couple of hamburgers for me. And we'll play the badminton meanwhile.

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:25.000
...and then he said: "We'll give you a double helmet"! Haha, but the helmet hadn't help.

00:01:25.001 --> 00:01:30.000
So, it remained only to put the carrot into the nose, and the installation of the snowman on the tank will be completed!

00:01:32.001 --> 00:01:35.000
It's so hot! George, are we still far from Germany?

00:01:35.501 --> 00:01:37.000
oh, I don't know, Jason.

00:01:37.001 --> 00:01:41.000
4 years later...

00:01:53.001 --> 00:01:55.000
We need to look around. Where we are?

00:01:55.001 --> 00:01:59.000
Oh, hello, chieftain! Can you tell us where Reichstag, Berlin, Germany are?

00:01:59.001 --> 00:02:02.000
We don't know the way to go there.

00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:07.000
Iron tortoise' children! Firstly, you have to reverse you direction. Secondly, it is in Europe.

00:02:07.001 --> 00:02:09.000
I've understand, thank you!

00:02:09.001 --> 00:02:14.000
John, turn the planet to the other side! We'll pop by at the base and specify it.

00:02:18.001 --> 00:02:21.000
Hey, what are you doing here? It's the military base!

00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:25.000
Yo, I'm hippy, bro. Relax!

00:02:25.001 --> 00:02:29.000
Th ebase was closed about 15 years ago, after the Second World War had been finished.

00:02:29.001 --> 00:02:31.000
But I've heard, your people are in Vietnam, I guess.

00:02:31.001 --> 00:02:33.000
Vietnam? Where is it?

00:02:33.001 --> 00:02:37.000
Bro, it's on the other side. I think it's somewhere near Asia.

00:02:37.001 --> 00:02:39.000
Jason, what does this shaggy say?

00:02:39.001 --> 00:02:41.000
John, turn it back!

00:02:41.001 --> 00:02:44.000
Peace with you, brothers! And with your tank!

00:02:57.001 --> 00:03:02.000
Guys, don'be nervous, but it seems that we were going with hand-brake turned on all this time.

00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:05.000
Yeah, there is the second speed here!
