Hi! My name is Frank and what we’re going
to look at in this clip is a very unique style:

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.540
it’s the jazz style. We’re going to look
at different patterns, but mainly the thing

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:14.820
that sets it apart from most of the other
styles we’ve looked at in other clips—you

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:23.140
can go check them out; let’s see rock, there’s
funk, some Latin things—but in jazz everything’s

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:32.279
swinging 123 123 123 123 you can speed up
that 123 but it’s all pretty much based

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:41.040
in three. So if you count right now in three
1231231231231231231 then you’re going to

00:00:41.040 --> 00:01:00.770
find the basis for all the patterns you’ll
play in jazz, 1231231231231231231231231231231231231231231231231231.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.331
So those subdivisions, which is what they’re
called, are in triplets; that’s what we

00:01:05.331 --> 00:01:10.960
call them, triplet beats. So speed up the
tempo and you got different patterns. That

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.230
pattern there’s a big joke; it just sounds
like, sping, sping-a-ling, sping-a-ling that’s

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:24.740
what the right cymbal’s doing…you’ll
notice that in another clip I go into much

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.050
more detail; it’s a lot of French grip over
here on the ride cymbal, especially in jazz

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:42.380
music, where it’s not about power it’s
about finesse. We’ve also started employing

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:50.300
the hi-hat just doing chicks, loud two and
four on the hi-hat…1 3 1 3 put them together;

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:55.600
that’s the main part of jazz. The snare
drum and the bass drum in rock, those are

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:17.560
huge; in jazz, much lower down in the mix.
Don’t be the drummer who goes up to a jazz

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:34.120
gig and sounds like a rock guy like this…that’s
just not swinging. So if you’re wanting

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:42.280
to swing, keep it in the hands on cymbals,
but everybody submits to that 123123123123123123,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.840
listen to a lot of jazz; that’s what’s
going to get you swinging the hardest.
