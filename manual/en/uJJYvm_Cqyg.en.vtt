00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.700
Hello I'm Alana, and welcome back to Mall
Hauls hauls on HaulRox.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.990
So I've been to Primark for you guys.

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:13.420
I know you wanted some cheaper hauls, some
bargain pieces, so I've gone to Primark and

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:19.741
I'll show you what I got.

00:00:19.741 --> 00:00:24.070
I have picked up this amazing cover for your
tablets.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.530
It was only four pounds, so it just shows
you don't have to spend a fortune on a case.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:35.820
Um, this one is so fun, it's got semi-bright
colors, it's kind of a tribaly print I guess.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.219
I really like it because its kind of.

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.489
You can your personality to your, to your
tablet.

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:43.170
How cool is this rucksack?

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.989
Um, this is obviously from Primark again.

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:48.319
Uh, but it was nine pounds.

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:50.530
They have these in loads of different colors.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.329
Tassle are quite in this season.

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:55.289
And i really like check, so that's why I picked
this one.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:01:00.519
Perfect for I don't know your school books,
everyday weekend.

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.339
It's huge as well so it fits so much in.

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:05.019
I really like a standout blazer.

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:11.180
This one was only fifteen pounds, and it's
that kind of like a sweatshirt kind of material.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.350
So it is definitely a casual blazer.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.869
They have these in Primark in every color,
you name it, under the rainbow.

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.009
They have it.

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:20.219
Really really nice little number.

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:24.090
I will definitely wear this in the day time,
with like a pair of jeans.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.689
I also really like the shoulder pads inside.

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:28.689
It gives it a little bit more structure.

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:32.390
Those kind of like baseball, American style
t-shirts are everywhere.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.100
They are so in fashion.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.609
Um, I like this one.

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:38.340
It's only six pounds, so its super super cheap.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.340
And its really like over sized t-shirt.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.049
I will probably wear this to bed as well.

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:44.250
Its quite like a good night tarp.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.729
Very very american style.

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.329
I know TopShop have very similar tops to this
at the moment.

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.439
Um, for six pounds though this is really really
good value for money.

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.929
I personally love this top.

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:01.159
I picked up this denim pinafore . Uh it was
only twelve pounds which I thought was really

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.431
good value for the money for how good like
of a fabric it is.

00:02:04.431 --> 00:02:06.090
It's actually real denim.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.899
These are super super girl, and so so cute.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:09.920
I really like them.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.370
Um, for awesome winter I would wear this with
probably like some tights or a long sleeve

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.370
top underneath.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.580
A big chunky necklace would look really cool
as well.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.060
And what I really like about piniful dresses
is are they suit all body shapes, because

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.540
they're just really girly.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.560
I would not get anywhere without a water bottle
in my hand bag.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.010
Especially if im on a public transport and
I'm so thirsty.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.940
I get really like, ah, all hot and bothered.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:34.940
So I picked up this.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:36.920
It's only two pounds from Primark.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.410
Bit of a random bit of a random one from Primark,
but I thought I would include it in this one.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:46.540
And I thought as it's getting a little bit
more chilly, I would get a woolly hat.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.099
But this one was really cool because its so
bright and its got a really cool pattern on

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:51.099
it as well.

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.590
How cute is this little bobble on top.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:53.590
I like that.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.069
Let me try it on.

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:56.180
If I can.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.340
but, I thought it was quite cute.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.440
But I thought it was quite cute, quite sweet
for winter.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.890
I need to practice wearing it a few more times.

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:05.739
I'm not very used to wearing hats.

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:09.630
All of the bits I that I got from Primark
I will put in the description box bellow.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.400
