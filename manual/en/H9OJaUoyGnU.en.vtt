00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.879
Our first technique is going to be a basic
3 strand braid. You can do this with any parting

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:19.999
size or a whole head of hair, whatever. We're
going to first break the section down into

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:31.890
three individual partings like so. The technique
to braiding is crossing each side to the middle

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:39.600
so what we're going to do is take the right
side right here, we're going to hold all three

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:45.010
in our fingers like this. We're going to take
this right one, cross it over the middle and

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:54.640
take it to the middle. Next we're going to
grab the left side; cross it over and bring

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:00.640
it to the middle while bringing the middle
to that side so basically what we're doing

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.670
is we're taking the side and bringing it to
the middle and the middle bringing it to that

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:14.700
side, taking this side bringing it to the
middle and taking that one to that side. So

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:26.880
now wrap over to the middle; over to the middle,
right to the middle; left to the middle and

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:35.650
you're constantly moving the middle to either
side, to that side; to that side, to that

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:44.890
side, to that side; that side, that side.
You also at the same time you want to smooth

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:52.680
the hair between the fingers so all the little
strands also get braided in; right middle

00:01:52.680 --> 00:02:00.450
left middle, right middle; middle right, left
middle so you're going to grab it with your

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:10.500
thumb and pointer finger and bring it to the
middle keeping the braid flat as you go. You

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:31.230
can just keep going down until you're finished
like so. You can do the exact same braid underhanded;

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:37.830
take another parting, I like to do a C shaping
because it's easy and pretty; it stays pretty

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.901
much the same, you can get a pretty even look
all over. Once again you want to divide it

00:02:44.901 --> 00:02:53.030
into three section; 1 2 3 and instead of going
over to the middle you're going to go under

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.650
to the middle, and bring the middle to the
side; you reach under to the middle and that

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:09.459
one goes to the left side, grab to the middle;
grab to the middle, grab to the middle; grab

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:20.330
to the middle, grab to the middle. And once
you get that technique you can move a little

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:33.860
faster; keeping the braid flat as you go,
you can also turn your hands around the other

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:41.491
way to finish the braid side again, see each
section when your going under; under; under,

00:03:41.491 --> 00:03:41.502
under; under, under; under, under.
