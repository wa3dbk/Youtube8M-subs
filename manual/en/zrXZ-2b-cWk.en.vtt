00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.690
hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.190
welcome back to another session of
cooking with technology using Phillips

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.190
where each one of you can be super chef

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.369
you know some of you have asked me if we can make muffin using philips air fryer

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.230
yes we can and it is very easy so today
I'm going to show you a very simple

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.460
method, a recipe also to make the muffins
and in this

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.309
I'm taking a hundred grams of butter and
in this take hundred grams of icing

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:44.690
sugar powdered sugar and we're going to
use the Phillips hand blender too nicely

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.540
cream this whenever I cream it with the
hand

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:52.219
it takes a lot of time and it's painful
and you'll never get the real nice

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.949
aeriation in the butter and sugar
mixture but with the hand blender life

00:00:57.949 --> 00:00:59.480
has become very easy

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.610
so just run the hand blender in no time

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.470
this powder sugar and the butter will be
creamed with the Phillips hand blender

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.350
you can cream the butter and powdered
sugar very easily

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.729
now in this i'm going to add some vanilla essence and also we're going to add

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.030
egg but just beat the egg and add very little at a time

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.380
just little bit and then we're going to cream it

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.720
that way it will be mixed nicely

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.090
yeah

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:39.789
okay just make sure take a spatula and
remove off the sides and put it in the

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:45.100
center and once again keep adding the egg little by little and finish all of

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.679
it and mix it well, now look at this very
well creamed and not cuddled

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:56.950
so now here I've got you know same
hundred grams of flour in this add pinch

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:04.659
of baking powder, in this add 50 grams of
oats and also add raisins

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.399
ok and before you add this into that

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:15.010
just mix this flour, oats and raisins well if you want you can also add nuts

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.060
dry fruits to this but just making it with oats today

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.299
this oats is nicely mixed to the flour and here I've got the mixture and

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:29.829
we're going to do you know folding method where we're going to add the

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:37.150
flour you can add the entire thing at one
time and now we're going to cut and fold

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.690
that means just cut it like this and fold
it

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.370
so like this and fold it just keep doing like this till all the flour is

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.260
absorbed by this mixture once this mixture is nicely mixed we're going to put

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.560
this mixture into the muffin moulds

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.480
now we're going to put the muffin
mixture into the mold

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.829
ok if you have smaller moulds you can
make lot of them in this

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.440
that should be good just make sure that
you drop in this picture

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.440
just two spins of mixture should be
good enough so that this becomes full

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:16.450
and nice ok

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:20.049
that should be good now

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.049
preheat the airfryer for

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:29.350
three minutes at 180 degrees centigrade
you know once it is preheated pull the

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:30.520
basket out

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.790
just put this muffin

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:39.400
moulds in here and just put them in

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.990
and now at 180 degree centigrade
for around 10 minutes you will have

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:50.740
awesome muffins ready, after around 10
minutes we're going to check the muffins

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:59.380
