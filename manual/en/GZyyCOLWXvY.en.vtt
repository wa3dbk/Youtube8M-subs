Hello everyone, it's Adam A Comedy.
Today I'm going to show you how to get unlimited

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.190
free trials on Xfinity Wi-Fi.
I'm sorry to say that you can't do this on

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:17.050
Apple iOS devices, but it may be possible
on jailbroken ones.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:22.400
Comcast has been putting out software updates
to residential subscribers' routers.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:29.189
The router then broadcasts two networks, their
secure home network, and an open Xfinity Wi-Fi

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.770
network.
Certain Comcast subscribers can use this Xfinity

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.830
Wi-Fi network for free.
However, if you are not a Comcast subscriber,

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:44.730
you can get a 1 hour free trial at most Xfinity
Wi-Fi hotspots.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.170
There is a limit of two 1 hour free trials
per month, and they must be at least 24 hours

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.990
apart.
Comcast saves your computer's MAC address

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.900
to prevent you from using more free trials.
On Windows computers, it is possible to change

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:05.259
a MAC address.
I believe that it is also possible to do this

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:10.689
on Linux, Xbox, Android, and Macintosh.
In this video, I'm only going to show you

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:15.420
how to change a MAC address on a Windows computer,
so you'll need to look elsewhere if you're

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.409
not using Windows.
Now, there are several ways to change a MAC

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.460
address on Windows computers.
In this video, I will show you what I think

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.259
is the easiest way.
Click the link in the description to download

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.929
a free program called Technitium MAC Address
Changer.

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:37.459
When you click the link in the description
it will bring you to this page.

00:01:37.459 --> 00:01:49.090
You want to click "Download Now".
It's gonna download it as a zip folder, so

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:59.579
open the zip folder.
And you have the setup program, you're gonna

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:15.600
want to run that.
So, go through the installation.

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:24.200
And then click "Finish".
After your complementary session, you're gonna

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:29.630
want to run the Technitium MAC Address Changer
program.

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:38.280
So, it you go to your start menu and search
"TMAC", it should show up.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:50.910
It'll also be on the desktop.
So, click it to run the program.

00:02:50.910 --> 00:03:03.780
And it'll take a little while to start up.
So, once it's open, you want to go down to

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:15.270
"Wi-Fi", click on it, and then click "Random
MAC Address".

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:22.470
Make sure the three boxes below are checked.
Then click "Change Now".

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.850
It'll take a few seconds for your computer
to change the MAC address, and it will disconnect

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:33.840
from the Wi-Fi network.
And then you will have to go in and reconnect

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:38.690
to the Wi-Fi network.
Now it's not showing up for me because I was

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:45.760
connected to an Xfinity Wi-Fi hotspot that
was coming from a neighbor's house.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.800
The signal was not very strong and obviously
it dropped it.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:55.590
But, you should be able to reconnect to the
network and go through the login thing.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:00.790
It will ask for an email address.
However, I've found that it does not need

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.780
verification, and you can just put any phony
email address you want.

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:12.180
So, that's how you get unlimited Xfinity Wi-Fi.
Now, sadly, yes, you will have to do that

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:17.850
every hour to stay on.
But, if you really need internet it's not

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.930
that big of a hassle.

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:29.970
