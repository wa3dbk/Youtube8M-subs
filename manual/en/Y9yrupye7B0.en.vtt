00:00:01.289 --> 00:00:03.207
What do you want to talk to me about?

00:00:03.415 --> 00:00:07.378
When you got to the majors,
you played only one inning of one game.

00:00:07.503 --> 00:00:09.504
What happened with you?

00:00:10.464 --> 00:00:12.716
It was the last day of the season.

00:00:12.841 --> 00:00:15.220
Bottom of the eighth inning,
we were way ahead.

00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:19.556
I'd been up with the club for three weeks,
but I hadn't seen any action.

00:00:19.681 --> 00:00:23.019
Suddenly old John McGraw
points a bony finger in my direction...

00:00:23.144 --> 00:00:25.062
...and he says, "Right field."

00:00:26.313 --> 00:00:28.899
I jumped up like I was sitting on a spring.

00:00:29.024 --> 00:00:32.986
Grabbed my glove, and ran out on the field.

00:00:35.614 --> 00:00:37.699
Did you get to make a play?

00:00:37.824 --> 00:00:40.744
They never hit the ball out of the infield.

00:00:42.246 --> 00:00:44.998
The game ended. The season was over.

00:00:45.582 --> 00:00:47.960
I knew they'd send me back down.

00:00:48.502 --> 00:00:51.797
I couldn't bear the thought
of another year in the minors.

00:00:52.005 --> 00:00:54.966
So I decided to hang them up.

00:00:57.594 --> 00:01:00.055
- Go on. Sit down.
- Thank you.

00:01:02.265 --> 00:01:04.184
So what was that like?

00:01:06.436 --> 00:01:09.605
It was like coming this close
to your dreams...

00:01:10.022 --> 00:01:13.860
...and then watching them brush past you,
like a stranger in a crowd.

00:01:13.986 --> 00:01:15.820
At the time, you don't think much of it.

00:01:15.945 --> 00:01:19.448
We don't recognize our most significant
moments while they're happening.

00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:23.452
Back then I thought,
"Well, there'll be other days."

00:01:23.744 --> 00:01:26.581
I didn't realize that was the only day.

00:01:28.542 --> 00:01:31.711
And now, I want to ask you a question.

00:01:32.712 --> 00:01:37.133
What's so interesting about half an inning
that would make you come from Iowa...

00:01:37.258 --> 00:01:40.094
...to talk to me about it
50 years after it happened.

00:01:41.637 --> 00:01:44.347
I didn't really know till just now...

00:01:45.433 --> 00:01:49.437
...but I think it's to ask you,
if you could do anything you wanted...

00:01:49.604 --> 00:01:51.980
...if you could have a wish...

00:01:55.735 --> 00:01:58.987
And you're the kind of man
who could grant me that wish?

00:02:00.322 --> 00:02:02.992
I don't know. I'm just asking.

00:02:04.827 --> 00:02:09.039
You know,
I never got to bat in the major leagues.

00:02:09.331 --> 00:02:12.210
I'd have liked to have had that chance,
just once...

00:02:12.418 --> 00:02:14.753
...to stare down a big-league pitcher.

00:02:14.878 --> 00:02:19.175
Stare him down,
then just as he goes into his windup, wink.

00:02:19.759 --> 00:02:22.177
Make him think you know
something he doesn't.

00:02:22.302 --> 00:02:24.012
That's what I wish for.

00:02:24.137 --> 00:02:28.058
The chance to squint at a sky so blue
that it hurts your eyes to look at it.

00:02:28.183 --> 00:02:31.102
To feel the tingle in your arms
as you connect with the ball.

00:02:31.228 --> 00:02:33.772
To run the bases,
stretch a double into a triple...

00:02:33.897 --> 00:02:36.566
...and flop face first into third.

00:02:36.733 --> 00:02:39.069
Wrap your arms around the bag.

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:40.820
That's my wish.

00:02:44.241 --> 00:02:47.327
Is there enough magic out there
in the moonlight...

00:02:47.452 --> 00:02:49.162
...to make this dream come true?

00:02:49.912 --> 00:02:54.834
- What would you say if I said yes?
- I think I'd actually believe you.
