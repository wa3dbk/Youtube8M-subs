Like what?

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:11.135
Mountain time.

00:00:11.135 --> 00:00:11.960
-Yay!

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.610
Do we get to see a mountain?

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.470
-No.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:16.165
-Awww.

00:00:16.165 --> 00:00:19.000
You're not a very good dad.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.460
-It's one more than Central,
but not yet Pacific.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.380
-Oh, well, how much
does it advance?

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.356
-Uh, two hours.

00:00:27.356 --> 00:00:28.310
-Two hours?

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.500
-Yeah, it's not the greatest
thing in the world, but--

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.860
-It's not really that
impressive.

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:33.740
-It's OK.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.570
I mean, come on.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.600
This is a fun day.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:39.060
-Dad, does--

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.700
where are we even going?

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.060
-Uh, I gotta be honest
with you, kids.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.690
Your mother asked us to leave.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.180
-She asked you to leave!

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.740
-We, well--

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:53.100
-She didn't ask us to leave.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.250
-She told me to take you guys.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.010
-No she didn't.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.565
She said, don't take them.

00:00:57.565 --> 00:00:59.010
They're staying here.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.630
And you hit her, and now
we're in this car--

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.230

All right.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.319
Do you kids want McDonald's

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:06.410

to stop if you keep--

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.390

Burger King either.

00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:10.510

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.930
-We're going to Dairy Queen.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:12.770
That's what you get.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:14.390
-Oh, I actually wanted
that anyway.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.750
-Oh, you want Dairy Queen?

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.270
Really?

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:17.630
-Yeah, it was a big cop-out.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.720
-Yeah, well no Blizzard.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:22.070

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.900
Fine.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.010
You guys can have one Blizzard
and share it.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.370
I'm not getting one for both of
you 'cause I don't have a

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.176
