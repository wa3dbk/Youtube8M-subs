Hi, my name is Dave Andrews. Today I'm going
to show you how to convert from Excel to comma

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:19.330
separated text. Let's open up Excel by clicking
on our start button. We go to all programs,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:29.450
let's find Microsoft Office, then we're going
to open up Excel. I'm going to basically type

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:38.149
some data on here, let's say you got a list
of employees. Let's just put some names and

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:46.449
their sales and these are really simple spreadsheet.
Now we want to save this as a comma separated

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.399
text file which is a different way of representing
data in a spreadsheet. It actually takes it

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:58.249
out of Excel format and puts it into a text
format. In each of these cells and rows are

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:05.780
separated by a comma. This is real good for
transferring data between applications because

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.350
it puts in a very simple format, it's easy
to read. So let's save this as a comma separated

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:18.640
by clicking on our Office button, go to save
as and I'm going to scroll down to the bottom

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:27.380
here and we're going to select other formats.
Now at the very bottom of your save screen,

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.000
it's at the top here because of my resolution,
but we're going to select save as type and

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:40.400
we're going to say CSV or Comma delimited.
I'm going to put this on my desktop and I'm

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:48.880
going to call it Book 1 saving as a CSV file.
Now it's going to warn you that CSV files

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.990
do not support multiple sheets and that Excel
won't be able to open it up with multiple

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.130
sheets anymore. I'm okay with that so I'm
just going to click okay. It's going to tell

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:03.560
you also that CSV has features or rather the
Excel version of this has features that CSV

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.170
or comma separated doesn't support. It asked
you if you want to continue saving, just say

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:17.810
yes. Our file has been saved and let's go
to our desktop. As you can see we have now

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:26.330
a Book1.CSV. If I open that up, that opens
up in notepad because it's just plain text.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.670
As you can see our columns have been converted
into text and they're separated now by a comma.

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:40.480
My name is Dave Andrews and I've showed you
how to convert from Excel to comma separated

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.010
values.
