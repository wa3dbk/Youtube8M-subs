Hi. This is Scott Smith with Expert Village.
Right now we're going to talk about guitars

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:14.789
and how they've changed over the past number
of years. The guitar that our grand masters

00:00:14.789 --> 00:00:22.019
would be most familiar with would be a softer
sounding string made of cat gut, which today

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:37.660
would be nylon, and it has a very pretty sound.
So, that is a nylon string guitar sound. As

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:44.480
we change these sounds around, as we use the
full capability of these keyboards, you can

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:56.399
hear twelve string guitars.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:15.760
And, we can get a little funky with it. We
can add clavinet with a guitar.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:37.110
And we don't want to forget good old, heavy
metal guitar.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:42.350
So, if you're composing and you have keyboards,
you don't have to do all you?re composing

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.590
on a guitar. This makes a lot of guitar players
pretty upset, but you have the ability to

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.490
play all the instruments in the orchestra,
and all the contemporary instruments of modern

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.520
day rock and roll, just with your keyboards
today.
