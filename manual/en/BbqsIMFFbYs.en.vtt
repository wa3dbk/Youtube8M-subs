Hello everyone this is Breanna Rutter author
of the book the natural hair Bible and founder

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.240
of howtoblackhair.com and for these special
videos I love to answer all of the questions

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.410
you all send me via email so any of you have
any questions you like for me to answer be

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.419
sure to check out the description box below
for additional information so without further

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:35.920
ado are going to jump right into the video
in this video is inspired by email I received

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.850
from Morgan, Morgan emailed me because she
really wants to dye her hair a dark blonde

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.920
color but she is deathly afraid of suffering
hair damage so she wants to know if hair dye

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.359
is damaging on her hair and if she should
go ahead and dye her hair and if it will still

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.629
be healthy so what I want to do is to give
you some tips and suggestions and hair care

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.629
advice by helping you in regards to dying
your hair and yes of course you can still

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:10.280
have healthy hair as well so first what I
want to address is that yes inherently hair

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.720
dye is damaging to hair but when you dye your
hair that doesn't mean you're going to suffer

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.430
with hair damage so what I mean by this is
by nature any chemical treatments you're going

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:28.720
to put once your hair is damage on your hair
is inflicting damage on your hair so even

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.680
if your dying your hair to achieve a different
color your chemically altering the state of

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.400
your hair so your hair is going to be stripped
and its defense is going to be weakened in

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.061
different ways so what's going to happen is
when hair dye is being put onto your hair

00:01:45.061 --> 00:01:49.500
whatâ€™s going on is that the hair dye is
reaching deep inside the hair shaft or hair

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.680
follicle and it's replacing your natural melanin
color that's already in your hair with a new

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.130
color because this treatment is so invasive
on your hair this often leads you to lose

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.090
in some natural protein that makes up the
structure of your hair and also this chemical

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.000
treatment is going to weaken your hair's ability
to be able to maintain moisture so when you

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.130
dye your hair its always common that you follow-up
some type of deep conditioning treatment or

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.590
protein treatment to get your hair back to
a healthy state so yes by nature hair dye

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:30.560
is damaging because it's a chemical treatment
that you're putting on your hair and then

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.070
at the same time you can still have healthy
hair if you follow-up with the right practices

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:42.230
to make sure that you're going to have well
moisturized and balanced hair with protein

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:49.760
as well so another tip that I'm going to give
is that I highly discouraging you or anyone

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.040
to dye their hair if you know you are lazy
when it comes to taking care of your hair

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.250
if you know you're not sleeping at night with
a silk scarf all the time for you adding moisture

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.900
to your hair when its all extra dry or you're
not manipulating your hair properly and you

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.170
are just rushing through your hair if you
know you already have bad haircare practices

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:16.010
dying your hair will only worsen the troubles
so if you're the sole person that takes care

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.430
of your hair and you're very good at doing
these things make sure your consulting with

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:25.580
a professional in your area to dye your hair
for you and to give you some extra tips as

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:29.620
well to help you to take care of your hair
but of course you are just going to make sure

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.390
that you are following up with proper treatments
to care for your hair even though it's dyed

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.750
and also if someone else's dying your hair
for you consult with them on what color will

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.080
go best with your complexion and some things
that they suggest for you to do specifically

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:50.260
to help you with your specific hair needs
whether or not you choose to dye your hair

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.180
or not and last but not least tip number three
remember to keep in mind how light your hair

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.530
color will be and the strength of the color
lift because this can cause damage on your

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:07.090
hair so if you're going to lose very light
colors especially those blonde colors what

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:12.959
you're doing is a your pretty much a bleaching
your hair to achieve a certain level of brightness

00:04:12.959 --> 00:04:18.370
and also if you choose to do other vibrant
colors like reds and blues or even greens

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:23.889
what you have to do is bleach your hair to
take out that melanin deposit and have pretty

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:30.270
much a blank white canvas to deposit a color
that you would like so by bleaching your hair

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:36.270
this is going to inflict a lot of damage on
your strands and you specifically wanted to

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.289
know in regards to hair dye because you want
to dye your hair a dark blonde color so you're

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.849
pretty much going to be stepping into the
area of a permanent hair color treatment but

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:54.120
there's plenty of other options as well like
semi-permanent rinses and even natural plant

00:04:54.120 --> 00:05:00.099
dies you can do with your hair so because
you're going into the realm of doing a chemical

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:05.909
not chemical by a permanent hair color on
your hair you want to make sure that you are

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:12.449
doing the necessary steps keep your hair moisturized
and balanced as well with protein and keep

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:18.419
in mind that yes by nature hair dye is causing
damage but that doesn't mean you're going

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:22.569
to have damage here because you dyed your
hair just going to make sure you're taking

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:27.330
care of your hair and in the meantime so i
hoped this video has helped you to give you

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:31.460
