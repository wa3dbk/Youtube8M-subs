00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.260
we love it basketball~

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.260
they're playing basketball~

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.120
we love it basketball~

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.880
-when did you buy your "chicago bulls" jersey? 

00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:23.814
this?

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:25.226
2 years ago,

00:00:26.053 --> 00:00:28.693
i bought this in Itaewon, Seoul, Korea.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.487
i'm sorry,everybody. this is imitation. i'm sorry to Adidas staffs.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:33.920
this is imitation, i'm sorry.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:48.440
basketball dribble moves of Derrick Rose, Allen Iverson, dribblers like you,etc... 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.400
 the moves look like dance.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.580
there are rhythm and groove.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.260
- that is exciting point of basketball. to move gently and dribble with a rolling gait.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.934
-basketball is HIP-HOP.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.380
BASKETBALL AND HIP-HOP ARE NOT TWO!

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.340
oh, you have a reason, both are the exclusive property of black people, almost.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.220
- i told you "one"!

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.260
- absolutely, one!

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.860
plus, there is always hip-hop music in basketball time.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.960
it is bizarre that ROCK music is played in basketball time.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.040
- imagine! JAZZ music is played...

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.960
IMAGINE!  KOREAN silent BALLAD music is played in basketball time.... hahaha

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.900
basketball moves are very dynamic, but if BGM would be korean silent BALLAD... hahahaha 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.140
ah, that would be funny!

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.640
let's try to add BGM, later!

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.580
lyric : "everyday with you~"

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.780
today i felt " dribble is basis". i'm not good at dribble. 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.820
- i couldn't dribble well today, neither. because of not playing so long time.

00:02:16.994 --> 00:02:24.174
today i felt that i'm not good at dribble.everytime i dribble, the ball was slipped and missed. 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.580
when the professional players do so large movement, the ball sticks always on their hands.

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:46.060
even though my hands are small and i cannot grab by one hand, i wanna do many various skills, but now, i can't.

00:02:46.653 --> 00:02:47.853
- than the ball size...

00:02:48.173 --> 00:02:50.213
my hand is smaller than the ball size?

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.360
but my hand is not small for a girl...

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:54.440
- your face is too smaller than the ball size.

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.860
someone who doesn't have a smaller face than basketball size, is very bizzare!

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.260
- for example, SHAQUILLE O'NEAL! basketball is not bigger enough than his body size!

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.700
to him, basketball looks HANDBALL size.
