00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.920
so we have seen a major scale and
another way of exploring the major scale

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.660
is just by playing it in intervals ... what's called diatonic intervals

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:20.419
within the
scale which means all the thirds major and

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:26.059
minor it doesen't matter or on the fourths
all the intervals or fourth or the notes

00:00:26.059 --> 00:00:31.759
that far apart by an interval fourth or the
fifths contained within that scale I'll

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:41.120
just make an example this is C major and
now I want to play that scale with in

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.180
thirds which means playing start for the
first note and then playing the second

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:54.530
note which is a third above and starting
from the second note of the scale and

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:01.430
playing the one that sits a third above
this is D and F third note of the scale

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:13.880
E then the third
above which is G and so on for playing in

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.780
the same position

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.909
okay so these are whole the thirds
contained in C major

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.340
I will do the the same playing all the fourths so
now the second note will be a fourth

00:01:29.340 --> 00:02:02.000
fourth apart so it will be C and F, D and G E and A, and so on...5ths are C and G , D and A and so on...

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:10.090
I can have sixths I can do the same
for all the other intervals although you

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.520
know the sixth seventh and so on up to
the upper extensions how to use it and

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:25.060
solos? I think a good way is to play
a solo where you play mostly only thirds

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.270
or only fourths and so on actually
certain intervals are specific of a

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.600
certain jazz style
... fourth you'll instantly

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:43.570
recognize solos by McCoy Tyner
like hard bop style the players but

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.709
again these are concepts that you can use in any style I'll just play over a

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:54.730
jazz track but again this is good for
any style so I'll do to go I'll play

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.910
over two five one in C and I'll start
just by playing mostly intervals of a

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:06.480
third you'll recognize right away the
sound of that interval

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:38.630
and so on...
so now I'll do the same but use fourths

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:42.709
words and you'll
recognize instantly that the sound of a

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:45.010
fourth

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.250
so I'll use 5ths

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:38.170
so now I'll do 6ths

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:04.990
and so on, so feel free to experiment again with that with intervals and trying

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.490
different generes on music trying with a
rock solo blues solo and of course this

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:16.230
is just an example of exercise where you
are trying to use only a specific

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.330
interval but when you of course play in real-life mix it up and of course

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:27.390
try to make it as musical as possible and
that's it
