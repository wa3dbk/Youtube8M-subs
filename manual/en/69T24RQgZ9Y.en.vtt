00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:05.100
(aircraft noise)

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.066
(music playing)

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:12.033
Mrs. Obama:
Today, we boarded a
ferry to Gorée Island,

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:15.033
which is just off
the coast of Senegal.

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:19.900
Now, for roughly 300 years,
until the mid 1840s,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.667
millions of men, women,
and children from Africa

00:00:22.667 --> 00:00:25.633
were kidnapped from their homes
and communities

00:00:25.633 --> 00:00:30.300
and brought to this island
to be sold as slaves.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.667
Now, on the island, we saw
cells where dozens of people

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:37.834
were packed together
for months on end.

00:00:37.834 --> 00:00:41.567
We saw the courtyard where they
were forced to stand naked

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:45.533
while buyers examined them,
negotiated a price,

00:00:45.533 --> 00:00:49.133
and bought them as if they
were nothing but property.

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:54.667
And we saw what is known
as the door of no return,

00:00:54.667 --> 00:00:57.734
the doorway through which these
men and women and children

00:00:57.734 --> 00:01:01.667
passed on their way across the
ocean to a life of slavery,

00:01:01.667 --> 00:01:07.033
a brutal journey many of us
know as the Middle Passage.

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:11.200
Standing there, I thought
about the terror and grief

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.967
these people must have felt

00:01:12.967 --> 00:01:16.867
as they took their last
steps through that doorway,

00:01:16.867 --> 00:01:19.400
knowing they would never
again see their families

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.467
or their country.

00:01:21.467 --> 00:01:24.734
There is no way to undo what
happened on Gorée Island,

00:01:24.734 --> 00:01:29.333
and no way to erase the stain of
slavery from our nation's past,

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:32.133
but there is also no
denying the course

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:36.433
that history has taken
since that time.

00:01:36.433 --> 00:01:41.567
Since then, we've seen so many
brave men and women rise up

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:46.500
against slavery and segregation
and injustice and inequality

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.367
of all kinds.

00:01:48.367 --> 00:01:52.934
People who came through this
island could never have imagined

00:01:52.934 --> 00:01:55.367
how history would unfold,

00:01:55.367 --> 00:01:57.800
and they certainly could
never have imagined

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.200
that someone like me,
a descendent of slaves,

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:07.233
would come here, and look back
through that door of no return.

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:11.300
Maybe in the end,
that is an argument for hope

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.533
even in the face
of the most unspeakable horrors,

00:02:14.533 --> 00:02:16.700
because time and again,

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.300
both in America and
around the world,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:24.000
we have seen that cruelty and
oppression are no match

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.066
for people of conscience
who commit themselves

00:02:27.066 --> 00:02:29.467
to the cause of freedom.
