00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.700
The holiday season means
food, presents, family,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.040
and also travel.

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.475
Lots and lots of travel.

00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:07.170
And with these gas
prices, wouldn't you

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.965
want your vehicle to
be more efficient?

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:15.789
Hey, drivers.

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:17.830
Trace here for D News with
some holiday knowledge

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.490
that I'm going to drop on you.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.640
Automobiles opened up
the world for individuals

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.810
to travel as far as they
wanted on their own schedule.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:26.230
But gasoline, man?

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.150
Fossil fuel.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.060
It's a huge drawback
on so many levels,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.380
climate and environmental
effects, and the cost.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.090
So to fight back,
our government now

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:36.940
requires manufacturers to
create more efficient cars.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.321
And with those efficiencies
growing a lot from now to 2025,

00:00:40.321 --> 00:00:42.070
we thought, how are
they going to do that?

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.730
Since the invention of better
transmissions, fuel injection

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.900
systems, emission controls
and other technologies,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.210
our cars have pulled more
power with less fuel.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.170
But we've kind of hit the wall.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.864
It seems it's hard to make
an engine more efficient,

00:00:54.864 --> 00:00:56.280
and that's not the
best way to go.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.740
Instead, automakers are opting
to shed pounds and reduce drag.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.790
Aerodynamics can be beneficial.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.349
For example, a boxy truck would
have a lot more difficulty

00:01:04.349 --> 00:01:06.899
pushing through the air
than a sleek sports car.

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:08.440
The better the
aerodynamics of a car,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.400
the less drag you get from air
resistance, thus a lower drag

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:13.500
coefficient.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.400
If you can reduce the
drag coefficient by 0.01,

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.330
you'll gain 0.2
miles per gallon.

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.670
If you're not using your
roof rack, take it off.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.050
You'll reduce your drag.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.140
If you've got an
antenna topper up there,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.500
you're increasing your drag.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:28.208
Seriously, get rid of
that stupid things.

00:01:28.208 --> 00:01:29.940
Making the car
lighter is another way

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.550
the manufacturer can make
a car more fuel efficient.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.470
If they cut weight,
they'll have less car

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.240
to pull with the same engine.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.770
This is why sports
cars are usually

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.760
made of ultra light materials,
like aluminum and carbon fiber.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:44.630
Even shaving just a few ounces
off of the physical gas pedal

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.290
could save a tiny
amount of fuel.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.140
The US Department of Energy
says if automakers reduce weight

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.930
by 10%, the car will get a bump
of 6% to 8% in fuel efficiency.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:55.430
However, since most
of us don't want

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.380
to put a file to our
cars' metal parts,

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.360
there are strategies
all of us can

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.630
use to improve our gas mileage.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.220
The US Department of Energy
says the quickest way is also

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:06.330
to cut weight.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.770
Carrying 100 lbs of extra
cargo and baggage in the car

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:12.470
will reduce your fuel
efficiency by 2%.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.064
So leave those party
supplies at home,

00:02:14.064 --> 00:02:15.230
because you don't need them.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.680
The second easiest
way is to make sure

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:18.471
that your tires are at
the proper pressure.

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:21.020
Yeah, I know this seems
kind of silly and whatever,

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.400
but it's actually way
better, because most of us

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.460
drive on under
inflated tires, which

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.770
increases the friction
with the road,

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:31.080
decreasing fuel
efficiency by like, 7%.

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.460
Driving slower will also
reduce the coefficient of drag,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.790
and increase gas mileage.

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.380
The most efficient speed
is 55 miles an hour.

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.290
That's where aerodynamics,
power, and fuel,

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.090
and efficiency,
they all line up.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.780
Each five mile increase over
50 will decrease your economy

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.180
by another 7% every five miles.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:50.400
I know it seems like the
world is kind of nickel

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.300
and diming you here, but hey,
that's how physics works, guys.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.230
Over time, like, say, a year,
if you can improve your gas

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.890
mileage by 7%, you would
save hundreds of dollars.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.590
Do you have other strategies
to improve your gas efficiency?

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.090

and thanks a lot
