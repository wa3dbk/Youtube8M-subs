00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.659
Hello Indiana, my name is Nelson and
this is The Nelson Wrap Dispenser.

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:14.839
We've designed a dispenser that is able to
wrap a Skid from top to bottom without

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:16.579
the need of bending over,

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:19.019
walking backwards or, any awkward positions.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.780
Experience the possibilities of Wrapping
SIX Pallets

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.630
in the same time is it would take four
with the traditional dispensers

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.379
With the Nelson Wrap Dispenser, we can
safely secure the load to the pallet

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:32.019
wrapping a load of medium height

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:35.860
our extended handle enables us to bring
the load in close and tight

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:41.280
by figure "X" method.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.390
The Nelson Wrap Dispenser can both capture the
Load and the Pallet quickly and SAFELY with the

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.120
Natural walk around the Load

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:55.120
no more bending over and shuffling your feet
trying to Hap-Hazardly single wrap the load.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.920
when wrapping a load on a raised Fork Lift

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.350
most companies are using two people

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.390
who dangerously expose both
Arms and Head under the Load.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.640
Which is NOT SAFE
nor OSHA approved.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.540
Now, with the Nelson Wrap Dispenser
you can SAFELY wrap a load with

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:15.890
one person, saving TIME and
POTENTIAL INJURY.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.960
Wrapping high loads should not be awkward
or back-breaking. Simply wrap the load in a

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.140
SAFE and EASY stance, allowing the dispenser
to do the work and NOT your back.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.859
The Nelson Wrap Dispenser can wrap
a load eight feet or higher

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:31.090
based on the operators natural
grasp of the dispenser.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.640
The Nelso Wrap Dispenser takes all film
types of three-inch core

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.830
from eleven to twenty inch lengths

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:42.150
you can have its tension set to best meet
the type of application being used.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.780
Adapted with the Nelson Wrap Dispenser
is our hand brake systems that allows the

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.240
Operator to wrap a load more
tightly and securely

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.890
that is over and beyond the
traditional dispensers

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:57.890
integrated from the Nelson Wrap Dispenser
is our Better Wrapper (NWD) that is

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.939
used to wrap medium to high skids

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.980
and stabilize the load from shifting

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:08.430
wrapping rolls of Fabric, Linoleum and Rugs
can SAFELY be done with the tension

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:09.059
set on the Dispenser

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:13.199
allowing for a comfortable grip
to wrap the load

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:17.339
The Nelson Wrap Dispenser is changing the
way that freight is being handled in the

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:18.889
Packaging and Shipping Industry

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:30.000
The Nelson Wrap Dispenser is designed to SAVE
TIME, MONEY and your BACK.
Thank You.
