00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:11.519
And this is where Steve was showing his brilliance.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.789
Around this time, Next is not working out so well.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:23.109
And I've got a good relationship with Steve,

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:26.889
all of us do, but we didn't want him there full time.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.499
He was really good part time,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.113
because he faced outwards and he let us,

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.679
excuse me, I keep raining.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.779
Just put it on the table...

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.789
So we're out trying to figure out how to make this movie.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.199
And we were a group that had been through failures together,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.889
we'd experienced that.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.419
And it was really difficult to figure this out,

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.029
and we made a lot of miss-estimates.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.059
And the first version didn't work very well,

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.229
but as we got closer it became apparent

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:08.179
that we were onto something really big.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.159
And I have to say, John Lasseter believed right from

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.689
the beginning that this was going to be gigantic.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.729
But from Disney's point of view it was a boutique film,

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.629
so they didn't put any consumer products behind

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.789
it because they didn't see it being anything.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.219
But as we got into the last year, it was now apparent it was big.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.019
And so Steve said, okay now we are going

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.249
to revolutionize this industry.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:37.769
But we are also in a position where because

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.169
we've got the experience here,

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.439
not only do we have the first film out,

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.819
we will probably have the second film out

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.629
before anybody else can get into this.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.249
But the deal that we had with Disney,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.719
frankly was not a very good deal,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.779
we got like three to five percent of the profit,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.519
something like that.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.379
So it was not...

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.989
Not very good.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.049
Not very good.

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.254
So Steve called John and me together and he said,

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.189
okay, our deal lasts for three pictures

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.119
and at the end we are on our own.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.569
Michael Eisner will realize as soon as this film is successful

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.289
that he will have just created his biggest nightmare.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.554
So he will not want the contract to end.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.989
So when the film comes out he will renegotiate,

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.819
and when we renegotiate I want 50% of the profits.

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.994
But if we get 50% of profits,

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.399
that means we have to put up 50% of the money.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.829
So in order for us to put 50% of the money,

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.019
we have to have the money in the bank,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.579
therefore we should go public.

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.804
So John and I were saying,

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.169
whoa, whoa, whoa, this is a little early here!

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:55.869
Let's prove our worth first.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.629
But Steve being Steve, he had a compelling way about him.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:02.279
So we put on the roadshow,

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.434
we went out and showed pieces of the movie.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:09.854
But what he told people as we went on the roadshow,

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:16.369
so I went out with our CFO Lawrence Levy and Steve.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.519
And as we went out, the argument was that the company

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:25.349
will go public one week after the movie opens,

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.689
so you will see that we're changing the industry.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:32.909
And so that's the prep, so the movie comes out,

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.399
it opens huge, it gets incredible reviews

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.019
and then next week we go public.

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:41.609
And it was the biggest IPO of the year, it was bigger than Netscape.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.769
Incredible.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:43.660
It was an incredible thing.
