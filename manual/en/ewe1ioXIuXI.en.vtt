00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:18.530
Welcome to the park which is truly one of
a kind; Antonio Gaudi's Parc G端ell.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:25.279
Nowhere else is there a park where beautiful
rough stone creations, ceramic tiles, and

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:32.320
landscaping details creates such an amazing
fantasy world, while at the same time not

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:38.420
overpowering the natural setting of the park
environment.

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.070
The designer of the park, Antonio Gaudi, was
an Art Nouveau and Modernist architect situated

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.900
in Barcelona.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:54.410
He was a master of combing color and natural
shapes into something out of this world.

00:00:54.410 --> 00:01:01.129
Arguably, no other architect in history has
ever had such an absolute influence on a city

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:06.369
as Antonio Gaudi has had on Barcelona.

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:12.240
There are great works of his Modernist style
all over the city and one of his most interesting

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.770
works is this beautiful park.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:25.490
This park, built between 1900 and 1914, was
originally part of a commercially unsuccessful

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.509
housing site.

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:32.700
The idea behind the site came from Count Eusebi
G端ell.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.670
The Count wanted to build a type of gated
community for Barcelona aristocracy -- consisting

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.520
of 60 houses surrounded by an extraordinary
park.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:50.740
However, due to poor response from potential
clients, only two of the planned 60 houses

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.719
ended up being built, neither of them designed
by Gaudi.

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:02.819
One of these two buildings was intended to
be a show house, but as no buyers came, Gaudi

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:05.990
decided to buy it himself.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:13.960
He moved in with his family and his father
in 1906 and lived there on and off until his

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.730
death in 1926.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:24.390
The building is today known as "la Torre Rosa"
or "Casa-Museu Gaudi"; a museum which has

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.240
notable examples of furnishings designed by
Gaudi and other personal memorabilia.

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:40.200
This house is definitely a must see for everyone
interested in Gaudi and his style.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.690
Even though the gated community became an
epic failure, the park remained a private

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.500
garden of the G端ell family until the 1920s.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:56.520
The family then handed over the park to the
municipality which transformed it into a public

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.310
park we have today.

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:04.720
Throughout the park, Gaudi's strong influence
by natural shapes is evident.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:12.610
Here you can find walkways supported by twisting
rock pillars that seem to be growing out of

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.120
the ground like trees.

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.780
You can also find several animal inspired
sculptures, the most prominent one being the

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:24.280
dragon found at the entrance to the park.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:31.430
The dragon is adorned with beautiful colored
tiling, called "trencadis", which Gaudi often

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.710
used in his creations.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.900
The focal point of the park is however the
main terrace, surrounded by a long bench shaped

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.590
as a sea serpent.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.980
The curves of the serpent bench form a number
of enclaves, creating a great social atmosphere

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.260
for all the visitors.

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.880
Many people rate Park G端ell as a must see
when visiting Barcelona; not only you'll enjoy

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:04.480
the park but the amazing view of the city
from the main terrace area.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:13.180
In 1984, Barcelona's most magical park became
listed on the UNESCO World Heritage List;

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:17.239
a true testament to how extraordinary this
fascinating site is.
