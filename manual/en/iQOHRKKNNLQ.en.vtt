00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:09.600
Have you wondered what it would be like to be an astronaut floating around in the space station?

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:14.010
Why are the astronauts floating?

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:19.769
I'm here at the powerhouse museum in sydney to find out if anyone knows the answer

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:25.199
Why are they floating in their gravity in our graphic zero-gravity there's my gravity's

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.369
The stuff that holds us to the planet Brumis beam doesn't happen up there gravity holds you the answer in space. There's nothing there

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.369
[they] just float. There's no gravity in space

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.989
hey there if your seeing this right now then you have found my secret code

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:39.479
No greater. That's very little but is there really no gravity in eat my ass oh yeah

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:43.710
After all the moon orbits the Earth due to gravitational attraction

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.119
So where with the space station fit in this picture?

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.000
Can you make me a roughly to scale?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Model of the Earth and the Moon and then we're [gonna] position the space station in there, so [try] like that

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:06.269
Maybe then you ready to see the real distance hMM. How do you reckon oh?

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:14.830
It's actually about

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.730
here maybe a little further

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:22.249
I think we were wrong now if the moon is here and the Earth is there whereabouts would you put the space station?

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.830
Yeah pity

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.410
About halfway yeah right about here

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:32.119
So [that's] maybe like a quarter of the distance to the [moon] let me show you the real distance you ready for the real distance

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.109
The space Station is right about there

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.949
The space Station is actually only about [four] [hundred] [kilometers] away, so if you're in Sydney

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.400
It's a little further than the drive to Canberra, but does it make sense that the earth exerts a big gravitational force on you?

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.710
But nothing on the astronauts just a short distance away, you reckon there be no gravity there

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.710
There's not much. They [flex] we've seen them. Well clearly there's not [they're] floating [around]

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.100
I know they float and the question is why no idea

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:16.289
Well in truth the force on the astronauts is almost as much as the force on you

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:24.839
So then why are they floating while you're stuck here the answer is the astronauts aren't floating they're falling

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.679
and not only that but the space station, they're in is falling as well ah

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.389
So why doesn't the [space] [station] come crashing into the Earth?

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.410
Well the reason is the space station and astronauts inside have this huge sideways velocity of about

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:47.080
[28,000] kilometers per hour

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:53.320
So even though they're falling towards the [earth] they're going so fast that as they fall towards the Earth's surface

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.390
It curves away from them

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:02.080
If the Earth didn't put a gravitational force on them, they would fly out into space sure yeah, right

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:06.580
So it's due to that gravitational pull that they can actually keep orbiting the Earth

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:11.560
If it was to stop moving, and it would be plummeting exactly, what would they?

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:15.220
They would still feel weightless until you smash into something

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.779
So the space station and the astronauts inside are constantly accelerating towards the Earth's core

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.940
but they never get any closer and

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.300
Because they're accelerating at the same rate the astronauts feel weightless they have this amazing

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.330
sensation of floating

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:41.020
you
