00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.110
Stand-up paddleboarding is a fun,
relatively easy activity that's quickly

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.610
becoming one of the most popular water
sports in the outdoor industry.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.849
It appeals to everyone from casual
recreationalists

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.919
to fitness enthusiast, to big-wave riders. To
get started, pick an area of calm, protected

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:26.689
water that's deep enough to absorb a few
falls until you find your balance on the

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.520
board. It's best to start out on your
knees until you feel comfortable.

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.670
Place your knees about hip's-width apart and just aft of the board's center.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:38.539
Take a few strokes in this position to
get the feel of how the board will

00:00:38.539 --> 00:00:39.140
respond.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.160
When you're ready to stand place the
paddle across the deck in front of you

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.600
and slowly rise to your feet, placing
each foot where your knees were. After standing

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.440
keep your feet parallel, pointing forward,
keep your back straight but your knees

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.210
slightly bent.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.909
Remember also that when in motion your
paddle will

00:00:56.909 --> 00:01:01.640
act like an outrigger and help in
maintaining your balance. It's a good idea to

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.120
keep your eyes focused ahead.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.729
Avoid looking down at your feet. To move
forward, start with a few basic strokes.

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.240
Keep your arms straight and twist your
torso to the side you're paddling on

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.430
using your core muscles to provide the
power more than your arms.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.000
Plant the blade of the paddle all the way
into the water out in front of you.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.159
And then pull it back alongside the
board, just past your feet. Take five or

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:25.140
six strokes on either side until you're
comfortable switching the paddle from

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.329
one side to the other.

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.320
As you progress you can incorporate
common canoe strokes such as the J stroke,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.000
side stroke, back paddle,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.189
and sweep stroke to maintain a straight
line or assist with turning. Eventually

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:38.850
when you're really comfortable standing,

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.500
you can alter your position on the board
to carve turns and other maneuvers in

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.189
both flat water and surf. With a
relatively modest investment in

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:47.750
equipment

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.799
stand-up paddleboarders can explore and
enjoy a variety of watery environments

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.300
from serene ponds, rivers, and lakes to
heart-pounding ocean surf.
