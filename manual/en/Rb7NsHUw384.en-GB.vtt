00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:09.309
We’re here in the 1760 to 1780 room

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.160
which is a brief period, 20 years, and it’s a small room 

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.680
but its of vital significance in the history British Art

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.760
and this is because 1768 was the foundation of the Royal Academy.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:23.380
The room is dominated, just like the art world of the period was, by Sir Joshua Reynolds

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.220
whose extraordinary large paintings you can see here of the Montgomery sisters with the ‘Term of Hymen’

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.300
and behind us here ‘the Archers’.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.540
Reynolds was essentially a society portraitist, which meant that he painted people faces for money. 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.040
But for Reynolds there was a way of elevating his art which was by referencing the history of art 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.540
and each of the paintings in this room use some kind of a motif, usually by referencing the Old Masters. 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.100
In this painting, you can see a good deal of what made Reynolds the popular and great artist

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.280
that he was at the time. 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.140
It’s a painting on a very, very grand scale although it is just a portrait of two young aristocrats

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:09.060
Colonel Acland and Lord Sydney, engaged in a hunt leaving a trail of dead behind them as they go. 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.260
But this is no naturalistic scene

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.300
this is a Renaissance hunt scene essentially referencing Titian and Frans Snyders.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:23.280
 It’s a way of elevating what is a simple portrait to a level of grand style painting.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.480
Not everybody took Reynolds view that portraiture elevated to a new level

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.480
by historical references was enough

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.180
if you are going to do intellectual painting, Benjamin West thought, 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.280
then you really needed to do intellectual painting

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.080
and subjects like this which are almost impenetrable to modernise 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:44.600
are exactly the sort of thing that they had in mind.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.000
West painted this painting in 1760

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.940
and it’s a subject from Euripides

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.360
in which Iphigenia, who’s the priestess of Diana here, is about to pronounce a sentence of death

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:03.320
on these two guys here, who are Pylades and Orestes, for their attempt to steal this statue up here. 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.980
And what Iphigenia is about to find out is that Orestes is her long lost brother 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.240
and although it ends well and these two are let off, essentially

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:18.140
the person whose looking at this in the 18th century who has read their Euripides, is supposed to know and get

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.850
that feeling of that terrible moment at which Iphigenia may just have sentenced her brother to death.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:35.240
If for Benjamin West the problem with Joshua Reynolds was that he simply wasn’t intellectual enough

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.100
for another painter, Nathaniel Hone

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.460
there was a sense in which Reynold’s method was essentially a form of trickery 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.760
and in this painting, 'The Conjurer'

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.860
Nathaniel Hone paints an old figure, who’s clearly meant to represent Reynolds

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.600
who’s basically magicking an oil painting out of old Master Brint

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.980
and if you look very closely we can actually see that this is the composition that was used on

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.900
the Montgomery sisters decorating the ‘Term of Hymen’ over on that wall there.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.420
There was something of a scandal in this and not surprisingly 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.740
the painting wasn’t accepted for exhibition at the Royal Academy.
