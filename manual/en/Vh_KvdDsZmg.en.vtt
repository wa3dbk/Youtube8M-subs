00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.809
 Trees, shrubs, and other plants
that grow along the banks of a river are called

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.000
Riparian Vegetation
Areas of riparian vegetation that cover

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.990
a significant portion of land adjacent to
the river can be considered a

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:26.710
riparian buffer
Riparian buffers play an important role

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:31.640
in maintaining wildlife and water quality
by providing shelter for animals, reducing

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.430
river pollution, and minimizing erosion. Riparian
buffers are most important in areas where

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.090
surface water runoff is likely to carry pollutants
into the river. Such areas include city streets,

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:51.090
highways, agricultural areas, and privately
owned waterfront property. The way in which

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:55.750
riparian buffers minimize pollutant access
into the river is by interrupting the flow

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:01.260
of surface water and forcing it to slow down.
When surface water has more time to infiltrate,

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.729
more pollutants soak into the soil rather
than flowing directly into the stream. The

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:10.630
use of fertilizers in close proximity to the
river can really affect the river

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:12.409
water quality and the organisms that

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:18.640
live there. Surface runoff from fertilized
areas such as farms, gardens, and lawns is

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.880
typically high in nutrients. However, good
riparian buffers located between the area

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.119
of applied fertilizer and the adjacent waterway
can greatly reduce the amount of nutrients

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:33.969
that enter the river. In some forms, the nutrient
pollutants found in fertilizers are taken

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.840
up by plants and used for growth. When nutrients
are used by plants, fewer can make their way

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.969
into the river, and the river stays cleaner.
In addition to increasing infiltration and

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:48.420
absorbing nutrients, riparian buffers also
provide structure for the river by holding

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.149
the soil in place with their roots. In fact,
studies have shown that areas with little

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.049
to no riparian vegetation have higher rates
of erosion and sediment pollution than areas

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.649
that include vegetation. If you or someone
you know owns land along the Chippewa River

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.979
and wants to maintain optimal riparian buffers,
some suggestions include allowing areas of

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.190
native vegetation to grow up rather than keeping
the lawn trimmed up to the water

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:15.390
edge; and to avoid the use of herbicides

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:22.390
in close proximity to the river. If you want
to find out more about how you as a citizen

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.610
can help establish and maintain riparian buffers,
information can be found by contacting local

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.030
agencies such as the Farm Service Agency,
the Natural Resource Conservation Service,

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:39.970
or the River County Resource Conservation
and Development Council. Riparian buffers

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:45.250
play a vital role in minimizing pollution,
reducing erosion, and providing habitat for

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.970
wildlife along the river. It is important
that we don\'92t destroy existing riparian

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:54.970
buffers, but focus on establishing and maintaining
them so that they can continue to provide

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.520
these services for wildlife and water quality
along the Chippewa River.
