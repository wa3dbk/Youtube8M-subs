Way Better than Average Guacamole Recipe

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.499
Welcome to The Poor Man's Gourmet Kitchen
where we share gourmet recipes at a low budget

00:00:05.499 --> 00:00:06.499
wonder.

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:12.320
Now check this out . If you don't already
know the easiest way to cut into an avocado

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.769
just take your knife and cut into the end
and work the blade all the way around the

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.710
seed until you get back where you started.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:26.909
At that point you can just twist off the top
take your blade hit it right into the seed

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:28.710
and cut it out.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.810
Simple as that.

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:37.270
Skinning the avocado is just as easy just
take a large spoon and just cut right into

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:48.100
the sides all the way around and scoop out
the filling.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.410
Cilantro is just as easy most people don't
know this little trick but all you have to

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.850
do is roll it all up into a little ball.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.920
Of course pull out the stems but again roll
it all up, tight little ball.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:08.260
Hold it with the opposite hand you're cutting
with and with your knife very carefully slice

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:19.060
right through it.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.860
Now here I've already got four peeled avocados.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:28.320
I'm gonna go ahead and add the cilantro to
this and start mixing up all the ingredients

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.360
to make our guacamole.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:38.870
Now here we've got Julian jalapeno, we've
got chopped garlic and we've got some scallions.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.490
we'll just add that to the mixture.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:44.170
Don't worry about making it look pretty.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.549
Moving on to dry ingredients.

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:49.590
We have tomato bouillon.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.970
Now let me tell you about the tomato bouillon.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.430
You can get this by a brand named Knorr.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.850
They make beef chicken or tomato.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.300
Tomato is excellent in this guacamole.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:11.209
So we'll just add that bouillon and we'll
move right on to the oregano.

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:18.230
Next we'll add the cumin and peeper.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.940
Now we're not going to be adding salt because
there's enough salt in that tomato bouillon.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:29.510
If you have a potato masher that's really
good to chop up these avocados because it

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.730
mashes them really good and incorporates all
the ingredients.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:47.770
This is a real good time to add the last ingredient
and that's a squeeze of this here lime.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:51.160
Once the lime is exhausted again we're gonna
stir it all up.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.620
At this point it's a good time to take a good
taste to that and make sure it's to your liking.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.580
Then add some more salt and peeper you can
add some more cayenne and paprika if you want

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:03.580
some more kick.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:10.400
Just make sure at this point it's exactly
the way you like it.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:15.620
Now you can serve it up but just between you
and me If you do this the night before you

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.319
actually want it.

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:23.790
It will get a lot more potent and add a lot
more flavor the next day when you go to eat

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:24.790
it.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.970
And there you have it homemade guacamole right
here in The Poor Man's Gourmet Kitchen.
