00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.200
Ok now it’s dessert time for all you sweet
tooths out there.     

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:20.960
I reckon after you have had a bit of tucker
in the evening, sitting round the camp fire.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:27.300
I reckon the first thing that pops into your
head. I tell you what, I wouldn’t mind to

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:35.800
chew on something a little bit sweet. So tucker
is out of the way, we have had a nice feed

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:44.940
of barramundi, so I reckon I am going to cook
up a lemon lift cake. So where do we start,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.239
mixing bowl, flour, sugar, got some lemons.
I will grab some stuff out of the fridge.

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:59.759
Course I got some eggs. Course, don’t forget
some lemon lift. So first of all, a bit of

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:09.140
sugar. Precisely that much, so whatever you
think. So we will get some butter out. I don’t

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.200
know, whatever that is. I am going to put
2 eggs in. So there we go. 2 eggs, yolk and

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.300
all. Will try and mix those ingredients together,
just so it’s a little bit easier for when

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.410
the flour comes in. So that is what I am doing
that. Next ingredient in a cake is flour,

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:30.220
and I am going to use self raising flour.
How much am I going to use, well I am going

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:40.820
to use 1, 2, 3 alright. So starting to look
like a cake actually. So we will stick a can

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.090
of lemon Lift in. I won’t stick the whole can
in I’m just going to put about 1/3 of it

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.520
in. Ok so we are going to start with a 1/3.
Gives it air. Makes your cake fluffy and light

00:01:51.520 --> 00:02:00.940
when it bakes. So I grab myself a real lemon.
I am going to cut that sucker in half like that.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.740
And we're going to squeeze half a lemon.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:12.200
And we mix that up thoroughly. Alright so
we get the trusty cake tin. Make sure that

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.140
you wipe it out. Remember, grease it. Grease
it well. Remember get the bugs out before

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.189
you put it in, otherwise it won’t be a lemon
cake; it will be a bug cake.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.620
That is now ready for the camp oven. So we
will whack that straight in the camp oven.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:38.260
Look at those coals. Those are some serious
coals going there. So what I will do is get

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.400
a bed going on there. Then I will stick a
few on top.

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:51.799
Well there she is all done. Nice little brown
tinge to the top, so I have got some icing

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:56.060
sugar here, then we got some lemon rind here.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:59.800
Come on, mate, you got a dessert finished yet or what?

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.340
It looks pretty good.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.920
Alright, here we go. He hoes into it, doesn’t
he?

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.739
Not bad, got any ice cream there?

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:17.280
Ho ho he wants ice cream with it.
