- [Host] With the unfurling
of the Chapter flag,

00:00:32.473 --> 00:00:35.056
welcome to BarbecuePitBoys.com.

00:00:35.948 --> 00:00:39.553
Today we're cookin' up a
bacon and beer can chicken.

00:00:39.553 --> 00:00:40.386
It's easy to do.

00:00:40.386 --> 00:00:41.219
All right,

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.360
I have about a five and a half
pound chicken right there.

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.450
It's been all cleaned, all right?

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.084
And of course for this recipe
you're gonna need some beer,

00:00:50.084 --> 00:00:53.474
so grab yourself a 12 ounce
can of beer or even a kinger.

00:00:53.474 --> 00:00:55.489
You're gonna need some bacon,

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:57.022
and you're gonna need a few spices

00:00:57.022 --> 00:00:59.367
for a rub we're gonna put
on this chicken, all right?

00:00:59.367 --> 00:01:02.119
I'm startin' out with some SPG,

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:04.882
salt, pepper, garlic, couple tablespoons.

00:01:04.882 --> 00:01:08.620
Puttin' in some paprika,
maybe a couple tablespoons.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.405
I got some chili powder,
maybe a tablespoon or so.

00:01:12.405 --> 00:01:15.459
And got a little bit of cayenne pepper,

00:01:15.459 --> 00:01:17.232
yeah maybe a half a teaspoon.

00:01:17.232 --> 00:01:18.962
Now you make the rub the way you want,

00:01:18.962 --> 00:01:21.772
use an off the shelf rub, whatever.

00:01:21.772 --> 00:01:24.355
Or use this rub, it works good!

00:01:25.545 --> 00:01:27.519
All right, like I said,

00:01:27.519 --> 00:01:31.884
here I've got about a five
and a half pound chicken here

00:01:31.884 --> 00:01:35.367
and I've got one of those beer
can chicken holders, right?

00:01:35.367 --> 00:01:36.644
They're cheap now, you can get 'em,

00:01:36.644 --> 00:01:40.127
it works with steadyin'
that bird on the grill.

00:01:40.127 --> 00:01:42.194
And you know about that, right?

00:01:42.194 --> 00:01:43.761
You get one of those.

00:01:43.761 --> 00:01:45.747
And I'm going to coat up this chicken

00:01:45.747 --> 00:01:48.347
with this quick rub we made here, right?

00:01:48.347 --> 00:01:51.238
Now with the paprika, the
chili powder in there,

00:01:51.238 --> 00:01:53.081
it's gonna give it a lotta color.

00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:55.507
Now, we're gonna fire up that grill,

00:01:55.507 --> 00:01:58.038
and we're gonna make a ring
of fire on it, all right?

00:01:58.038 --> 00:02:02.148
And it's gonna take a couple
full chimneys of charcoal,

00:02:02.148 --> 00:02:03.495
pre-lit charcoal,

00:02:03.495 --> 00:02:05.770
and we're gonna run around the perimeter

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.046
of this grill, all right?

00:02:08.046 --> 00:02:09.729
So simple enough.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.866
And we are also not gonna
use that top grate as well

00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:14.756
'cause we need the room, all
right, to cook this chicken,

00:02:14.756 --> 00:02:17.636
so we're gonna put it
down inside this grill

00:02:17.636 --> 00:02:20.643
and it works real good, all right?

00:02:20.643 --> 00:02:23.255
Now, here's the bacon, right?

00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:24.857
Simple enough.

00:02:24.857 --> 00:02:27.585
You just drape the bacon

00:02:27.585 --> 00:02:29.443
outta the neck,

00:02:29.443 --> 00:02:30.918
over the chicken,

00:02:30.918 --> 00:02:34.726
and this will help baste
it durin' this cook.

00:02:34.726 --> 00:02:35.631
And this bird is gonna take

00:02:35.631 --> 00:02:38.406
a couple hours to cook, all right?

00:02:38.406 --> 00:02:42.353
So this bacon will be a natural basting.

00:02:42.353 --> 00:02:45.326
As well as that beer on the inside, right?

00:02:45.326 --> 00:02:47.984
Nah, you've made beer can chicken before,

00:02:47.984 --> 00:02:49.795
but if you haven't done it with bacon,

00:02:49.795 --> 00:02:53.151
you definitely gotta check this out.

00:02:53.151 --> 00:02:54.335
Man!

00:02:54.335 --> 00:02:57.226
(twangy guitar music)

00:02:57.226 --> 00:03:01.394
All right, the bacon has
been draped, the beer is in.

00:03:01.394 --> 00:03:04.064
We're gonna place it on a inverted pan,

00:03:04.064 --> 00:03:06.781
and now we're gonna pop that
can right there, all right?

00:03:06.781 --> 00:03:10.948
We're just gonna put a slice
right in it, with ol' hick.

00:03:11.901 --> 00:03:13.816
Put the cover on.

00:03:13.816 --> 00:03:15.767
Oh man!
(sizzling)

00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:18.054
Hey, and through the miracle of time,

00:03:18.054 --> 00:03:20.471
'bout 45 minutes has gone by,

00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:23.975
and we're gonna baste
this bird, all right?

00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:25.960
Now you can baste her the way you want

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:27.644
but (laughs) it's easy enough.

00:03:27.644 --> 00:03:31.104
Just take a can of beer,
pour it down her neck.

00:03:31.104 --> 00:03:32.854
Oh yeah, easy enough.

00:03:35.434 --> 00:03:39.601
All right, now, it's been
about two hours, all right?

00:03:40.875 --> 00:03:43.649
But we wanna check the temp of this bird,

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:45.124
all right, and we're gonna in there

00:03:45.124 --> 00:03:47.434
right near the thigh and the leg bone,

00:03:47.434 --> 00:03:51.434
and we've got a temperature
of about 175, right?

00:03:52.473 --> 00:03:54.818
Good enough, were gonna pull her out,

00:03:54.818 --> 00:03:58.985
and let her rest on the board
for maybe 20 minutes or so.

00:04:12.245 --> 00:04:16.099
I say it's time to cut
this bird up, right?

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.572
Now, doin' beer can chicken like this

00:04:18.572 --> 00:04:22.961
with some bacon draped over
top, it's gonna be real juicy.

00:04:22.961 --> 00:04:24.517
Take a look at that.

00:04:24.517 --> 00:04:27.779
Look at that juice just
drippin' outta this bird.

00:04:27.779 --> 00:04:28.612
Oh man!

00:04:30.263 --> 00:04:31.831
You smell that?

00:04:31.831 --> 00:04:33.081
It smells good!

00:04:35.964 --> 00:04:38.611
Now, as always, we do apologize

00:04:38.611 --> 00:04:41.529
for eatin' in fronta you like this, but,

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:44.304
we call this pit master privilege.

00:04:44.304 --> 00:04:46.951
You're just gonna have
to make your own bird.

00:04:46.951 --> 00:04:48.118
Whoa ho, good!

00:05:06.955 --> 00:05:09.544

lookin' for a bird recipe
