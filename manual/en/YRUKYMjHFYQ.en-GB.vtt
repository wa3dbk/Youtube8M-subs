00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.300
My name is Claire Benton I'm a maths teacher
at Greenford high school in West London. Teaching

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.360
is my second career I used to work in computing
moving up to being a project manager during

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.110
that time I had children I then needed to
revaluate my work/life balance and I chose

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.539
teaching as a profession, I went into visit
a school for a day and decided that is what

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:30.039
I wanted to do. Average day I don't think
exist in teaching and one of the beauties

00:00:30.039 --> 00:00:35.610
of the job is how different it can be from
day to day the interaction with the students,

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.090
the challenges, how it makes you think, how
it makes you reflect on what you can really

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.390
do to help these students learn maths. It's
year 11 maths we are doing ratio and proportion

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.160
they've done it in the past but what these
are now about is problem solving so we've

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.970
got a recipe for example here where it's for
4 people and the question is asking them how

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:06.340
much would you need for 10. I always loved
maths, I did a maths degree and it had always

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:13.260
been something I'd considered I did a year
PGCE at the institute in London and I've absolutely

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.020
loved every minute since. I think maths is
one of those subjects where lots fear it they

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.430
have a lack of confidence, I'm talking about
the students who often say to me "I can't

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.070
do maths" you know "I'm rubbish at maths"
and it's changing that perspective. It's a

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.750
year 9 booster maths class and the idea of
this class is that they have extra lessons

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:41.750
on top of their normal maths class. What we're
using today is a matching activity where I

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.570
want them to check the accuracy of their answers
on the tablet, what the tablet allows is instant

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.960
feedback for them have they got it right?
Or did they get it wrong? Just having lunch

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.270
in the maths work room, 45 minutes we get
in total it's quite a short turn around before

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.120
heading into tutor time so any last minute
things you need to do before the afternoon

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:12.280
period is done now and also trying to get
your food in the microwave. This is registration

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:18.530
form time where we deal giving them notices
and any important information ultimately as

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:31.730
tutors we look after them. This is a year
13 class; they're approaching their C4 exam

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.671
which is a module for A2 mathematics. Now
what they're studying is vectors and it's

00:02:36.671 --> 00:02:44.620
very hard for them to see 3 dimensions so
you try and bring it alive for them. The difficulties

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.440
you do encounter is if you have a challenging
group, when I first arrived a Greenford I

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.740
did have a group that was extremely challenging
and it's being able to talk to people outside

00:02:53.740 --> 00:03:03.630
your classroom it's not a job your own your
own doing. Meeting with Natalie who's an NQT

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:08.980
at the school that means she qualified or
she did 1 year of teaching last year and now

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.950
she's a newly qualified teacher which means
she has to me meet the certain standards by

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:19.770
the end of this academic year, so every term
we review targets or review progress and agree

00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:30.150
targets. It's year 8 top set maths and what
we are exploring today is loci so what shapes

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.050
are produced when we have to obey a given
rule now again this is something they need

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:44.470
to experience themselves so this is why I've
got them out here at the moment making decisions.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:49.590
We've come back inside and they are now trying
to apply the knowledge so it's using the reasoning

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:56.200
from what they experienced outside. It's the
end of the day now, after a full teaching

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.010
day there is a moment where you go "That's
it gone, time to start preparing for tomorrow

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.231
another full teaching day" Reflecting now
on how those lessons went what would I do

00:04:07.231 --> 00:04:12.490
to improve next time? Which students did get
it? Didn't get it? Could I do it better next

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:15.710
time? So It's always a reflective process,
always trying to improve.
