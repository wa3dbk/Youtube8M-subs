00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.640
&gt;&gt;Female Voice: I happened to be in the school at the time, heard the 911 call and I thought,

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.780
"Okay, somebody got hurt in P.E."

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.240
[wind and school bell]

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.200
And, um, somebody came out and said, "It's Pete"

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.600
[electricity crackling]

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.260
&gt;&gt;Voice on radio: Emergency

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:34.760
[sirens]

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.060
&gt;&gt;Female Voice: Pete's laying on the stage,
they had me behind a wall so that I couldn't see him.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:43.020
 I grasped to every sound.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:52.380
[hospital monitors, ventilator breathing, heart beats]

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.540
Then when we got to the hospital 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.080
the doctor came out and told us we needed to come back and see Pete.

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:09.090
&gt;&gt;Rob: She goes running, ya know, right into
the fire, and I grabbed her and I said,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.710
 "No, you can't go in yet... cause your gonna...

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.670
...it's gonna be bad."

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.660
[hospital machine beeping]
[heart thump]

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.440
&gt;&gt;Chris: He's hooked up to every... every device there is—the blood pressure, the oxygen, ya know.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:33.560
 Finally I went out and sat
down cause I needed... I needed to be calm.

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.930
It's almost like I went numb. I didn't know
anything else that was happening around me.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:43.230
I didn't hear anything else, I just wanted
to hear, "he'll be okay," and I wasn't hearing that.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.700
Pete had wanted to do Tech Theater. 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.140
Went up in the lift to change the lamps, 
about 30 feet up,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:55.680
 and the whole lift tipped over and
Pete crashed onto the stage.

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:02.380
&gt;&gt;Rob: I stayed at the hospital for the 2
1/2 weeks, I didn't... I tried to go home,

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.230
and I went home and I came right back. I couldn't
handle being away.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.590
&gt;&gt;Chris: I knew when something beeped and
it was... his food.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.820
 I learned, you know, the beep
 when the antibiotic was done.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.830
&gt;&gt;Rob: And I would sit there and breathe with him.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.620
I would sit and... listen to him breathe for hours.

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.349
&gt;&gt;Chris: They finally came in and told us
the type of brain injury that Petey had.

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.249
It was a shearing. Everything was kind of torn.

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:35.980
So, my aunt is a head trauma nurse, and I called her and I said, "He has a shear brain injury."

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.920
 And I could hear her, on the other end of the phone go... (Gasps).

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.420
I was a wreck. I didn't know where we were going, what was the outcome.

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.340
 I lost all hope at that point. 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.400
Rob, my husband, Pete's dad, said,

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.499
"OK, we have to be positive with this,
we are not gonna sit at his bedside and cry.

00:02:57.499 --> 00:02:59.699
If you have to cry, you go out of the room."

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.780
So after two and half weeks at I.M.C. they transferred us to Primary Children's.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.830
They were very positive, you know. It wasn't
a matter of if Pete goes home,

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.180
 it was a matter of when Pete goes home. 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:17.180
And even my uncle who's a doctor, he said, "You know what? You listen to the therapists.”

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:24.389
&gt;&gt;Female Nurse: Don't give up. Good job Pete.
Oh that was beautiful! 

00:03:24.389 --> 00:03:27.449
Perfect... perfect bud! A+!

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.280
&gt;&gt;Rob: When we were explaining his progress to others, 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:36.480
the first couple times we put it
out, people misunderstood what we said. 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:39.540
Like I said, "oh, you know, Pete was walking." "Oh!"

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.920
Then the next response was, "well, when's he coming back to school?"

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.060
And we're like, "Uh...
he's not coming back to school for a while.”

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.509
&gt;&gt;Chris: It's not like a broken arm or broken leg 

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:51.800
where you set it in a cast and it heals and you're okay.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:57.360
&gt;&gt;Rob: To me listening is really not putting your thoughts into the listening.

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.640
&gt;&gt;Chris: For the longest time Pete didn't talk. We didn't have a way of  communicating with him.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.279
&gt;&gt;Rob: We had gone out on these outings 
they have you do.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.840
&gt;&gt;Chris: And Rob was sitting in the back seat
of the car with him

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.060
 and kind of messing around with his throat 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.780
and all the sudden you just
hear this garbled, "Mom.”

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:21.720
I look over to all the kids, I mean, my older
kids are crying, my husband's crying, I'm crying...

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.830
&gt;&gt;Rob: We called a few people. I think his grandparents out of Boise...

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:28.880
&gt;&gt;Chris: He's going, "Hi Grandpa". And that's about all he could do.

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:33.000
&gt;&gt;Rob: He went from here,
 all kinda clenched and tight, to... 

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:36.240
(exhales) "I can move."

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:44.500
&gt;&gt;Chris: When Pete came home he still needed... he needed to be watched 24/7. 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.479
We had to put baby monitors in his bedroom, you know, and listen where he was in the house.

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:56.340
&gt;&gt;Rob: I got to spend a lot more time with
him, in a different way than I have before.

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.920
&gt;&gt;Chris: It has made me more compassionate
for other people. 

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:03.100
You don't judge a book by its cover. The little things don't matter anymore.

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.640
&gt;&gt;Rob: You know, you think too far in the
future, you do a lot of, "what if's," 

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.100
you know, like, "Ah you know I feel bad,” but I'm like, 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:12.720
"Why should I feel bad for him? 
He doesn't feel bad for himself.”

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:22.020
&gt;&gt;Pete: I honestly don't understand why this has happened to me, where I was a good kid before.

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:27.140
Maybe the truth of everything is
that bad things happen to good people.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:33.940
So, God, whatever you have in store for me,
in my life, I'm ready.

00:05:50.500 --> 00:05:54.000
Who knew I would be walking, running, swimming?

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.260
I proved those doctors 100% wrong. 

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:04.600
Doesn't matter, like, what type of situation you're in. 

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:11.000
You might as well regain and re-stabilize yourself. 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.960
Because you only get one chance.

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:19.720
&gt;&gt;Rob: I feel fortunate that he's around so that we can still experience things and still do things and, we are!

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.340
&gt;&gt;Chris: I prayed for the day that I would hear Pete's voice and now I hear it every day, all day. 

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.640
You know, and... It's okay, it's a blessing.

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.380
&gt;&gt;Pete: Listening means comfort, 
not like anguish and sadness.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.380
&gt;&gt;Chris: There's always, always hope.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.420
And listening is hope to me.

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.660
 That he's gonna make it. That things are gonna be OK.
