00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.479
A man was arrested for bringing a samurai
sword on board an SMRT train on Monday afternoon.

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.630
Tweets and photos from a commuter showed the
heavy-built man dressed in a samurai outfit

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.650
on board the train, with other passengers
in the carriage leaving him a wide berth.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.560
The tweets said the police and MRT staff were
"quite fast" in their response. According

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.560
to SMRT, the man had jumped the fare gate
at Paya Lebar MRT station and brought a samurai

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.530
sword on board the train. SMRT said its staff
informed the police immediately, and the man

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:39.210
was soon arrested near Bugis MRT station.
Police said the man alighted at City Hall

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:45.460
MRT station. Officers followed and advised
him to surrender his weapon at Bugis. The

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:51.379
man complied and was arrested for possessing
a weapon. Fortunately, no one was injured.

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.940
SMRT said passenger safety is its priority,
and it does not allow weapons to be brought onto its trains.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.060
He was later arrested at Bugis,
the police said in a statement last evening.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:24.860
Passenger Ow Yong Weng Leong said one of the
Public Transport Security Command (Transcom)

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.569
officers who had followed him into the train
took a step towards him. That was when the

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:35.099
man retaliated by pushing the officer in the
chest. He also pushed the other two officers

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.230
in the chest and unsheathed his sword. People
who saw the incident mentioned how they thought

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.440
the sword was fake at first until it started
glinting in the light. The New Paper reported

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:50.180
that the sword the man was carrying has a
sharp blade, unlike ornamental swords sold

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:55.870
here, which have blunt edges but sharp tips.
The police said that officers who later boarded

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.860
the train kept the suspect apart from other
commuters, reports The Straits Times.

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:06.860
This was done "so as not to aggravate the situation"
while they monitored the suspect and followed

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:12.840
him closely when he alighted at City Hall
MRT station. Mr Ow Yong also said, "The man

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:18.440
told the Transcom officers in a loud voice
'Don't follow me.' But they managed to follow

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.480
him into the train without a scuffle." "While
they were inside the train, he kept telling

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:29.269
them not to get close in a loud voice. He
sounded local." The man alighted at Dhoby

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.390
Ghaut station, with the officers trailing
him. The sword-wielding man was next seen

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.799
at Bugis, near Victoria Street at 1pm. When
he reached a traffic junction near Golden

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:45.299
Landmark Shopping Centre, he unsheathed his
sword and brandished it at the officers. When

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.930
they saw him running across the road, people
at the junction ran off in different directions.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:56.970
The man then crossed Arab Street, past Victoria
Street towards Jalan Pisang. He was arrested

00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:03.819
at about 1.15pm by the officers at the side
of a building at Jalan Pisang. SMRT had said

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.689
in a statement on its facebook page that the
man had jumped the fare gate at Paya Lebar

00:04:08.689 --> 00:04:10.079
MRT station before boarding the train.
