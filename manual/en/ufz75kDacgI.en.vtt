00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.734
Hello and welcome to

00:00:08.734 --> 00:00:11.633
On The Green with Alan.

00:00:11.633 --> 00:00:13.834
It is the start of a new

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:15.834
academic year at Gallaudet!

00:00:15.834 --> 00:00:19.133
Welcome Class of 2016!

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.367
Last week I gave
my Welcome Back speech

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:29.633
to the campus community.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:33.867
During that speech I mentioned
that over the summer

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:37.033
I spent some time recuperating.

00:00:37.033 --> 00:00:42.133
I also used the time to reflect
on Gallaudet's future.

00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:47.433
I came to the conclusion
that enrollment matters

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:50.700
to the future
of the university.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.367
The term Enrollment Matters means two things.

00:00:56.367 --> 00:01:02.166
Although the word "Matters"
is ambiguous in English,

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:07.333
its meaning is
conveyed beautifully in ASL.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:13.367
Enrollment matters... matter.

00:01:13.367 --> 00:01:16.533
Enrollment matters is important

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:20.333
because of our
fundamental belief in Gallaudet.

00:01:20.333 --> 00:01:24.600
We provide our students
with the solid foundation

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.900
of a quality
Liberal Arts education

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.834
in a bilingual
and fully accessible

00:01:30.834 --> 00:01:33.467
learning environment.

00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:36.000
Students leave Gallaudet prepared for

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.500
successful careers
and lives.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.767
We believe that what we do
at Gallaudet matters!

00:01:46.767 --> 00:01:50.533
And that is why we want to
increase enrollment,

00:01:50.533 --> 00:01:52.166
to prepare future generations

00:01:52.166 --> 00:01:54.200
of deaf and
hard of hearing students

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.433
to make an impact
on the world.

00:01:58.433 --> 00:02:02.867
To ensure we make enrollment
a top priority,

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:05.166
an Enrollment Management Council

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:08.333
will be established
and led by

00:02:08.333 --> 00:02:16.367
interim Chief Enrollment Officer Charity Reedy-Hines.

00:02:16.367 --> 00:02:22.500
The Council will involve a
cross-section of the university.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.667
The Council will develop a
university-wide enrollment plan

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:32.400
which reinforces the
Gallaudet Strategic Plan.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.367
The Council will establish
a timeline and projections

00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:39.667
for increasing enrollment.

00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:42.967
To support the efforts
of the Council,

00:02:42.967 --> 00:02:48.433
the Gallaudet University
Marketing Committee (GUM)

00:02:48.433 --> 00:02:52.700
will transition into
a reporting committee.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.033
GUM will be charged
with implementing

00:02:56.033 --> 00:03:00.767
the Enrollment Management
Council's initiatives.

00:03:00.767 --> 00:03:03.400
Executive Director of
Communications and

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.100
Public Relations
Cat Murphy

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.400
will lead GUM
starting this fall.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.266
We are asking
the Student Body Government

00:03:15.266 --> 00:03:18.300
and
the Graduate Student Association

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.166
to assist with
our enrollment efforts.

00:03:22.166 --> 00:03:25.800
Enrollment issues will
also be discussed at

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.266
University Council meetings.

00:03:29.266 --> 00:03:32.533
We ask the entire
Gallaudet community

00:03:32.533 --> 00:03:36.467
to make enrollment
a top priority.

00:03:36.467 --> 00:03:41.867
Together, we will accomplish
this critical mission.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.433
This year marks the
150th anniversary

00:03:52.433 --> 00:04:01.100
of the D.C. Compensated
Emancipation Act of 1862

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:05.700
which freed slaves in D.C.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.834
As part of D.C.'s yearlong celebration,

00:04:09.834 --> 00:04:14.467
Gallaudet recently hosted
D.C. historian and lecturer

00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:19.900
Carroll R. Gibbs
for a presentation.

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:27.000
Mr. Gibbs discussed how
many famous D.C. landmarks

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.600
were involved in the
city's history of slavery.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:36.934
He stressed the importance of
remembering our city's past

00:04:36.934 --> 00:04:40.400
and how the
sacrifices of others

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.200
led to the freedoms
we enjoy today.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.266
On November 13,
Gallaudet will host Tim Wise,

00:04:50.266 --> 00:04:53.500
a well-known
author and lecturer.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.166
That same day,
Gallaudet will unveil

00:04:58.166 --> 00:05:04.266
an exhibit about Amos Kendall and slavery in D.C.

00:05:04.266 --> 00:05:09.333
during the 1830s.

00:05:09.333 --> 00:05:15.800
We are also holding an essay,
multimedia, and poster contest

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.166
for Clerc Center
and university students.

00:05:20.166 --> 00:05:23.533
An awards ceremony
for the contest

00:05:23.533 --> 00:05:30.133
will be held on November 13
after Mr. Wise's presentation.

00:05:30.133 --> 00:05:35.300
I look forward to all of
the upcoming celebratory events

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:39.834
to mark this important time
in D.C.'s history.

00:05:45.567 --> 00:05:52.166
Election Day, November 6,
is coming soon!

00:05:52.166 --> 00:05:56.500
Because our students come
from all over the country,

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:57.934
Gallaudet is offering

00:05:57.934 --> 00:06:04.467
a free service to our community called TurboVote

00:06:04.467 --> 00:06:10.567
to register to vote and
to request absentee ballots.

00:06:10.567 --> 00:06:14.934
You can also sign up for
reminders of deadlines,

00:06:14.934 --> 00:06:18.800
voting dates, and more.

00:06:24.567 --> 00:06:30.500
Thank you for watching
On The Green with Alan.
