00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.649
Today on this 2002 Ford F-350 Super Duty,
were going to install the AFE Direct Fit Cold

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:14.030
Air system part number AFE51-10192.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:18.850
Our first step is going to be removing the
negative battery cable on both sides.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.370
This particular application has two batteries.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.530
Im going to start with the passenger side.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:31.760
With the passenger side down well move over
to the drivers side and repeat the same process.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:35.579
Now were going to go ahead and remove the
cold air intake holes that connect to the

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.579
air cleaner box.

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.519
You see the wire connector here, it goes through
the top of the air cleaner box, were going

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:42.499
to go ahead and disconnect and remove it also.

00:00:42.499 --> 00:00:45.390
Well set both aside for reinstallation later.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.999
Now were going to remove the top of the air
cleaner.

00:00:46.999 --> 00:01:15.479
Were going to set that aside as it will not
be reinstalled later.

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:31.609
Were 

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:57.859
going to pull 
the air filter out underneath the air filter

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:45.530
is 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:03:02.069
a 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:04:04.620
sensor that we will 
also 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:21.440
need 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:05:25.130
to remove 

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:43.409
under 
the box.
