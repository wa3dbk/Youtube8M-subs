00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.330
Hi Im Tricia an organic gardener and I grow
organically

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.330
for a healthy and safe food supply for
a clean and sustainable environment

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:11.719
for an enjoyable and rewarding
experience

00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:16.480
Are you longing for a taste of summer in
the winter grow herbs indoors

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.670
its easy I'll show you how The hardest
part about growing herbs indoors is

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.039
getting sufficient light

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.410
if herbs don't get six to eight hours of
direct light

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.960
they can get leggy and they don't taste
as good Often you'll get enough light

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.980
from a south or south west facing window
if you keep your plants in the window

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:34.489
sill

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:37.660
be sure and turn them every couple days towards the sun

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.790
if it's not enough light its easy to
supplement with a little bit of

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:41.610
fluorescent

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.700
A grow light like this jump-start system
is a great way to supplement with

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.590
fluorescent

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.500
it takes two hours of fluorescent
lighting to make up for one hour

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.719
of sunlight The light should be five to twelve
inches

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.750
above the plant The best kind of pots

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.180
are six inches and either wood bamboo
or clay

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.439
because they're breathable I like
these pots made of bamboo and plant fibers

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.170
there sustainable and they're attractive
Use a good quality light potting mix

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.100
like our Peaceful Valley potting soil

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.610
it doesn't hurt to add in some pumice or
perlite to a standard potting mix for some

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:17.700
extra drainage

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.909
Some favorites for growing indoors are
basil

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.390
chervil chives oregano parsley sage

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.920
mint bay rosemary thyme lemon balm

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.040
and tarragon You can grow herbs from seed

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.869
or cuttings herbs like sage lavender

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.290
oregano rosemary and tarragon

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.110
grow very well from cuttings others like
basil

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.320
parsley chives they do great from seed

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.390
Take cuttings from August to October and
root them for a supply

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.979
of herbs through the winter Check out our
blog on how to root cuttings

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.840
if you're growing from seed moisten your
potting soil

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.310
fill your pot plant a couple seeds in
each pot and cover with more moistened

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.259
potting soil

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:08.090
keep the soil moist but not wet Herbs
don't need a lot of fertilizer but every

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.420
couple of weeks they can benefit from a low
dosage of a water-soluble fertilizer

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.120
like this liquid fish During the winter
heating months

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.300
indoors might be a little dry for your
herbs to make up for the dryness

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.620
you can mist them every once in a while
or place a saucer with gravel in water

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:28.170
underneath the pot Water herbs regularly

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.069
but be careful not to overwater water
when the soil starts to dry out

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.190
herbs like bay marjoram oregano sage

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.349
and tyme like to dry out between
waterings

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.220
rosemary is one that should never be
allowed to dry out completely

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.459
If you're really into growing herbs and
veggies indoors

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.730
you might wanna try a vertical growing system like this

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:52.410
Foodie The Foodie allows you to grow several
levels of plants

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:56.890
in two square feet of floor space one of
the cool things about the foodie

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.489
is that you can rotate it to make sure
the plants get good light exposure

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.269
when growing in a window It can be
watered by hand or easily adapted to

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:04.690
water

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.379
automatically with a pump and timer Whether
your growing three pots in a window

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:09.800
sill

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.860
or your growing with a Foodie grow some
herbs

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:19.860
and grow organic for life

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:23.680
 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.930
