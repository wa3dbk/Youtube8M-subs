00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:19.000
Mercedes introduced the 3rd
generation C-Class (W204) in 2007.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.485
The sedan hit the market first.

00:00:24.485 --> 00:00:28.610
The combi/estate station wagon
followed a year later

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.235
There was a subtle facelift in 2011.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.765
It marked the introduction
of a pretty 2-doors coupe.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.020
Mercedes offers a lot of possible
choices, especially for the engine.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.495
It starts with the C180, which we're
driving now. It has 154 hp.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:55.615
It ends with the C63 AMG, or
the C63 AMG 507 with 500 hp. 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.135
That one is the most fun, of course.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.300
ENGINES
gasoline

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:06.220
ENGINES
diesel

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:14.925
When shopping for a C-Class at
AutoScout24, you'll find 1,200 cars.

00:01:14.925 --> 00:01:17.655
Over 50% is a sedan.

00:01:18.865 --> 00:01:25.915
Most of the rest is a station wagon.
1 out of 10 or 15 is a coupe.

00:01:25.915 --> 00:01:28.375
The coupe is available
since 2011, of course.

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:33.330
Most cars, 62%, have
an automatic gearbox.

00:01:33.935 --> 00:01:40.440
Less than 50% has a diesel engine.
We're driving on gasoline with the C180.

00:01:41.565 --> 00:01:44.010
It's the base model. 154 hp.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.540
Most cars have a lot of features,
so "base model" sounds dowdy.

00:01:50.085 --> 00:01:56.445
Most C-Classes for sale have satnav,
A/C, and a lot have leather.

00:01:56.915 --> 00:02:03.990
It means the cheapest cars
aren't the most basic ones.

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:08.910
Prices for a C-Class
start at 11,500 euros.

00:02:09.055 --> 00:02:11.055
PRICES
minimum, average, maximum

00:02:17.665 --> 00:02:20.080
This car offers good quality.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:27.875
Previous generations had some
problems, but these cars are OK.

00:02:27.875 --> 00:02:30.330
Of course you should
know a few things.

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.635
First of all, the key may not be
recognized after getting in.

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.350
Check if the car has two keys.
Bring the 2nd key with you on holiday.

00:02:42.875 --> 00:02:46.385
If one key doesn't work, you
can continue with the other.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:53.380
The atomizers in diesel engines can
break down, usually one at a time.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:05.690
The C350 with the M272 engine can get
play on the tensioners and timing belt.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.125
You don't want that, because when
shit hits the fan, it really does.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.195
So, check if it's maintained well.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:22.710
Beware of plastic handles breaking
off, so check if they're still firm.

00:03:23.185 --> 00:03:26.770
If they need replacing, the whole
door panel has to come off etc.

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:28.415
It's an expensive fix.

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:35.730
If you go for the C63 AMG:
it devours rear tires.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.910
Get a tire subscription
at cheap suppliers.

00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:43.525
If there's only two tire
companies in your village,

00:03:44.315 --> 00:03:48.785
look for another out of town because
the tires wear faster than expected.

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:59.300
Check for all C-Classes of this gen
if the front tires have an even wear.

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:02.395
The alignment can cause troubles.

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:10.010
In general, there's a lot of
C-Classes with automatic.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:18.870
Most of the time they're problem
free, but need to be maintained well.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:25.575
If you hear a noise, it can be fixed
with new liquids and oil.

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:30.625
Check if everything runs
smooth and sounds right.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.960
This car is a C180 with 154 hp.

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:39.615
It's a nice car.

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.400
Silver grey, a fresh car with
a manual transmission. 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:47.010
If you're looking for that, it's
harder to find than an automatic.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:53.305
The C180 is no rocket,
but it does go.

00:04:54.365 --> 00:04:57.960
Only leather is missing,
and I'm not very fond of wood.

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:00.915
There are people who like it.

00:05:01.265 --> 00:05:03.265
THIS CAR

00:05:18.265 --> 00:05:21.100
