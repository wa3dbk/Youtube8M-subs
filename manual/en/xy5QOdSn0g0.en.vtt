00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:03.500
.of 2011 Nissan Maxima.

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.359
We're going to install part number 11352 from
CURT.

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:08.359
All right.

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:10.090
This is what the hitch looks like when it's
installed on the car.

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:13.260
Next, we're going to give you some measurements
that'll help you out in selecting some accesories

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.950
such as a bike rack or a cargo carrier.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:20.290
From the center of the hitch pin opening to
the edge of the bumper is five inches.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.960
And from the top or receiver opening down
to the ground will be nine and three quarter

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:24.960
inches.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.900
Now, I'll go ahead and show you how the hitch
is installed.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.190
First thing we need to do is go ahead and
remove the mufflers from the car.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:01:23.710
We'll unbolt these fasteners 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:02:04.729
here and here, then we can slide the mufflers
off the exhaust.

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:38.850
Spray them down with 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:03:15.030
a lubricant.
