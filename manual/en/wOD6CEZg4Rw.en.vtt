00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:07.479
In our last video, we met the astronaut and
living legend, Commander Chris Hadfield.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:13.380
Inspired by some of the photographs he took in orbit around the Earth whilst onboard the              International Space Station;

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.790
we invited him to re-create some of the incredible
textures in his photographs, 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:20.480
but using close-up macro-photography instead.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.060
Today, we’re going to be investigate how
macro photography works

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.660
and show you a few methods to take your own
macro-photos at home.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:33.900
Macro-photography typically refers to that
in which the image produced is greater than life sized.

00:00:34.289 --> 00:00:39.039
Now camera lens like this one actually contains
a few different lenses inside it.

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:44.379
As you adjust the distance between the lens
and the subject, the image comes into focus.

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.480
But there’s only so close you can get before
the image gets out of focus.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.980
A standard kit lens such as this one has a
magnification of only 1:3.

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.629
In other words that means that at the minimum
focus distance, the image appears to be only

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:01.690
one-third the life-size of the object.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.199
To overcome this, there are a few options
for you to magnify your image.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.579
The first is to get another lens. Now there
are hundreds of options out there for you to try,

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.479
before long it can start getting pretty expensive.
So we're going to show you a few cheaper options.

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.469
The first thing to try is putting your
lens on backwards.

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:20.670
This might sound like a strange thing to do,
but it actually works pretty well

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.610
Normally a lens allows you to focus on a
big object that's far away and make it look much smaller

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.310
By turning the lens around you can do the
opposite.

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:33.439
So you're able to look at a small object that's
up close and make it appear much bigger.

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:40.039
So all you need is a reverse lens adapter,
which goes between your camera and the filter thread of your lens.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.039
Alternatively, you can move your lens further
away from the camera’s sensor.

00:01:44.039 --> 00:01:49.719
Now doing this allows you to get an object
much closer to the lens and still have it in focus.

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:54.899
So we can do that using this series of barrel-extenders.
Now these things are cheap, but they do the

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.789
job and are the best £15 we’ve ever spent.

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:01.049
The last option is to use a second lens to
the front of first one.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.320
This is a little bit like holding up a magnifying glass.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.649
Now you can use a coupling ring to fix two
lenses together, and have one in reverse.

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.500
Or, you can do away with all of that and use
the camera from your phone and an old laser-pointer.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.670
If you take apart the laser-pointer, inside
will be a tiny lens like this one.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.140
All you have to do is fix this lens to the
front of the lens of the camera on your phone;

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.810
to do this we’ve used a ring of plasticine...
and voila! It's as simple as that.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.000
The image is magnified and we can take some
macro-photos. Try this for yourself at home,

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.269
and see how different the world looks up close.

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:40.500
