Hi welcome to StressedOutStressFree.com my
name is Vincent Woon. In this video we are

00:00:09.391 --> 00:00:11.200
going to talk about the mouse

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:20.310
Ooops! not this mouse, medium mouse, small
mouse, trackball mouse, wireless mouse, what’s

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:25.779
thatHey that’s my daughter’s pet hamster
and big mouse

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.750
Why are we talking about the mouse today?
My wife came back yesterday complaining that

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:36.620
she have pain in the hand especially at the
web area here. After asking few questions

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:44.250
about how her work place is set up. We figured
out that, she was using a trackball mouse

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.500
with a limited space and she uses the mouse
a lot.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.600
And I figured the repetitive use of the mouse
create pain for her it might create pain for

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.080
other people like you and what I’n going
to do is show you how to loosen the muscles

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.369
in the area.

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:07.470
Usually this is the pain area, the wrist area
and the web. Today I’m going to show you

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:17.820
the web. How you dig into the web area. Use
your index finger.. find where the pain and

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:25.610
all you need to do is move this way like such,
push it you’ll feel the knot there and that

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:33.340
will loosen up or you can use your thumb same
way push it in and the other method is just

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.440
to put your thumb there and move your other
fingers you will feel it or just move this

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:48.140
way and you’ll feel the area loosen up or
the knot loosen up.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:56.080
To tackle this area, the wrist area just use
your pad of your thumb, push down hold it

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:09.221
and then move your hand move your wrist and
to finish it you just do a little quick to

00:02:09.221 --> 00:02:21.090
loosen up the area. Here too, just hold on
to it kind of like jiggle it. Push it down

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.740
too and that’s it.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.819
Thank you very much for watching, this is
what I do to release the tension for my wife

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:35.000
