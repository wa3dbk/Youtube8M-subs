Hey I'm Justin with AmericanMuscle.com and
I'm going to be breaking down Covercraft's

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.539
deluxe custom fit car cover fitting all 87-93
Mustang GTs.

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:15.139
The deluxe custom fit is Covercraft's higher
end offering for the Mustang, and is an excellent

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.480
way to protect your Fox body from the elements
when it's not out being enjoyed.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.660
This cover does include some features that
Covercraft's ready fit cover does not, so

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.029
with that said let's take a closer look.

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.849
The first difference is in the name, whereas
Covercraft's ready fit cover is a great budget

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.560
friendly car cover, the deluxe custom fit
has been tailored specifically to the lines

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:39.090
of the Fox, as you can see with our GT here
in the shop.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.320
This is going to allow the cover to do its
job even better by sealing out the elements,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.320
protecting your ride.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.190
To help further protect your paint, the deluxe
features a unique triple layer fabric known

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:56.070
as Blockit 380, this offers unmatched protection
by utilizing a soft inner and outer barrier,

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.940
sandwiching an inner film barrier, that blocks
out everything from dirt, dust and water,

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.500
yet still offers great breathability so it's
going to allow any heat and moisture to escape

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.280
while the cover is in place.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.570
This fabric is pretty thick too so it should
prevent any small dents and scratches, while

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:12.840
the car is in storage.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.350
This is a pretty mindless install that could
take you 15 minutes at first, but once you

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.920
do it a few times you'll probably do it even
faster.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.170
Me personally, I like to get the cover situated
on the roof first, with the officially licensed

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.280
Mustang logo pointing forward, after that
get the cover in the corresponding mirror

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.620
pockets first, and then pull the front and
rear of the cover over each bumper.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:37.530
Before installing the cover for the first
time you'll either need to remove the antenna

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.200
like I did, or make a small hole in the cover
and use the included grommet where the antenna

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.310
will go through.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.460
So if you're looking for only the best protecting
for your Fox Mustang while it's not out being

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.510
enjoyed, look no further than Covercraft's
deluxe custom fit car cover, available right

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:53.850
