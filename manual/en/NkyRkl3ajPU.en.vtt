President Obama and his ever so corrupt administration just seem to be digging 
 the hole deeper and deeper when it comes to Benghazi Libya.

00:00:10.899 --> 00:00:21.899
It has become utterly impossible to get anything even remotely approaching the truth from this 
 bunch about the deaths of Ambassador Christopher Stevens and 3 other Americans in Libya.

00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:33.394
Just Friday, former CIA director David Petraeus testified in a closed door session that he knew right away 
 that the attack on our Consulate in Libya was the work of Al Qaeda militants, 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:41.370
yet the Obama administration kept the lie going for at least 2 weeks 
 that the attack came as a result of the anti Islam video.

00:00:43.823 --> 00:00:50.823
Petraeus also commented that the original CIA talking points said it 
 was a terrorist attack and that Al Qaeda was responsible.

00:00:53.677 --> 00:01:00.677
However, Petraeus also said these original taking points had been changed 
 to delete the reference to terrorism and Al Qaeda.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:15.180
One of the things President Obama did to keep the lie going was of course to send out US Ambassador to the UN 
 Susan Rice to go on 5 Sunday morning talk shows 5 days after the attack and tell everyone who would listen,

00:01:21.548 --> 00:01:26.548
this was just a protest gone wrong base on that hateful video.

00:01:44.853 --> 00:01:56.850
So when did those CIA talking points get changed? They made it out the CIA door, but when they 
 went through the White House and into Susan Rice's hands, they had been changed to reflect the lie.

00:02:03.035 --> 00:02:15.040
Okay, got that. This is the lie that President Obama wants you to believe. Even though he knew all along 
 it was a terrorist attack, instead of just not sending out anyone to talk about what happened in Libya,

00:02:16.347 --> 00:02:28.350
he sent Susan Rice out to 5 Sunday morning talk shows to spread a patently false story. Instead of 
 telling the hosts and millions of Americans watching those Sunday talk shows that maybe, oh I don't know,

00:02:33.194 --> 00:02:40.190
this was an incident that was still being investigated and they couldn't talk 
 about it in much detail, they decided to lie about it.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:14.660
So President Obama, why did the talking points get changed to say this wasn't a 
 terrorist attack and why did you lie about what really happened in Libya?

00:03:20.833 --> 00:03:30.830
I think America wants to know the answer to those things because 
 the blood of 4 dead Americans are on your hands.
