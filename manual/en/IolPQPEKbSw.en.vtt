00:00:00.531 --> 00:00:02.749
In part one and two, we set up the command centre,

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.781
built the extractors and 
started extracting materials into the storage silo.

00:00:07.413 --> 00:00:11.617
So now we want to refine the materials 
into products that we can sell or develop further.

00:00:12.325 --> 00:00:14.881
So let's build two basic industrial facilities,

00:00:15.058 --> 00:00:17.607
and place them close to the silo and link them all together.

00:00:18.679 --> 00:00:20.382
Now we are ready to select the Schematics.

00:00:20.966 --> 00:00:24.327
One factory will produce Biofuels 
and the other will produce Precious Metals.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.303
Let's select the schematics and press Install.

00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:31.283
Now, the product window pops up offering you to route the products

00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:33.693
and let's create a route to the Silo.

00:00:35.165 --> 00:00:38.307
We now have two factories ready to deliver products to the silo.

00:00:39.536 --> 00:00:42.381
Now we only need to route some of the raw materials 
into the factories

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.874
in order to start the process.

00:00:44.596 --> 00:00:46.096
Select the Storage facility.

00:00:46.497 --> 00:00:49.516
In the Storage Facility, you can see 
that we have already received

00:00:49.716 --> 00:00:52.006
the first batch of raw materials.

00:00:52.013 --> 00:00:53.416
If we select the Routes button,

00:00:53.968 --> 00:00:56.418
we can view the flow of materials 
in and out of the Silo.

00:00:58.143 --> 00:00:59.295
Let's open the storage again

00:00:59.295 --> 00:01:02.838
and route the Carbon Compounds 
and the Noble Metals from the storage

00:01:03.007 --> 00:01:04.753
to their appropriate factories.

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:11.035
You can now clearly see that the materials 
are flowing to and from the factories.

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:13.863
The factory cycle for the basic factories
is about 30 minutes,

00:01:14.185 --> 00:01:17.477
which fits really nicely with
the extraction period we have selected.

00:01:17.752 --> 00:01:19.041
As we discussed before,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.373
the refined products can be combined
in Advanced Factories to produce Biocells.

00:01:24.331 --> 00:01:27.022
So let's build an Advanced Factory
and link that to the Silo.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.750
Now we select the Advanced Factory 
and select Biocells as the product.

00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:34.106
Install the Schematic

00:01:34.184 --> 00:01:36.154
and route the product 
to the Launch Pad this time.

00:01:36.931 --> 00:01:39.690
Let's route the Biofuels and 
the Precious Metals

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.330
to the Advanced Factories.

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:43.399
We currently have none in storage,

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:45.718
but we can select the Routes button again

00:01:45.718 --> 00:01:48.793
and forward the incoming materials 
into the Advanced Factory.

00:01:51.136 --> 00:01:53.366
We now have set up the routes 
for the advanced factory.

00:01:53.847 --> 00:01:58.695
Once the basic factories have finished producing
their first batch of refined materials,

00:01:58.937 --> 00:02:01.861
they will be transported to the advanced factory 
for the final production.

00:02:03.125 --> 00:02:05.013
Note that we are not using the high-tech factory.

00:02:05.801 --> 00:02:09.595
The high-tech factory combines advanced materials
 to produce high tech products,

00:02:09.595 --> 00:02:13.139
such as Self harmonizing Power Cores
or Wetware Mainframes.

00:02:14.328 --> 00:02:17.467
The site is now fully set up 
and will continue to produce Biocells

00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:21.426
until the extraction is finished 
and the stored materials run out.

00:02:22.278 --> 00:02:25.327
Harvesting from other types of planets 
and manufacturing other types of products

00:02:25.427 --> 00:02:26.724
works in the same manner.

00:02:26.744 --> 00:02:31.112
In part four, we will learn how to launch the products 
into space and retrieve them.

00:02:31.345 --> 00:02:32.745
Until then, fly safe.
