00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.010
There's something inherently enjoyable about
mine cart rides in videogames.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.289
From Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom
to Donkey Kong Country, they remain a memorable

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:16.920
part of those titles.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.880
Wait, did I say enjoyable?

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.769
I must have meant hair-tearingly frustrating.

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.520
Well luckily Rail Rush isn't that psychotic.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.470
I mean it eventually becomes that way the
longer you play for, but being in the same

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:32.890
vain as Temple Run, this sort of exponential
difficulty is expected.

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.239
The formula here is pretty stock standard.

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:39.690
Survive in the mines as long as you can, collect
as much gold as possible, use that gold in

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.899
the store once you die, and then play again
to see if you can get a little further.

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:48.240
There are six decisions you can make when
you come to each obstacle, and of course only

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.450
one of them is the correct one.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.400
Swiping up will make the mine cart jump, swiping
down will make your player duck.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.510
Swiping left and right will jump the cart
to a different track in that direction, and

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.700
leaning left and right will not only avoid
wooden signs that only cover half the track,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.420
but this is how you collect all the nuggets,
gems, and eggs that are floating around in

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.420
this mine.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.530
The further you go, the less time you have
to make these decisions and the more the game

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.090
mixes them up so you'll be track hopping,
leaning back and forth collecting as much

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.280
gold as possible, before forgetting that you
have to duck, and then that being the end

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.280
of you.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.270
The items in the store are your standard fare.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.400
Usable items that allow you to plow through
one obstacles or magnets to collect gold,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.840
new characters, mine cart upgrades, nothing
should come as a surprise.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.420
The prices of these items seem rather steep
and suggest that the developers want you to

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.630
spend money through in-app purchases to deck
out your ride.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.500
Some of these items can be collected by breaking
open the eggs you find in your travels, and

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.790
there are plenty of missions and achievements
to complete as well.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.770
Starting off, Rail Rush seemed like a game
we've played a hundred times before, but after

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.880
the initial few failures, its addictive quality
started to shine through.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.869
You really don't need any of the items in
the shop to enjoy this title, and its reflex

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.479
oriented gameplay is reminiscent of a more
contextual version of Simon.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.020
If you're sick to death of Temple Run clones,
there's probably nothing for you here, but

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:14.080
for those who aren't, this is a solid entry
into the genre.
