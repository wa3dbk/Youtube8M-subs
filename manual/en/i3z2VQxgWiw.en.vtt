00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:26.660
Wow theyíre not even trying to hide the program
any more, are they?

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.750
Are you Selen Sidran?

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.050
Mm-hmm.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.320
Iím Sergeant First Class Benjamin Gould.
We spoke online earlier.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.960
Yeah, I figured as much.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.559
This is Major Christina Moore, Commander of
the Gem Special Security Detachment. She can

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.770
explain more about the assignment we discussed.

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:51.420
Ms. Sidran, I must admit I was not particularly
impressed by your service record. However,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:55.280
we have need of someone with your relatively
unique qualifications.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.640
Iím flattered. You obviously have a healthy
supply of enhanced individuals who blend so

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.240
well with the civilian population, what do
you need for me?

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.369
If you donít want the job...

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.500
Ms. Sidran, this sort of assignment requires
the Corp to maintainÖ a respectful distance.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.200
The Major feels a civilian contractor would
be ideal. Given your past association with

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.890
the program and certain individuals, weíve
selected you for consideration.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.290
Which certain individuals?

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:28.210
Youíre familiar with Aisha Blackmon.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.670
Yeah, we went through the program together
back on Gem.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.200
She currently runs a private security firm
under contract with a Boreal geneticist named

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.020
Parada.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.740
Okay, so whatís the problem?

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:46.329
We have information that heís involved in
unauthorized Genetic work. Mr. Parada operates

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.799
a genetic fitness club here in the city, but
we suspect heís also conducting illegal activities

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.040
off-world.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.990
As you already know Blackmon, we want you
to infiltrate her security crew.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:04.250
God knows we certainly wouldnít want any
illegal genetic work done on anyone.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:10.540
You may not take the threat of aliens manipulating
the DNA of humans for their own purposes seriously,

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.490
but I assure you the Corps does, and I--

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.830
Look, Clearly this is an issue we all have
some experience with, but this isnít a policy

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:25.960
debate about the program. Itís a job, are
you interested or not?

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:30.260
Right, okayÖ what am I supposed to do once
Iím in?

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.250
Youíre to collect evidence of any illegal
GM activities that may involve the corps.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.810
Thatís it?

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.110
Thatís it.

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.110
A prior source informed us a possible meeting
offworld soon.

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.640
So we suggest you move quickly.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.890
Alright, Iím on it then.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.700
Excellent. Contact us when you have the information,
and weíll arrange payment.

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:57.640
Just one question, what happen to your prior
source?

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.050
She dropped out unexpectedly.
