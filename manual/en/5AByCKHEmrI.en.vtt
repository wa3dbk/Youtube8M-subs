00:00:11.267 --> 00:00:14.300
Polyform Products Company
manufactures a complete range

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.167
of oven bake polymer clays,

00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:18.833
which are available through
Blick Art Materials.

00:00:18.833 --> 00:00:21.167
All of our clays stay soft
until you're ready to

00:00:21.167 --> 00:00:23.733
bake them in
your own home oven.

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:25.600
After they're baked
they can be sanded,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.467
drilled, carved, polished,

00:00:27.467 --> 00:00:31.900
they can be finished with
acrylic paints or glazes.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.933
Our clays are
all allergen free,

00:00:33.933 --> 00:00:36.067
they're lead
and phthalate free,

00:00:36.067 --> 00:00:37.367
they're never
tested on animals

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:39.767
and they're made right here
in the United States.

00:00:39.767 --> 00:00:41.867
Now let's take a look at
the specialty clays

00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:43.933
from Polyform Products Company.

00:00:43.933 --> 00:00:46.100
Bake and Bend is a truly
unique polymer clay

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.667
because it stays flexible

00:00:47.667 --> 00:00:49.900
and rubbery
even after it's been baked.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.533
Adults will enjoy it
for its wide range of uses,

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:55.500
and children will
just love playing with it.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.433
Bake Shop is
a really really soft clay

00:00:57.433 --> 00:00:58.733
that's so easy to condition,

00:00:58.733 --> 00:01:00.533
making it perfect
for children

00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:03.800
and beginning clay artists.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.533
Translucent Liquid Sculpey is
a liquid polymer clay

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.733
so it has a lot of the same
characteristics of

00:01:09.733 --> 00:01:11.000
our solid polymers

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.833
but can do some
unexpected things

00:01:12.833 --> 00:01:14.700
because it's in liquid form.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.833
It's white in appearance
but bakes up semi translucent

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:19.167
in the oven.

00:01:19.167 --> 00:01:23.833
It's perfect for
photo image transfers.

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:25.733
It's also a really
good adhesive

00:01:25.733 --> 00:01:29.067
to form raw clay to
raw clay bonds,

00:01:29.067 --> 00:01:33.667
and also to use between
raw clay to pre-baked clay.

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:35.633
Sculpey MoldMaker was
specially formulated

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:38.267
so that you can make your own
permanent and flexible

00:01:38.267 --> 00:01:39.500
push molds.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.767
You can make molds of
things that you've created,

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:44.600
or found items like
buttons and coins.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.000
What's great about that is
then you can use the mold

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.667
to make a series of pieces
which are exactly identical.

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:52.633
The MoldMaker is super soft
so it captures

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:54.400
really fine details,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.367
and after you've baked it
in your home oven,

00:01:56.367 --> 00:01:58.467
you can use it
with Plaster of Paris,

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:01.800
with wax,
or with polymer clays.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.167
MoldMaker is also
a perfect softening agent.

00:02:04.167 --> 00:02:06.500
If you have some clay
that's a little bit too firm,

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.900
just a pinch of MoldMaker
and a whole handful of

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:09.867
that firm clay

00:02:09.867 --> 00:02:14.000
and you've got clay that's
easy to use in just minutes.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.233
Ultra Light is one of
my favorite clays.

00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:18.633
It is by far our softest clay,

00:02:18.633 --> 00:02:22.233
but bakes up
rock hard in the oven.

00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:25.167
When you roll it out thin
it stays very flexible

00:02:25.167 --> 00:02:28.133
so it's great for
paper crafting.

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:30.367
The uses for this would
include armatures,

00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:33.433
underneath a base
of other clays,

00:02:33.433 --> 00:02:35.533
or you might use it to make
an oversized bead

00:02:35.533 --> 00:02:39.433
that you could cover with
a veneer of millefiori canes.

00:02:39.433 --> 00:02:42.500
This clay is so lightweight
that it even floats.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.133
Wouldn't it be great
to make some tub toys,

00:02:44.133 --> 00:02:46.633
or some floating candles?

00:02:46.633 --> 00:02:54.067

00:02:54.067 --> 00:02:55.300
