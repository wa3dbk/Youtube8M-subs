00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:05.100
You know, I'm feeling kind of sick you guys and

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.340
That game was not the remedy I was looking for at all

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.820
A 6-2

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.220
Shalacking at the hands of

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.040
Crosby the boogie monster and the Pittsburgh Penguins

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.220
To my knowledge the Leafs don't have to play them anymore

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.360
I think that was their fourth game against them, and thank goodness

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:29.680
Crosby and Malkin are monsters! Boogie monsters!

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:35.910
And now they have J.S. Aubain in net, I know it's not J.S. Aubin, it's Ty Conklin

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.440
But where did he come from he's 6-0

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:46.220
With this superhuman save percentage, did this guy not cost the Edmonton Oilers a Stanley Cup a couple years ago

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.261
Pretty sure he did ,pretty sure he did, pretty sure that was a guy

00:00:51.261 --> 00:00:53.399
Very few bright spots in this game

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.329
Even a Tucker fight with Ruutu, I don't know, he did okay

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.380
Lone bright spot

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.620
I suppose

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.160
Jason Blake finally scoring, he's got three goals in his last two games

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:08.640
Way to go Jason, but other than that

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.260
The Leafs looked how I look

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.020
Like poop

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.520
That was

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.500
A wretched game

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.630
6-2 is a bad loss, and what makes it worse?

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.899
Is it was the Leafs 41st game

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.529
Meaning they have played half of their games, they're on pace to get 80 points

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.819
They got 90 or 91 last year, and they didn't make the playoffs

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.720
Damn

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.089
That is a problem, and I was just reading an article here on Sportsnet that Pogge

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.880
Will apparently be

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.180
Disappointed

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.280
If he's not called up at some point this year

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.220
And

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:10.820
I did say to keep him in the minors before but I didn't realize Toskala was going to be out this long, says here

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:18.500
Pogge, he's 21, he's 12-2-4 with the Marlies with a 2.24 goals against average

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.700
And a 909 save percentage

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:30.269
That's more like it Justin. I think, oh, I don't know, maybe the Leafs do call him up for one game

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:34.380
One or two, and he said he didn't even have to play

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.890
One or two

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.620
Call him up for, make sure Toskala is back

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.260
And Clemmensens in the minors at this point and just

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:47.760
Give him a call-up

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.260
I still say Pogge is better served in the minors where he will get tons of playoff experience this year

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.119
It looks like the Marlies are prepped for a deep playoff run

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.019
And just leave him there

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:03.880
Leafs? :(

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.780
Are not looking very good

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.209
Jason Blake, if he can keep up the pace that he's

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:15.920
Done in the last two games. I hope, I hope! He can end the season

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.320
With at least 20 goals

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:24.940
Hopefully 25. I know that's not nearly what people expected of him, who cares at this point

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:33.080
Get over it. If he starts improving, he starts improving. Wellwood? Get your lazy bum back in the lineup

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.620
Do what Maurice wants you to do

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:48.980
Let's review some of the videos I've done, or the repercussions of the videos as a result

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:51.960
halfway in to the season

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.700
110 subscribers

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.360
Didn't expect that at all

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:01.640
And!

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.920
Two subscribers appear to already have their own videos, another one for the Leafs and one for the Islanders

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.880
As far as I know there might be more

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.920
I think someone wanted to do a Sens one

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.120
Yeah

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.260
Interesting, last thing I would like to talk about, I got this recently this book

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.539
McCowan's Law; the 100 Greatest Hockey Arguments my Bob McCowan

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:29.839
He's the radio show host on the Fan with

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:32.810
Wears sunglasses indoors

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.500
Although he seems to be a very stable intellectual person

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:38.960
Despite that

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:46.380
I think I'm gonna love and hate that book because he's a very opinionated dude. I haven't read any of the arguments yet

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.500
Buuuut

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:53.820
Gretzky record book, no good Leafs, worst ideas, ever why Americans don't watch, the Sens as chokers

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:56.990
I think I'm gonna love that book

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.549
I'll plug one last book that I'm not getting paid for and then call it a day

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:05.570
Go to the Net; Eight Goals that Changed the Game

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:08.180
Great book, I read it this year

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.500
I wasn't even alive for a lot of the books, uh, for a lot of the goals that are described in the book

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:18.250
But I feel like I've seen them, that's actually how well they're described

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:23.650
Go Leafs Go?

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.509
And find a way to dig yourself up out of 13th
