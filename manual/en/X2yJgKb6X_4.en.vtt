00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.320
Your doctor has recommended that you undergo
a Dilation and Curettage, or D and C. But

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.689
what does that actually mean?

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.550
The uterus is part of a woman's reproductive
system. It's the organ that contains the growing

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:32.640
fetus.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.570
The cervix forms the neck of the uterus,

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:41.520
and the vagina is the canal through which
conception and birth take place.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.980
The endometrium is a soft lining that protects
the fetus during pregnancy.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.130
Reasons for having a D and C vary. Most D
and C's are performed because the patient

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:56.170
has complained of unusually heavy menstrual
bleeding.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:03.170
Other common problems include, uterine infection,
bleeding after sexual intercourse, incomplete

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.119
miscarriage

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:12.159
or the presence of polyps - small pieces of
extra tissue growing on the inside of the

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.020
uterine wall.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.189
Then the surgeon will use a gloved hand to
conduct a vaginal examination and will check

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:25.689
the size and location of the uterus by pressing
on your lower abdomen.

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:31.789
A metal or plastic vaginal speculum is used
to gently expand the vagina and allow access

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:34.399
to the cervix.

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:40.850
Once the cervix is visible, a forcep is used
to grasp the front lip of the cervix - causing

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.649
the uterus to open a little.

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.729
Using a blunt-tipped probe, the surgeon carefully
measures the length of the uterus and takes

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.459
a small sample of tissue from the cervical
canal.

00:01:53.459 --> 00:02:00.459
Next, the surgeon will dilate, or open the
cervix, using a series of progressively larger

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:05.350
metal rods called dilators.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.810
When the cervix has expanded sufficiently,
the doctor will use a spoon-shaped instrument

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:17.810
called a curette to gently scrape out the
lining of the uterus. In some cases, surge

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.720
When the entire lining of the uterus has been
removed, the instruments are withdrawn.

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:38.829
The tissue removed will then be sent to a
laboratory for analysis.
