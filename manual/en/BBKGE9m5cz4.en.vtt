00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.157
What's up guys? Welcome to Slow Mo Lab!

00:00:02.157 --> 00:00:04.873
We haven't done anything with our rat trap for a while

00:00:04.873 --> 00:00:09.495
And it's not one of those mouse traps which is half the size and probably even less power

00:00:09.495 --> 00:00:11.994
 But today we are going to do something with it

00:00:11.994 --> 00:00:15.914
We haven not done it with it, We missed it and we are going to throw the ping pong ball in it

00:00:15.914 --> 00:00:21.490
Will it bounce off? will it smash it and explode it? let's check it out and we'll film it in slow motion

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:23.709
Muaahhh!!

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:24.567
Let's do it!

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:26.780
So I am going to set up the rat trap (mousetrap) right over here

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.316
and we are going to throw couple different objects in it and see what happens. Let's do it!

00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:33.495
Well we have our rat trap set up

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:37.140
and we are going to get out ping pong balls. We haven't played with them for a while as well

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.033
So we are going to throw it on the rat trap and we'll see what happens

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:43.075
Not really sure what to expect, but why not?

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.560
Alright hopefully it's not going to shoot into my face

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.056
if anything I have eye protection. Let's do it!

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.320
Where is it??

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.475
Let's check it out in slow motion and see what happend.

00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:00.235
ping pong ball dropping into the mousetrap

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.540
sound of the mousetrap smashing and hitting the ping pong ball in slow mo

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.100
Well that looked pretty cool in slow motion, although, it wasn't the result that I expected to see

00:01:14.095 --> 00:01:18.015
I am hoping to hit it again and for the bracket to smash it and

00:01:18.015 --> 00:01:23.100
I just wanted to see if it will break it or what will happen if it smashed the ball against the wood

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.200
let's do it!

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.520
Everyone ready? lets do it!
