Behind the Scenes
Hit Chance &amp; God Wars

00:00:07.843 --> 00:00:10.830
There are improvements to God Wars in this weeks behind the scenes 

00:00:10.985 --> 00:00:15.247
but before we take a look at that here's Mod Avatar with news on new armour types 

00:00:15.438 --> 00:00:18.862
and some player feedback inspired tweaks to hit chance. 

00:00:19.134 --> 00:00:23.383
Hit Chance is where we compare your equipment to your opponent's equipment

00:00:23.562 --> 00:00:26.233
and if your equipments better than theirs you have a higher chance to hit them.

00:00:26.872 --> 00:00:33.219
Basically we take into account all of your offensive stats so anything that's contributed from your weapon or your armour 

00:00:33.538 --> 00:00:36.755
and then we compare that against your opponents defense stats 

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:42.652
the current implementation of it is quite awkward and convoluted it didn't work as we wanted it too when we released EOC. 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.598
A lot of players have said they haven't seen their stats making enough of a difference in combat as they used to,

00:00:47.623 --> 00:00:54.471
what we've done is we've tweaked the stat contribution towards your hit chances and your defense chances. 

00:00:54.964 --> 00:01:00.340
Because we're reworking how stats contributed to your combat effectiveness.

00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:08.324
Potions and prayers that increase your actual level will also benefit from the stat contribution we're adding 

00:01:08.563 --> 00:01:11.358
We're now introducing new types of armour into the game. 

00:01:11.383 --> 00:01:16.248
Tank gear, which is maximum defense and maximum life point bonus. 

00:01:16.705 --> 00:01:24.432
The power armour you'll sacrifice your life points and your defense rating for increased damage. 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:31.457
The Hybrid you won't suffer any penalties across all of the styles, your defense against all styles will be the same

00:01:31.482 --> 00:01:37.443
but you'll have a similar armour decrease but a massive drop in your total hit points. 

00:01:37.743 --> 00:01:41.599
We just hope it will give players a lot more choice, they're been asking for it a lot 

00:01:41.624 --> 00:01:46.030
and we decided with the reworked hit chance we can support this type of gear now. 

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:47.774
The players feedback is really important to us

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:51.875
all of the changes to the hit chance and the armours have been driven by player feedback initially anyway 

00:01:52.132 --> 00:02:02.122
so we will keep an eye on the players feedback and make sure we can incorporate their opinions and ideas into the future of combat. 

00:02:02.699 --> 00:02:06.789
God Wars is a big PvE dungeon in Runescape really popular it's been popular for years

00:02:06.814 --> 00:02:11.730
and it's just a massive area full of bosses and monsters to get some awesome armour and weapons from. 

00:02:12.321 --> 00:02:16.203
We've made a few tweaks to the God Wars boss rooms 

00:02:16.394 --> 00:02:20.986
and that involves adding a grouping system and a little bit of fun and challenge with the new hard mode encounters. 

00:02:21.194 --> 00:02:25.581
Following the success of the Kalphite king we realized people do like the ability to have private groups. 

00:02:25.606 --> 00:02:27.815
It removes the risk of being crashed by other groups

00:02:28.024 --> 00:02:31.992
so what I've done is I've extended that and brought in the god wars fights to that system

00:02:32.017 --> 00:02:35.453
and now you can make your own version which is private to you and your friends. 

00:02:36.335 --> 00:02:39.129
So what this does is it allows you to get to the doors and if there's a group in there 

00:02:39.154 --> 00:02:42.015
you can go right lets make our own party and go straight in anyway. 

00:02:42.182 --> 00:02:44.980
It does increase the amount of people that can go into bosses concurrently 

00:02:45.172 --> 00:02:47.780
which obviously means a lot more weapons and armour coming into the game 

00:02:48.004 --> 00:02:53.113
to balance this when you make your own personal version of the grouping system boss fights 

00:02:53.322 --> 00:02:57.738
we do ask for around two hundred thousand gold an hour and you can top it up whilst you're in there.

00:02:57.763 --> 00:03:02.570
Anyone can top it up so if I make a party and someone comes with me they can top it up when we're in there,

00:03:02.595 --> 00:03:05.754
we can stay as long as we want you just have to pay that little fee. 

00:03:05.961 --> 00:03:09.496
There's always the option when you get to the doors you don't have to make a personal version 

00:03:09.521 --> 00:03:11.915
you can go straight into the original one for free as normal. 

00:03:12.473 --> 00:03:15.304
Grouping system is one of the 2 things we've added with this update 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:18.135
the other one is the addition of what we're calling hard mode. 

00:03:18.595 --> 00:03:20.722
Hard mode was the brain child of Mod Dean 

00:03:20.747 --> 00:03:23.216
he was really excited by the recent World Wakes quest 

00:03:23.241 --> 00:03:26.497
so anyone who's played the world wakes will have fought 3 of the original 4 god wars bosses. 

00:03:27.552 --> 00:03:30.697
So what we've done is we've brought those mechanics into the group environment, 

00:03:30.722 --> 00:03:33.168
they're much harder much more challenging and hopefully much more fun. 

00:03:33.648 --> 00:03:37.959
The fourth one Commander Zilyana was missing from the quest in a way you never got to fight her head on

00:03:38.247 --> 00:03:43.071
but we have included a hard mode for her which is something I made up and hopefully everyone will enjoy. 

00:03:43.242 --> 00:03:48.710
There's not any new armour or weapons this time round however we have increased the general value of the drop table

00:03:48.735 --> 00:03:51.773
so you should receive more income for your outcome. 

00:03:51.798 --> 00:03:55.781
For each boss in the god wars hard mode encounters we've added a unique stone 

00:03:55.806 --> 00:03:59.173
 it's a quite common drop and every time you have the stone in your inventory 

00:03:59.198 --> 00:04:02.613
when a hard mode boss dies it'll store like a charge 

00:04:02.837 --> 00:04:07.465
so if you kill Commander Zilyana with a Saradomin stone in your inventory it'll add one to it so to speak. 

00:04:07.705 --> 00:04:12.883
What that does is it stores the kill count so you can take that outside of the god wars dungeon and bring it back in as well

00:04:12.908 --> 00:04:18.424
and it removes the need to do that kill count so if I'm with a friend and he's already got the kill count

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:22.169
I can literally get my stone out if I've killed 40 bosses before and run straight through the door 

00:04:22.194 --> 00:04:25.609
and it will take it from the stone instead rather than me having to grind the kills. 

00:04:25.817 --> 00:04:29.113
So the grouping system and the hard mode should make it easier for the players to group up together

00:04:29.138 --> 00:04:32.116
and take on these new challenges and I wish them all the best of luck. 

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:39.537
The audio team are pulling out all the stops to make RuneScape's soundtrack a goose bump inducing orgy of noise. 

00:04:39.761 --> 00:04:46.085
Audio Lead Mod Lord will be here to tell us more with a little help from Bafta Winning composer, James Hannigan.
