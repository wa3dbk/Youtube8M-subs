Hi, I'm Rokosz, Your Digital Lifestyle Expert.
And I'm going to show you or give you some

00:00:05.141 --> 00:00:10.110
ideas. how to recycle or you know, give a
new life to your VHS. If you're like most

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:16.520
of us, you're finally finished off the upgrade.
And completely upgraded away from VHS. I have

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.830
to and I'm in the process of moving it from
one media to a more permanent digital media.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.199
Because VHS will degrade over time. If it's
not kept, even with being kept in climate

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.740
control and what not. Things will adhere,
the tape will get weak. And you will lose

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:36.870
quality over time, for just sitting. So for
archival purposes. I go ahead and, go ahead

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.170
and move it over to a digital. Burn it to
DVD or move it to a full digital format. Now

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:47.360
I've got this large and I mean large collection
of VHS. So I was really waiting to see where

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.361
DVD was going back in the day. And I have
many years collecting VHS tapes. Here are

00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:58.620
some creative ways. If they're actually purchased
movies, try to donate them. There are definitely

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.500
some areas that are still using VHS. Would
find VHS to be a great quality type of thing.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.460
A lot of old people, believe it or not, have
not moved over to DVD. And they can enjoy

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:14.149
the same VHS quality anywhere. So try to sell
them, sell them on eBay. Sell them in a yard

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:18.670
sale. You can donate them. Donate them to
Salvation Army, to your local thrift stores.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.170
You can give them away. Make sure they're
going to a good home. After your personal

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.859
stuff though, you may want to degauss them.
Which is to use a degaussing machine. It's

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:36.210
basically a, basically a large magnet. It
can be purchased at Radio Shack or other electronic

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.649
stores. It will erase the information on the
tape. And the tape stock can be reused again.

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:45.829
If you tape it over and you're still using
VHS. You can re-record on the tapes. And lot

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.990
of the major big box electronic stores have
pretty strong recycling programs. If you bring

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:55.319
to them, they'll make sure they get there.
Or you can contact your local recycler. I

00:01:55.319 --> 00:01:59.300
believe, these might be even a schedule two
type of recyclable plastic. And they'll be

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.189
happy to take them and turn them into milk
jugs or other different plastic things. So

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:07.240
when it come to getting rid of them sure guys
send them off to the landfill. Do something

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.030
good with them. give it away to somebody,
who'll appreciate it. Or just recycle them

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.430
into new things. I recycle myself, I'm Rokosz,
Your Digital Lifestyle Expert. Saying, we'll

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:18.459
see you next time.
