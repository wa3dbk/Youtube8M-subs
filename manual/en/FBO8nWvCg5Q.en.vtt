00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:17.240
Here is the Mohawk River, Lock #8 in upstate
New York, the County of Schenectady, the Town

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:18.390
of Rotterdam.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:27.060
The Mohawk River was named after the Mohawk
Indians, who were the keepers of the eastern

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:35.190
gate of the Iroqouis Confederacy, the first
democracy in America, set up by Hiawatha and

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.190
Degonawida.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:48.589
The Iroqouis Nation was comprised of six indian
tribes: the Mohawks, the Senecas, the Cayugas,

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:56.250
the Oniedas, the Onondagas, and in 1756 the
Tuscaroras.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:04.600
When I look at this river, I think of these
people, the Mohawks, its meaning- man-eater,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:15.520
the war chiefs were known to eat the heart
of an enemy for strength the Algonquin, the

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:20.140
Huron, and then the European invaders.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:27.590
But I also think of their long houses where
the women ruled the roost, a division of labor

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:35.390
where the women were the domestic keepers,
and the men were the hunters and warriors.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:44.460
Then I too see fifty warrior-hunters-bucks
from the banks of this river, spying a group

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.520
of indian maidens taking a swim and bathing.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:59.760
But then this river, as now, was civilised
as part of the great Erie Canal trading barge

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:08.159
system, hooking to the St. Lawrence River
and passage to the Atlantic Ocean.

00:02:08.159 --> 00:02:17.580
Civilised, yes civilised, and much beauty
and love of nature was lost.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:29.709
The river trade has been gone, and we hold
her still, because if we free her again, she

00:02:29.709 --> 00:03:11.590
may wash us away.
