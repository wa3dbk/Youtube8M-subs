Hi guys. Sonja Foust the Pintester here and today we're going to do a hair tutorial, cuz

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:11.470
you know I love those!

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:15.700
You guys asked about my hair from the video a couple of weeks ago, which I'm going to link to

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.080
right here. So today I'm going to show you how I did my hair

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.279
for that video. Be prepared. It's awesome.

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:25.550
So, for this you don't need too many supplies.

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:30.070
You need some kind of rubber band. It can be a big one, or a little one, or any color, cuz

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.530
it's not gonna show. And you either need a few bobby pins

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.329
like maybe 3 or 4 or 5, or some of these little

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.140
clips, and I like these little clips because they stay in better than bobby pins

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.440
and so if you don't mind if they show, then they hold

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.990
a little bit better. So you're going to start by
putting your hair in a ponytail

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:51.710
sort of right on the back of your head.
This actually works a little bit better

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.480
if your hair's

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.940
kinda gross and dirty like my usually is.
Today it's pretty clean so

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.940
we'll see how it goes.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.220
Okay now just hold it right there. Don't put it in the rubber band yet.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.290
It's not time for that yet. So what you're gonna do is you're gonna take this

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.460
and you're gonna hold it as securely as you
can...

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.050
Hold it firmly and don't pull too hard. We're still talking about my ponytail.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.290
Take it and divide it up into three sections, cuz we're gonna braid it.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.930
 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.119
And try not to let go too much.

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:38.969
Just get those three sections and keep
holding on tight.

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:42.549
And then once you have your three
sections out,

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.610
start braiding really, really close to your head

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.189
and get everything really, really tight,
or it's not gonna work

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:57.010
I promise. It has to be super tight.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:59.939
 

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.490
 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:06.570
Now it's time for the rubber band.

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.649
So take that shit and secure your braid.

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:14.330
There. So now you have a ponytail

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.930
with a braid in it like that. And a little lumpy thing right there

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.310
which we will just tuck down... and now

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.820
all you have to do is tuck it under like this.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.230
Make sure the rubber band is underneath

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.500
so nobody will see it, and then hold it down like that.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.950
and pin it where you want it to stay.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:42.659
 

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:48.150
And this usually really only takes me, like, maybe three

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.439
or four bobby pins cuz my hair's pretty thick and will stay where I want it to.

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:55.079
But yeah. That's it.

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.459
That's how you do it. Oh, this one's coming out already.

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:03.230
It's cuz my hair's clean. Dammit. God damn...

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:06.459
look at these bobby pins falling out. Ok these bobby pins are not staying in today

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.099
cuz my hair's clean, guys. Alright, well, that looks a little stupid

00:03:10.099 --> 00:03:13.400
but, you guys get the idea, right?

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.480
I ain't no beauty guru. So, uh, that's how you do it.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.459
You should probably do it better than that.

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:24.319
Alright guys-- I will see you next time. I do a video every week

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:27.670
so come back here next week to find another video from me.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.049

and I am posting a link to a YouTube Christmas Carol

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.489

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:52.220
are just really good. You'll like it, I think, so
