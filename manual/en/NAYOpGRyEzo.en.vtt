Hey guys!

00:00:01.344 --> 00:00:02.510
Thanks so much for watching.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:05.060
Today's video is just
in time for Halloween.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.550
This is a Game of Thrones,
Daenerys inspired hair tutorial.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.090
And this is what you'll need.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:12.650
A couple of alligator clips.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.810
I only needed one for this tutorial, it
just depends on how heavy your hair is.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.594
Also, a few bobby pins.

00:00:18.594 --> 00:00:21.510
And you're going to want to make
sure that they match your hair color.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.010
My hair is dark, so I
picked some dark ones.

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.612
Also, a few elastic hair ties.

00:00:26.612 --> 00:00:28.320
These are going to
help secure the braids

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.970
that we're going to
create in just a moment.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.280
And lastly, some
hairspray with flexible.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.594
I'm using Pantene ProV
Stylers in the number one.

00:00:39.594 --> 00:00:42.260
Now what you're going to do is
take your hair down and make sure

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.840
that you part it down the center.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.730
Then you're going to take a small
section in the front, making

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.480
sure that you keep all
of you hair parted,

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:56.750
and leave room for those little
baby hairs in the front out.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.690
That's how she has it in the show.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.720
So that's what I'm going to keep
true to this hair tutorial as well.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:07.130
Then you're going to make a classic
three-strand braid all the way down

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.272
until the end, and then secure
it with an elastic band.

00:01:10.272 --> 00:01:12.230
And then you're going to
pull it back, and then

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.810
alligator clip it to
the back of your head.

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.320
Then you're going to take another small
section underneath that braid, almost

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.140
like a second tier, and then
do the exact same thing.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.950
You're going to braid it, a
three-strand classic braid.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.660
And then after you're
done with that, you're

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:32.690
going to go ahead and secure
it with an elastic band,

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.190
and then bring it to
the back, alligator clip

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:40.610
it, and go to the other side of your
head and do the exact same thing.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.750
And we'll move on from there.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.070
One of my favorite
things about braids would

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.300
have to be that there's
no heat required.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.156
So the time to style your hair is cut
down, and then also, so is the damage.

00:01:54.156 --> 00:02:01.315
This hairstyle is perfect for Medieval
or Renaissance style costumes.

00:02:01.315 --> 00:02:04.164
Also, of course, every day wear.

00:02:04.164 --> 00:02:06.080
Now, when you're done
with your braids, you're

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.150
going to go ahead and release
them from their elastic bands,

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:14.700
and then create almost like a joining
braid at the center of your head.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:20.420
And make a three-strand braid from
the four braids that we just created.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.870
And go all the way down
the center of your head,

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.850
secure it with an elastic
band, and then you're

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.800
good to go as far as the braids go.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.890
Now, Daenerys has her braids a little
bit higher on her head, especially

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.520
the top ones.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.603
So what I'm going to do
is raise them a little bit

00:02:38.603 --> 00:02:40.334
and then secure them with bobby pins.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.720
And to finish the style, I'm in a
spray on that lightweight hairspray

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.610
and then you're ready to hit the town.

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.590
Thank you guys so much for watching.

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:58.300
