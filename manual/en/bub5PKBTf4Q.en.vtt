00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.570
Isolation is probably everyone's favorite
trick to watch, and I'm going to teach you

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.870
how to do it.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:12.870
Okay.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.980
So you're going to start with the hoop in
front of you, in the vertical plane.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.070
You want the top of the hoop to be slightly
above the top of your head, and the bottom

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.840
of the hoop to be about your belly button
height.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:31.840
If you have a hoop that's much, much larger
than mine, mine is about 32 inches in diameter,

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.180
which is pretty small for waist hooping, but
really great for learning isolations, and

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.589
you might want to try a smaller hoop just
for this trick, to learn it, and then graduate

00:00:41.589 --> 00:00:44.769
to your larger hoop once you get the motion
of it.

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:49.320
So I've got the top of my hoop slightly above
the top of my head, bottom of the hoop bellybutton

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.840
height, and it's centered with my chest.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:01:00.390
So the center of the hoop, notice where the
center of your hoop is, should be right in

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.439
front of your heart, or right below, right
below your chin, depending on your height,

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:15.900
and then just put your hand there to kind
of get an idea of where the center of your

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:16.900
hoop is.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:24.570
From there I would like you to focus on keeping
your shoulder about at that center point.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.980
What I want you to imagine is that your shoulder
is the center point of this wheel, and that

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.700
your arm is the spoke turning the wheel around.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:45.640
Okay, so we'll start here, hoop in this position,
hand at 6:00, the bottom of your hoop, keeping

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:52.560
your shoulder at the center point, begin to
rotate the hoop, or rotate your hand, rather,

00:01:52.560 --> 00:02:00.370
on the inside of the hoop, without allowing
it to drop, keeping that center point nice

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:03.230
and stationary.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:10.979
I have a pretty strong grip on the hoop with
my hand to keep that position.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:16.580
So practicing just the bottom part of this
isolation to start.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:27.430
Then once you feel comfortable with that,
you're going to see where your hand meets,

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:34.670
10:00 and 2:00, 10:00, 2:00.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.830
Obviously your shoulder flexibility has a
lot to do with how high up you can go.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:49.069
When your hand reaches that 10:00 point, you're
leading with my thumb, I'm going to hold the

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.220
hoop here so just to show you this motion,
you're going to release the hoop, allow it

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:02.160
to roll across the back of your hand, and
then grab at 2:00 with the pinky side of your

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.160
hand.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:12.920
Continue the circle down, release at 10:00,
roll across the 12:00, grab at 2:00, and then

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.920
continue the circle.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.709
You can reverse the direction.

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.910
It's really difficult to do this slowly, so
don't be discouraged if this is not working

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:25.349
right away.

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:31.780
Once you start building momentum, it will
be a little bit easier to keep that floaty

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.430
motion.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:40.580
Now if you notice that the hoop is doing this
whenever you're rolling, what's happening

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:46.030
is your hand is now at your center point,
and the hoop is rotating around it, so it's

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:54.160
more and more motivation to really crank your
arm all the way around the edge of your circle.

00:03:54.160 --> 00:04:03.910
Practice both directions, switch hands, like
this both hands, starting with that bottom

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:07.000
part motion.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.380
And that's how you do a basic hula hoop isolation.
