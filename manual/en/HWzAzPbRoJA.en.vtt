Hi, Kim here with ochimp.com and today we
are looking at the Crayola Dry Erase Chisel

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.220
Tip Markers.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:23.320
Now one of things that makes these so cool
is that they were designed by teachers.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.480
So they are great to use not only in the classroom
but with your little ones.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.900
One of the things is that they are AP Certified
nontoxic.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.739
So even if you are around them all day or
your kids are around them all day they are

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:38.490
not gonna cause any illness or harm.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:45.080
They also just for extra safety, have an extended
ventilated tip.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:50.620
Now these are low odour markers so again when
you are working around dry erase boards and

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.220
using dry erase markers all day sometimes
the smell can get a little overwhelming.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:59.820
These are low odour and they write on boards
nice and smooth without any squeaking.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.000
So I would like to show you just how easy
it is.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.860
You can see they have a nice bold colour.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.860
This is red.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.009
They also come in blue or black and you can
get them by the dozen and again just nice

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:21.170
bold colours that also erases cleanly off
so no staining of ghosting.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.490
One other ways that you can use these outside
of the classroom and in your home is to write

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.369
on your freezer bags.

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:34.219
Now you may want to test it at first just
to make sure so you would just write on a

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:38.649
freezer bag, freeze it overnight in the morning
see if you can erase that off.

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:45.209
If you are freezing something like bread or
things like that probably not meat you can

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:52.359
re-use your bag simply wipe off the dry erase
marker, write on again and boom recycling.

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:53.359
We love it.

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:57.869
If you have questions on this or anything
else give our awesome team a call here.

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.900
We know buying office supplies, school supplies
probably isn't the highlight of your day but

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:03.609
we certainly hope the talking to us is.

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:06.880
We will make it fast and easy and a little
bit of chimpy fun.
