00:00:01.619 --> 00:00:02.950
Hi there!

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:07.150
I'm going to demonstrate scan fizz for Salesforce App developed by ApexCloud 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:13.329
and I am the project lead for Mobile Applications at  ApexCloud

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:18.859
This App scans all Linear Barcodes and 2 Dimensional Barcodes

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.509
such as QR Codes and Data Metrix

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.839
for 2 Dimensional Barcodes it scans and decodes

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:31.629
the encryption information and creates 
the Leads Record in Salesforce Instance

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:33.730
let's go to the App on my phone

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.130
here is the icon Scan Fizz

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.990
let's go there

00:00:40.990 --> 00:00:44.560
and this is the authorization page and
now here comes the

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.430
Salesforce login page

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:54.430
we have to type in the user name and password of our Salesforce instance here

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.640
let me quickly login

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.460
and here is the activation required
message that you get

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.820
this is important if you login

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.250
for the first time.. ok

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.410
so let's go ahead and

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:23.800
select " Email me a Verification Code "

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.250
and this Verification Code you will get on
the email address that you have specified

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.440
let me quickly go to my Email address

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.400
uh... i'm sorry to my email

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:41.500
so here is my Email that i just got
and this is the Verification Code

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.030
that i got from Salesforce and i'm going
to type this code on my phone

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.680
so let me punch in

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.670
60315

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.819
its 60315 yes

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:06.819
so let me select "Verify my code and log me in" 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.929
here comes another permission
message

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.769
so you have to select "Allow"

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.269
and here is the authorization message
again

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:19.399
and this is the main screen of our App

00:02:19.399 --> 00:02:23.489
and we have two buttons "Scan" and
"Recent"

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.969
in "Recent" button we have the recently
scanned items stored

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:32.969
and this is the scan button where we can scan the Barcodes

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:36.979
for the demonstration i have

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:38.009
the business card

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:39.439
on which we have

00:02:39.439 --> 00:02:43.499
on which there is a QR Code on it

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:45.939
so I'm going to scan this and show

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:48.289
show you how it works

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:50.779
so I will select "Scan"

00:02:50.779 --> 00:02:53.639
and I will place this 

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:55.669
um...

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:58.529
business card

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:00.209
with in the frame

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.979
and it scans

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:06.549
and here is the scanned information on
my screen

00:03:06.549 --> 00:03:12.799
and again i have another two options "Yes" and "No"

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.679
"Yes" is for creating Lead Record in your Salesforce instance

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:17.930
"No" if the information is irrelevant to
you. 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.189
You can just go ahead and select "NO"

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:21.989
if the information is

00:03:21.989 --> 00:03:24.489
not required. so for

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.509
the demonstration purpose I will create the Lead

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:30.069
I will select "Yes"

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.099
and here are certain Criteria

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:33.199
uh... for which 

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:35.299
uh... it is required

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.089
it is required to create the Lead record
in our Salesforce instance

00:03:39.089 --> 00:03:43.119
name email address mobile number city
and company is required

00:03:43.119 --> 00:03:46.659
to create the

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:47.400
Lead

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.999
So now let me login to Salesforce instance
on my computer

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:55.769
go to your browser and type

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:01.629
login.salesforce.com

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:02.709
and then

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.979
quickly login

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:08.789
here comes the home page and there are several tabs here

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:10.039
and

00:04:10.039 --> 00:04:12.179
there is the "Leads" tab

00:04:12.179 --> 00:04:14.179
I will click on it

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:17.239
and I will go to "Today's Leads"

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.680
where I can find

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.780
 the newly created Leads

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.460
so he really didn't think it needs

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.330
ok so,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:36.330
here I can see the same information that I  just scanned

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:45.129
mobile number, email name and company

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:51.339
Now I will show 

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:54.599
how to log out of this App

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:59.550
for that we have to go the settings 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.639
and flip the log now option

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:04.590
first

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.530
go to the settings again select Scan Fizz

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:10.360
and then flip the log now option

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:11.659
you have

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.610
login host option here,  where in you can login  to production org or the 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:25.559
sandbox respectively depending on your
Salesforce Instance

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:29.410
so i would also like to show how it
works

00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:31.809
how can you scan 

00:05:31.809 --> 00:05:33.649
the barcode

00:05:33.649 --> 00:05:35.479
 Linear Barcodes

00:05:35.479 --> 00:05:42.479
so I will have to login again since i had logged
out

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.659
you don't require the

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:57.049
 verification code again, we 
just have to login, since we had already

00:05:57.049 --> 00:06:00.509
logged in with the same instance. In case if you are logging in with

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:02.580
different instance you would 

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:04.579
require the verification code 

00:06:04.579 --> 00:06:05.630
and to scan the linear barcode,

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.580
 you should always have 

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:12.949
the

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:14.759
mobile held in 

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:16.979
landscape position

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:19.240
for the Linear Barcode

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:23.830
here it scans the information

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:27.830
and most importantly when you're scanning

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.519
the

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:34.169
QR Code you can 

00:06:34.169 --> 00:06:35.539
scan

00:06:35.539 --> 00:06:42.220
either in  portrait position or  landscape
position

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:44.669
up to you

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:45.139
thanks for watching
