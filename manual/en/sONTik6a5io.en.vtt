00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.190
This is the Kelty Grand Mesa Four.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.410
It is a three season tent.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.290
It could be used for back packing.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:08.960
It weighs in at six pounds and 13 ounces.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:14.250
If you were splitting the weight, you know,
the poles, the tent, the fly amongst three

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.320
people or more, you might be able to get down
to a manageable weight, but for the most part

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.150
it is going to be better off used as a camping
style tent.

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.869
The Grand Mesa Four is a three season camping
tent.

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.470
And based on the amount of mesh used in the
canopy here, probably not going to be a good

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.210
option for any sort of real cold weather camping.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.980
It does have a single front door and a full
coverage rain fly with a ves-tibule that is

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:37.980
created on the front.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.320
And you will see that the tent is a simple
two pole de-sign.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.120
It is your classic wedge shape.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.830
And the tent uses DAC aluminum poles so you
have got some lightweight, sturdy structure

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.830
here.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:54.190
The tent body attaches to the pole structure
through a series of clips.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.170
They are easy to work and very secure to the
tent.

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.600
Let me take a look here at the set up.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.000
Here is your grommet point where the pole
is going to connect to the body of the temp.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
These are not color coded and they don't need
not be.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.930
You only have two poles and any pole point
can go in any of the four corners of this

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:12.930
tent.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.360
You can see here the half of the buckle.

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.300
This is where the rain fly clips in.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.040
So it is real easy quick set up with the rain
fly.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.980
And, of course, you have your webbing loop
on then end here and stake to anchor to the

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:24.980
ground.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.190
So the Grand Mesa Four only has one door on
the front here, but it is a very large door.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.150
You can see the design here kind of opens
the entire front of this tent up and there

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.310
is a pocket on the inside here that allows
you to stuff that door into it.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.100
So it is completely out of the way.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.380
It is not laying on the ground where people
are going to trample over it.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:47.770
It gives you this huge opening at the front
of the tent.

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.049
It is going to be very easy to move gear in
and out of the tent or have people moving

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:53.590
in and out if the weather is good.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.490
And you have got this kind of fly off and
the door folded back.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.550
So this really nice, comfortable opening on
the front of the Grand Mesa Four.

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.590
So I am sitting inside the tent and you can
get a pretty good feel for what the space

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.110
is like in here.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:11.530
I know it is a Grand Mesa Four and there is
room to fit four 20 inch wide stand-ard sleeping

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.400
pads side to side in here, but it is a very
tight fit and I think if you were four people

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.139
using this tent you would probably be a little
too tight and I would consider this to be

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:26.520
more for maybe three people or two people
who wanted to bring their gear inside or have

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.970
a pet with them.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.620
There are four pockets inside of this tent.

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.849
There are hanging pockets here on the sides.

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.200
You have two on this side and two on that
side.

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.370
They are quite deep.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.000
You can put a va-riety of stuff in there.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.849
So it gives you a way to kind of clear up
the floor space and get little items into

00:02:40.849 --> 00:02:41.849
storage.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:46.060
This tent does not come with a gear loft,
but there are tabs at the roof here, so you

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.129
can purchase one separately and hang it up
there.

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.930
And there is obviously enough head space here
that you could really load up a gear loft

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.639
and not have it hanging low enough that people
would be bumping their heads on it.

00:02:56.639 --> 00:03:00.150
There is a huge amount of mesh used in the
canopy of this tent and it is going to be

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:04.129
ex-ceptional for any sort of hot or human
camping.

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.060
Great breathability.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.430
Tons of air is going to move through this
tent.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.459
And this is all that, like, no see them netting.

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.569
So it is definitely going to protect you from
bugs.

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.169
And, of course, there is that full coverage
fly you can add on if the weather is going

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:17.169
to get bad.

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:21.909
But the Grand Mesa Four is going to be a great
option for any sort of hot weather camping.

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:24.290
And if you have got a couple of people that
can split up the weight, it is going to be

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.169
a good option for backpacking as well.

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:30.680
Grand Mesa Four comes with a full coverage
rain fly.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.849
The seams are sealed.

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:33.319
It is water-proof and ready to go.

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:36.450
And you can see here there is a small vestibule
created on the front.

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.099
This is mostly offering protection over the
door in the front of the tent.

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:44.449
You could stow some small items underneath
there, but it doesn't allow for a large amount

00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:45.620
of stuff to be stowed there.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.749
It does offer protection across the front
of the tent.

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:52.090
So let's take a look at the connection point
of the tent and the poles.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.980
You can see here as your pole comes down it
fits into a grommet.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.290
You have got your webbing piece here.

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.709
The half of the {?} you see here is where
the fly locks in and you have an adjustment

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:03.709
point there.

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:07.519
And, of course, you have your webbing loop
that the stake goes through to anchor the

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:10.040
entire thing to the ground.

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.930
So take a closer look at the point at the
edge of the tent body where the poles connect.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.090
You can see here there is a grommet and the
pole fits into that easily.

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.829
These webbing pieces are color coded.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.520
There are two silver and two orange and they
do match up with t corners of the fly so you

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:29.090
can see silver webbing matches with silver
webbing.

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.800
That way you know which corner of the fly
goes where.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.389
And the buckle system you see here is how
you connect the fly to the tent.

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.750
It is a quick, fast tax buckle.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.020
And then you have an ad-justment point there.

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.870
So you can pull tension on the fly.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.379
And, of course, you have a web-bing loop here
at the end that you can anchor the stake through

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:47.159
to anchor the whole things securely to the
ground.
