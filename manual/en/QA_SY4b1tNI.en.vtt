00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:16.520
Perched on the East Coast of Australia, few
cities are as geographically spectacular as

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.490
Sydney, the capital of the state of New South
Wales, and home to over four and a half million people.

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:33.490
Surrounded by the rolling Pacific
Ocean, two dramatic headlands stand as a timeless

00:00:33.769 --> 00:00:40.170
gateway to one of the worlds most beautiful
harbors. Blessed with over 100 beaches, bathed

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.460
in year-round sunshine, and buzzing with a
youthful vitality, when it comes to the good

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.970
life, Sydney is hard to top.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:55.629
Sydney's heart is the harbor. What began
as a penal colony in 1788, would within a

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.640
century be transformed into paradise. From
its rough and tumble beginnings in an area

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:07.250
known as The Rocks, Sydney soon threw off
its convict shackles and blossomed into a

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.810
gracious city, filled with Victorian Architecture
and public gardens. New arrivals came by the

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.810
boatload in search of a new life. The city
expanded, into gorgeous inner city suburbs

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.670
like Paddington, harbor neighborhoods like
Rose Bay, and into beachside communities up

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:31.619
and down the coast.

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:38.619
For first-timers, Sydney can feel like a maze
of beaches, headlands, bays and coves. 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.960
The quickest way to find your bearings is to take
the trip to the top of the Sydney Tower. From

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:50.960
over 800 feet up, the observation deck offers
360 degree views of the entire city.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.990
Once you've come to grips with the layout
of the city, head to Circular Quay, Sydney's

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:06.939
version of Grand Central Station. From Circular
Quay you can get just about anywhere by ferry,

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:13.939
water taxi or train. Just to the right, like
white sails billowing in the breeze is the

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:20.140
Sydney Opera House. You don't need a ticket
or tuxedo to explore this incredible performance

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:27.140
venue. Whichever way you look, inside or outside,
up or down, the Opera House is nothing less

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.420
than an architectural miracle.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.890
Just behind the Opera House, on the site of
Sydney's first farm are the Royal Botanic

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.360
Gardens and the Sydney Domain. Here you'll
find Government House, the Art Gallery of

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:49.060
New South Wales and some of the leafiest views
in Sydney.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:55.180
To the left of Circular Quay stands the famous
"Coat-hanger", the Sydney Harbour Bridge.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:00.340
One of Sydney's famous sons, Paul Hogan, the
star Crocodile Dundee, was a painter on the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.980
bridge before he hit the big time. But you
don't need to work on the bridge to enjoy

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:11.980
the views from the top, simply strap on a
safety harness and join a Bridge Climb Tour.

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.590
Just across the bridge at Luna Park, you'll
find Sydney's most famous smile. The rides

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.670
are a little on the vintage side, but the
locals wouldn't have it any other way. This

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:30.670
heritage-listed fun park has been thrilling
Aussie families since 1935.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:36.600
Just a short ferry ride from Luna Park is
Darling Harbour, one of Sydney's urban renewal

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:42.230
triumphs. Once the site of rusting railway
yards, Darling Harbour is now home to the

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:49.230
National Maritime Museum, and popular parks,
bars and restaurants. Only a few blocks away

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:56.690
you'll find the Powerhouse Museum, a celebration
of steam, space, and science.

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:03.370
A short walk across the Pyrmont Bridge is
the Sydney Sea Life Aquarium where you'll

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:08.870
experience many of Australia's maritime environments,
from the Great Barrier Reef, to the rugged

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.870
South Coast. Australia has a reputation as
a land of creatures that bite, sting, and

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:23.400
can even rip off your whole arm. At the Wild
Life Sydney nature park, say g'day to some

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.400
of the world's deadliest creatures, as well
as some of Australia's most cuddly.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:43.389
But for the zoo with the view, hop back on
the ferry and cruise over to Taronga Zoo.

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:47.939
Ride the cable car to the top of the hill
and follow the paths back down, past some

00:04:47.939 --> 00:04:53.090
of the happiest and most relaxed looking creatures
you'll ever see. And who wouldn't be,

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.139
with views like this!

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:03.960
When it's time to cool off, grab your towel
and head to Bondi Beach. You haven't experienced

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:09.990
Sydney until you've felt Bondi's golden
sand between your toes. The beach is patrolled

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:16.990
year round by bronzed Aussie lifesavers, but
always remember to swim between the flags!

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:25.460
Another famous seaside suburb not to be missed
is Manly. The 30-minute ferry ride from Circular

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:31.669
Quay to Manly Wharf is all part of the adventure.
Go for a dip in the gentle harbor-side waters

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:38.270
of Manly Cove, or head through the historic
Corso to Manly Beach. If you've never tried

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:44.490
surfing, pack your board-shorts, this is the
place to learn. Feeling energetic? Hike the

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:50.870
coastal paths and bush tracks to North Head
for some incredible views back to the city.

00:05:53.870 --> 00:06:00.870
So, you've climbed the bridge, tackled some
Bondi waves, and wrangled the wildlife, no

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:07.029
doubt your feeling a little a thirsty. Time
to partake in one of the great Sydney traditions.

00:06:07.029 --> 00:06:13.919
Join the locals by the water, raise your ice
cold beer, and make a toast ~ to paradise.
