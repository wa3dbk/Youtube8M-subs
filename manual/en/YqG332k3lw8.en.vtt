00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.830
We have all had that experience of putting
on a backpack, only to have to take it off

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.600
on and off again to get it to fit exactly
the way we want to, making fine tune adjustments.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.070
Kelty has addressed that issue head on with
its perfect fit suspension system, which allows

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.130
you to make adjustments while you are wearing
the pack.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.890
It is on their larger trail series packs and
it enables back packers of various shapes

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.660
and sizes to get the fit they want and get
it on the go.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.790
I am going to give you a quick demonstration
of the three simple steps to achieving your

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.180
own perfect fit.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:43.950
Begin by making sure that all the straps are
loosened prior to putting on the pack.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:58.860
This includes loosening the waist belt, the
shoulder straps, the load lifter straps and

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.750
the fit straps located just above the lumbar
padding.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.520
Make certain that the back panel is at its
highest position.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:23.780
The second step is to put on the pack and
begin by situating the waist belt so that

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.689
it rests on your hips, over your hips.

00:01:29.689 --> 00:01:38.979
And then pull down on the shoulder straps.

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.049
Close the sternum strap.

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:51.329
And the final step is to pull down on the
fixed straps, sliding that lumbar padding

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.779
into the ideal position for your perfect fit.
