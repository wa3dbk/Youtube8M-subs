00:00:10.524 --> 00:00:14.112
Hello and welcome to the fall edition of the MiWuLa-News.

00:00:14.521 --> 00:00:19.136
Railway technicians have commenced operation around the airport.

00:00:19.226 --> 00:00:21.712
Tests are done almost daily

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.605
and the shadow stations are provided with new trains.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.430
Hours-long tests prove that operation proceeds without major complications.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.628
Over 700 meters of tracks were laid here during the past few months.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:37.571
Up to 40 trains will make their rounds when the airport opens.

00:00:37.711 --> 00:00:40.295
Because construction is still taking place,

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:43.918
there is dirt on the tracks that impedes the operation of the trains.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.130
Thankfully we have Wolfgang, who also takes care of these little things.

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:53.538
Further details are being completed around the tracks and stations,

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.841
such as this small railroad construction site.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:01.304
The lighting for the buildings, stations, streets and railways is also proceeding.

00:01:01.608 --> 00:01:04.072
At the same time, Flo is implementing the signals.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.326
Beneath the tables, amidst a maze of cables, lie Kenny and Matthias,

00:01:07.472 --> 00:01:12.008
responsible for the wiring of the lighting, so it may be programmed later.

00:01:16.257 --> 00:01:22.303
Stefan has developed an interesting new push-button action for the airport:

00:01:22.673 --> 00:01:25.337
Heinkel's research and development hangar.

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.186
In this complex, every visitor may test the resilience of an airplane's wing.

00:01:31.244 --> 00:01:36.669
There'll be further details and custom-made items besides the resilience simulator.

00:01:37.076 --> 00:01:42.172
This another part of the Heinkel hangar: My little testing booth.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.565
There'll be a regular propeller inside a wind tunnel

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.911
and from below it will perform actual flight movements.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.124
Perhaps some day this futuristic vehicle or

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.514
this solar-driven plane will be part of our everyday life.

00:02:04.725 --> 00:02:08.383
The electronics technicians are currently lighting the aiport's last few vehicles.

00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:12.300
Many will be able to drive but some will have fixed places.

00:02:12.554 --> 00:02:14.758
The airplane construction is in its last phase.

00:02:15.004 --> 00:02:18.342
Klaas is testing the weight distribution of the Lockheed Super Constellation.

00:02:18.465 --> 00:02:22.340
It still needs a lot of weight in the front to have enough contact pressure.

00:02:22.607 --> 00:02:24.808
It's too tail-heavy at the moment.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.103
Many new small models are being created that will be placed on the apron.

00:02:30.262 --> 00:02:33.407
This JU52 is one of those special airplanes.

00:02:33.924 --> 00:02:36.717
Some may recognize the pilot.

00:02:38.603 --> 00:02:43.500
Other stationary models are this Lufthansa JU F13 with its own lighting,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:45.764
the small Spirit of St. Louis

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.742
or the Nord Noratlas, built by Jens.

00:02:51.876 --> 00:02:55.741
An important detail has been added: The passenger stairs.

00:02:56.091 --> 00:02:59.537
Klaas has installed 15 of these small stairways,

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:03.823
that will drive up to the planes and adjust to their height.

00:03:04.158 --> 00:03:06.355
Another highlight are the passenger boarding bridges

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:12.245
which are almost fully positioned around the airport and are ready for action.

00:03:14.595 --> 00:03:17.039
The further the airport progresses,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.162
the more detail work is required by the modelmakers.

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:25.545
Judith is recreating elements of various venues of the Hamburg Airport.

00:03:26.101 --> 00:03:29.303
Custom made items ensure the likeness to the original.

00:03:29.732 --> 00:03:32.236
She is mindful of every little detail,

00:03:32.518 --> 00:03:35.150
such as the flower shop of the terminal.

00:03:37.334 --> 00:03:41.166
Elke has been working for weeks on the fence for the airport's boundaries.

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:44.620
It's a demanding job because everthing is hand-made.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:47.693
After the paintjob, the fences are mounted in various ways.

00:03:47.898 --> 00:03:52.789
For example, magnets enable a quick removal in case of an emergency.

00:03:54.131 --> 00:03:57.861
Many small and large buildings are already part of the layout.

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:02.691
Minor works are being done now, such as the ageing of the tower.

00:04:02.904 --> 00:04:06.305
Another highlight is the veterinary station near the terminal.

00:04:06.856 --> 00:04:09.775
An enormous amount of animals await their departure.

00:04:09.925 --> 00:04:16.550
Many remarkable animals are present and some had to be painted carefully.

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.941
Elaborately crafted railings at the terminal's access ramp,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.900
the glowing signposts inside the parking structures or for

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.675
the traffic routing are some of the distinctive features of the airport apron.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.156
The waving flags of the airlines will also be part of the scenery.

00:04:31.418 --> 00:04:36.163
Lastly, we have exclusive footage of the Wunderland's first vacuuming dog.

00:04:36.581 --> 00:04:40.959
And that's it for this episode. Have a nice day.

00:04:41.188 --> 00:04:42.680
Come visit us again soon.
