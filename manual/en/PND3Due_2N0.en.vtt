00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
You have freed us from Nisachaar’s ancient curse at last.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
We cannot thank you enough.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
No problem, chief. We knew Nisachaar was up to no good. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And once we saw that sword we knew it had to be evil.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Indeed. He destroyed our home and trapped our 
 souls in this sword for eons. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
We finally killed him but he cursed us to become demons.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We kept the sword hidden from his spirit ever since but now…

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
you have freed us forever…

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
And in thanks I present this sword for you to kee—Ah… nevermind.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Come with us, we’re the sons of King Pandu, 
 your people deserve to live at the court.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000
I am sorry, we can’t

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
We have lived in the forest too long and cannot face this new world.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I beg of you to tell no one about us 
 and let us live here in peace and hiding.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Agreed, chief. See ya later!

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And that is how I met the two bravest warriors I’ve ever known. 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
But their legend only begins here.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
How was I to know it wasn’t a treasure?!

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
IT WAS MASTER DRONA’S OLD LAUNDRY!!

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Calm down, brother Bhima.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
So what’d you guys do today?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Save the world.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.000
I know my two young friends kept their word and 
 didn’t tell anyone the truth of their secret adventure.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
They were content to stand in the shadows and be forgotten,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
for what superwarrior needs glories of their deeds to be sung?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.000
The bravest of the brave, stand distinguished in history 
 on the pillars of their own deeds.
