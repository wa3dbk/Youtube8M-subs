Hey, have a look at this. This just came in, a brand new All-In-One PC,

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.750
from the folks at Averatec, and this is... This is interesting because it's incredibly

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:23.560
low cost. This is an 18.4 inch screen on this  thing, shares a lot of similarities with a lot

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.830
of the Netbooks you see out there. Very similar  specs, aside from the screen size and the fact

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.870
that it's not a little Netbook computer. In fact this thing comes in at you know, at less than 500$

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.610
and it's extraordinary. It's got an Atom 1.6 Gigahertz processor, it's got 1 GB of DDR2 RAM,

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:49.170
a 160 GB hard drive, it's got an 18.4 inch screen,  it has a DVD, Dual Layer,

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.290
DVD-RW drive inside of it. Comes with Windows XP preloaded, has...

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.160
In fact let me just show you all around this thing 'cause it's a really slick design.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.670
I mean, this is very nice. The screen is fully adjustable, you could move it into any position

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.710
you'd like it to be in, to be able to see it from whatever angle, I mean look at that. 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.700
It even folds down this way so you can look  at it straight down, if you'd like.

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:20.940
It's a very very flexible design. It does come with a wired keyboard and a wired mouse

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.960
although I'll tell you what: This thing is really dying for a wireless keyboard

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.160
and mouse which you can throw in there, no problem obviously.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:34.190
Let me show you around. Take a look at this, on the front you're going to see just a few 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:40.130
buttons here along the front. These are for  controlling your screen brightness, your volume,

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.570
your mute, and you can actually quickly turn the LCD on and off. As you can see when I push that 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:48.610
button, it turns off the LCD, but doesn't turn off the computer which is,

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.450
 which is going to save you a lot of electricity, but also keep the computer ready to go,

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.990
whenever you walk up to it, which is a really slick of the design. It also has

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.150
the power button over here. Over on the side, you're going to find a couple of USB ports,

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:07.600
as well as a 4 in 1 Memory Card Reader right here. That 4 in 1 Memory Card is going to do SD,

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.800
it's going to XD, it's going to Memory Stick, all right there.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.140
Over here, you're going to find a VGA port, in case you want to hook up another monitor 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.800
to it you do have that ability with this machine. Around the back, you're going to find your

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.390
Power port, your Ethernet, right here, and a few more USB ports for plugging in 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.990
all of your peripherals and over on this side is where you're going to find that

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:39.800
 Dual Layer DVD-RW drive, located right there. So, it's all in a very small, very compact,

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:45.200
very clean design from the folks at Averatec. I mean this is an impressive looking

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.160
little computer, and what's most impressive about it, is the price. Of course it's not going to do,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:57.750
you know any of your 3D gaming and all that stuff, you know this is... Think of this as a Netbook

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.150
but with a really big screen that you keep in your house. It's a perfect kitchen computer,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.320
perfect computer to throw on a coffee table  somewhere, and at the price that it comes in at,

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.690
it's actually pretty realistic to think about  putting this computer anywhere,

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.230
that you think it might be nice to have a screen with access to TV listings, or recipes,

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:20.240
webpages or whatever it is you want to get to, this is a really good choice.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.600
As I said, it does also have a web camera, built in right there. There's a webcam 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:28.550
integrated into the bezel, so you're going to be able to do all of your video chatting

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.780
and all that stuff with this machine as well,  but all in all it's an impressive design,

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:40.260
it's a great value, it's really inexpensive  compared to a lot of the All-In-One PCs out there,

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:46.490
it's got a nice big 18.4 inch screen, which is  something that's actually rather impressive. 

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.630
The screen quality is very very nice, it looks  really good. This is a really cool computer. 

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.570
Brand new, these just came out, and they are available now... And you know, if you're in

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:00.370
the market for something like this, that might just go anywhere, I'd encourage you to get one 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.380
because, they're really nice. The Averatec  All-In-One, Atom 1.6 GHz PC,

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:07.780
go have a look at this one. 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.140

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:17.930

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:19.830
