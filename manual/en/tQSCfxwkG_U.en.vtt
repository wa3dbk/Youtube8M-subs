00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:22.240
 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.750
It's so easy to get
caught in our heads.

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.600
And one of the most important
things that we can learn

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.420
is how very quickly
to center ourselves.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.220
So here's one way
that you can practice.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.080
The nature of consciousness
in the present moment

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:40.960
is very different than
what we learn in school.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.010
In school, we focus,
and we narrow.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.310
But consciousness in
the present moment,

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:47.750
when you're in deep meditation,
when you're surfing,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.140
when you're skiing, is
an extraordinary sense

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.180
of the vividness of all your
perceptions and expansiveness.

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:59.700
So all you have to
do is shift from time

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.460
to time to your breathing.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.900
Focus, for example, on
the sensation of the air

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.360
moving through your nostrils.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.100
It's a very easy
sensation to find.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.270
You can have your eyes open.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.770
You can have your eyes closed.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.666
Bring that sensation
into real vividness.

00:01:20.666 --> 00:01:22.290
If you have to close
your eyes in order

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.640
to concentrate on it
for a moment or two

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:27.350
for a few breaths,
close your eyes.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.120
But in daily life, we want
to be able to be centered in

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.480
and have our eyes open.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.500
So with your eyes open,
sensing the breath

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.020
moving through your nose,
aware of the light around you,

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.910
the sounds around you, all
your perceptions vivid,

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.650
simultaneously imagine that your
mind is limitless like space.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.300
In fact, the notion
of the universe

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.870
conveys a sense of
spatial vastness.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.040
But the mind itself
is the vastness

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.990
in which the concept of
the universe is present.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.760
So let yourself get spacious.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.330
Feel your body and yet keep
the sensation of your breath

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.896
truly vivid, very precise.

00:02:13.896 --> 00:02:16.790
Become aware of the
space around you.

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:20.240
Realize it's now everywhere
in the universe right

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:21.180
in this moment.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:26.720
It's always now, the mind,
in that sense, limitless.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:32.966
And there's the very vivid
perception of your breath,

00:02:32.966 --> 00:02:36.080
of the light, the
colors, the sounds,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:37.810
sensations in your body.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.010
And now, five breaths.

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:59.280
 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.410
Focused and spacious.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:04.830
Precise awareness
of your whole body,

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:09.855
of your breathing and the sense
that mind in the largest sense

00:03:09.855 --> 00:03:12.220
is limitless.

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:15.260
So if it were a scientist, you'd
focus on what you're studying.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.680
But you wouldn't lose the
sense of a holistic system,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.920
everything connected to
everything else perspective,

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.110
which is what is lost.

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.070
So just become aware
of five breaths.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.040
Any time you find
yourself agitated,

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.910
hurrying, starting to get
caught in the motions,

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.290
come back to the present moment.

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:41.620
Five focused breaths
with a spacious mind,

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.235
precise awareness
of your breathing,

00:03:44.235 --> 00:03:49.530
your senses all attuned
to anything and everything

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.250
and the sense-- wow.

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:56.260
The mind extends limitlessly.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:57.100
Five more breaths.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:16.033
 

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:18.574
Most people aren't going to stop
to meditate for half an hour

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:21.920
or 20 minutes or 40 minutes
or an hour in the morning.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:25.100
But if you do this
practice, 5 breaths,

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.620
allowing yourself to
become so precisely

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:33.485
focused and vast open at the
same time, that will cause

00:04:33.485 --> 00:04:36.400
your arousal level, the
stimulation of your thoughts,

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.789
the emotions they generate will
come down just a little bit.

00:04:39.789 --> 00:04:41.830
And if 20 minutes later
you do five more breaths,

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:43.810
it'll come down
again a little bit.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.650
And if through the day five
breaths takes what, 20 seconds?

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.190
So through the day if
you did this 20 times,

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:56.700
you would be spending five,
six, seven minutes at most.

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.460
And it will really
help you center.

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.210
So take hold of this
practice and make it yours.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:15.488
