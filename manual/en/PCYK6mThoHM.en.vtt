Peter Aerts

00:00:14.495 --> 00:00:18.676
Q: Tell us about the fight.

00:00:19.307 --> 00:00:26.752
A: It was a good fight. The first round was equal, but I downed him in the second.

00:00:26.752 --> 00:00:35.589
Actually, I wanted to finish him there.

00:01:14.355 --> 00:01:35.476
Q: Saki said his speed and technique were better than yours.

00:01:35.476 --> 00:01:48.676
A: Saki complained about the weight difference, but I'm only three kilograms heavier.

00:01:48.676 --> 00:02:04.750
Yes, he is faster, but I won with experience. I was able to choose the best way to win. 

00:02:54.316 --> 00:03:02.279
Q: How do you feel about not making it into the tournament.

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:14.204
A: This is the first time in my career that I didn't make it, so I'm not happy.

00:03:14.204 --> 00:03:16.127
But what's finished is finished.

00:03:16.127 --> 00:03:19.549
Next year I'll make it into the tournament. It will be a new start.

00:03:51.271 --> 00:04:17.877
Q: What do you think about Japan and The Netherlands being in the same block for the World Cup?

00:04:19.368 --> 00:04:40.251
Japan has improved, so they might do well. They might surprise us this year.
