00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.520
Hello there! Welcome to our smanos video
channel.

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.950
In this video we will show you the S105
Plug &amp; Play alarm system.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.410
It is very easy to use and can be set
up within a minute.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.380
It works on a frequency specially made
for security at 868 Mhz

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.420
 and is expendable up to 40 sensors.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.120
Then let's have a look what's inside the smanos S105 on-site alarm system kit.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.700
The kit contains the mini-strobe siren which is the SS1005

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.200
a PIR motion detector with
its bracket and a screw set

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.160
a door/window contact, two remote controls

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.740
double sided tape, its documentation and
warning decals.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.300
Then how does the alarm system work. 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.760
The basic operation of this system is very easy.

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.499
When a sensor has been triggered it
will send a signal to the control panel.

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:56.800
The control panel will sound the built-in
siren immediately.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:02.380
All products in this kit can be used as accessorie for different smanos control panels.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:06.940
To install the system you only have to
plug in the siren into the power socket.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.840
In order to check if the pre-paired accessories are correctly paired

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.500
press the button on the siren for about half a second the siren will beep once

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.409
and goes into pairing mode. When a sensor is triggered and sends a signal

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.449
the siren will receive the signal and
connect.

00:01:22.449 --> 00:01:24.700
When one beep is heard, it's a new connection.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.710
If two beeps are heard it has already been
connected before.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:31.550
Let's have a look at the door/window  contact.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:36.840
First pull the strap out of the sensor. Keep the triangles of the door/window contact pointed to each other.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.380
Now we separate the magnet from its sensor and the LED indicator on the sensor will be seen.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.520
Which means it has been triggered.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.100
Installation can be done at the side of a door or window opening.

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:52.340
Place the sensor on the side. Place the
magnet on the door or window itself.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:56.960
Make sure the triangles face each other
and keep the distance within one centimeter.

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:00.350
Then next the PIR motion detector.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.410
Again, pull the strap out of the motion detector.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.600
It will start testing for about 30 seconds.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.780
When the detector sees movement twice
within three minutes

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.320
the detector goes into power saving mode.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.340
This means it will not be triggered and will not send a signal to the control panel.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:21.980
Click twice on the button at the back side of the motion detector in order to send a signal to pair the device.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.300
Installation height is best at 2.2 meters. 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.720
This will give a range of about 8 meters and 110 degrees wide. 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.740
Every product in this kit can be used as an accessorie for each smanos panel.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:39.420
The PIR motion detector and magnet contact can be installed with the normal pairing mode

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:45.480
To install the SS1005 siren on the smanos control panel, the siren needs to be in pairing mode.

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.280
This means pressing the button on the
siren for about half a second until one beep is heard.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.400
Then press the arm button on the smanos control panel.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.020
The siren will beep once indicating it's connected.

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.520
And that's the end on this product video. I hope you enjoyed it
