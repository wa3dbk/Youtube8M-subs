00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:06.950
• From raw dough containing killer ingredients
to cooked fish that'll turn you into a gibbering

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.400
idiot, we count 15 quite harmful foods you're
gonna find all over your house and kitchen

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.410
15 - Microwave Popcorn,
• This only applies to the kind that comes

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.869
pre-packaged and thrown into the microwave
to let pop into an inflated state

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.019
• Research shows the chemical used in certain
types of these popcorn bags is linked to an

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:31.179
increased risk of cancer, infertility and
disease in lab animals

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:36.100
• It's highly recommended you instead make
your own bag of popcorn - it's relatively

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.920
easy, only takes around 5 minutes and won't
kill you, unless you happen to choke to death

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.220
on a popcorn
• That would be a shame

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.359
14 - Potatoes,
• These things contain a natural toxin called

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.449
Glycoalkaloids found in the leaves, sprouts
and stems - and if allowed to build up over

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:58.239
time, is potentially fatal
• If you eat just 2 milligrams per kilo

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.079
of your body weight in this stuff, you'll
get cramps, diarrhea and headaches

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:07.420
• Eat between 3 and 6 milligrams and prepare
for coma or death

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.310
• Avoid potatoes with a greenish tinge wherever
possible

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.150
13 - Apples,
• There's the old saying, "an apple a day

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.750
helps keep the doctor away", but there's an
even older saying, "don't eat things that

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:25.320
contain pesticide"
• Most mainstream apples are loaded with

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.890
pesticide unless you buy organically-grown
apples, and the apple seed themselves contain

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.840
a compound which breaks down into cyanide
• Of course, you'd need to eat dozens of

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.789
apples, chew and digest all the seeds all
in one afternoon before it does you any harm

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.200
• So unless you, the viewer, are in fact,
a horse - you should be safe

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.130
12 - Coffee,
• There's a variety of problems associated

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.880
with coffee, including the story of the old
woman from McDonalds who spilled her coffee

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.999
and suffered third-degree burns over 6% of
her body

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:01.509
• If you have a heart rate problem or trouble
sleeping, coffee certainly won't help, and

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:04.249
not to mention it'll stain your teeth just
like smoking

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:09.490
• And if you mistake your tea-bag for a
bag of rat poison, that'll just ruin your

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.600
day
11 - Eggs,

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.160
• There's a reason people tend not to promote
raw eggs in your traditional breakfast line-up,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.370
and that's because of a typical problem we
refer to as salmonella

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.690
• Most raw eggs contain this, but the more
you find in the egg, the higher your chance

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.920
to get sick
• It's recommended to put your eggs inside

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.420
the fridge the moment you get home from buying
groceries, and also make sure to cook the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.270
egg until the yolk looks firm - unless you
just want some time off work

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.540
10 - Raw Cookie Dough,
• You thought you could escape egg poison

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:43.620
by baking up some cookies?

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.590
Well tough shit - raw cookie dough contains
uncooked eggs and therefore the risk of salmonella

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:55.400
contamination; in fact, you likely used more
than one egg so that dough will be laced with

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.500
it
• Furthermore, harmful bacteria make their

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.050
way into the uncooked dough be it from dirty
bowls, unwashed hands, cutting board contamination

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.280
or a combination of the above
• If someone offers you a taste of some

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.890
raw cookie dough, give them an unpleasant
bonk on the nose

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.230
9 - Processed Meat,
• The American Institute for Cancer Research

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:23.250
will tell you right off the bat that processed
meat will riddle you with health problems

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.890
• The preservatives used to help this meat
sustain its longevity is linked to cancer,

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:34.050
with higher rates of cardiovascular disease
from subjects that consistently eat processed

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.650
food
• They recommend if you can't live without

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:40.319
hot dogs, chicken nuggets or the like to simply
make your own

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:45.910
• Or you can ignore what they say and not
change your diet even slightly

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:49.450
8 - Hot Dogs,
• You might think, well, it's likely the

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.140
processed meat and pure unhealthiness that
makes them a dangerous food - but no

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:58.990
• A hot dog is perfectly shaped to slide
down your breathing hole and choke you to

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:03.530
death, which occurs more often than you think,
especially in children 10 or younger

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:10.710
• In fact, some health companies even suggest
redesigning the hot dog to be less of a choke-hazard

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:17.070
• It's clearly evident here, with this trampoline
example that will allow the hot dog to bounce

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:23.180
right back out of your oxygen tube
7 - Leafy Greens,

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.991
• You've always been taught that green food
is generally healthy, but in this case, there's

00:04:27.991 --> 00:04:32.199
a risk it'll get you violently sick
• Before you eat any of these leafy greens,

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:37.490
be sure to wash and dry them with paper towels,
UNLESS the package claims to be pre-washed

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.940
or ready-to-eat, then it should be safe
• If you wash an already-washed green, you

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.470
risk spraying it with the grime and feces
on your kitchen counter

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:51.280
6 - Jalapenos,
• This only happens to a select minority

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:56.379
of people, but the oils may actually irritate
your skin and cause it to swell up

00:04:56.379 --> 00:05:00.889
• In this case it's recommended to wear
gloves while handling them, or at least use

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:05.119
long tongs and a knife that can extend several
metres

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:09.810
• Or just not use it and deal with having
a non-spicy salsa

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.080
5 - Tuna,
• Nobody talks about this, but eating tuna

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.499
on a regular basis can actually be bad for
you because of all the mercury that fish happened

00:05:19.499 --> 00:05:22.870
to absorb
• If you've consumed large quantities of

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:29.349
this on a regular basis, it'll slowly travel
into your brain and clog up all the pathways

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:35.229
- it'll drive you insane and make you blubber
because your brain is now a pile of melted

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:38.629
goo
• It is possible tuna was designed to transform

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:44.219
you into a brainless fish-person, but this
is pure unsubstantiated madness that has nothing

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:47.379
to do with a conspiracy involving the government
and marine life

00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:52.289
4 - Rice,
• These contain a chemical known as arsenic,

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:56.869
sucked up by rice roots from wet paddies,
and it encompasses two types of arsenic

00:05:56.869 --> 00:06:02.729
• The organic kind found in earth, generally
safe, and the inorganic type left over from

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:09.009
pesticides and fertilisers which increase
the risk of type 2 diabetes, bladder cancer,

00:06:09.009 --> 00:06:14.069
skin, lung and cardiovascular disease
• It's recommended to not only eat rice

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:19.370
as your only grain, but vary it up with others
- and also try not to live in Asia

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:24.879
3 - Blender,
• So you're eating a blender, and your tongue

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:30.000
catches on the sharp twirly bit
• I'm not entirely sure how you made it

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.009
this far in life
2 - Supermarket Cashews,

00:06:34.009 --> 00:06:38.509
• If the package says "raw cashews", don't
believe it - all it means is they've been

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:42.830
steamed to remove a chemical commonly found
in poison ivy

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:47.669
• If the steam missed any of this chemical,
all you need is a sufficiently high dose on

00:06:47.669 --> 00:06:52.020
a bad day and you'll be walking down shit
creek without a stomach pump

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:58.400
• Even worse is, if you're allergic to poison
ivy, you won't get any warning - these cashews

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.360
will kill you immediately - and that's not
so fun

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.020
1 - Raw Meat
• If you've ever taken a Food Handling class

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.509
like me then you'll already know that raw
meat is perhaps the deadliest food you can

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:13.870
own
• There are four steps you should always

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:18.939
be aware of when preparing raw meat - first,
wash your hands and wash the surfaces you

00:07:18.939 --> 00:07:24.120
plan to use - second, separate these meats
from other food because otherwise salmonella

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:27.509
and E. Coli will spread around your kitchen
like wildfire

00:07:27.509 --> 00:07:33.389
• Three, cook at the right temperatures,
high enough to kill all bacteria in the meat,

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:38.069
but not so high that it burns the food
• Fourth, refrigerate the meat if you're

00:07:38.069 --> 00:07:41.569
not using it - it'll slow the growth of bacteria
dramatically

00:07:41.569 --> 00:07:48.139
• And lastly, rub the chicken carcass all
over your face and sneeze into it for good

00:07:48.139 --> 00:07:48.759
luck
