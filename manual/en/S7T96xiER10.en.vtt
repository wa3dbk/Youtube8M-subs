for two thousand

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.900

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:30.320
a few scratches on it nothing that would
keep anybody from buying it but if you

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.580
want to make you aware of that

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:38.140

seventh-day cubic foot refrigerator

00:02:21.469 --> 00:02:25.139
you go in the back in this is where i
think it's got a very nice of helped

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.579

yet but so what grade that is not the
original flooring but actually it looks

00:02:55.159 --> 00:03:00.219
really good

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:02.140
factually creativity reach that goal

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.790
people maintaining equipment wood
flooring india carpet that's hard of

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.950
ownership and that's what you want to
look for when you look for a camper

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:10.730
