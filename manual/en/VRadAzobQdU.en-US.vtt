00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:10.673
(movie reel rolls)

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:14.661
(HT Guy) From the studio who's 
casually redefined the word "trilogy"

00:00:14.661 --> 00:00:18.107
comes the Hunger Games like 
you've never seen them before.

00:00:19.257 --> 00:00:20.539
Hunger Game-less.

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:24.713
The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1.

00:00:25.473 --> 00:00:27.784
If you thought half a short book 
wouldn't have enough plot

00:00:27.784 --> 00:00:31.850
to carry a two hour movie, you were right!

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.176
Prepare for a slow buildup 
to a climax that won't come

00:00:35.176 --> 00:00:38.328
until you pay for the next one, 
kind of like the last one.

00:00:38.448 --> 00:00:40.963
Full of obvious time filler, like:

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.309
Repetition...

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:43.606
President Snow?

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:45.271
President Snow, it's Katniss.

00:00:45.271 --> 00:00:47.346
(Katniss) President Snow?
I need to speak with you.

00:00:48.006 --> 00:00:49.186
(Katniss) Are you there?

00:00:49.186 --> 00:00:50.986
President Snow?
It's Katniss.

00:00:51.436 --> 00:00:52.448
Can you hear me?

00:00:52.448 --> 00:00:54.026
President Snow, it's Katniss.

00:00:54.616 --> 00:00:55.708
President Snow?

00:00:55.998 --> 00:00:57.672
- President Snow--
- (garbled voice) Everdeen.

00:00:57.672 --> 00:01:01.614
(HT Guy) A guy whose only purpose
is to walk Katniss to her next scene.

00:01:01.754 --> 00:01:03.868
President Coin's requested 
to meet with you first.

00:01:03.868 --> 00:01:05.004
You're wanted to come in.

00:01:05.174 --> 00:01:06.005
This way.

00:01:06.005 --> 00:01:06.991
This way, soldier.

00:01:07.091 --> 00:01:07.859
Let's go.

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:08.618
Come with me.

00:01:08.618 --> 00:01:11.755
(HT Guy) And lots and lots of nothing!

00:01:11.955 --> 00:01:17.893
(silence)

00:01:17.893 --> 00:01:19.035
(HT Guy) Um...

00:01:19.059 --> 00:01:25.261
(silence)

00:01:25.261 --> 00:01:26.522
(HT Guy) And cut.

00:01:26.522 --> 00:01:30.116
(silence)

00:01:30.116 --> 00:01:32.099
(cat meows)

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.336
(HT Guy purrs)

00:01:38.046 --> 00:01:39.304
(HT Guy groans in frustration)

00:01:40.644 --> 00:01:43.325
(HT Guy) After the last games,
The Capitol is murdering

00:01:43.325 --> 00:01:44.627
everyone in sight.

00:01:44.737 --> 00:01:47.692
Now, with the chance 
to help stop the genocide,

00:01:47.762 --> 00:01:51.587
Katniss will do everything 
she can to not cooperate.

00:01:51.717 --> 00:01:52.540
Katniss...

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.741
Don't make me do this!

00:01:54.741 --> 00:01:57.622
(HT Guy) And constantly bitch 
about her fake TV boyfriend,

00:01:57.622 --> 00:02:00.149
who she really didn't care about
until he gave her a ball.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:02.106
What about Peeta.
Is he alive?

00:02:02.106 --> 00:02:03.282
He left Peeta.

00:02:03.282 --> 00:02:05.203
Peeta was the one who was supposed to live!

00:02:05.203 --> 00:02:06.798
(HT Guy) Clearly, there are more 
important things than Peeta

00:02:06.798 --> 00:02:07.854
going on right now.

00:02:07.854 --> 00:02:10.272
Even if we win this war, 
what happens to Peeta?

00:02:10.326 --> 00:02:12.478
Peeta and the other tributes will be rescued

00:02:12.478 --> 00:02:13.983
at the earliest opportunity.

00:02:13.983 --> 00:02:17.057
Sounds like exactly what Peeta said 
when you all called him a traitor.

00:02:17.057 --> 00:02:18.663
(HT Guy) Please, shut up about Peeta.

00:02:18.933 --> 00:02:20.026
He's gonna kill Peeta.

00:02:20.126 --> 00:02:21.707
He's punishing Peeta to punish me.

00:02:21.707 --> 00:02:22.958
He's gonna kill Peeta.

00:02:22.958 --> 00:02:23.908
Katniss, are you there?

00:02:23.908 --> 00:02:24.837
Oh, Peeta!

00:02:24.837 --> 00:02:26.685
This revolution is about everyone.

00:02:26.735 --> 00:02:28.432
Then you should've saved Peeta.

00:02:28.502 --> 00:02:29.828
(HT Guy groans in anger)

00:02:30.158 --> 00:02:32.642
Ride along for a movie 
that boils down to each side

00:02:32.642 --> 00:02:35.198
making political attack ads 
about each other,

00:02:35.198 --> 00:02:38.900
as Peeta appears on TV 
in a series of humiliating little outfits,

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.034
while Katniss pouts her way 
through being the Mockingjay

00:02:42.334 --> 00:02:44.718
in scene after scene, with all 
the excitement

00:02:44.718 --> 00:02:46.664
of actual film production!

00:02:46.714 --> 00:02:49.760
(blandly) People of Panem,
we fight, we dare, we...

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:50.756
(microphone turns on)

00:02:50.756 --> 00:02:51.975
(director) Does she know the line?

00:02:51.975 --> 00:02:52.718
I know, I know it.

00:02:52.718 --> 00:02:53.656
- (director) Okay.
- I'm sorry.

00:02:53.656 --> 00:02:55.032
- (director) All right, let's do it.
- She's warming up!

00:02:55.032 --> 00:02:56.232
(director) Okay, okay.
All right.

00:02:56.582 --> 00:02:58.990
(HT Guy) So cringe while one 
of the best supporting casts

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:02.565
of all time is squandered 
on this paper-thin half a movie,

00:03:02.665 --> 00:03:06.528
the movie's biggest hunk is squandered 
in favor of the zombiefied manlet.

00:03:06.638 --> 00:03:09.249
I mean, I'm not gay, but would you 
rather make out with this

00:03:09.249 --> 00:03:10.399
or this?

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:12.852
And one of the most 
talented young actresses

00:03:12.852 --> 00:03:15.864
is squandered in a role that 
has her put on a frumpy jumpsuit

00:03:16.014 --> 00:03:18.368
and make two hours worth of cry face!

00:03:18.427 --> 00:03:20.386
- (sobbing)
- Shhh!

00:03:20.956 --> 00:03:23.116
- Shhh!
- (sobbing)

00:03:23.116 --> 00:03:25.597
(HT Guy) Don't worry, Kat.
It'll all be over soon.

00:03:26.387 --> 00:03:27.389
Starring...

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:28.559
Pita Pocket,

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:29.875
Team Jacob,

00:03:30.215 --> 00:03:31.828
Fifty Shades of Grey,

00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:34.693
Elizabeth Banks on this Part 
to Pay her Mortgage,

00:03:34.863 --> 00:03:36.963
Woody Harrelson as Himself,

00:03:37.303 --> 00:03:38.447
Skrillex,

00:03:38.747 --> 00:03:40.917
And None of Us Have Seen Your Boobs.

00:03:41.327 --> 00:03:42.608
I Mean, Definitely Not Me...

00:03:42.608 --> 00:03:44.739
A Friend of Mine Sent Me a Link,
But I Said, "Hey, Man...

00:03:45.029 --> 00:03:46.733
That is Not Okay!

00:03:46.933 --> 00:03:48.606
Privacy is an Important Issue!

00:03:48.836 --> 00:03:51.146
Not Interested.
Thank You Very Much.

00:03:51.456 --> 00:03:53.817
'Cause...That's...Not Cool."

00:03:54.627 --> 00:03:57.247
Where's Peeta?: Part 1

00:03:59.867 --> 00:04:01.987
The Capitol just bombed a hospital

00:04:03.047 --> 00:04:07.084
filled with unarmed men, 
women, and children.

00:04:07.094 --> 00:04:08.567
(HT Guy) Uh, no they didn't.

00:04:08.737 --> 00:04:10.068
That was you, remember?

00:04:10.288 --> 00:04:13.147
(explosion)

00:04:13.147 --> 00:04:14.619
Smooth move, Hawkeye!

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:18.721

00:04:20.181 --> 00:04:23.556
I have been, and always 
shall be, your friend.

00:04:24.166 --> 00:04:27.191
The needs of the many 
outweigh the needs of the few

00:04:27.191 --> 00:04:28.500
or the one.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.424
A solar eclipse, the cosmic ballet goes on.

00:04:32.884 --> 00:04:35.499
Of all the souls I've 
encountered in my travels,

00:04:35.499 --> 00:04:37.693
his was the most human.

00:04:38.253 --> 00:04:40.127
Live long and prosper.
