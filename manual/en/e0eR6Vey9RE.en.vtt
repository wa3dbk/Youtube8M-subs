00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.600
First what we're going to do is we're
going to take a dry piece of wood

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.440
drill a hole in what's going to be the top side

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.920
...closed, 9 o'clock would be closed as well

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.040
...corner so that we can begin to turn our bowl shape

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.560
...before we turn the tenon, again I need to get some

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:46.040
...which is a shearing cut, and just continue the curve up and then stop, leaving a shoulder

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:51.440
...center of the bowl and make cuts that go from the top of the bowl down to the bottom

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.920
...once the sanding is complete we can apply a coat of finish and this is always fun

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.960
because it finally allows us to see what the wood is going to look like

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.760
...I've replaced the smaller jaws in this chuck with these large jaws that have the cushioned buttons

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:13.520
...to do this we're going to have to sand up a little ways into the part that has been sanded nicely before

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.780
...and now we get to put some finish on the bottom side of the bowl again

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.040
and see what it's really going to look like

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.940
...procedure for turning a bowl out of dry stock

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.440
Some of the advantages of making custom made handles are

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.880
that you can use different colors of wood so that you can color code the handles for easy identification

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.190
you can make sure you get a handle that fits the tool well

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.000
that is weighted properly, you can make sure that fits your hand

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.440
in the right places the way you like to
so it feels really good and functions the way that you like to

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.920
...calipers, and pick up the critical diameters from the tool handle that we're using as a template

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.260
here we're just going to establish the end of the tool handle and also where the ferrule is going to begin

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.280
...off relatively quickly but also leaves a nice surface

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:06.680
and it's really a nice tool for making gradual flowing curves like we have on this tool handle

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:10.280
...to do the final shaping

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.600
we'll continue here with a 3/8" spindle gouge

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:17.160
...pushing the point straight in and scraping a small "V" groove

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.650
we can now apply the finish, which we'll do here with the lathe stopped so that we can...

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.710
...remove the marks from the drive center

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:32.460
...piece of wood and put it over the tip of the gouge

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.860
and then take a mallet and drive the blade down into the handle

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.640
...to go from the largest diameter to the smaller diamter

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:52.300
...tool rest to guide the tool. Go ahead and work the shoulder down to the rest of the...

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.540
...the last detail we're going to make on the tone chamber is a groove for the lanyard

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.180
...sand always with the grain to remove any of those circular

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.020
...take your time with this, really push it in there - work it in everywhere

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:10.180
...closer look at our call, we want to have a tenon turned on the stopper

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.930
...a small 3/8" spindle gouge

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:16.760
...these are cuts

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.170
...remember to always go downhill, we've got the shallow gouge here again

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.140
...a couple more cuts on after its been removed from the lathe

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.800
...a little better. Go ahead and push it together

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.600
...just glue that in

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.030
...keep shaping that

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:50.500
now that we have our finished shape we're gonna make a couple of small detail cuts right up here

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.260
...still running true, once we remove that center

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.500
...this might move slightly

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.440
...keep working it on

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.760
...and then we're gonna flip the lathe on to buff it out dry

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:06.900
...twist it

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.360
...bandsaw, and then sand it nice and flat

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:21.220
...and this 1/2" mandrel used to be a router bit

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.920
...start out with a shallow spindle gouge to remove the square corners

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.260
we'll start with short strokes and just work along the blank

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:35.090
...notice here that the bevel of the tool is riding on the wood

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.310
right behind cutting-edge and that the
shavings are coming off in nice little curls

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.540
...slightly, hold it firmly and just press it in still until I hear that nice fun squeal that you get from a chatter tool

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.540
...not only make the surface shine a little bit but we'll bring out the pattern in the chatter work

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:52.860
...with the lathe stopped, and then turn the
lathe on and pretty much immediately

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:55.590
wiped off the excess finish from the surface

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.910
...we're going to use epoxy here - this is
two part epoxy that we'll mix up in equal parts
