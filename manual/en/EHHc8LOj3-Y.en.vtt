00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.950
Hello and welcome to this special edition
where we will be taking a look at one of the

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.090
projects that our research and development
team have been working on in recent weeks.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.380
UAV Vision was tasked with assisting an Australian
gripping services supplier, Black Bishop Films,

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:26.990
to finalize a self designed and manufactured
gyro stabilized camera mount named Dingo Head.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:33.940
The Dingo Head when mounted to an orbital
arm provides a 3 Axis Gyro stabilized platform

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.849
for which a range of cameras can be fixed
to capture that perfect travelling shot.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.000
Drawing on vast experience with gyro stabilized
platforms, UAV Vision successfully engineered

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.290
a solution to provide exceptional gyro stability
for the Dingo Head project.

00:00:53.429 --> 00:00:57.709
The Dingo Head was mounted to an Orbital Arm
which was then tested on top of Black Bishops

00:00:57.709 --> 00:01:00.829
Mercedes ML500 picture car.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.460
For testing an ARRI ALEXA Camera was mounted
to the Dingo Head.

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:09.249
Both the arm and camera were operated from
within the vehicle.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.890
Notice the exceptional stability of the shot
as the vehicles travel.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.390
Once testing criteria was satisfied, UAV Vision
R&amp;D engineers provided training to Black Bishop

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.150
Films on how the newly gyro stabilized head
is operated.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.200
We hope you enjoyed this insight into some
of the other projects that our R&amp;D team here

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.110
at UAV Vision are skillfully able to accomplish.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.180
