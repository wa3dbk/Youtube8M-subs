by watching Adorama TV.

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.560
I am here with mister Peter Hurley so obviously you came out of the model background

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.630
and that would make sense that you go a
little into

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:48.580
photographing people but what cemented
it for you that you want to work with

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.050
people like what did that mean to you

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.040
honestly it was like money to tell you the truth I was like started

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.850
shooting models because I was one and I
had access to my agency so I went

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.840
into my agency and the agent and I said hey
I picked up a camera do you mind if I

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.820
photograph any and it was guys at the
time it in a makeup artist and shoot any

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.310
women

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.570
and she's like yeah you can shoot

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.380
you now so I grabbed actually grab one
my friends and I shot him in the subway

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.090
and I was like, that sound terrible. I
photographed him in the subway

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.800
sorry and I brought the pictures in and she was
like oh my gosh you're really good you

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.070
can photograph anybody you want

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.070
wow and then that's how it started so
but then I was charging

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.270
I was trying to charge models and it's
hard because if their modeling in New

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.450
York with an agency

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.369
they generally have a pretty good
look and a lot of photographers would want them

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.380
in their book so they don't pay very
much so

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.649
I had a model that wanted to get in

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.330
an actor's head shot and he said shot
photographers created this market in New

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.420
York where head shot cost between $800

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.350
and like a thousand dollars back at the
time back at the time and I was like wow

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.210
oh my gosh if I could like do that and like
figure out how to make a living at this

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.569
I was the model actor bartender dude

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:58.289
I was like bartending till 4 a.m. I
remember I did this job

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.330
i bartender til 4am I got on the set
I fell asleep that client called my

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.759
agent

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.500
you know the model sleeping. It's like this is not
good anymore

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.950
so um I'd picked up a camera and this

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.069
guy thing, I think it was a guy, no it was a girl. this girl that was modeling acting

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.330
said to me I need headshots so

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.480
I didn't know what to do like when you get somebody close to your

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.040
camera

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.140
and you have to do a headshot it became so
foreign to me because I was shooting

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.640
models and they were full body

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.660
or three quarter, this gets very personal, yeah and you need eye contact the camera

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:33.630
so when I was shooting models and their
good looking in there in an agency in New

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.709
York they can look around any direction
you want and they just look cool

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:38.110
but you need to say anything to them

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.780
the minute they look in the lens and
they go like this

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.180
I feel like I don't have a shot I'm like
they look blank and I'm like why

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.990
are you doing that

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.370
and their like what and I'm like well you
were fine when you looked over here and

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.000
then you look at my lens and you got
weird

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.530
yeah and then I realize everybody
started doing that so I started shooting

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:56.170
actors and the on that weird I was like

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.709
why are they getting weird and why are celebrity's so cool in front of cameras

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.260
and then I was like something's going on
and I was like Bruce, I shot with Bruce and he

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.010
shoots celebrity's and they look all cool

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:08.900
yeah and I was like I don't know is it
that actors are so stressed out about

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:10.489
their head shot that they get weird

00:03:10.489 --> 00:03:14.319
so I started to realize that it was
about the direction

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:17.409
and when somebody gets weird you gotta
chill them out and

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:21.569
it comes through the relationship or
the repour that you build and

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.989
amount and what happened over the course
my career the amount of time it took me

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:30.049
to chill people out used to take me like
an hour two hours when I first started and

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:33.019
then it slowly got it shorter and
shorter and shorter shorter now I can do

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.209
it in like 30 seconds

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.180
right exactly practice make perfect I
we're gonna jump into watching

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.439

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:14.459
before we check out peter in action
here is his favorite way to carry

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:19.419
all his equipment for a shot. the
airport security version 2.0 is think

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.560
takes largest carry-on rolling back

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:25.540
allows you to carry two or more pro body's
up to 6 lenses

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.260
two flashes all the little accouterments you might need

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.389
built to ensure that everything is
protected and conveniently traveling

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:38.330
right by your side. so why is that, why I
have no idea where this came from

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:41.650
I used to model I don't know how that
happened but I did some modeling

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.650
and I remember how come these guys look
cool I want to look at celebrities

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.570
I want you to checkout magazine's. generally
they will all be squinching which is this

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:54.800
their not squinting, this is this, and it's not
ethnicity based. I'm gonna show you some

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:55.720
examples

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:59.020
of all different ethnicities doing this
and why it works OK

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:02.039
so fear, confidence

00:05:02.039 --> 00:05:05.669
with the squinch watch the lower lids
again we'll do it again

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:11.350
right that's the deal now let's get
scientific on you. I'm gonna get a little

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:12.380
scientific here

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:17.030
there's a muscle that surround eye
called the orbicularis oculi, so it closes

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.180
your eye tight and it creates squenching it's like
this squinting

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.729
it creates squinting. so goes around your eye like
this right if you want to close it tight

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:27.320
to do that lower lid little pinch

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.070
there's a palpebral ligament that runs
across the bottom of your eye

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.340
and you just lift it up a little bit. that's
all you're doing

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:38.760
your hitting that palpebral ligament
so don't tell me you can't do this

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:43.020
you have the ligament you just have to
teach yourself to do it and you do it

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:43.669
anyway

00:05:43.669 --> 00:05:46.199
you just know when you're not in front
of a camera once you take conscious

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:48.080
control of it your brain covers it

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:50.889
you walk around in public you don't have
to think about this is when you're

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:51.900
in front of the camera

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.110
and you take conscious control over your
eyes and you have to hit this stuff how

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.979
do you think the celebrities models do
it

00:05:56.979 --> 00:06:00.960
I used to do it you can do it you ready
I'm giving you this is a gift you can

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:01.729
