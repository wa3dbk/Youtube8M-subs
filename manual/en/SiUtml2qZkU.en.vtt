00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.700
Hi, I am Jared, welcome to Fun Science Demos. The big idea today is that heat

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.000
moves matter. Heat moves matter in this
lamp

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.360
and heat moves matter in our earth.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:15.349
So let us take a look at this lamp and
see heat move matter.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.810
You cannot see it, but there is a light
bulb here

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.119
and it is hot. It gives off lots of heat and
that heat

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.800
heats up this purple wax- you can see it,
whoo!- and causes it to rise to the top. When

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.060
that wax gets hot

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:31.480
it rises to the top. And you can see some
of the wax

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.300
dropping down. Why? Well, as the heated wax moves to the top

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.300
it just hangs out there and it is cooling
off. And when it cools off

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.670
it drops, it drops back down. And when it
drops back down it gets heated back up

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.870
and moves up.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:51.000
And it cools off and moves down and it
gets heated up and it moves up and it

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.820
cools off and it moves down. It is this
cycle,

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.320
it is happening in the lamp. And guess what?

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:02.510
the same thing happens in our earth. So let us
take a look at this diagram

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.850
and see how the earth works. Through
science we have discovered that the middle of

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:08.720
the earth is really, really hot.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.250
We have also discovered that the outside of
the earth has this crust

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.400
and the moving matter inside the earth
can actually move the crust.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.549
As it is heated up it rises up to the crust,

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:26.060
it cools off and comes back down just like
this lamp; the wax in this lamp.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.829
It is happening inside of our earth. The
heat from the middle of the earth is

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:33.119
causing all this matter to move

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:36.570
and that makes the crust move. So let us take
a look at that crust

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.640
and the outside of the earth. These are continents.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.100
That us where we live. The blue is the
ocean.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.549
Oceans and continents actually sit on
top

00:01:46.549 --> 00:01:50.399
of the crust. But what are these lines? Through science we have discovered

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.619
that the crust is actually broken into
plates

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.990
and those plates move. Heat

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.329
moves matter. Let us try and show you how
that works.

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:05.280
We have a heat source here, we have a
heat source here,

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.030
we have a heat source here. Our heat
source is the middle part of the earth.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.989
We need something to be the matter that
that heat energy can move around.

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:18.670
We have our milk and now we need
something

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.900
to be the crust. For that we are using

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.400
chocolate powder. So here is our setup, we
modeled it after our earth.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.800
We have our center hot part, there is the heat
source down there

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.940
making it hot. We have our crust which you
can see on the top. It is

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.340
smooth right now, something should happen
as the matter

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.340
which you cannot see-the milk-starts moving
inside

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.940
from the heat. Heat heats it up, rises,

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.440
cools off and sinks. There is movement happening, you cannot see it-yet.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.430
Let us zoom in and take a closer look.
So our timer is going, let us take a look at

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.310
this setup and see what is going on here.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:58.610
Inside the pot we have our liquid matter,

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.840
much like the earth and we are heating
that liquid matter,

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.560
much like the earth. And you can see that
chocolate powder on top

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.200
is our crust. It does not look like much
is happening,

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.159
but there is a lot going on underneath
the crust, just like

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:17.250
our earth. So we are going to zoom in and
take a closer look.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.209
But what should you be looking for? Well,
that liquid matter

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:24.599
under the crust is moving. It does not
look like

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.690
anything is happening to the crust but as
the liquid matter

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:30.920
of the crust moves, the crust will start
to move

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.019
and you will actually see tiny cracks form.
And those cracks will get bigger

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.659
as the crust moves. So we are coming up on
the 14 minutes and now we can see

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:43.700
our crust starting to crack. Why is that
happening? Well,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.220
that liquid matter, we heated it up and it is
starting to move underneath the crust.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:52.950
And you can see that crust-they are
called plates, scientists call those plates-

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.239
and they are starting to move.

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:58.080
Look at this one right here. Seeing it
start to separate?

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:02.500
Take a look at these plates as they move.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:06.780
Why are they moving? The liquid matter

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.930
underneath is moving, too. Take a look

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:14.459
right here and right here.

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.650
Tiny cracks in the crust, they are going to-

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.340
the plates are going to-start to move and
you will see

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.690
the cracks get bigger. Watch right here,

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.930
watch it open up. Watch right here

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.410
and right here. Ooh, there is one
forming right here.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:40.630
Now we have a crack forming here. The
crust is breaking iinto plates right

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.830
before our eyes.

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:46.720
Why is that happening? The liquid matter
underneath the crust is moving. Now we

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.270
can start to see it happen.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.530
You can see the plate movements.

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:57.590
As that liquid matter heats up the crust,
the plates move.

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.500
Cracks are forming. We are at about 15 minutes in

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.690
and now we can see our plates really
forming up here

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.430
beautifully. We want you to remember

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:15.270
that our continents and oceans actually
sit

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.479
on these different plates.

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:21.650
I am not putting them in the right order
but that is all right,

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:25.800
you get the picture. Each continent and ocean

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:29.800
sits on different plates and you can see
how the plates are separate

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:33.370
by the cracks. What causes it? The moving
matter

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:37.169
underneath the crust. We cannot see it, but
through this demonstration

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:41.910
now we can. It is so easy to see the
movement of the crust.

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:44.970
Well, scientists call that movement of
the earths crust

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:50.229
plate tectonics. It is a big word but so
many cool things happen because of that

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:50.960
word.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.370
Because the crust moves and those plates
move

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:57.690
we have earthquakes, we have volcanoes

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:02.039
and even, it forms new mountains. Science
is so cool.
