Hi this is Yolanda Vanveen, and in this segment
we're going to talk about how to repel rodents

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:15.129
naturally from digging holes up in your yard.
Now anybody that has a large yard or has any

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:20.930
property near natural areas usually has a
problem with rodents digging up the yard.

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.650
And I usually say if you've got rodents digging
up holes in your yard that usually means you've

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:33.480
got great soil, and you've got great drainage.
And you've got to remember that gophers and

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.980
moles have a purpose in this world and they
naturally aerate your lawn. So instead of

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:47.350
fighting them I kind of enjoy their services.
And so I set boundaries for them. First off

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.510
I don't grow any flower bulbs directly into
the soil, I put them in raised beds with some

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.050
cloth that's rodent proof. They can't dig
through it underneath it, and then you put

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:04.220
the raised bed on top and that way the rodents
won't get into your flower bulbs and dig them

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.990
out. So first off set boundaries and that
way they won't become a problem in that area.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.799
Secondly, if they're messing in your lawn
it can become a problem. And there's only

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.179
a few things you can do naturally that help.
What I found was as soon as you find a hole

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:28.350
put the hose down the hole and that way the
water will flush them out or drown them out,

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.850
and they'll find a new area to go to. Another
trick is as soon as you have a hole put a

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.639
bunch of cayenne pepper, red hot chili pepper,
cinnamon, anything into that hole. They hate

00:01:37.639 --> 00:01:43.889
the smell and they'll move on. So another
easy trick that I've learned is whenever rodents

00:01:43.889 --> 00:01:49.490
make a hole in your yard thank them for digging
up a hole for your bulbs, and put some daffodils

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.240
in those holes. Because they won't eat the
daffodils. And the daffodils will come up

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.140
and bloom beautifully in the spring, and then
die back in the spring. You'll mow the lawn

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.399
all summer and you won't even know they are
there. And that way the rodents have dug your

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:06.640
holes for you. You can put the daffodils in
there, and you've got a beautiful spring garden

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.210
in your lawn. So in the end I try not to hurt
any of the wild animals in my yard. And I

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:18.240
panicked when I saw that I've got holes coming
up with, they're not gophers because those

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:25.180
are bigger holes, and they make bigger tunnels.
These are moles. And the moles only eat the

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.520
worms, they are not eating the bulbs. But
what happens is the moles make the holes,

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.610
they dig up the bulbs, then the mice come
in and eat the bulbs. So they work together,

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.740
tag team me on that one. So by eliminating
the threat of separating your bulbs into a

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:46.290
bed where they are not going to get into it,
and running the hose down every time they

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:52.180
make a hole, raking it out, putting more grass
seed where they've made beautiful lush soil

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.850
for you. Is an easy way to repel the rodents
from your yard. And we can all live together

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:58.230
naturally.
