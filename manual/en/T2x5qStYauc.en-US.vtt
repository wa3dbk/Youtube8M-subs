00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.780
Hi!

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:04.780
Oh no...

00:00:05.251 --> 00:00:06.611
Hi!!!

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:08.480
You're recording...

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.040
Wrong. Again.

00:00:48.668 --> 00:00:50.668
Marcelina. Life with G2 Mini. Sum up. 

00:00:52.935 --> 00:00:55.635
We arrived in our mountain hut in Reunion

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.960
In a green jungle, it was unreal

00:00:58.953 --> 00:01:05.533
For the first time in my life I felt like getting up at 3 a.m. just to go sightseeing

00:01:05.533 --> 00:01:08.613
We were busy the entire time, always doing something

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.440
We decided to visit a volcano

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.909
It's best to get there as early in the day as possible

00:01:14.121 --> 00:01:16.121
We got to the top, which we couldn't really see

00:01:16.121 --> 00:01:18.121
Because it was so foggy

00:01:18.121 --> 00:01:20.121
We were looking for a spot to record the episode

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:23.701
We came across a place that looked like the surface of the Moon

00:01:23.701 --> 00:01:27.200
I felt like sticking a Polish flag in the ground 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.200
To show that I was here

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.200
And a footprint!

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.200
We had a few scary moments

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.200
It was really steep

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.200
We carried all the equipment with us

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.200
Suddenly we heard a loud noise

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.460
We looked back and saw that Arno, our guide, had rolled down the slope

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:44.460
It looked terryfying

00:01:44.816 --> 00:01:46.816
Luckily he just got up and dusted himself off

00:01:46.816 --> 00:01:48.436
He's an undestructible man

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.820
It was great to spend some time at the markets

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.820
There's plenty of great colorful places there

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.820
I bought a ukulele

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.420
To learn to play it before the concert

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.700
I recorded myself using the phone

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:08.920
During these few days I managed to learn enough to play it at the concert

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.480
That was really satisying

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:14.160
What I liked the best on Mauritius was the water adventures

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.160
And the time with dolphins

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
We took a boat to a place where they were supposed to appear

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.440
Every time I saw them they were gone before I jumped in the water

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:26.480
We tried to dive as deep as possible, which was difficult

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.480
I hadn't suspected I could dive so deep

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:31.760
We needed great shots and we couldn't get enough material

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.540
Back home, we went through the footage and suddenly saw this shot

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.160
With a whole group of dolphins swimming in slow motion

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.660
Small ones, big ones... best shot ever

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.660
Snorkeling was totally great

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.580
We saw beautiful fish and coral reef

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.580
Just like a giant aquarium

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.580
A few of us got scratched by the corals

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.240
Which was dangerous, since we heard it can latch on to the body

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.700
They wanted to make a teaser where I appear in different places

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.700
And walk ahead

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:05.700
With the landscape chaning around me

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.700
I had dreams about it

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.700
"Teaser! Action! One, two three..."

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.700
I just walked on obediently

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.880
The editing and sound for the videos was done in Warsaw

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.380
It was great that Robert Cichy, my guitarist and producer could join me there

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.760
He played the concert with us

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:26.020
He really got into it

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.020
Every video has its own story

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.020
The music helps tell these stories

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.540
All of this would not have been possible without LG, Socialyse and Urban Legend, who recorded everything

00:03:38.078 --> 00:03:40.078
It was a great adventure, to be able to go to these places

00:03:40.078 --> 00:03:42.078
And create a more unconventional campaign

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.340
The phone deifinitely passed the test

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.600
I recorded a lot of sounds and inspirations

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.320
It was a great adventure, I could do this all the time
