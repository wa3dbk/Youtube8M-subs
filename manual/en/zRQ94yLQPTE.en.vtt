Hi, my name is Kip and I'm here on behalf
of Expert Village. At this point we need to

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:11.211
preheat our oven, take our cook sheet and
prepare it and then cut our cinnamon roll

00:00:11.211 --> 00:00:22.140
log into actual cinnamon rolls and place them
on the pan. We would want to take and preheat

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:31.669
your oven to three hundred and seventy-five
degrees. You want to get a dish or a cookie

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:38.080
sheet or something that has fairly high sides
because as the roll rises during baking it

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.980
would tend to go over the edges if it does
not have something to hold it in. Now in the

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:46.260
commercial bakery we actually use something
that looks very much like a cookie sheet it

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.240
has a very small edge but then there is a
fiber glass or I'm not sure what kind of material

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:58.900
but it is kind of plasticly material frame
that we put down inside that cookie sheet

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.070
that gives it a wall or something for the
cinnamon oil to lean against. You want to

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:10.690
add some cookie spray or you can put some
butter on the bottom. A lot of times I put

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.060
the spray, put some butter on the bottom,
put some more of the filling the cinnamon

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.530
sugar mixture in the bottom. So when they
are cooked you really have a lot of goo there

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.030
but we would start with this. We may need
to actually use one more can because my cinnamon

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:33.220
rolls obviously quiet large so we might have
to may cinnamon rolls for this one. The next

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:39.810
thing we are going to do is actually to cut
our cinnamon rolls, now this (I'm not even

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.860
sure what they call this in a bakery I have
used them forever) but it does not have a

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.100
really sharp edge on it so we use this to
actually cut dough without cutting our counter.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.650
You can use a knife but then you want to use
the chopping block. Then just determine how

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.689
long you want them to be I usually make them
about a inch in a half to two inches long.

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.479
Now I have seen people go along like this
and get them all different heights because

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.170
it is pretty hard to gage. You take your first
one, set it next to it and then just use that

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:16.950
as the gage and then you have some a little
bit more consistency in uniform. As to making

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:27.090
sure that all the cinnamon rolls are more
or less the same. Of course the two end ones

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.010
are usually the most different so we got one,
two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.810
so they would probably would all fit in this
pan. So just take our pan and you want to

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.790
have just a little bit or room between each
you don't want to stick them too close together.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.310
So we are going to do a row of four and they
got some room as you can see, a little space

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:58.430
between and we are going to do another row
of four so we would only need the one pan

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:05.681
and this will fill up and come probably close
to the top or a little bit over. So oh look

00:03:05.681 --> 00:03:10.540
a little piece of dough we can eat that raw.
Now that we have done that all you have to

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:17.200
do is put them in the oven for twenty-five
minutes, check part way through because sometimes

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.450
if they get too tight in here they middle
spiral will poke up really high and you can

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.230
just take a spatula and shove it right where
it belongs. But at this point we are now ready

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.780
to bake.
