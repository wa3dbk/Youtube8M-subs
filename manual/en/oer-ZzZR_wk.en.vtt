00:00:16.083 --> 00:00:18.755
We're back on set for
our patio pond installation.

00:00:18.755 --> 00:00:21.705
The next step that we have to do
is we have to install a spitter,

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:26.125
or some kind of tubes that bring water from
the upper bog down into the lower pond.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:29.185
Now, the homeowner that I'm dealing with
was super excited and anxious to try and

00:00:29.185 --> 00:00:33.195
find an antique faucet or
some kind of interesting trinket to bring

00:00:33.195 --> 00:00:37.550
the water from the upper pond down to
the lower pond through that face of the wood.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.620
Now, we kind of struck
out finding an old piece.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.570
So, we're going with his second best choice,
which is some, some copper spillways or

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.015
some copper tubes to bring
the water back through.

00:00:47.015 --> 00:00:49.650
Cuz the copper looks really pretty
when it gets a patina on there and

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.660
it shows some age and some weathering.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.690
Now, before we go in and install the copper,

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.970
I wanna talk about copper and its effects
on the water and the effects on the fish.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.890
Now, back in the day when pennies
were really made of copper.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.380
And people treated koi ponds
as a wishing well, and

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.240
they would flick the pennies into there.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.730
Copper levels could get really high and
it could be, dangerous for the fish.

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.150
One thing I want to point out is, one of the
dangers of copper is if you have soft water

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.340
or a low pH, copper can become very
sensitive on the, on the fish.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.010
And, where we're located right here,
we have a very hard, high alkaline,

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.530
high pH, so, copper's not as, dangerous
to fish in that regard and, then, this

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.050
is primarily gonna be a goldfish pond as well
and goldfish are a whole lot more tolerant.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.820
Now, we're gonna have three spillways
that are gonna come through and

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.430
one is gonna be, a, a little half-inch
spillway, it's gonna be really a trickle.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.230
So, when you're out on the patio it's
very calming, and peaceful, and then,

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:51.220
we're gonna have this one
inch pipe as an overflow.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.770
The majority of the water that's
traveling through the bog filter

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.310
will flow in back to the pond,
below water level, and won't make a sound.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.040
Now, we're going to have a,
a third element in there as well,

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.860
because things look better in threes.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.910
But it's also going to be our,
our safety overflow.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.880
Because that main, that main feed that
water's going to be traveling through,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.200
roots might be prone to, to going to it.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.650
It'll be maintained every now and then to,
to, keep the roots from invading on it.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.250
But let's say, we neglect it a little bit,
we're gonna have the overflow setup to where,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.110
if the roots get clogged,
the overflow will become active and

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.660
water will start to make more
noise as it pours into the pond,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:32.850
and it'll be like an alarm to say, hey,
we need to do some maintenance on the roots.

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.730
So, that's what we're gonna be doing today.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.400
Let's get started.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.080
Alright, so, we're gonna have the three
spouts coming through this panel right here.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.960
And, we're gonna, we're gonna come in pretty
low because actually the bottom of the bog is

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.480
way down here, and
the top of the bog is around here.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:56.340
So, I wanna be sure I come down low, so, my
water level's not too high in the bog filter.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.458
Now, the, the first one we're
gonna do right in the center.

00:02:59.458 --> 00:03:03.042
And, we've measured 34
inches in between here.

00:03:03.042 --> 00:03:06.253
[SOUND] So,
I'm going to come in at 17 inches.

00:03:06.253 --> 00:03:09.125
[SOUND]
I'll make a mark.

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:11.792
[SOUND] See that mark there.

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:14.708
And I'm going to come up about, say, an inch.

00:03:14.708 --> 00:03:21.660
[SOUND]
So, that'll be our centerpiece right here.

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.850
Where our little spout's gonna come through.

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:26.930
And then,
I don't really want these guys to be equal.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.580
I'm gonna offset these guys a little bit.

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:33.588
So, one's gonna be there and
the same on this side.

00:03:33.588 --> 00:03:36.167
So, this is about 5 inches, I would say.

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.639
Yeah, we're gonna come
in at about 5 inches and

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.750
I want these guys to be a little bit taller.

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.320
I don't want them to be at the same level.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.960
So, this is gonna be five-inch mark here and
I'm gonna come up about an inch and a half,

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.543
say inch and three quarters.

00:03:51.543 --> 00:03:54.918
[SOUND] So,
there's where we're gonna mark that one.

00:03:54.918 --> 00:03:58.792
[SOUND] So, inch and three quarters by five.

00:03:58.792 --> 00:04:05.833
[SOUND] Come in here, we got five and
then, inch and three quarters.

00:04:05.833 --> 00:04:10.250
[SOUND]
Mark that.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.130
[SOUND]
So, there's our marks.

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:19.330
I want you to notice that I've,
got my little hole saw and

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.900
this is the,
the spout that's gonna come through.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.390
A petite little half inch here for the,
the main feed as the trickling effect,

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.280
and then I have my other hole
saw that I've specced out.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.744
You see it's, it fits in there nice, not to
tight, not to loose, and that will be for

00:04:35.744 --> 00:04:37.375
the overflow in the main feed.

00:04:37.375 --> 00:04:40.919
[SOUND] Let's get these things drilled out.

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:50.512
[NOISE]

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.653
This will be nice.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.780
[SOUND]
I think that's gonna look real nice.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.050
When it's all said and done,

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:34.958
we're gonna have these little turnabouts
like this, dropping the water down.

00:05:34.958 --> 00:05:35.877
That's gonna look real nice.

00:05:35.877 --> 00:05:41.611
[SOUND]
I drop the tank back into place for

00:05:41.611 --> 00:05:43.050
the bog filter.

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:47.360
So, I can come in here and I can mark,
where these bulkheads need to be.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:50.090
So, I can be precise.

00:05:55.417 --> 00:05:59.690
Now, I'll put the tank back out and
I'll drill those, install those bulkheads.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:02.820
Before I drill, I just want to double-check.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:05.270
On the right bulkhead size.

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.470
I've got a half inch here in the middle, and

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.170
then do the two,
three quarters on the outside.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:13.333
And these guys have the both
the same diameter bulkhead.

00:06:13.333 --> 00:06:16.293
So, the same drill,
that's gonna work on all three.

00:06:16.293 --> 00:06:23.097
[NOISE]

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.958
Clean these guys up with my knife just a little bit.

00:06:48.958 --> 00:06:58.958
