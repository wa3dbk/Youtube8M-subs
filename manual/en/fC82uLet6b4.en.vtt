Hi I'm James Adams I'm here on behalf of expertvillage.com
and I'm going to talk about laptop video cards.

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:14.230
Laptop video cards are not upgradeable and
another thing about them is you could always

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:23.940
look at what kind you have by going to start
control panel system and then you go to hardware

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:31.580
and device manager. Right here the forth option
from the top forth or fifth it depends on

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.800
your computer. You will click it and right
there it says what kind you have. In my case

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:47.060
I got a AT radiant 200 series. So one thing
to know about laptop video cards is there

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.840
are different kinds for a simple. I'm looking
right now this Dell system and if you are

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.470
planning to doing any kind of gaming on the
laptop you are really not going to find a

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.639
laptop with a video card cable to play like
high in games. For under a 1000 dollars actually

00:01:04.639 --> 00:01:11.119
about 11 or 12 maybe even 13 but, in this
case this Dell I have a if you where going

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:15.719
to buy you have a couple of options Intel
graphite meaning accelerator in 950 which

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:24.819
is good enough for some games and mostly intended
for emails and stuff like that, typing letters,

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:31.109
what not. Then they have this second option
on this Dell laptop which is 128 mega mobility

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:39.250
S1300 which that would play some games and
they have the 256 mega radian X1400 that would

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.659
also play some games. With these cards the
last two you will be able to play games but

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.099
not with the first. The first one would play
some games but not most of them. They have

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:59.079
another manufacture right here it is called
cyber power not only ATI radian are not the

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:08.509
only ones that make video cards but also Nvidia
In this case of these cyber power where is

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:19.519
it cyber power it comes with it. There it
is. It comes with a MGVA force 7600 256 mega

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:25.810
which is better then the dell but, also it
is 1200 dollars. So if you are planning on

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.150
playing any kind high in games on it and you
have a lot that you pay like 700 dollars for

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:38.459
it there is not going to play games. Another
thing like I said the video card on the laptop

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:43.860
is not upgradeable the only kind that there
is one kind of laptop that you could upgrade

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:50.110
the video is called MXM module if your laptop
has that. The module basically looks like

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.650
a super Nintendo cartilage you just pop it
out and pop a new one in but it was not very

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.959
popular and has gone out of circulation.
