00:00:06.593 --> 00:00:10.313
I need advice on how to fix PS4 internet problems.

00:00:10.313 --> 00:00:14.633
First, make sure it is actually connected
to the internet.

00:00:14.633 --> 00:00:17.863
I do not have to make sure it is connected.

00:00:17.863 --> 00:00:24.403
The PS4 controller and even the console connection
to the internet is usually wireless now.

00:00:24.403 --> 00:00:29.263
If the WiFi connection is being dominated
by someone else watching Netflix or downloading,

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:31.952
you’ll have internet problems with the PS4.

00:00:31.952 --> 00:00:37.703
My PS4 has typically worked even if other
people were working online.

00:00:37.703 --> 00:00:43.462
If too many people are trying to use the same
WiFi connection, it could slow down the PS4’s

00:00:43.462 --> 00:00:47.883
connection to Sony to the point that the PlayStation’s
connection times out.

00:00:47.883 --> 00:00:51.782
All I know is that is the opposite of my idea
of a good time.

00:00:51.782 --> 00:00:53.642
How could I fix it?

00:00:53.642 --> 00:00:58.503
Try an old school wired connection to the
internet instead of using WiFi for both the

00:00:58.503 --> 00:01:02.542
controller and console plus anything else
in the room.

00:01:02.542 --> 00:01:07.273
Or making sure that WiFi connections for smart
house monitoring networks are not all in the

00:01:07.273 --> 00:01:10.983
same cabinet, interfering with the PS4.

00:01:10.983 --> 00:01:16.053
True, interference from other wi-fi from wireless
phones to security cameras can interfere with

00:01:16.053 --> 00:01:17.053
it.

00:01:17.053 --> 00:01:21.513
Then you’re down to moving them apart and
checking line of sight to solve it.

00:01:21.513 --> 00:01:24.373
Pity tin foil hats won’t solve it.

00:01:24.373 --> 00:01:28.813
If putting the router on a LAN cable did not
fix it, you may want to determine if using

00:01:28.813 --> 00:01:30.683
a different cable would fix it.

00:01:30.683 --> 00:01:34.003
I’ve heard changing NAT settings could fix
it.

00:01:34.003 --> 00:01:40.133
You want NAT 2, because open NAT is an open
invitation to a hacked system, whereas NAT

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:45.283
3 has so many security precautions it slows
down your internet connection more than an

00:01:45.283 --> 00:01:48.403
NSA checkpoint does to your travel plans.

00:01:48.403 --> 00:01:51.513
I hate chokepoints and slowdowns in general.

00:01:51.513 --> 00:01:57.813
Speaking of slowdowns, check to see if the
PS4 is trying to update while you’re playing.

00:01:57.813 --> 00:02:00.393
That’ll slow down game play.

00:02:00.393 --> 00:02:04.033
If I run updates in rest mode, it can lock
up.

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:08.893
Not if you set it to run updates and but not
go in rest mode, or move the controller once

00:02:08.893 --> 00:02:13.143
in a while so the updates go while it is not
in rest mode.

00:02:13.143 --> 00:02:15.593
I need to Google that solution.

00:02:15.593 --> 00:02:20.792
Depending on your system, you might want to
check the DNS settings on the PS4 compared

00:02:20.792 --> 00:02:22.983
to what Sony says it should be.

00:02:22.983 --> 00:02:28.962
Google that instead, assuming you do not want
to use the Google DNS settings.

00:02:28.962 --> 00:02:32.682
As long as connectivity problems are solved,
I’d try it.

00:02:32.682 --> 00:02:37.652
Google the Sony server status if you keep
having connectivity problems.

00:02:37.652 --> 00:02:42.612
The PlayStation 4 tries to connect to Sony
when you turn it on, and if their servers

00:02:42.612 --> 00:02:45.302
are down, you’ll get connectivity problems.

00:02:45.302 --> 00:02:49.042
But my system wants to update the firmware.

00:02:49.042 --> 00:02:53.893
So try downloading the firmware updates that
might solve the problem somewhere other than

00:02:53.893 --> 00:02:57.423
Sony; their support site has alternate links
to getting it.
