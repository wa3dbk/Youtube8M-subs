00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:05.700
[Airplane noise]

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.920
[Clattering sound and footsteps]

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.880
Hello I'm Tim Johnson
and I'm in my studio in Newtown.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.600
I think for me being an artist was
a dream come true.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.620
At school we had to do 
vocational guidance tests

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.670
and they said, oh you're actually very
clever, you can really do anything you want

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.899
and I said well I don't want to do
anything except be an artist and they said

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.000
yep you can do that too. 
[Chuckles]

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.640
When I went to Papunya 
I noticed that the artists they

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.060
lay the canvas on the ground and they
all sit around it and they all work on it

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:53.360
and sometimes I think it's a bit like
sitting on a magic carpet. [Tinkling sound]

00:00:53.360 --> 00:01:00.880
I've got a whole lot of different techniques I use.
This one, this part is stamping.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.780
I started using stamps because 
I had to do so many paintings and

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.360
I had to find ways to paint more quickly.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:15.720
I was lucky in that the things I was interested in
later on became more popular.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.880
For example, performance and conceptual art
later on became the norm.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.399
And then when I got
interested in Aboriginal art

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.260
I didn't realize it would become
an international art movement

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.000
and my interest in Asia...

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.620
This is just an animation cell from a
Japanese anime movie.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.300
It's something that inspires me, I think, and you will see
images like this in some of my work,

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.440
like this particular one. It's in one of these
paintings around here...

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.920
Oh here we are, yeah, just there.

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.900
They come out different so I don't worry too much

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.780
about the fact that I'm taking someone else's image.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.260
So I'm a little bit like someone who's making a selection, like culling down someone else's art history

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:23.400
from an outside point of view and so
creating another way of looking at something.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.460
[Musical clanging sound, 
like something closing]
