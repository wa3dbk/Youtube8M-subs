00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:04.750
In this clip, we're going to talk about gem
crafting. Now, in the World of Warcraft there

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.530
are thirteen professions. There are three
secondary skills and ten primary professions.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.340
Now, the primary profession we're going to
talk about of course is gem crafting. Gem

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.760
crafting is a skill that is exactly what it
sounds like. If you go to a jeweler in the

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.779
real world, he can cut stones to make facets.
And, so you get your diamond ring and you

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:30.120
get married and you live happily ever after.
In the World of Warcraft, you can do the same

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:37.690
kind of thing. Now, the gems that you're using
of course many of them have magical properties.

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.030
For example, you could make a diamond ring
in the World of Warcraft. But, it would be

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:49.280
a magical diamond ring. You can also use things
like bracelets and necklaces. Or, gems that

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.789
you plug into your weapons or armor to make
them more powerful. And, some examples of

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:02.510
gem crafting things are different buffs that
are inherent buffs. Like, for example if you

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.590
were to enchant something you could put a
magical enchantment on something. And, give

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.020
yourself more strength. You could do the same
thing with gems. You could cut a magic gem

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.240
and put it in your sword and give yourself
more strength that way. It's just another

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:21.591
way of doing something and that's why you
would take the profession gem crafting. So,

00:01:21.591 --> 00:01:25.540
if you have the profession gem crafting you
would go down here to your spell book. Come

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:32.460
up here to gem crafting, go here and here
are some things that you can make. Now, currently

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.409
what we are able to make are things like an
inlaid malachite ring. In order to make it,

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.420
we would need certain raw materials like copper
bars and malachite. Something we have the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.749
materials for right now is a pendant a malachite
pendant. We have malachite. We have delicate

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:53.400
copper wire. So, we could make a malachite
pendant. Now, if we were to do that that's

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.960
a necklace basically. And, if we were to wear
that necklace it would raise our agility attribute

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:06.020
by two points. So, that's just one example
of what you can do with gem crafting. You

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.789
can make things like rings and that sort of
thing and necklaces and stuff.
