Belly Dance Moves: Chest Circles:

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.890
So, now let's go over the basic chest circle.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.070
Before we did our chest slides going from
side to side as well as lifting your chest

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.519
up and down.

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.170
Now we're going to combine these into a chest
circle.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.970
Now we're going to slide over to one side,
keeping the hips really still, tailbone pointing

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.130
down, remember to engage the lower abs, lifting
the chest up, going over to the other side,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.219
coming back to neutral.

00:00:33.219 --> 00:00:39.640
Over to one side and up and the other side
and neutral.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:45.249
Remember to keep your hands really relaxed,
relax the neck, keep the chin lifted and now

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:46.249
we're going to circle.

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:50.760
We're going to connect those dots and create
a smooth movement.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:00.719
Now, let's try that with music.

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:10.760
And a little bit faster.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:36.609
Let's try going in the other direction and
if you're really comfortable, lift the arms

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:46.622
overhead 
and drop the arms back down.

00:01:46.622 --> 00:01:58.379
And that's how you do a chest circle.
