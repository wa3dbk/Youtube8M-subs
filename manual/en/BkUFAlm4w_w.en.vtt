00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.980
Dancing shadows in the dazzling season

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.680
The road where they're back to back

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.040
Nearby, you who I can't reach

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.020
Are always watching with a smile

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.980
A dream that doesn't end in one night

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.800
In this palm

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.100
Passing through the seasons, now

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.900
In the skies without lies, there are stars

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.880
The moon dances again shining on the surface of the water

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.800
On the misty clockwork night

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.560
A dazzling light pierced quickly through my body

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.080
The line of tears across my cheeks

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.600
Ahead of where they fall, a reflective surface

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.920
Extending out from the crack,

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:20.980
Warmth dispels the fog

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.860
Even if the flowers are strewn about a new wind

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.780
Blows through them to reach you

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.360
The children of the moon that buds at times will gather light again

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.880
The moon dances again shining on the surface of the water

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:44.840
On the misty clockwork night

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.720
A dazzling light pierced quickly through my body

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.900
Even if the flowers are strewn about a new wind

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.740
Blows through them to reach you

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:28.660
The children of the moon that buds at times will gather light again

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.900
The moon dances again shining on the surface of the water

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.840
On the misty clockwork night

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:44.440
A dazzling light pierced quickly through my body

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:03.180
So that you don't scatter

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.620
So that you don't vanish fleetingly

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:16.760
I'll go towards tomorrow that reaches my dreams
