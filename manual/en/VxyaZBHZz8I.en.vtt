Image Planes are used often in Maya to make the modeling process easier. And what I've done 
here is, I've a capture model with photography, 

00:00:09.733 --> 00:00:16.599
under 2 different lighting schemes, so that we can see multiple types of reference that we can 
model on top of.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:22.000
So, I have my front view and my side view, but these aren't the only photos that I've taken. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.900
I've also taken photos with more extreme side lighting, and this makes the model's figure pop,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.366
I can see a lot more muscle detail showing up. And that will be very useful when it comes to 
texturing and sculpting.

00:00:35.366 --> 00:00:39.999
For my image planes, I'm going to use the more evenly lit version so that there's less distractions, 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.733
and what I'll do is go to my Image &gt; Canvas Size, and I'll double the width of my front view.

00:00:46.733 --> 00:00:55.499
I'm doing this so I can compare the front view and  side view directly side by side. I'll just drag the 
side view image into the front view's canvas,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.366
and I'll trim the side view, just using my marquee and hitting delete to get rid of that. I'll crop the 
image, just to the width of the two 

00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:07.599
reference photos. And I'm going to make sure that my rulers are on - so, View menu &gt; Rulers

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:14.066
Once I have the rulers turned on, I can drag down from the rulers, to create a bunch of 
guidelines,

00:01:14.066 --> 00:01:20.599
to match up my front and my side views. What I'm looking for, are distinctive points points on the 
front view, 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:28.100
like the edge of the clavicle, or the nipple, that ALSO show up in the corresponding side view 
(the underwear here is a good point)

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:35.600
that I can compare the two references, to make sure that they're lined up. Now the lower leg will 
not line up, 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:43.000
we won't be able to do anything below the knee, don't worry about it. Generally we'll see that 
there are mismatches between the two views, 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:49.733
so I'll use my Edit &gt; Transform tools, Ike Scale and Rotate, to make changes to the side view.

00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:56.566
Our front view is our dominant reference, we want our side view to match our front view, but not vice versa.

00:01:56.566 --> 00:02:01.199
Once I'm done adjusting, I'll save it, and then I'll Crop my image,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.333
to highlight either the front or the side view. Right here I'll crop the front view,

00:02:05.333 --> 00:02:07.833
and I'll Save As that as its own image.

00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:15.733
Then I can use my History menu (on the right here) to step back to the uncropped version, and I can Save As the side view.

00:02:15.733 --> 00:02:22.866
I want to save at as high a resolution as possible and I'll use JPG to reduce file size. Then I'll jump into Maya

00:02:22.866 --> 00:02:28.932
Importing our Image Planes into Maya is pretty easy, we just have to click this Import Image Plane button

00:02:28.933 --> 00:02:36.999
and assign the correct photo reference to the corresponding view, so the front view gets the front reference. I'll click the button again for the 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.066
side view, to bring in the side view reference. I'll just double check placement - I create a plane, and I'll use it the same way I use 

00:02:45.066 --> 00:02:50.466
those guide rulers in Photoshop. I just want to make sure that my image points match up.

00:02:50.466 --> 00:02:56.932
I'm not to making changes to my image planes in Maya. But if I see a mismatch, I know to double check my files

00:02:56.933 --> 00:03:05.966
if I mis-saved or if Maya scaled it. And when I do this, I see that my front view is rotated a little bit. This is not uncommon, our model will move 

00:03:05.966 --> 00:03:13.966
or the photo is a little bit off center. We just want to double check, to make changes if we need to. When I do make a change to the front view,

00:03:13.966 --> 00:03:20.266
I'll double check to make sure the side view still lines up. And then I can just delete the Image Plane in Maya,

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:26.632
re-import the new Image Plane, and now my Image Planes are set, and I'm almost ready to begin modeling.

00:03:26.633 --> 00:03:34.999
I need to push the Image Planes away from the center line, otherwise they will overlap my models when I'm trying to model on top of them.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.533
Ok - one last step. Click the Image Plane to select it, and hit CTRL+A to open the Attribute Editor.

00:03:41.533 --> 00:03:50.899
At the very top, I'll select 'Looking through Camera', so I'm only seeing the Image Plane in my orthographic cameras, and not in my perspective.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.200
Now my Image Planes are ready to go. I can begin the character modeling process, and you can watch the video 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.100
where I use these Image Planes to create this character here.
