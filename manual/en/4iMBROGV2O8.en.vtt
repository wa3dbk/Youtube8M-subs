00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.000
Today, I'm bringing you a 2008 calassic

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.000
made by Dion (Paperbat) and me

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.960
I made some of the levels

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:11.500
and Will Ryan as the announcer

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.000
and Dr. Robotnik as the other announcer

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.300
'City Streets'. We've got all the latest levels in this game even those from back in the day.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.730
Now, if you gonna watch this video, I suggest you go play the game first

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:27.149
Because the video will just ruin most of the levels for you so go

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.400
go play this, it's in the description

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.289
'cause I'm a master, I know where every tank is.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.500
You gotta find a 'Newgrounds' tank in every level.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:41.300
Where... Where the fuck is it? I think I made this level too.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.000
Okay.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.339
So Dion, he did like the programming,
 he did pretty much all the work and I just came up with some of the levels

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.200
Like this one I came with this one. Oh.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.849
You can tell which ones Dion made 'cause it's like about ballerinas and stuff

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.599
Stuff that I wouldn't know about, you know, for my lifestyle.

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.420
We took both of our lifestyles pretty much and we put them into one game

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.429
Like this one.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:07.979
This one would be from my lifestyle

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.400
you know, 'Smash Bros Brawl'.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.520
This one is from Dion's, 'cause all he does is look at maps.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.000
This one is from... Huh...

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.020
Mine, 'cause I built a mall.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.850
This one is from Dion's 'cuz he lives on an island

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.760
This one is my DVD collection.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.600
This one is Dion. He's the horse on the left [Cough].

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:33.089
Now this is the important tank search technique, classic technique. If you can't find it...

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.349
... just start clicking like a fucking madman.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.900
[Screams] AH!

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.480
That scares the shit out of me when you actually find it that way.

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:50.000
Alright, huh... Same strategy, I don't know where it is.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:06.900
[Intense Clicking sounds]

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.900
[Whispers] 'the hell is it

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.500
[Intense Clicking sounds]

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.900
[Whispers] Where the hell is it, come on.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:13.900
[Screams] AH!

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.300
Will Ryan: Level 40! -

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.240
Shut the hell up, Will Ryan.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.900
Dion has the worst taste in movies

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.859
He's got his favorite movies in this game 'Never Back Down' and 'Fast And Furious: Tokyo Drift'

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.960
Here's one of my favorite films 'Chinatown'.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.050
You can see, uhh, Jack Nicholson.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.000
Huh, I don't think this is actually from the movie.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.000
[Clears his throat]

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.529
Where is... Where's the tank?

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:46.300
Just take the concentration that goes into this.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.540
Especially when you have the music off.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.900
This is... This is perfect if we'd just put a screamer in here

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.700
Scare the shit out of you.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.600
Like it's just the big ass picture of like a squirrel and this loud ass sound effect:

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.000
[Unintelligible sound]

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.869
Just like it'd be so perfect. This would be so scary.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.000
Yeah, I ain't gonna do it, ain't gonna.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.320
Classic tank search strategy

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:14.489
just go to the walkthrough and...

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:16.500
Cheat every level.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.289
Of course I knew it was there... Who didn't know.

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.000
WIll Ryan: Save successful!

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Oh yeah.

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.160
Dion came up with the names for the levels, okay?

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.779
This isn't 'Happy Feet'.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.309
This is the testament to Dion's-no-knowledge

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.369
on movies, cuz this is not 'Happy Feet'

00:03:35.369 --> 00:03:37.120
I'm pissed... Where is the t...

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.800
How am I gonna find it in this fucking thing-

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.500
Like Mike? Well when you're right you're Mike.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:46.300
Okay I gotta change my opinion. This man is a film connoisseur of sorts.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.800
CJ from San Andreas

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:51.000
They thought of everything with this game. G-Oh

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Huh oh.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.760
What is this?

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:59.980
Oh God, oh, God you only have 60 seconds to find the... to find the thing!

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.120
Where is it?

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:09.350
Where the hell is it? Where is the tank?

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:10.980
Somebody where is the tank!

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.800
Yell it out to me! Like 'Blue's Clues'

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:18.900
But even... Even more entertaining than that show though.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Where is it?

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.489
This is... Where is it!?

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.909
This is like my favorite movie 'Inception' and the climactic scene

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:33.100
Argh!

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.100
Where is it!?

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.500
I gotta get my kids back for beating this tank search game...

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.200
... otherwise I die in limbos.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:45.800
Where is it.

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:49.100
Ugh!

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.500
It's on to the left of the countdown timer.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.920
Why didn't I think of that!

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:54.730
[Screams]

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:00.960
I won!

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.500
Whoa!

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.540
You won in...

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:06.549
Oh, can you say speedrun?
