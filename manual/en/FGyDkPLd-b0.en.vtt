Hi, I'm David Hunter with Expert Village.
Today we're going to be talking about fireworks,

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:10.900
the different types and safety tips. Now we're
going to move up just a little bit more in

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.810
your line of fireworks to what we call the
multi items. A multi item or cake as we call

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:24.800
them, consist of commits, mimes, spinners,
colors, smoke, all traditional things you

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.850
find in your celebration needs for your display.
This particular item is from Black Cat, it

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.300
would run in detail anywhere from about 15.95
to 22.95 depending on your distributor, your

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:43.139
dealer, your store, always shop around for
the right prices, and check prices. Make sure

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:48.050
you check 2 or 3 locations before you actually
buy. One of the reasons why we know this is

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.219
a newer item is because of the new safety
fuses. The new safety fuses that come with

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:57.960
this is usually yellow in color and many of
them glow after dark to where you can see

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.609
them. This helps you to identify that the
item has a fuse on the side when lighting

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.869
in the dark, that'll way you don't have to
stumble with the flashlight or something like

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:14.039
that. But this item here what you simply do
is you take it and peel away the cap and it

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:20.859
peels right off and there is your fuse. What
you need to do is we've checked, there's no

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:25.380
power lines above us, we have moved to the
backyard because where we were shooting our

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.260
fireworks from before in the driveway, we
need a little bit more space between us and

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:35.229
the houses and the cars and of course our
people watching the fireworks. So we've chosen

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:42.111
the backyard, we've found a board to set this
on. Simply because you don't want to set the

00:01:42.111 --> 00:01:49.109
item on the grass because you can see here,
if you set it on the grass, it's real easy

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:54.140
to tumble back and forth and of course when
the first shot comes out, it will tip over.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.030
That's one of the do's and don'ts that you
don't want to do because this item then when

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:02.079
it tips over, it's going to shoot in a direction
usually you don't want it to shoot in. That's

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.049
the very simple reason you want to take it
and put it on a good flat surface like concrete

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:11.370
or a board and that'll way you push down on
it, make it doesn't rock back and forth very

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:17.940
easy. Once you established that, and all people
are away from your area, you take your puck

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:50.019
stick, hold it down, light your fuse and get
away.

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.400
Another thing that you might want to make
sure is even though you think all the cylinders

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:01.620
have fired; always approach this firework
with extreme caution. Never ever whether it's

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:07.470
lit or not, stand over a firework. Always
go up to the side of the firework, turn your

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:13.010
body away from it, and you're sure that they
went off, take your foot, tilt the item over

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.219
away from you and away from your spectators.
