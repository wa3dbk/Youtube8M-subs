00:00:00.264 --> 00:00:03.231
-I'm here with Babe a Fett
and Hurt Lockher

00:00:03.231 --> 00:00:06.000
at the Doll Factory
in Los Angeles.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.165
They're gonna show me
how to skate the bank track.

00:00:09.165 --> 00:00:10.627
-Yeah.
-True story.

00:00:10.627 --> 00:00:12.132
-[ Chuckles ]

00:00:12.132 --> 00:00:13.561
-Okay, so, our first thing
is derby stance.

00:00:13.561 --> 00:00:15.297
-Uh-oh.
-You need to be able to slow

00:00:15.297 --> 00:00:17.759
down, okay, or speed up.
Either one.

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:19.495
'Cause you don't want to be next
to her, believe me.

00:00:19.495 --> 00:00:22.132
So the first stop we'll learn
is a "T" stop.

00:00:22.132 --> 00:00:24.330
You're gonna make a "T"
with your feet,

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.462
and you're gonna slide
your right foot

00:00:26.462 --> 00:00:28.759
and make that noise
that makes you also stop.

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.594
So you want to make it
as loud as you can.

00:00:31.594 --> 00:00:33.561
Let's get up on the bank
to do a snow plow.

00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:35.528
We'll go forward
in derby stance.

00:00:35.528 --> 00:00:37.363
Basically, you're gonna get
your feet really, really wide.

00:00:37.363 --> 00:00:39.660
You're gonna slide both feet,
or one, however you prefer,

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.264
to use them
in front of you to stop.

00:00:42.264 --> 00:00:45.066
So if you go forward...

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.165
Not so perfect.
-Not quite.

00:00:47.165 --> 00:00:48.462
-Keep your head up.

00:00:48.462 --> 00:00:50.132
-Better!

00:00:50.132 --> 00:00:52.165
You're gonna hit Babe.
This is the more fun part.

00:00:52.165 --> 00:00:53.594
-Okay.

00:00:53.594 --> 00:00:56.231
Not even. That was so weak.
It was so bad.

00:00:56.231 --> 00:00:58.759
-Beautiful.
-[ Laughs ]

00:00:58.759 --> 00:01:01.495
-We're gonna skate for speed.
How does that sound?

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:02.759
-That sounds good.
-Ready?

00:01:02.759 --> 00:01:04.759
-Yep.
-Set...go.

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:07.033
-Oh, God!

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:08.594
-Take up -- get the high.

00:01:08.594 --> 00:01:11.231
And then cut down low.

00:01:11.231 --> 00:01:14.726
Nice!
Look at her with the step-over.

00:01:14.726 --> 00:01:16.627
That's impressive.

00:01:16.627 --> 00:01:19.726
Now I'm gonna hit you as hard
as -- No, I'm just kidding.

00:01:19.726 --> 00:01:22.396
Transitions are the most fun
to watch, so let's do it.

00:01:22.396 --> 00:01:24.099
-Especially 'cause you fall
all the time.

00:01:24.099 --> 00:01:26.198
-So give it a shot.
-All right.

00:01:26.198 --> 00:01:29.000
-Yes!
-Almost.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.693
-Ahh!

00:01:30.693 --> 00:01:34.759
-That's better
than my first year of skating.

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:37.099
-Ooh!
-Yes!

00:01:37.099 --> 00:01:39.165
Stay up!
-Almost!

00:01:44.231 --> 00:01:48.495
Ohh!

00:01:48.495 --> 00:01:50.231
And there we go.

00:01:50.231 --> 00:01:51.594

00:01:51.594 --> 00:01:54.693
I'm Erin Cantelo,
and this is "SubCultures."
