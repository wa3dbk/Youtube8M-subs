00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.420
One of them old dock fish didn't we?

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:12.300
Not a very big one.

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:19.680
It's actually at the end of the stall rather
than outside corners.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.320
I'd rather catch them on the outside corners
but every now and then they sneak up inside

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.970
them stalls too.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:43.920
You know, one thing a lot of people try to
avoid my opinion is the cable systems that

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.629
you have around these docks whether it's cables
that are tied to the bank to the dock to the

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:54.399
bank or the cables that are basically keeping
the dock in place it's unbelievable how much

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.609
activity goes on around those cables.

00:00:56.609 --> 00:01:02.489
Fish will suspend because as those cables
get older they get plankton and algae on them.

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.570
The baitfish come up and feed on them and
the bass just suspend right behind them.

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.560
A bass, they can get behind a cable and they
feel like they are hiding from you.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.580
So I mean anytime you get around dock systems,
don't just through what the cables you can

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:21.090
see visible up front but if they got tie down
cables it's a great place to fish a jerk bait

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.550
especially in the spring when the fish are
suspended; when they are just starting to

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:35.509
move up and then when they start guarding
fry it's a good time to get after it again.

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:41.549
Little bitty one...

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:53.640
Little bitty guy...
