00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:11.360
I'm the Head Physiotherapist for the Leeds
Rhinos, so my job is to look after the Rhinos

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.940
side of things in the Physiotherapy Department.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.119
So that's sort of assessing, treating and
rehabbing up all the injured players.I initially

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:24.160
got a post upon qualifying as the assistant
physiotherapist, then I was promoted last

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.140
Autumn to the head post.

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.390
So it's a really good place to work and I'm
really enjoying it.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.240
I originally applied to study physiotherapy
when i was 18, so when I was ay Sixth Form,

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:35.550
and got no offers of any courses.

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.320
So I ended up doing another degree up at another
university not too far from here, and then

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.960
off the back of that I then reapplied to do
physiotherapy and it was Bradford I chose

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.030
to study at.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.060
Probably the main reason at the time that
I went to study was that they had the highest

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:55.449
employment rate for physiotherapy in the north
of England, which was a pretty big draw for

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:57.239
me.

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.980
Physiotherapy is a really hard profession
to get into in the first place, and obviously

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.540
upon qualifying it's probably even more difficult
to get a post so that was probably the big

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.920
turn for me really.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.600
As part of the physiotherapy degree at Bradford
we do an elective placement, which I'm sure

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.250
they still do now.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.360
And actually got the opportunity to come down
here and work with the physios then at the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.630
time.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.880
And upon that placement I actually got asked
to come back, so we did a 3 week elective

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.700
placement, then the guys down here asked me
to come back on a volunteer basis really but

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:33.280
working with the first team, and it sort of
snowballed from there really.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:38.840
Over the next year at uni, in my third year,
I was probably getting more and more input

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.820
and more and more exposure to this environment
and then towards the back end of my third

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:48.100
year I got offered the post of the assistant
first team physio.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.270
All the skills that I learned during my studies
at Bradford put me in really good stead to

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.670
start working here and ultimately the skills
that I had learned during my undergraduate

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.960
study obviously were enough to impress the
guys at the time when I was down here on the

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.060
elective placement which ultimately got me
a job offer.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:10.950
So all the assessment, all the treatment stuff
and how to rehab-up a person regardless of

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:15.590
what sort of setting obviously stood me in
really good stead to come down on that placement.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.040
The practical element of the degree was really
good.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.010
I know at Bradford we did a massage module
which I felt was really really good and really

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:29.160
good to get hands-on treatment early in the
first year of the course which I know some

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:34.290
universities don't do And in my experience
of now having students come on placement with

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:42.299
us, I think that skills set often puts them
way above students from other universities-

00:02:42.299 --> 00:02:48.530
having that hands-on knowledge and approach
to treatment.I know that a lot of the tutors

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.689
there still do work in a lot of different
clinical environments and I thought that was

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:56.090
real helpful.

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:00.549
In particular Hillary Pape, who I know worked
within rugby league, and obviously I used

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.170
to ask her quite a lot of questions and my
background itself, growing up and supporting

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:11.140
sport is predominantly in rugby league, So
a lot of her case studies, for me personally,

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.200
were in rugby league.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.879
So that probably was highly appropriate for
myself and highly appropriate for this sort

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:18.269
of job really.

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:21.730
For me, people should consider studying at
the University of Bradford.

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:29.280
They've got great academic support and great
teaching staff who in their respective fields

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.920
have worked at some great places and they
want to pass their knowledge on to students.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.709
I'm really happy with where I am at the minute,
it's probably my dream job.

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.329
I've grown up supporting rugby league, I'm
a Leeds lad through-and-through so obviously

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:48.980
to be working and be the Head Physio at the
sports club and the sports team that I support

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.310
is unreal really.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.150
I've not really thought long-term where I'd
like to get to but ultimately where I am now

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.609
I'm more than happy and I can see myself being
here for a few years to come.
