00:00:01.412 --> 00:00:04.662
(relaxing piano music)

00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:07.736
- [Voiceover] Welcome to the
Dinosaur Discovery Museum.

00:00:07.736 --> 00:00:10.146
The only museum to focus exclusively

00:00:10.146 --> 00:00:12.065
on the transition from extinct

00:00:12.065 --> 00:00:15.796
meat eating dinosaurs to modern birds.

00:00:15.796 --> 00:00:17.893
In a design originated by
Carthage College Professor

00:00:17.893 --> 00:00:21.206
of Paleontology, Dr. Thomas Carr,

00:00:21.206 --> 00:00:23.839
the museum exhibits one
of the most complete

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.607
evolutionary transitions
known from the fossil record.

00:00:27.607 --> 00:00:31.130
Opened in 2006, museum tours
and educational programs

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.256
are overseen by the museum's
curator of education.

00:00:34.256 --> 00:00:37.589
- Hello and welcome. I'm Chris DeSantis.

00:00:38.608 --> 00:00:41.096
In addition to the original
vision of the museum,

00:00:41.096 --> 00:00:42.864
we have put a lot of time and effort

00:00:42.864 --> 00:00:44.795
into presenting these displays to you,

00:00:44.795 --> 00:00:46.071
before you begin your visit,

00:00:46.071 --> 00:00:48.644
please take a few minutes
and watch this short film.

00:00:48.644 --> 00:00:50.110
It will give you a brief overview

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.642
of what you're about to see

00:00:51.642 --> 00:00:53.216
and hopefully give you
a better understanding

00:00:53.216 --> 00:00:56.748
of this unique and exciting gallery.

00:00:56.748 --> 00:00:59.915
(upbeat guitar music)

00:01:11.246 --> 00:01:12.568
I should mention that there are two

00:01:12.568 --> 00:01:14.367
additional short films for you to enjoy.

00:01:14.367 --> 00:01:16.312
One with some very interesting facts

00:01:16.312 --> 00:01:18.652
about the science of paleontology

00:01:18.652 --> 00:01:20.677
and another about Dr. Carr's search

00:01:20.677 --> 00:01:23.677
for the remains of a juvenile T-rex.

00:01:26.996 --> 00:01:29.702
Enjoy the films and then
explore the fossil record

00:01:29.702 --> 00:01:31.042
on display in our gallery.

00:01:31.042 --> 00:01:35.956
We'd be happy to answer
any questions you may have.

00:01:35.956 --> 00:01:39.708
(upbeat guitar music)

00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:41.288
- [Voiceover] When you enter the gallery,

00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:42.945
be sure to turn to your left,

00:01:42.945 --> 00:01:46.017
and proceed clockwise around the room.

00:01:46.017 --> 00:01:48.152
The geological record shows that dinosaurs

00:01:48.152 --> 00:01:52.798
first evolved some time
before 228 million years ago

00:01:52.798 --> 00:01:56.421
and while we know your visit
here will be much shorter,

00:01:56.421 --> 00:01:58.244
please take as much time as you need

00:01:58.244 --> 00:02:01.052
and look closely at the displays.

00:02:01.052 --> 00:02:03.951
You are sure to notice
some interesting things.

00:02:03.951 --> 00:02:07.304
The first might be the color of the bones.

00:02:07.304 --> 00:02:10.214
- [Voiceover] The dinosaurs
in this gallery are casts

00:02:10.214 --> 00:02:12.983
of original fossils which are held in

00:02:12.983 --> 00:02:14.841
museum collections in
various parts of the world.

00:02:14.841 --> 00:02:16.653
After fossils are prepared in the lab,

00:02:16.653 --> 00:02:18.524
casts, or copies of these fossils,

00:02:18.524 --> 00:02:20.528
are then made so that the specimens

00:02:20.528 --> 00:02:23.138
can be displayed in other museums.

00:02:23.138 --> 00:02:24.773
The casts of original fossils

00:02:24.773 --> 00:02:26.722
are painted to match the color of the bone

00:02:26.722 --> 00:02:30.214
which is often a light shade of brown.

00:02:30.214 --> 00:02:32.236
The black ones indicate
the bones that were missing

00:02:32.236 --> 00:02:34.547
from the original
skeleton and were sculpted

00:02:34.547 --> 00:02:36.880
to fill in the empty spaces.

00:02:38.276 --> 00:02:39.653
- [Voiceover] As you explore the gallery,

00:02:39.653 --> 00:02:41.218
you will notice that many of the dinosaurs

00:02:41.218 --> 00:02:42.967
are posed in unique ways.

00:02:42.967 --> 00:02:45.591
Although it is rare to see
behavior in the fossil record,

00:02:45.591 --> 00:02:47.660
the dinosaurs were posed this way

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.170
to suggest daily activities
and in some cases,

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.332
to show possible behavioral similarities

00:02:53.332 --> 00:02:54.761
between these extinct

00:02:54.761 --> 00:02:58.501
meat eating dinosaurs and modern birds.

00:02:58.501 --> 00:02:59.978
This Torvosaurus, for instance,

00:02:59.978 --> 00:03:01.819
is in an eating pose.

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:03.515
The animal is holding down its prey,

00:03:03.515 --> 00:03:05.191
turning its head to the side,

00:03:05.191 --> 00:03:08.384
and ripping the flesh with
its long, pointed teeth.

00:03:08.384 --> 00:03:10.392
If you saw an eagle or a hawk eating,

00:03:10.392 --> 00:03:12.153
they would assume the same pose,

00:03:12.153 --> 00:03:14.172
one foot holding their prey as they

00:03:14.172 --> 00:03:16.755
rip the flesh with their beaks.

00:03:18.054 --> 00:03:20.625
This Allosaurus is seen in a resting pose,

00:03:20.625 --> 00:03:22.948
arms tucked back, and
resting on its chest,

00:03:22.948 --> 00:03:25.781
much like any large bird would do.

00:03:26.622 --> 00:03:30.071
A hundred and twenty
three million years ago,

00:03:30.071 --> 00:03:32.791
Sinosauropteryx was the first non-avian or

00:03:32.791 --> 00:03:36.148
non flying dinosaur to have feathers.

00:03:36.148 --> 00:03:38.353
Feathers probably developed
first for insulaton

00:03:38.353 --> 00:03:41.157
rather than flight, the
feathers of this Sinosauropteryx

00:03:41.157 --> 00:03:45.324
are clearly preserved as
dark fringe around its body.

00:03:46.273 --> 00:03:48.748
This detail panel mount of a Caudipteryx

00:03:48.748 --> 00:03:51.488
has large feathers on the hand and tail,

00:03:51.488 --> 00:03:55.969
which probably evolved for
display and sheltering eggs.

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:57.754
In the stomach of the Caudipteryx,

00:03:57.754 --> 00:04:00.493
you can see small pebbles and stones.

00:04:00.493 --> 00:04:02.887
Some dinosaurs, like some modern birds,

00:04:02.887 --> 00:04:04.772
swallow these stones to help them

00:04:04.772 --> 00:04:07.461
break up and digest food.

00:04:07.461 --> 00:04:09.987
While this does not
indicate a common ancestry

00:04:09.987 --> 00:04:12.693
between birds and dinosaurs,
it is an interesting

00:04:12.693 --> 00:04:15.360
example of convergent evolution.

00:04:16.742 --> 00:04:18.309
You can see that the dinosaurs are looking

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:20.784
more like modern birds.

00:04:20.784 --> 00:04:23.408
The skeleton of this Caenagnathoid

00:04:23.408 --> 00:04:25.748
is posed to show the predatory
stroke of the forelimb

00:04:25.748 --> 00:04:28.175
of these types of dinosaurs.

00:04:28.175 --> 00:04:30.919
Eventually, flying theropods co-opted this

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:34.152
motion into the flight stroke.

00:04:34.152 --> 00:04:37.193
In this Caenagnathoid
specimen, you could see

00:04:37.193 --> 00:04:40.247
many inherited conditions
that advanced theropods share.

00:04:40.247 --> 00:04:42.978
Additionally, this animal laid large eggs

00:04:42.978 --> 00:04:46.145
and sat on those eggs on an open nest.

00:04:47.696 --> 00:04:49.927
As you round the final
corner of the main room,

00:04:49.927 --> 00:04:53.633
you will find several modern
bird skeletons on display.

00:04:53.633 --> 00:04:55.609
You are encouraged to
compare these skeletons

00:04:55.609 --> 00:04:58.743
with the dinosaurs, noticing
the arm similarities,

00:04:58.743 --> 00:05:02.129
the hands and feet, the
way they ate and walked

00:05:02.129 --> 00:05:05.156
and rested, what do you see?

00:05:05.156 --> 00:05:07.489
Does T. rex have a wishbone?

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.194
- [Voiceover] The
Dinosaur Discovery Museum

00:05:11.194 --> 00:05:13.630
is also home to the lab
for the Carthage College

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:16.267
Institute for Paleontology.

00:05:16.267 --> 00:05:17.609
Carthage students participate in

00:05:17.609 --> 00:05:20.577
paleontological digs,
spending weeks in the field

00:05:20.577 --> 00:05:22.786
looking for fossils.

00:05:22.786 --> 00:05:26.436
This lab is where they bring
the specimens they extract.

00:05:26.436 --> 00:05:27.915
Many different species of dinosaur

00:05:27.915 --> 00:05:30.005
have been collected by the field school

00:05:30.005 --> 00:05:33.711
including fossils of
Triceratops, Hadrosaurids

00:05:33.711 --> 00:05:35.544
and Tyrannosaurus rex.

00:05:37.322 --> 00:05:39.231
- [Voiceover] The displays here at the

00:05:39.231 --> 00:05:40.369
Dinosaur Discovery Museum
traced the evolutionary

00:05:40.369 --> 00:05:44.387
path over millions of years,
relying on one of the most

00:05:44.387 --> 00:05:46.540
complete evolutionary transitions

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:49.113
known from the fossil record.

00:05:49.113 --> 00:05:52.469
It truly is a one-of-a-kind
museum experience.

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:54.347
- [Voiceover] We hope that
this film has been helpful

00:05:54.347 --> 00:05:56.987
in highlighting some of the
key features of the museum.

00:05:56.987 --> 00:05:59.384
We invite you to fully explore the museum

00:05:59.384 --> 00:06:02.301
and come back as often as you like.

00:06:03.703 --> 00:06:06.953
