00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.480
Hello everybody :)

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:04.020
today we are going to make

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:07.860
this little rabbit

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.560
we can give him a carrot

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:14.120
so it was not boring

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.140
Main dimensions are:

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.660
back - 10 cm

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.480
legs - 6 cm

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:31.200
We need one 260 balloon

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.620
and scrap of black for eyes

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:46.360
inflate eyes on about 4 cm

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.120
split in half

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.940
twist

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:07.020
tie

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:11.120
cut off the rest

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.480
stretch the 260 balloon

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:24.300
and inflate on 65 cm

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.320
(or leaving about 8 fingers margin)

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.300
tie closer to the nozzle

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.300
move the air

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.300
make small bubble

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.940
on about 3 cm

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:53.420
twist, fix

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.820
make back on 10 cm

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.680
squeeze well

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.560
and make second bubble on 12 cm

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.260
twist so

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.040
it will be cheeks

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:28.620
squeeze again

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.780
and here

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:36.520
squeeze the air completely

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.700
and then let in back

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.600
to make balloon thicker

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.040
so the nose will be wider

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.780
put the eyes in the middle

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:07.180
it is better to cut off tails

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.820
so they do not bother

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.620
press here

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.880
put finger here

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.020
and twist

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:35.800
make thread

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.820
and turn around the neck

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.800
so we've got a nose

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:47.840
here is narrowing

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.340
and here is thickening

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.020
make a leg on 6 cm

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.600
about the same size as a cheek

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.280
small bubble - pinch

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.780
second the same pinch

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.420
it's paws

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:35.260
make the same bubble on 6 cm

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:41.420
turn around the tail

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.500
make the same bubble

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.980
turn around paws

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.100
make the second front leg

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.900
and turn around the neck

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.500
correct these pinches

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:21.780
to lie paws flat

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.120
and the rest divide in half

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:38.220
at the end make tiny bubble

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:48.100
which move forward

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.900
twist

00:05:59.020 --> 00:06:02.760
we've got a Adam's apple

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.160
if we place it in front

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.840
then the head turns up

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.620
and if we move it back

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:18.740
then the head turns straight

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:25.620
take marker

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:31.600
and draw

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:37.000
the nose at this level

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:09.660
That's rabbit we've got :)

00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:11.900
Thank you for attention :)

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:14.900
Sergey Loginov  was with You :)

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:18.600
And bye-bye
