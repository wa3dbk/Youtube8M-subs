ANTHONY RAVITZ: I was always
passionate about how can we

00:00:06.118 --> 00:00:09.758
create an environment that
really supports people and

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.404
their well-being as well
as our planet.

00:00:12.399 --> 00:00:23.975

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.630
ANTHONY RAVITZ: The most
sustainable thing we can do

00:00:25.627 --> 00:00:27.437
from a resource perspective
is use something

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:28.403
that we already have.

00:00:28.401 --> 00:00:31.051
We have some buildings, and they
might not be spectacular

00:00:31.046 --> 00:00:33.446
buildings, but how can we make
them great places for people

00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:34.861
and make them as efficient
as possible?

00:00:34.858 --> 00:00:38.698
When we demoed out the ceiling,
we found these really

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.750
actually beautiful wood beams,
and we were really

00:00:41.743 --> 00:00:42.503
surprised by that.

00:00:42.502 --> 00:00:46.032
And we said, how can we
make them a feature,

00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:46.874
a part of the building?

00:00:46.873 --> 00:00:50.123
It's not just a strategy to
create good air quality or to

00:00:50.116 --> 00:00:54.286
save money or save energy or
to create flexible space.

00:00:54.277 --> 00:00:56.337
How do you have integrated
strategies that provide you

00:00:56.333 --> 00:00:57.763
with all of those things?

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.410
Nature has been developing
these processes and these

00:01:00.404 --> 00:01:01.944
really miraculous and
beautiful ways of

00:01:01.941 --> 00:01:03.661
doing things over time.

00:01:03.658 --> 00:01:04.898
How can we think about
nature and

00:01:04.895 --> 00:01:07.535
replicating nature's processes?

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.370
LEED stands for Leadership in
Energy and Environmental

00:01:10.364 --> 00:01:12.014
Design, and it's a
green building

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.210
certification program.

00:01:13.208 --> 00:01:16.518
We build almost all of our new
space to a minimum of LEED

00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:19.186
Gold, and in some cases, we've
exceeded that and achieved

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.675
LEED Platinum.

00:01:19.674 --> 00:01:22.034
And there are certain areas of
LEED, for example, with our

00:01:22.029 --> 00:01:26.299
materials selection, where we
go pretty far beyond LEED.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.720
This is an all-natural wool,
felted wool carpet that

00:01:31.709 --> 00:01:34.239
doesn't contain any toxic
materials on it.

00:01:34.234 --> 00:01:38.164
Every single product we buy, we
send a questionnaire to the

00:01:38.156 --> 00:01:39.476
manufacturer and ask
the manufacturer

00:01:39.473 --> 00:01:41.223
what's in this product.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:42.919
We think a lot about
energy and water.

00:01:42.916 --> 00:01:45.376
The building we were in that's
the new home for the Real

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:47.461
Estate &amp; Workplace Services
Team, we actually dual-plumbed

00:01:47.456 --> 00:01:50.246
the building so that we'll flush
all the toilets with

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.470
recycled municipal water.

00:01:52.466 --> 00:01:55.956
In all our buildings, we use
really efficient fixtures.

00:01:55.948 --> 00:01:58.918
Even shower heads, we have a lot
of showers here at Google.

00:01:58.912 --> 00:02:01.002
And we found two shower heads
that everyone seemed to really

00:02:00.998 --> 00:02:03.528
like that only use a gallon
and a half per minute.

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:07.333
We're installing our first solar
hot water installation

00:02:07.325 --> 00:02:09.135
in the United States.

00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:10.421
This building was pretty dark.

00:02:10.418 --> 00:02:12.788
So we said, how can we bring
daylight to the building and

00:02:12.783 --> 00:02:14.423
make it a more pleasant place?

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.990
So we cut this huge skylight
into the building.

00:02:16.985 --> 00:02:19.875
We have one place where there
are a bunch of huge screens

00:02:19.868 --> 00:02:22.808
that show how much energy we're
using around campus,

00:02:22.802 --> 00:02:25.162
where you can see dashboards
for every building.

00:02:25.157 --> 00:02:28.344
I'm amazed that every day I get
to work on things that are

00:02:28.338 --> 00:02:29.041
so exciting.

00:02:29.039 --> 00:02:31.129
I just feel so fortunate
to be a part of that.

00:02:31.125 --> 00:02:33.645
And I hope that with this
project, we can get better,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.600
and we can get smarter, and we
can do more, and we can build

00:02:35.596 --> 00:02:37.366
upon our success over time.

00:02:37.362 --> 00:02:40.032
I think the sky's the limit in
terms of what we can achieve.
