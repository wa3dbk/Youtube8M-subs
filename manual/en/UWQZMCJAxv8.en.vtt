Hey guys.

00:00:03.739 --> 00:00:12.820
This is my GoPro grip with internal tripod
that I built and showed you recently.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.160
I was using it the other day and I thought
of a modification that might be helpful to

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.430
you guys.

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.070
I usually use my phone with the gopro app
for a view finder when I'm setting up some

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:29.930
of these shots and with the grip and then
the phone you've got your hands full and I

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:34.370
said it would be great if you could attach
the phone on here somehow.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.020
So I figured out a pretty easy way to do that
so I'll show you real quick.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.550
I'm not going to go through the whole grip
build with you because I already did that

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.810
in a previous video.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.700
The tripod came from Monoprice.

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:55.040
This mini pocket tripod and I started thinking,
it has this cell phone cradle in it.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.850
And it turns out it's actually perfect.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.400
This is kind of a piece that I figured I wasn't
going to use but it actually works really

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.400
really well.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:10.710
What I did was I made a little bracket and
this gets sandwiched in between the tripod

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.460
adapter and the cap.

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:25.390
Just screw it on like normal with the plate
in the middle.

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:33.580
And then after that stick the grip on just
like in the regular build video.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:41.960
Tighten it down 
and then you've got a platform to mount this

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.670
on.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.090
It's got a 1/4-20 threaded insert down here.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.930
This is the only bolt that I had around.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:02:01.080
Gotta get a better looking one but it just
screws on here like that.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.150
And then you can attach your phone in the
cradle.

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.150
So you've got the GoPro on the front and the
phone in the rear so you can kind of use it

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.480
as a viewfinder.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.519
You have to recognize that the GoPro app has
a little bit of a lag but it's great for setting

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:22.760
up shots and keeping your hands free.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:30.550
It makes the whole rig a little bit top heavy
but it works.

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:37.319
It's not to top heavy that it doesn't function
correctly but you do need to be aware of it.

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.950
I have a second hole down here so you can
move the phone back if you want and that would

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:49.810
let you tilt the Gopro back to get upward
facing shots if you need it.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.279
Just a little bitty mod that might help you
out and let me know if you guys have got questions.

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:56.260
I appreciate you watching.
