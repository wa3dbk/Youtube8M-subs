00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.590
Oh time travel, it’s one of video gaming’s
best friends – a way to fill plot holes

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.230
and tighten loose ends.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.360
Traveling through time can tie together all
imaginable themes, while still making sense

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.120
of all kinds of things.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.380
You want sci-fi, with robots galore?

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:48.080
What about pirates or a Western?

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.250
And let’s not forget the dinosaurs.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.770
The foot clan, Shredder and Splinter, or how
about being crush flat?

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.739
Don’t worry, Turtles in Time has all of
that.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.511
But let me take you back in time to visit
the ghost of gaming’s past, back to the

00:01:01.511 --> 00:01:06.400
mystical year of our lord nineteen hundred
and ninety one – a year with great promise

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.400
for fun.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.619
The Super Nintendo Entertainment System had
just been released and had a lot to live up

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:14.210
to, no average beat’em up would do.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.320
The NES had some greats like Double Dragon
and Battletoads.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:21.670
Luckily a new title would deliver substance
by the busloads – a game about some teenagers

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.250
who happen to be mutants and ninjas... and
turtles I should add.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.740
This group of friends is still around even
today, proving they’re more than just a

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.740
fad.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:32.970
They're also all named after renaissance artists
so they say, but that’s a time travel trip

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.130
for another day.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.140
Turtles in Time begins as things go awry,
when Krang swoops in to steal the statue of

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.590
liberty from up high.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:54.110
Yes, Ledenardo I agree, a bloated bean bag
indeed.

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.280
It’s time to stop these villains and their
dastardly deeds.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.580
After choosing your desired turtle, you jump
right into the action and over many a hurtle.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:06.040
You’ll have to face off against plenty of
bosses like Bebop and Rocksteady, but don’t

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.420
worry, these ninja turtles were born ready.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.450
With a nun-chuck, sword slash, drop kick,
or bash with your shoulder, the combat is

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.930
still great fun even though I am now older.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.940
It’s intelligent and easy to learn but hard
to master.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:29.120
And, the combat looks great with fantastic
animations that might just bring you to laughter.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.620
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles in Time has familiar
characters and a fun vibe, which brings the

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:35.820
whole thing alive.

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:40.700
It’s an amazing 2D side-scroller beat’em
up, it’s a classic and, yes, you should

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:41.940
give a F%*k.

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.319
So go blow the dust off your Super Nintendo
Entertainment System, you really won’t want

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:59.069
to miss this one.
