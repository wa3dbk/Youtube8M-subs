Hi, my name is Madeline Franco, and we're
here to talk about birds. Specifically, we're

00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:09.380
going to talk about talking birds. This here,
is Floyd. He's a Rose-Breasted Cockatoo. They're

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:15.940
native to Australia, and Floyd is approximately
six years old. He can be quite a talker. Many

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.750
birds talk. Some don't. For those of us who
love them, it matters not whether they do,

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.590
or they don't. It doesn't change the amount
we love them. However, Floyd says a number

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.250
of things, and I'm hoping he'll say them today,
and I'm going to test that theory right now.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:39.870
Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss. Many people
are curious as to why birds talk, or how they

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.299
talk. They actually don't have a voice box
as we do. They have air sacs, and they're

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:51.369
able to talk by manipulating air, over and
through those air sacs. Why do they talk?

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:55.650
They talk for a couple of reasons. Generally,
they talk because they've heard something

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:01.460
that they like, and they enjoy replicating
sounds. Floyd says, as I said, a number of

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.500
things, and he also says what a cute bird,
what a cute Floyder. I don't know that he'll

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.220
go through that whole repertoire today, and
I would tend to doubt it, because the other

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:13.030
thing is, that birds don't always do what
you want them to do. They seem to exercise

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.610
a fair amount of free will, so if you ever
see someone performing with a bird, and the

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:22.270
bird is talking quite a bit, that means probably
that the bird is happy, and that the bird

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.660
is very well focused. It's very difficult
to get a bird to perform in front of an audience,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.670
that they're not familiar with. In fact, often,
it's difficult to get them to perform in front

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.180
of an audience at all, so appreciate those
people who train them, so that they can do

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.780
that. Floyd, and a lot of other birds, will
also talk a lot when I'm not paying much attention

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.630
to them. I have, and some of the best talkers,
are this little guy, again a Rose-Breasted

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:49.800
Cockatoo. Also, a number of the Amazons, and
I have a couple of Amazons, who will say hello,

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:57.090
and say it louder and louder, until I acknowledge
them. Birds have learned that we pay attention,

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.850
I guess, when they talk, and they do it for
that reason, so let's see if Floyd is going

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:09.190
to talk again. What a cute bird. Oh, he liked
that. You going to give me a kiss? Give me

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:20.170
a kiss. Give me a kiss. Give me a kiss. He
also makes the kissing noise, which is kind

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.840
of cute, but he does have a repertoire. I
think he's going to limit it today, because

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.230
he's trying to play hard to get. If you're
trying to teach a bird to talk, just remember

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.840
they're a lot like children. If you want them
to talk, you need to talk to them. A lot of

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.700
people say to me, my bird doesn't talk, and
they sound disappointed in that. Just speak

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.670
to your bird, and you'll find that like a
child, many of them will respond.
