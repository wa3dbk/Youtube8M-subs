00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.190
Chapter 1: The Elves

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:12.000
On the surface, Elves are of modest height
with agile bodies, big eyes, and elongated

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:19.260
ears. Underneath, they struggle with a long
and tireless history, smothered by ages of warfare.

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.820
While the first to walk Thedas, the
Elves have lost what place they have in the world.

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.840
Ages ago, the Elves ruled Thedas. Under the

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.039
empire of Elvenhan, with Arlathan as its capital,
the immortal Elves reigned across the span

00:00:39.039 --> 00:00:46.479
of today's Orlais and Ferelden. Its culture
was great and inspired, embedding itself gloriously

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:52.679
in the fruits of magic and knowledge.
But a long time ago, Humans migrated into the

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:59.670
continent from the northern islands. The new
tribes met the Elves with hostility, and in

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:07.829
their interactions, the Quickening came. Elves
reportedly lost their immortality, and quickly

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:14.630
distanced themselves from the invaders. But
as they fled, the Humans overtook their deserted

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:22.159
lands and conquered the Elves. If not slaughtered,
they were made slaves, and as humans learned

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:29.719
to wield the arcane force of magic, the Elves
were their first blood sacrifices. As the

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:36.770
Elves' time was lost, so was their pride,
culture, and way of life.

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:43.520
Only during the time of Andraste, the prophet
who openly condemned the tyranny of magic,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.630
did the Elven people gain a glimmer of hope
in reclaiming a part of their old lands: the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:57.310
Dales. Shartan, an Elven disciple of the prophet,
rallied slaves under Andraste's banner. Although

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.850
they were successful, winning the Dales was
a momentary victory, as years later the Chantry

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.670
sanctioned an Exalted March, a religious war
against the Elves that caused irreparable

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:16.080
horrors which would echo between Elven and
Human relations for ages to come.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:22.470
In the Dragon Age, little has changed since
war scattered the Elves across the lands.

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:28.400
On one side, the Dalish grasp at what knowledge
they can discover about the old Elven Empire

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:35.400
lost so many years ago, in hopes of restoring
their culture back to its glorious roots.

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.210
On the other, the city Elves struggle to make
ends meet by dwindling in poverty. What was

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:52.620
once a proud people now languishes in obscurity.
The Dalish clans are overtly proud Elves who

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.790
continue to hold the old days of Arlathan
dear to their hearts. In recovering what was

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.400
lost, through artifacts and knowledge, the
Dalish seek to recover what was of the old

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:11.310
Elvhenan Empire. While united in cause, the
numerous Dalish clans are separated from each

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:19.040
other, traversing the land in an individually
nomadic lifestyle. The Keeper, who heads and

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:25.790
safeguards the clan, uses their leadership
and magical capability to keep the clan organized

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:32.790
and alive. The clan members protect themselves
and each other, through whatever means necessary.

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:40.470
While skilled in survival, often this leads
clans to be antagonistic and hostile towards

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:47.440
outsiders... and even other Dalish clans.
In continuing their isolation, they stand

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.860
indifferent to the plights of the Elves who
reside in the cities. While the Dalish are

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.020
revered by the city Elves, they hold very
little in common with their cousins. Unless

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:06.020
a greater threat beckons a fight, The Dalish
tend to their own and exist for themselves.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.920
Beyond the Dalish lie all other Elves, wasting
away commonly in cities and the slums called

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:20.900
alienages. Generally, Elven are perceived
as second-class citizens; while some take

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:28.060
up jobs as merchants and craftsmen, most struggle
and subsist in poverty. Most are at the whims

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:35.449
of the humans, in both society and government.
The city Elves have acclimated to human culture,

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:42.389
adapting the roles and religions while inadvertently
forgetting their own past.

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:48.740
The Elves of the Tevinter Imperium, the longest
existing country in Thedas, are allowed freedom

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:55.219
and given a higher status in the social strata
for their magical prowess; however, they still

00:04:55.219 --> 00:05:02.009
cannot escape the ties that bind from racial
scrutiny. As an Elf on Thedas, one never truly

00:05:02.009 --> 00:05:04.609
escapes racial prejudice.

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:19.800
Looking into the future, the Elves are once again caught in the fire. In Halamshiral,
the Elven rebellion was crushed by Orlesian

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:27.219
forces and later dragged about in the heat
of the Civil War. The Elves in Ferelden are

00:05:27.219 --> 00:05:33.310
still trapped in complacency for their country
that was nearly burned by the Darkspawn. While

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:38.909
key players may break the chains that bind
the Elves into a subset class, others may

00:05:38.909 --> 00:05:45.439
pave the way for the Elves reclaiming their
own place in society. Heroes may stand at

00:05:45.439 --> 00:05:52.289
the precipice of change, and tear at reality
to build a new world. Until then, the humans

00:05:52.289 --> 00:05:58.830
will continue to be authors of past and present.
Thedas is theirs now, and they command its

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:05.460
future, for better or worse. But that- is
a story for another day...
