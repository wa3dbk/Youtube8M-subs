00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:08.660
How to play double stops.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:14.570
Well, you basically play two notes at a time,
and whatever combination that is, is entirely

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:15.700
up to you.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:41.920
You can keep them close together, or further
apart, then combinations thereof.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:53.330
So, really, it's just a matter of using your
two fingers together or a thumb and a finger.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.519
Generally speaking, when you're going to be
playing you're going to be using your thumb

00:00:57.519 --> 00:00:59.320
and your second finger at the most.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.650
The first finger is going to drop in occasionally,
as needed.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:06.151
But when you're doing a lot of picking stuff,
if you've got a choice between the two, go

00:01:06.151 --> 00:01:07.460
for the second one.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.720
You've got a little bit more space to work
with.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.160
You're going to be less likely to get jammed
up because of the proximity of the first finger

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.160
and the thumb.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.300
But, I mean, with a ten-string instrument
you have limitless possibilities for double

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.880
stops, or really pretty much any kind of stops.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:27.270
So those are just some examples of what you
can do.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:35.970
Again, you can engage a pedal leading into
it as with E lower to kick things off.

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.810
It's always good with pedal steel to give
the impression that you're coming from somewhere

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.750
and going somewhere, too.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.490
You don't want to be just...

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.490
This is kind of static.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.090
It's a lot less interesting than... which
is reaching the same result but something

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:51.090
happened.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:08.600
You went from point A to point B, and that
applies to anything you're going to do.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.179
That's the kind of thing you want to be hearing.

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:16.990
You don't want to sound like you're just dragging
from one place to the next in sort of a rigid

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.990
way.

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:19.190
So, that's it for double stops.
