00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.750
over the weekend actor Paul Walker died
at forty in a tragic car accident in

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:06.190
southern california

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.870
he was in a 2005 Porsche Carrera GT
driven by one of his friends from his

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:13.000
racing team

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.300
actually had just finished up at a
charity event and unfortunately both of

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.150
them did I

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.560
in what is being called a high-speed car
accident now

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.420
obviously tragic and we're gonna get to
that but we do have to mention that

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:27.220
there has apparently been

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.619
at at point anonymous tip that implies
that there was at least one other car at

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:33.469
the scene

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:37.270
and investigators are looking into the
possibility that they were drag racing

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.829
at the time of the accident now

00:00:38.829 --> 00:00:43.030
at this point we are simply relying on
what is as I said an anonymous tip it

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.040
could very well

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.600
turn out to be and I imagine it will
turn out to be false but at this point

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.739
it is being looked into Los Angeles
County sheriff's sergeant richard cohen

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:52.210
says

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.289
naturally for it from an investigative
standpoint we need to find out if that

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:56.890
is one

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.579
up the issues what the tragic parts is
that Tyrese Gibson who is this coast are

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.000
from several others movies

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.060
went to the location of the accident I
believe earlier today

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:10.590
and that he was surrounded by a crowd of
probable fans

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.010
all videotaping as he teared up cried

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.810
at the site of the debt that one of his
friends he did post Instagram my heart

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.330
is hurting so bad no one can make me
believe

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.960
this is real now so as we said we'd we
don't know if drag racing

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.979
can really be implicated in this it's a
tragedy in any event

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.220
I do think in your probably gonna say
this in just a second

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.290
people to get involved in the personal
lives a celebrity is

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.270
too far too great an extent whether it's
their deaths or their weddings or

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.890
them going on vacation I am it is a
doubt that is a

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.860
let me comment on that so you know when
news broke over the weekend

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.659
I felt like I needed to tweet about it
or write about it because I work in news

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:53.659
and there should be some sort of comment
from someone who works in News

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:56.869
and I was like I don't I don't have
anything to say about this yes it's a

00:01:56.869 --> 00:01:57.750
tragedy

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.390
people die every day and and when it is
a celebrity everyone

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.100
it of course warns rightfully so but the
morn is though that person is more

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.939
important than

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.120
the hundreds of thousands of Americans
the die I you know not not just American

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.140
but hundreds of thousands of people to
die on a regular basis because it's

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.260
stupid things

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.650
right because the hunger how many people
die because the hunger so whenever

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.520
celebrity dies its a front page story

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.349
everyone constantly talking about it and
what I would want to focus on here

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:28.690
is is the drag racing angle we don't
know for sure

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.480
at this point whether or not it was due
to drag racing but there should be an

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.560
open discussion

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.220
about how there are movies that
glamorize drag racing and that kinda

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.590
stuff should not occur not only are they
putting their own lives at risk

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.760
when they're driving like that they're
putting innocent people in danger that

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.720
are just standing there may be there was
a bystander something like that

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.069
they couldn't get been hit by that car
here you know so it's

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.739
I would want to have a national
discussion about that and how

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.080
that's not cool thing to do I know
people love their race cars but you

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.730
gotta be responsible on the road

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.400
yeah I mean certainly there is an irony
them dying in a particular way

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.370
many between I saw were making jokes
about Leonardo DiCaprio thing up a boats

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.319
and things like that

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.629
I mean people will address the tragedy
in various ways sometimes people use

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.530
calmly as a defense mechanism I guess

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.280
and but yet look I don't know I don't
agree that we should ban movies

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.400
that that have dragged recent even
saying that no I thought that you

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.269
replied no I'm not even applied

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.629
that's ridiculous but the what I am
saying just very quickly

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:28.450
is you know there are certain people
that think it's totally okay to go drag

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.680
racing and there's like an underground

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.950
you know drag racing Bing are even know
you would call community

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.080
community exactly it and it's just it's
not cool you know you wanna go racing

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:42.970
it's totally fine just do it on a track
do it in a controlled environment

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:46.480
where people are not going to get hurt
or you know there will be an immediate

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.920
response by

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:51.409
by you know %um pure whatever it is as
long as you're in a controlled

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:51.909
environment

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:55.290
at that started that I made 30 want to
believe in you can have a larger

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:56.680
discussion about death right

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.000
we all want to believe that we're
invincible especially when you are

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.200
a young healthy celebrity you're on top
of the world you don't

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.260
you don't think about the day that you
could possibly die and we do reckless

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.060
things

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.750
so having a discussion about that i
think is is more helpful than

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.000
you know that discussing whether or not
the movie should continue

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.859
yeah yeah ok there's a set that they're
they're producing a seventh best

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:19.729
imperious

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.680
yes that was the one that he was working
on he has another independent movie

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.330
that's coming on the 19th I believe

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.220
and that's the time when I'm not working
country I but that is a fact if you are

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.790
interested involved
