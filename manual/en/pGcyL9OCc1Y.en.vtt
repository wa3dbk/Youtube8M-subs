What's up guys its Justin TheGCDoc out doing
some geocaching.

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:07.310
But first I want to thank you guys and everyone
who was involved with helping me with the

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.550
Michelin Geocaching Quest!

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:15.960
That's right the partnership between Michelin
USA and Geocaching.com I became a semi-finalists

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.780
and actually won the Grand prize which means
this fall the Wifey and I will be heading

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:20.780
to NYC!

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.240
I know some of my viewers were also finalists
so congrats to you all!

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:30.710
This was really close, neck-to-neck for a
while, but with all the support and help from

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.059
everyone I was able to pull ahead and land
about 635 likes on my photo.

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.929
Thanks again guys for all your support.

00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:45.749
We are super excited for this trip.Well I'm
out here over my lunch hour dropping off some

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.159
trackables that a couple of viewers sent my
way.

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:55.399
First for the geocaching trackables is actually
my geocoin, the Doctor Who geocoin.

00:00:55.399 --> 00:01:00.721
Geocaching youtuber GeoHakliva purchased 2
of these coins from me, one that I already

00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:07.390
shipped to her and the other one here that
I'm going to be dropping into this geocahe

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.740
and sending it on its way hopefully making
it to Winnipeg Canada!

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:16.930
Here's the second geocaching trackable, this
is a zombie and her name is Tiffany.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.530
If you know me I'm a big Walking Dead fan,
but this is going to be heading it's way down

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:28.229
to Indiana hopefully to be picked up by GeoHoosier
who is also a geocaching youtuber.

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:33.780
Go check out their channels as it's always
fun to see new people and see new areas of

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.920
the world for geocaching.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:43.210
And I just found the cache.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.880
This geocache is a Travel Bug Hotel so supposedly
there is to be some trackables in here and

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.530
I'm going to drop off the ones that I have
and then hopefully they get picked up by someone

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:53.892
and moved on towards their destinations.

00:01:53.892 --> 00:02:12.020
A little wooden hummingbird looks like it's
heading to Canada, so it could have a little

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.720
travel buddy with my geocoin here heading
to Hakliva.

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:22.130
And also a wooden Nickel, pretty neat.

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.750
If you haven't subscribed to my channel please
do, we do lots of geocaching adventures.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.000
how-to's, contests, and in the future I'm
going to be doing some tutorials so stay tuned

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
for that.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.020
Alright guys, don't do what I do wear a hat
and gloves as it's freezing cold.

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.080
Get out there and find some caches, stay safe
but cache on!
