00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.279
Hi folks hows it going welcome to another food fear with my virgin kitchen

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.720
and today it's frogs legs

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.480
 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.969
now I don't mind frogs legs I don't really have a fear of them it's more of a

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.859
visual thing I can taste it

00:00:17.859 --> 00:00:21.060
and enjoy it but it's more like the waist and leggy thing

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.390
so we're gonna get over that ok. so I
managed to get hold of 100 frozen frogs legs from

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.460
my local Chinese supermarkets the same one that got me the durian fruit in fact

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:33.470
let them thaw out and cooked them up in some butter with a bit of parsley

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:35.239
I did that just to give a teeny bit of flavour

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.410
don't want it too bland but just enough so that I would eat it

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.280
and my friends would ok it kinda
freaked me out at one point when it was cooking

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.400
because the legs were moving

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.140
not cool called I Phoebe to have a go but she wasn't keen

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.539
luckily she doesn't know who kermit the frog is what are you holding? frogs legs

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.170
are you excited to try one?.... no..... why?

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.530
I don't like the look of them they smell like nice stuff don't they

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.930
well they smell like

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.030
roasted chicken so if it smells like chicken why don't

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.479
you want to try one? I dont like the look of them

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.600
alright mate I can't convince you this time can I? No

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.270
maybe next time? yeah but my friends and I
tried and we were pretty chuffed with the taste

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.899
it's a little bit rubbery

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:26.490
like a cheap chicken breast from a cheap pub

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.759
i'll eat it protein good times

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:34.739
smells like chicken

00:01:34.739 --> 00:01:39.259
tastes like chicken it's no nandos tastes like chewy

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:42.910
chicken looks even worse now

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.520
now that i've eaten it tap dancing like a trooper

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.610
slightly fishy it's like a fishy chicken

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.099
yeah it's like a texture of chicken with a fishy tang

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:59.879
hmmm got any more?!

00:01:59.879 --> 00:02:03.940
frogs legs hmm fishy chicken it's nice there's no reason why anyone should go hungry

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.770
go down your local pond

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.860
have a frog that's the bit I don't like gooooaaal

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:15.970
looks like alien

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.239
when you've eaten them they get a bit tap dancy crazy legs

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:23.359
if you can get over the way it looks that's the main fear

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:27.819
it tastes good but let's see what my family think

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:32.500
there you go.... dinner is served

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:39.500
what you thinking? smell like chicken ...... smells like fishy chicken

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.030
what does it taste like?

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.650
nothing would you eat it again?

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.989
if it wasn't like this if it wasn't like an actual frog because that's the worst bit

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.620
that bit tasted gross

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:10.860
the first bit was really nice but that bit urghhh thankyou

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.360
refusing to do it why? because

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.530
I don't like the idea of it and I think i'd throw up

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:24.530
that's the fear though the taste is great I don't care it's the thought of it

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.780
.... then my Mum gave it a try and she freaks out when she's eating vegetables and

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.100
stuff so it was really good of her to have a go too

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.080
ooooh there you go

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:48.080
 

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.400
 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:09.670
 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.220
come on take a bite

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.530
it's chewy!!..... it's chewy

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:23.169
bland

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.680
chicken tastes alright though? not as bad as you thought?

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.790
no it's just the look of it

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:34.730
got a picture in my mind of this green kermit just reminds me of

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:40.919
a frog! I can't have anymore

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:44.639
yeah? looks like it's gonna walk off in a minute

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.110
 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.180
it's cheaper than chicken... not surprised it's catching them though isn't it

00:04:53.180 --> 00:05:00.180
ooh what's that green bit?
I just felt bad when she sent me a
text message  afterwards saying she had a

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:03.740
nightmare about a frog

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:05.570
whoops

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:09.420
on the whole frogs legs for me are in no way shape or form a food fear and I cooked them really

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:10.290
bland

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.770
so i'm excited to use them in future recipes remember if you've got a food fear for me, my

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:16.200
friends or family to try

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.670
let me know and perhaps I'll give it a
go if not

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:23.030
i'll see you again next time cheers for watching look it's the beach

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:26.460
I live by the beach there's Wales over their and stuff....right i'm going home

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:32.380
so my food fear question for you is definately frogs legs related

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:36.790
have you ever eaten an awesome frogs legs recipe I cooked them up pretty bland and I know you can do

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:38.000
like garlic and stuff

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:41.950
in some countries you eat it raw I know there
are some countries that do that you crazy

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:42.650
crazy people

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:46.610
but if you've ever eaten a really cool frogs legs recipe

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:50.870
and you want me to try it send it over and i'll check it out or I could always grab one of these seagulls in the background

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:51.440
crazy

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.960
and annoying things flying past and stuff.... hate seagulls

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.250
cheers for watching see you again
