"Gut Feelings: Probiotics 
and Mental Health"

00:00:06.743 --> 00:00:17.058
Before thorazine was invented in 1950, mental
 illness was often treated surgically.

00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:24.270
In fact, in 1949 the inventor of the lobotomy 
was awarded the Nobel Prize,

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:31.340
but before tens of thousands were lobotomized, colectomy was all the rage.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.660
There was this theory that
 bad bacteria in the gut,

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.915
intestinal putrefaction was
 the cause of mental illness,

00:00:37.915 --> 00:00:43.335
so the cure was to just
 surgically remove the colon.

00:00:43.335 --> 00:00:45.654
Yes, the surgery killed 
about one in three,

00:00:45.654 --> 00:00:49.835
but when they didn't die surgeons
 bragged that, for example,

00:00:49.835 --> 00:00:54.200
when he resected the colons of school
 children as a preventative measure,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.080
there was a cessation of abnormal 
sex practices, such as masturbation,

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:04.540
which was viewed at the time as a
 precursor for mental illness later in life

00:01:04.551 --> 00:01:09.496
There were others, though, 
that took less drastic approaches,

00:01:09.496 --> 00:01:11.960
suggesting one could instead 
treat this intestinal putrefaction

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.480
by changing the intestinal flora.

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:18.820
So over a century ago there were reports of 
successfully treating psychiatric illnesses

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:23.923
like depression with a dietary 
regimen that included probiotics.

00:01:23.923 --> 00:01:28.648
Doctors perceived a connection 
between depression and feces

00:01:28.648 --> 00:01:33.370
deficient in quantity and moisture 
and very offensive in odor.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.451
And so they gave people probiotics, and
not only did people feel better psychologically,

00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:40.780
but their feces increased 
in quantity, became softer,

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.130
more regular consistency, 
"and the offensive smell diminishes".

00:01:45.132 --> 00:01:51.900
Concurrent with the probiotics, however, 
all patients were started on a vegetarian diet,

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.000
so it may not have been
 the probiotics at all.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.620
This field of inquiry remained 
dormant for about a hundred years,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.600
but a new discipline has recently emerged known 
as entericâ€”meaning intestinal---neuroscience.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.630
Our enteric nervous system, 
the collection of nerves in our gut

00:02:10.632 --> 00:02:16.760
has been referred to as our "second brain (given) 
it's size, complexity, and similarity".

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.900
We've got so many nerves in our gut, 
as many as in our spinal cord.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.460
And it kinda makes sense.

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.770
The size and complexity of 
our gut brain is not surprising

00:02:27.773 --> 00:02:33.590
when considering the challenges posed by the 
interface with our largest body surface.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.500
We have a hundred times more 
contact with the outside world

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.290
through our gut
 than through our skin.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.300
And we also have to deal with our 
100 trillion little friends down there.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.680
It takes a lot of 
processing power.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.320
Now anyone who's gotten 
butterflies in their stomach

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:52.850
knows that our mental 
state can affect our gut.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.730
In fact, every day stressors can 
affect the integrity of our gut flora.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:00.720
This innovative study 
looked at feces scraped

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.900
from used toilet paper in 
undergrads during exam week.

00:03:04.903 --> 00:03:09.370
This is how many bacteria they 
had in their feces before the exam,

00:03:09.371 --> 00:03:16.500
but look what happens on exam day and 
in fact lasted through the whole week.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:24.140
So our mental state can affect our gut, 
but can our gut affect our mental state?

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:26.940
We didn't know
 until recently.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.230
For example, "many suffering from chronic fatigue syndrome complain of gut dysfunction,"

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.580
so researchers tried giving people 
probiotics to see if their mental

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:39.600
and emotional state could be improved, 
and indeed it appeared to help.

00:03:39.603 --> 00:03:43.800
What about healthy 
people, though?

00:03:43.802 --> 00:03:48.620
This is the study that really rocked 
the scientific establishment.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.270
An assessment of the psychotropic
 properties of probiotics.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.620
One month of probiotics was 
found to significantly decrease

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:00.960
symptoms of anxiety, 
depression, anger, and hostility.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.590
How is that possible?

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.000
Well, a variety of mechanisms
 has been proposed for how

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.140
intestinal bacteria may 
be communicating with our brain.

00:04:11.153 --> 00:04:16.640
Until that study was published, though, "the idea 
 that probiotic bacteria administered to the intestine"

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.160
"could influence our brain 
seemed almost surreal".

00:04:20.164 --> 00:04:24.450
Like science fiction. 
Science, yes, but fiction, no.

00:04:24.453 --> 00:04:28.481
"Likely, organisms already
 inside us carry out some degree

00:04:28.481 --> 00:04:31.100
of influence on our 
mental well-being."

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.500
So might people suffering from 
certain forms of mental health problems

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.120
benefit from a 
fecal transplant

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:40.640
from someone with a more 
happy-go-lucky bacteria?

00:04:40.641 --> 00:04:46.010
We don't know, but "this ability of
 probiotics to affect brain processes"

00:04:46.014 --> 00:04:54.340
"is perhaps one of the most exciting recent developments in probiotic research."
