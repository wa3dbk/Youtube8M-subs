00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.940
GUESS WHAT I AM, SQUEAK!, SQUEAK!, SQUEAK!

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.040
A RUSTY WHEEL?

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.560
NO, SQUEAK!, SQUEAK!

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.440
YOU'RE PRETENDING TO CRY

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:29.040
(LAUGHING) NO! COME ON BLUEBIRD YOU'RE GREAT AT THIS GAME, WHAT'S BIG BEAR PRETENDING TO BE

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.680
(BIRD NOISES)

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.780
BLUEBIRD? (SQUEAK!, SQUEAK!) 

00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:39.391
HE'S A MOUSE

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.580
YES, WELL DONE BLUEBIRD 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.180
IT'S YOUR TURN NOW 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.200
(BIRD NOISES) 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.360
(BIRD SOUNDS FROM FLOCK)

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.440
HAHA, YOU'RE BEING A BIRD

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.440
OH, THAT'S EASY

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:58.640
WHAT'S THE BIRD DOING? 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.680
THIS BIRD IS MIGRATING, LIKE ALL ITS OTHER BIRD FRIENDS 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:06.660
MIGRATING? 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:15.020
OH, MIGRATING IS WHEN WE BIRDS FLY TO WARM, FAR AWAY PLACES LIKE A BIG LONG HOLIDAY 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:22.180
WE CAN PADDLE IN THE SEA, PLAY IN THE SUN AND EAT FANCY FRUIT FROM TREES 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.200
SOUNDS WONDERFUL 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.200
WOW!

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.620
TELL US MORE BLUEBIRD

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.760
OH! LOOK! ITS MY FRIEND, TILL

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.440
SHALL WE ALL MIGRATE? 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:42.440
I DON'T THINK WE CAN

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.540
IT'S A BIRD THING

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.560
(DUCK NOISES) YOU'VE GOT TO COME WITH US BLUEBIRD

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.020
MIGRATING IS WHAT WE DO

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.060
I KNOW, BUT WHAT ABOUT MY FRIENDS 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.040
THEY'LL UNDERSTAND, JUST THINK OF ALL THE FUN YOU'LL BE MISSING IF YOU DON'T COME 

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.000
SQUEAK!, SQUEAK! GUESS WHAT I AM 

00:02:04.887 --> 00:02:06.887
WELL YOUR A MOUSE OF COURSE

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.960
I AM NOT A MOUSE

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:12.400
I AM BIG BEAR PRETENDING TO BE MOUSE 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.420
(GIGGLING) VERY FUNNY RAGGLES 

00:02:16.934 --> 00:02:18.574
COMING TO PLAY? 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.140
I CAN'T, I'VE GOT THINGS TO DO

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:26.040
BLUEBIRD! ARE YOU ALRIGHT?

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.040
WHAT'S WRONG ROSIE? 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:31.260
I THINK BLUEBIRD MIGHT BE LEAVING US 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.300
I THINK SHE'S GOING TO MIGRATE

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.980
(EVERYBODY) WHOW!

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.860
SHE CAN'T LEAVE US

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.940
I'LL HAVE NO ONE TO WAKE ME UP REALLY EARLY IN THE MORNING 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.380
AND WHAT ABOUT HER MAGIC?

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.740
WELL THERE IS ONLY ONE THING FOR IT

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.480
WE'LL HAVE TO PERSUADE BLUEBIRD TO STAY RIGHT HERE

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.580
HOW? 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.440
OKAY, THIS IS WHAT WE ARE GOING TO DO
