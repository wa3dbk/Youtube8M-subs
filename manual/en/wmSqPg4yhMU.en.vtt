00:00:01.339 --> 00:00:06.510
Okay, so it is day two on safari and we are
heading back to Kruger National Park.

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.880
The focus today is going to be to find animals
like being around the water.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.470
So we're going to be visiting a watering hole
maybe seeing some buffalo, some hippos and

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:17.320
we'll see what else we can find.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.850
So again, it's an early start.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:25.520
It's around five thirty in the morning and
we're going to head on out there.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:31.960
So far, so good as far as the weather today.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.329
It looks like we're going to have a lot better
visibility.

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:38.120
We had an amazing sunrise to witness this
morning.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.270
But it is chilly and so we're all bundled
up.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.890
It's a lot colder than it was yesterday but
the sun is coming out.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:49.320
We actually had a little bit of drizzle yesterday,
so it'll be warmer.

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:50.829
Just waiting for it to get warmer.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.129
And I think we're going to have even better
visibility for photos and video in terms of

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.570
taking shots of the animals.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.150
So, exciting stuff!

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:51.649
Okay, so 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.380
a pretty cool morning so far.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.079
We managed to spot the ever elusive leopard.

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.729
So that was pretty cool.

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:00.999
And we also saw a heard of elephants that
were just crossing the road.

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:49.610
There was about fifteen or twenty of them,
so that was also a pretty impressive sight.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:03:07.890
One of the coolest things that I've seen today
was at a watering hole.

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.079
There was a crocodile and it was waiting for
an impala to drink.

00:03:11.079 --> 00:03:13.730
And it was so close to attacking it.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.530
Like we almost saw this ridiculous crazy scene.

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.049
Anyways, the crocodile was unsuccessful and
it ended up attacking another crocodile.

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:44.260
And we captured a bit of that footage.

00:03:44.260 --> 00:04:08.049
One safari tip to consider is to dress with
all kinds of layers.

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:09.279
This morning it was freezing.

00:04:09.279 --> 00:04:14.879
I had on a fleece, I had on a windbreaker
and now by the afternoon I'm peeling down

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.690
to just this tiny kind of athletic shirt.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.359
And you've got thick jogging pants on.

00:04:19.359 --> 00:05:13.450
Yeah, so I wish I had shorts right now for
that.

00:05:13.450 --> 00:06:07.610
Alright, so we are wrapping up our second
day of safari.

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:10.840
We're going to be heading to the campgrounds
soon and we're going to have our first braai

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:14.750
for dinner and apparently that is South African
barbecue so it should be tasty.
