00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.900
I am Hyun-bum Nam

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.660
A photographer who takes pictures of street fashion in abroad

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.900
I’m mostly known as 'the photographer Nam'

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.840
Don’t you mostly work in overseas?

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:11.840
I am leaving tomorrow!

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.640
I've been to London, Firenze, Milano and Paris

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.780
And I am just stopping over in Korea for the exhibition

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:17.680
Don't the people around you

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.440
Envy you?

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.740
Ah! They envy me a lot!

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.680
This is the suitcase

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.980
That I mostly bring with me

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.940
And you know when you take a flight

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:23.880
You have to stick these luggage receipt thingy

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.920
And when these things get piled up

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.880
It becomes a history of mine…

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:29.920
Now there are a lot of

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.320
Street Fashion photographers

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.120
But in 2010

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.200
When I first started

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.200
There were, like, four or five

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.900
So that helped me to get settled a bit easier

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.220
Were those five people Koreans?

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.960
No

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.760
None of them was

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.400
What did you do before you became a photographer?

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.800
I studied something related to computers

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.100
And after I saw many fancy people online

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.080
I got really curious

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:50.400
It made me wonder what kind of cool people would dress like that

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.080
And walk around the street?

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.180
I was so curious

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.960
So I saved some money

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:55.720
And went abroad with a camera

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:56.720
With no plans

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.680
You are still working, right?

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.920
Yes! I've been really busy

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.020
Preparing for the exhibition

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.100
And publishing my photo collection

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:05.580
These are the books that

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.360
That the publisher sent me after the binding

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.420
This isn’t your first time publishing a collection, right?

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.160
It is my second

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.500
When I was publishing the first one

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:12.920
I was interested in

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:13.960
Every single models

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:15.780
But as I gained more experience

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.440
It became more interesting

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.100
To take a look at

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.540
The stories on the street

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:22.840
So I completely changed my photography style

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.200
Then I emailed the businesses that I had contracts with

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:26.800
Saying,

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.940
“I don't think we can continue”

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.720
“The works that we've been working on"

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.220
“Because I want to change the direction of my photography"

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.680
There’s gonna be a publication party soon

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.420
You’re going to follow me, right?

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.680
We think we will!

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:40.140
Then shall we keep moving?

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.840
Yes!

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.000
What kind of conversation did you have at the party?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.100
I got questions from the audience

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.300
Then I gave them my signature

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.600
One of the people who came here

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.800
And bought the collection

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:47.780
Said that he had a question

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.060
I was wondering

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:50.440
Which city is the best for

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.340
Taking good pictures?

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.700
Ah… it’s Paris!

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.520
There are lots of things to get pictured

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.040
And many famous people are there as well

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.140
I guess Paris is fun

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.340
Thank you!

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.340
So many people showed up today!

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.720
I never knew I have so many fans!

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.620
I was so surprised!

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.540
I knew that he was popular

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.120
But I didn't know

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.460
This many people would come here and buy the collection…

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.540
So I felt good!

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.880
There are actually many people

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.360
Who think that I am rich enough

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.100
To travel around the world

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.320
But when I first went abroad

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.180
All I could afford to eat in a day

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.160
Was just one hotdog...

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.960
Photographer is a job

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:20.560
That creates things

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.300
It’s a job that you should express your thoughts

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:23.340
So if you don't really enjoy it

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.340
And don't put your best into it

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.120
The result is not that good

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.540
So I think that is really important

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.680
To do the things that I like

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.120
Then the result

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.380
Actually pays back!

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:35.640
We will follow you

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.240
Later to Paris

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:38.820
I’m going to Sydney in April

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.580
Come to Sydney!

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.360
Wow… You are really moving around a lot…

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:42.880
I envy you…
