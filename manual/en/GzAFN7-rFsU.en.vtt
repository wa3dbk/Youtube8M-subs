Hi I’m Scott for Expert Village and today
I’m going to show you how to make White

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.370
Coconut Hot Chocolate. Here’s some of the
ingredients that we need in order to make

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.610
this delicious treat. Three pieces of white
chocolate, about a tablespoon of coconut flakes,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:20.740
about a tablespoon of cinnamon, a teaspoon
of vanilla, a whole cup of white milk and

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.640
a little bit of salt. To get started making
Coconut White Chocolate, we have to make sure

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.160
we put our saucepan on a medium heat setting
so that it melts the chocolate at an even

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:39.610
rate. The first step that we now do is add
our milk.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.970
Now that the milk is added and the heat is
on a low setting we just have to wait for

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.000
the milk to come up to a warm simmer but don’t
boil it, or else it will turn into cottage

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.260
cheese and nobody likes that. Okay, now that
our milk has come to a warm simmer we can

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.100
take our white chocolate and begin to add
it piece by piece. But try not to break it

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.320
up, try spreading the pieces apart evenly
so that they can melt at an even rate. Now

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.050
that it looks pretty much melted we can go
right ahead and add our coconut flakes. Try

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:09.460
not to add all the coconut flakes, because
we’d like to save some of these to put on

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.120
as a garnish. Now that the coconut flakes
are mixed in with the milk, the smell is just

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.500
incredible. It smells like coconut hot chocolate.
While that’s sitting we can take some of

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.900
our salt now and just add a little pinch of
it, just give it that little finishing touch.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:33.130
We can also go ahead and add our teaspoon
of vanilla. Okay, so it looks like it’s

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.600
all done, so we’ll just turn off the heat
now, and we’ll get our glass and serve this

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.550
up right. Making sure that you pour it out
slowly so you can bask in the aromas that

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.880
come from this incredible drink. Mmm, that
smells great; you’ll see by the time that

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.590
you’re finished that some of the coconut
pieces will settle on the bottom. Make sure

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.492
that you grab your wooden spoon and scoop
them all in because that is important to coconut

00:01:55.492 --> 00:02:01.940
white chocolate. All we need to do now is
add a little bit of whipped cream and finish

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.880
this off with our nice little coconut garnish
we saved. It’s different than your normal

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.010
hot chocolate, but boy is it good. For Expert
Village, Mmm, I’m Scott.
