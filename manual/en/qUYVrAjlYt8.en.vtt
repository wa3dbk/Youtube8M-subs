00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.912
[Intro Music]

00:00:03.912 --> 00:00:05.972
&gt;&gt; Daniel: So the first place we’re going

00:00:05.972 --> 00:00:11.412
to start is the pantry. What do you got Tana?
&gt;&gt; Tana: Alright. Let’s see what we have.

00:00:11.412 --> 00:00:18.412
Oh, we have some nuts, several nuts.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: Dry-roasted almonds.

00:00:25.561 --> 00:00:32.561
&gt;&gt; Tana: Fine. Hmm, got some oils. More oil
– olive oil, vegetable oil.

00:00:40.881 --> 00:00:44.712
&gt;&gt; Daniel: Ah, poison. That goes in the “kill
you early” piles.

00:00:44.712 --> 00:00:48.672
&gt;&gt; Tana: We have red wine vinegar.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: That stays in “keep you alive

00:00:48.672 --> 00:00:55.672
a long time.” Oh, Skippy peanut butter.
I grew up on this stuff. If only they taught

00:00:58.582 --> 00:01:03.092
me how to read labels I would have thought
my mother was trying to kill me.

00:01:03.092 --> 00:01:08.701
&gt;&gt; Tana: That’s right.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: Roasted peanuts, sugar, hydrogenated

00:01:08.701 --> 00:01:13.252
vegetable oils. Oh, that means poison.
&gt;&gt; Tana: Poison and a lot of people don’t

00:01:13.252 --> 00:01:18.362
know that peanuts are not nuts, they’re
legumes and they’re very high in something

00:01:18.362 --> 00:01:25.362
called Aflatoxin which is a carcinogen.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: But the good news is there’s

00:01:25.972 --> 00:01:30.511
great peanut butter, just not this.
&gt;&gt; Tana: There’re also great alternatives.

00:01:30.511 --> 00:01:36.271
&gt;&gt; Daniel: Bread crumbs. Alright. Let’s
count how many ingredients are in bread crumbs.

00:01:36.271 --> 00:01:43.072
Bread crumbs, rich flour – that’s not
bad, partially hydrogenated; anything that

00:01:43.072 --> 00:01:50.072
says “hydrogenated” or “partially hydrogenated”
means early death; monosodium glutamate. Actually,

00:01:52.551 --> 00:01:57.211
once had a patient who would get violent whenever
he had MSG. No.

00:01:57.211 --> 00:02:02.211
&gt;&gt; Tana: Very bad for kids. Do we really need
to even talk about this one?

00:02:02.211 --> 00:02:06.912
&gt;&gt; Daniel: Sun syrup. I love this stuff.
&gt;&gt; Tana: It doesn’t love you.

00:02:06.912 --> 00:02:13.812
&gt;&gt; Daniel: High fructose corn syrup. So, anything
that says hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated

00:02:13.812 --> 00:02:19.382
or high fructose corn syrup, just assume it’s
poison and will kill you early.

00:02:19.382 --> 00:02:21.232
&gt;&gt; Tana: Right.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: So, as soon as you read that on

00:02:21.232 --> 00:02:26.652
the label you actually don’t have to read
the other seven, eight, nine, ten things including

00:02:26.652 --> 00:02:31.762
red dye which has been shown to cause behavior
problems in children. Actually I already have

00:02:31.762 --> 00:02:34.392
behavior problem so I don’t need any more
encouraging.

00:02:34.392 --> 00:02:37.882
&gt;&gt; Tana: That’s right. We have one we can
save.

00:02:37.882 --> 00:02:43.602
&gt;&gt; Daniel: Yellow, mustard. I love that.
&gt;&gt; Tana: Oh, another one we can save, I think.

00:02:43.602 --> 00:02:50.602
Yep, this one’s great. Tomato puree, chilies.
It’s got some food starch but, vinegar.

00:02:51.232 --> 00:02:51.892
Gluten-free.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: Wow.

00:02:51.892 --> 00:02:55.092
&gt;&gt; Tana: There’s got some salsa and they’re
not bad.

00:02:55.092 --> 00:03:00.122
&gt;&gt; Daniel: Salsa actually is generally very
low calorie. This is only 10 calories per

00:03:00.122 --> 00:03:03.502
two tablespoons and it’s got a lot of good
stuff.

00:03:03.502 --> 00:03:09.832
&gt;&gt; Tana: And it’s great alternative to ketchup.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: Oh, give me a heart arrhythmia.

00:03:09.832 --> 00:03:13.772
My grandfather was a candy maker, I mean like
a real candy maker. I used to make fudge with

00:03:13.772 --> 00:03:20.592
him. So, how many ingredients? And the first
one being fructose corn syrup and now we have

00:03:20.592 --> 00:03:27.592
milk. Most people don’t know is that after
the age of 5, 70 percent of people in the

00:03:28.332 --> 00:03:35.332
world do not process milk well in their digestive
system so the less milk probably the better.

00:03:38.172 --> 00:03:44.692
So we have high fructose corn syrup, milk,
corn syrup, partially hydrogenated coconut

00:03:44.692 --> 00:03:48.602
oil. Coconut oil is not the problem, it’s
the hydrogenated part.

00:03:48.602 --> 00:03:52.432
&gt;&gt; Tana: Coconut oil is great if it’s not
hydrogenated.

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:56.372
&gt;&gt; Daniel: Mono-diglycerides. You need a chemist
to know. In the bad pile.

00:03:56.372 --> 00:03:59.972
&gt;&gt; Tana: Scary. Another note on milk: if you’re
going to drink milk it’s best to drink it

00:03:59.972 --> 00:04:04.832
organic where they’re not adding extra growth
hormones to it so it’s big problem with

00:04:04.832 --> 00:04:08.641
milk – and the antibiotics. So if you drink
milk, make sure that it’s organic.

00:04:08.641 --> 00:04:15.352
&gt;&gt; Daniel: Well, in any animal products you
want to be thinking about them as hormone-free,

00:04:15.352 --> 00:04:21.331
antibiotic free, free range which mean didn’t
raise it in a small cage. If you also want

00:04:21.331 --> 00:04:28.331
to have a sense of what the meat you eat,
what they ate, because you basically consumed

00:04:29.861 --> 00:04:31.271
what they consumed.
&gt;&gt; Tana: Absolutely.

00:04:31.271 --> 00:04:35.151
&gt;&gt; Daniel: And while you’re there, I love
the almonds but these are dry-roasted and

00:04:35.151 --> 00:04:41.021
they have salt. Our preference would be raw
almonds just because you want to be careful

00:04:41.021 --> 00:04:48.021
with the sodium, this has 150 mg per serving.
&gt;&gt; Tana: Yeah and more than that, beyond that

00:04:49.401 --> 00:04:56.271
almonds are the wonderful natural fats that
are so amazing for you - you lose all that

00:04:56.271 --> 00:05:00.111
benefit when you roast them.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: So, better to have them raw. So,

00:05:00.111 --> 00:05:05.741
what do you think? Good pile or bad pile?
&gt;&gt; Tana: Bad pile. They have to go.

00:05:05.741 --> 00:05:10.621
&gt;&gt; Daniel: Pinto beans with jalapeno peppers.
That can’t be bad for you, except there’s

00:05:10.621 --> 00:05:16.882
like 14 ingredients. Pinto beans, no problem;
peppers, good; hydrogenated cotton seed oil,

00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:20.801
as soon as you say hydrogenated anything...
&gt;&gt; Tana: Yes, and cotton seed oil is not good

00:05:20.801 --> 00:05:26.412
for you. One thing about beans, beans are
fabulous source of fiber and protein especially

00:05:26.412 --> 00:05:30.882
for vegetarians if you’re not sensitive
to them. Many people have sensitivities to

00:05:30.882 --> 00:05:36.551
legumes – beans - and also to some grains
unless they’re prepared correctly. If you

00:05:36.551 --> 00:05:42.231
prepare them fresh, you soak them and cook
them properly, it eliminates a lot of problem.

00:05:42.231 --> 00:05:49.231
&gt;&gt; Daniel: Tomato sauce. Love it, except what’s
in it. Tomato, salt, dehydrated onions, garlic,

00:05:50.741 --> 00:05:57.741
garlic is great, sweet bell peppers, good.
Aha! Chicken broth. Love chicken broth. Hello,

00:05:59.451 --> 00:06:03.512
why is there cane sweetened anything in chicken
broth?

00:06:03.512 --> 00:06:07.921
&gt;&gt; Tana: Yeah and actually most of the chicken
broths do not have that so you really want

00:06:07.921 --> 00:06:12.071
to pay attention because you can get chicken
broth without anything in it. Also if you

00:06:12.071 --> 00:06:16.981
are gluten-free, it will say gluten-free.
This one’s not gluten-free.

00:06:16.981 --> 00:06:19.842
&gt;&gt; Daniel: So we should talk about that in
a little bit because we need to get to bread

00:06:19.842 --> 00:06:26.722
in a little bit. About 7 percent of the population
in America is sensitive to gluten. That means

00:06:26.722 --> 00:06:33.722
21 million people. People who are gluten sensitive
often have a lot of problems. Diarrhea, constipation,

00:06:37.102 --> 00:06:42.451
upset stomach, gas but they also have cognitive
problems. They have problems with depression,

00:06:42.451 --> 00:06:49.451
anxiety. We actually see over a lower activity
in their brain. If you don’t know that you’re

00:06:50.342 --> 00:06:55.711
sensitive to gluten, it’s often good to
get a blood test or do yourself a big favor

00:06:55.711 --> 00:07:02.222
and take the challenge for a month and go
off everything that could possibly have gluten

00:07:02.222 --> 00:07:09.222
in it. Garlic vegetable instant rice noodle
soup.

00:07:09.551 --> 00:07:12.331
&gt;&gt; Tana: Usually if it says instant, it instantly
has to go.

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:17.651
&gt;&gt; Daniel: Well if the ingredient list is
like there’s 30 things, it means just put

00:07:17.651 --> 00:07:21.312
it in a pile that will kill you early.
&gt;&gt; Tana: Instant anything is usually instant

00:07:21.312 --> 00:07:27.891
death, so… The American staple.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: Pasta. Doesn’t it turn into like

00:07:27.891 --> 00:07:32.641
sugar like immediately?
&gt;&gt; Tana: If you see white rice or pasta, think

00:07:32.641 --> 00:07:38.912
sugar. You’re eating a bowl of sugar.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: No. Now you have a secret though,

00:07:38.912 --> 00:07:39.892
with pasta.
&gt;&gt; Tana: I do.

00:07:39.892 --> 00:07:43.801
&gt;&gt; Daniel: They’re called Shirataki noodles.
&gt;&gt; Tana: We are going to share that in a little

00:07:43.801 --> 00:07:46.651
bit.
&gt;&gt; Daniel: Ah. So, there are alternatives

00:07:46.651 --> 00:07:52.502
that are actually very tasty that you can
do so you don’t have to think you’re getting

00:07:52.502 --> 00:07:53.951
rid of spaghetti forever.
&gt;&gt; Tana: That’s right.

00:07:53.951 --> 00:07:54.201
