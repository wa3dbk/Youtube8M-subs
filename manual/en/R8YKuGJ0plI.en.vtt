00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:04.090
I've got pairs of mixed
numbers and improper fractions,

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:06.890
and I want to think about
which of the two is larger.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.674
So 1 and 7/8, 39/10.

00:00:09.674 --> 00:00:11.090
So you could do
this in your head.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.110
You could say 10
goes into 39, I'll

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.020
even write it out, 10 goes
into 39 3 times, 3 times 10.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.410
And you want to find the
largest number of times 10

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:22.740
goes into this
without going over.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.611
So you couldn't
write a 4 over here,

00:00:24.611 --> 00:00:25.860
because then that would be 40.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.510
That would go over 39.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.450
3 times 10 is 30.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.090
And then you have
a remainder of 9.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.170
So you could rewrite this
expression right over here.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.450
Instead of 39/10 you could
write it as 30/10 plus 9/10.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.790
And 30/10 is just 3.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.412
So this is equal to 3 and 9/10.

00:00:46.412 --> 00:00:47.870
And you could do
that in your head.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:53.740
You could say 10 goes into 39 3
times, and the remainder is 9.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.010
You have your 9/10.

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.290
And that's essentially just
doing this in your head.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.290
So now we can compare,
and we can literally just

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.581
look at the whole number parts.

00:01:00.581 --> 00:01:02.860
This is 1 and
something, 1 and 7/8,

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:05.280
and we're comparing it to
essentially 3 and 9/10.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.640
3 and 9/10 is clearly
a larger number.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:09.980
We have a 3 out
here instead of a 1,

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.180
so we will write less than.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.150
And the way I always remember
it is, the opening always

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.390
faces the larger number.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.290
And the point is small.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.370
It always points to
the smaller number.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.370
Now let's do this next one.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.430
4 and 7/8 versus 49/9.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.060
So let's convert this
to a mixed number.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.660
9 goes into 49 5 times,
and 5 times 9 is 45.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.770
So the remainder
is going to be 4.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.446
The remainder is 4,
so this is 5 and 4/9.

00:01:42.446 --> 00:01:43.820
Once again, we
can literally just

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:45.390
look at the whole number parts.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:49.230
5 is clearly larger than 4,
so once again, less than.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:51.800
Point facing the
smaller number, opening

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.120
facing the larger number.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.680
Now 2 and 1/2 versus 11/10.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.377
10 goes into 11 only 1 time.

00:02:00.377 --> 00:02:02.210
And if you care about
the remainder, it's 1.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:04.340
So it's 1 and 1/10.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.934
Which is clearly
smaller than 2 and 1/2.

00:02:06.934 --> 00:02:08.600
You just look at the
whole number parts.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.840
2 is clearly larger than 1.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.730
So we want our opening of our
less than or greater than sign

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.719
to face the larger number.

00:02:16.719 --> 00:02:18.010
So we would write it like this.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.210
And this is greater than, so 2
and 1/2 is greater than 11/10.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.480
The little point facing
the smaller number.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.610
5 and 4/9 versus 40/7.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.520
7 goes into 40, so
let me rewrite this,

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:34.772
7 goes into 40 5 times.

00:02:34.772 --> 00:02:36.730
And then you're going to
have a remainder of 5,

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.175
because 7 times 5 is 35.

00:02:38.175 --> 00:02:40.660
You have a remainder
of 5 to get to 40.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.792
So it's 5 and 5/7.

00:02:42.792 --> 00:02:45.000
And if that looks like I'm
doing some type of voodoo,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.916
just remember, I'm really
just breaking it up.

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:49.580
I'm just really
saying that 40/7 is

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.310
the same thing as 35 plus 5/7.

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.200
The largest multiple of 7
that is less than this number.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.770
And this is the same
thing as 35/7 plus 5/7.

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.940
And then this, 35/7 5.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.430
And 5/7 is just 5/7 there.

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.980
This one is interesting because
we have the same whole number

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.280
out front on our mixed numbers.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.010
5 versus 5.

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.920
So now we actually do
have to pay attention

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.580
to the fractional part
of our mixed number.

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.944
We essentially have
to compare 4/9 to 5/7.

00:03:20.944 --> 00:03:22.610
And there's a couple
of ways to do this.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:24.650
You could get them to
have the same denominator.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.660
That's probably the
easiest way to do it.

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.665
So you could rewrite-- so what's
the least common multiple of 9

00:03:29.665 --> 00:03:30.720
and 7?

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.740
They share no factors, so
really the least common multiple

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:35.310
is going to be their product.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.840
So if we want to rewrite
4/9 we would write 63

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.030
in the denominator,
that's 9 times 7.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.980
If we multiply the
denominator by 7

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.000
we also have to multiply
the numerator by 7.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.550
So that will be 28.

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:53.120
Now 5/7, we're going to
make the denominator 63.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.860
We're multiplying the
denominator times 9.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.360
Then we have to multiply the
numerator times 9 as well.

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.710
5 times 9 is 45.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.760
So here it's easy to see.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:07.570
45/63 is clearly
larger than 28/63.

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:09.130
And so we could write this.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.260
And because the whole number
of parts are the same,

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:14.700
and 5/7 is the same
thing as 45/63,

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:17.490
and 4/9 is the same
thing as 28/63,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:22.660
we can write that 5 and
4/9 is less than 40/7.

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.220
Another way that you could have
thought about 4/9 versus 5/7

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:31.060
is you could have said, well,
how does 4/9 compare to 4/7?

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.480
We have the same numerator.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.994
The denominator here is larger
than the denominator here.

00:04:34.994 --> 00:04:36.910
But when you have a
number in the denominator,

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:38.900
the larger it is, the
smaller the fraction.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.220
The smaller the absolute
value of the fraction.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:44.390
So this right over here is
a smaller quantity than 4/7.

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:48.100
And 4/7 is clearly a
smaller quantity than 5/7.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:50.660
So 4/9 is clearly
smaller than 5/7,

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:53.510
so we would have
gotten the same result.
