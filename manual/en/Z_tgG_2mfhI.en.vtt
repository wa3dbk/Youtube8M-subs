Hello everyone, Sotius here from Fragmix and today we are going to talk about

00:00:04.283 --> 00:00:07.067
an absolutely amazing kickstarter campaign.

00:00:08.442 --> 00:00:12.058
Developers inXile entertainment started a kickstarter campaign

00:00:12.075 --> 00:00:15.017
for a game called Torment: Tides of Numenera.

00:00:15.475 --> 00:00:20.907
The goal was to gain $900,000 in funding within a 30 day period.

00:00:21.583 --> 00:00:26.642
Little did they know, the Kickstarter would pass 
 it's goal within the first 6 hours!

00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:30.920
Brian Fargo, one of the developers for the 
 game, implied that one of the reasons

00:00:30.925 --> 00:00:35.518
they decided to go to Kickstarter was because game publishers only show interest in

00:00:35.542 --> 00:00:40.102
helping fund games once they know that they can make some money in return

00:00:40.117 --> 00:00:44.381
which is no surprise they would want to make 
 a return on their investment, wouldn't you?

00:00:44.408 --> 00:00:48.952
The problem with game development is that it 
 is very expensive, why risk your money

00:00:48.967 --> 00:00:55.037
investing in a new game when you can be investing in a game 
 series that is proven to make a return on your money.

00:00:55.025 --> 00:01:01.665
And this was the problem inXile entertainment had to face when 
 they wanted to make a sequel to their game Wasteland,

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:06.375
so they put their reputation on the line and started a Kickstarter.

00:01:06.392 --> 00:01:11.115
And the bet paid off! It was a 
 huge success, that's the beauty of Kickstarter

00:01:11.108 --> 00:01:16.925
gamer's themselves can fund the games that they WANT 
 to see, rather than game publishers only funding

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:20.199
the sequels of titles that have proven to be successful. 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.793
So they tried their luck again. It is absolutely 
 incredible how successful this new Kickstarter campaign was.

00:01:27.792 --> 00:01:34.884
They are trending towards 3257% of their goal, 
 which would give them a total of

00:01:34.883 --> 00:01:40.710
Twenty-nine million dollars, of course it's unlikely that they will actually make that much

00:01:40.692 --> 00:01:46.490
because Kickstarters slow down overtime but by adding 
 stretch goals they can encourage more pledges

00:01:46.458 --> 00:01:49.370
and you can imagine what they could do with millions of dollars.

00:01:49.492 --> 00:01:52.920
You may be asking what is the game about exactly?

00:01:52.925 --> 00:01:57.730
Well the game is a CRPG a computer roleplaying game similar to Planescape.

00:01:57.775 --> 00:02:03.480
The game aims to have a deep story that is 
 governed by the choices and consequences you make.

00:02:03.525 --> 00:02:09.800
There will be choices to customize your abilities, skills and your 
 legacy which is determined by which tides you manipulate.

00:02:09.816 --> 00:02:14.010
Tides are sort of the game's version of aspects. There are five colors

00:02:14.033 --> 00:02:17.950
Gold, covering empathy, chairty, compassion and sacrifice.

00:02:17.975 --> 00:02:22.480
Indigo, covering Justice, Equity, Compromise and the greater good.

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.880
Silver is admiration, power and fame.

00:02:25.875 --> 00:02:30.250
Red contains passion, emotion, action, pathos and zeal.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:36.330
And lastly Blue represents reason, insight and wisdom.

00:02:36.358 --> 00:02:41.370
Your legacy opens new abilities such as the ability to 
 read the past in the minds of the dead.

00:02:41.367 --> 00:02:45.700
I would like to tell you more about the game 
 but the Kickstarter's rather vague on the details.

00:02:45.692 --> 00:02:49.740
This is probably on purpose so that they don't promise things that may change.

00:02:49.775 --> 00:02:54.120
I will add a link to the Kickstarter in the video 
 description so you guys can check it out for yourselves.

00:02:54.117 --> 00:03:02.720
Thank you everyone for watching be sure to like and subscribe if you haven't already and let us 
 know in the comments what you think of the game so far, see you next time.
