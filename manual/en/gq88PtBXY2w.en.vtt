00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.099
What's up guys?

00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:05.959
Today's video is about how to look better,
and it's not what you think.

00:00:05.959 --> 00:00:12.360
It's actually a tag video talking about five
ways to "look" better, as in your perspective

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.280
and looking at what's important in life.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.860
The tag was started by Shannon Says

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:20.960
and I got tagged by Life By Jazz, so thank
you Jazz!

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.870
Now I'm going to teach you how to look better
in 2015.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:25.870
1.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.210
Look at what you're consuming, as in what
you're feeding your mind:

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:35.559
what you're reading, what you're watching,
on social media, blogs, articles,

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.499
YouTube, TV shows, etc.

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:43.239
Take a look at the media you're absorbing
throughout the day,

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.739
and evaluate whether it's valuable information?

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:49.920
Or is it just noise and gossip

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.800
and wasteful, useless information?

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.149
This year I especially want to be more aware

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.519
of the information that I'm feeding myself,
making sure that everything that I read and

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:01.519
absorb

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:07.340
is helping me and not just wasting my time,
or even hurting me.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.579
2.

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:12.140
Look at what you're eating, as in what you're
putting into your body.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:17.820
This year, I'm definitely trying to be a lot
more healthier in my diet and my lifestyle,

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.079
trying to make more green juice and smoothies
in the morning,

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.259
and eat more fruit and veggies throughout
the day.

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:25.990
I recently watched a documentary called

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.750
"Forks Over Knives" and it's so good.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.579
I highly recommend you guys watch it.

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:31.810
It's on Netflix.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.049
Basically that documentary opened my eyes
to the endless benefits

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:40.850
of having a whole foods, plant-based diet.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.619
And so although I'm not one to label myself
or my diet,

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:49.850
I'm definitely trying to incorporate more
of those elements into what I eat.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.289
So I'm eating less meats and fats and sugars,
and putting more fruits and veggies

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:56.560
and complex carbs into my diet.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.640
At the end of the day, it's up to you what
you want to eat

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.170
and put into your body.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:04.329
It's totally fine to enjoy and indulge sometimes

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:08.710
but I'm just trying to be more aware of what
I eat and making sure

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.670
that it's nourishing my body in a healthy
and positive way,

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.290
and that it gives me the right kind of energy
to thrive in life.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.390
3.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:20.470
Look at your habits.

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.080
Habits are the building blocks to your lifestyle,
so choose wisely.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.080
If you haven't seen my last video on habits,
you can watch it right here.

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:34.440
This year I'm definitely trying to incorporate
more positive habits into my lifestyle,

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.740
and release the negative ones.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.200
Habits are the kind of things that multiply
and get stronger

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.990
each day, so if you have a negative habit,
then it's really going to bring you down.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.890
But if you have a positive habit, then over
time it's going to just bring you up.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:55.820
For me, my key habits that I have to hit every
day from morning to night are:

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:02.130
in the morning, I have to do my morning pages
and write; then I have to meditate and exercise;

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:07.210
and at the end of the day I have to read at
least 10 pages of a good book before I sleep.

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.120
So those are my four non-negotiable habits
for now and I guess once I master those habits,

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.680
then I'm going to keep adding more positive
ones in the future.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.750
Look at your habits, release the negative
ones and starting building

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:26.980
those positive small habits that will eventually
create the person that you want to be.

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:28.180
4.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.730
Look at your words.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:32.600
Your words are so powerful and can affect

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:35.560
more than you could ever imagine.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.830
Your words, meaning the words that you think
to yourself

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.120
and the words that you say to others.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:45.520
Ask yourself: are they helping or are they
hurting?

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.440
It's so important that you take responsibility
over the words that you use to yourself and

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:52.480
to others.

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.610
A book that goes really deep into this is
called "The Four Agreements".

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.760
It's one of my favorite books ever.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.470
The first agreement is: Always be impeccable
with your word.

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.320
You don't realize that your words can change
your life.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.320
And it could change

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.260
other people's lives as well.

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:12.880
So put out positive words and positive thoughts,

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.870
because anything negative is only going to
hurt yourself and hurt others.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.890
You can't just throw your words out there
carelessly because your words have power.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:26.870
They can affect others and they can affect
the world in some sort of way

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:30.360
that you can't imagine at the moment.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.960
So always be impeccable with your word.

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.330
5.

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:37.810
Look at how you look at other people.

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:39.920
Do you find yourself always comparing yourself

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.930
to others?

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.660
Whether it's on Instagram and you see someone
else's life and you wish

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.020
you were them, or you see someone else and
you tell yourself, "Okay, I'm glad I'm not

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:51.020
them,"

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.200
that's not right.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:57.040
Remember that you are no better or worse than
anybody in this world.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:01.520
We are all unique and we are all awesome in
our own way.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.920
So you can't ever judge somebody,

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.650
you can't compare yourself to anybody else
ever, because we're just different.

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.660
We all have our own unique lives and our own
unique paths.

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:14.250
It's just incomparable.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:20.410
Also: you should never judge anybody because
you can never know how their life is,

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.200
who they are 100%.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:25.980
Everything that you see is just perspective.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:28.980
It's just what you speculate.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.830
Look at how you look at other people.

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.300
Try to not compare, try to not judge.

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:39.890
And the most important thing is to just learn
to respect and appreciate everybody for who

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:40.980
they are.

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:45.530
Alright, those are my five ways to look better
in 2015.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:46.530
Now I want to know:

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:49.270
how do you want to look better this year?

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.900

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:54.580

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.840
I look forward to reading them

00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:01.940
because we all want to know how to look good
in 2015, right?

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:07.110
This is a tag video so I'm just going to tag
