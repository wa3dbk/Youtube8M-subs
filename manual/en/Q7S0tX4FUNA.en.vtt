00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:13.179
BUT I DON’T WANNA SHOOT ANOTHER DNEWS EPISODE!

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.639
Unsurprisingly, emotions are difficult to
pin down.

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:20.420
Even the definition is a little nebulous,
"a natural instinctive state of mind deriving

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.260
from one's circumstances, mood, or relationships
with others."

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:30.460
Circumstances OR mood OR relationships that's
pretty much everything we ever do.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.790
Emotions are a visceral state of mind that
hits hard and fast; and is something philosophers

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.520
and scientists have struggled with explaining
for millennia.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:45.030
Emotions start in the brain, so if we want
emotional maturity, what about brain maturity?

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.760
According to neuroscience, the brain reaches
full maturity around 25 -- though it varies

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.010
from person to person.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.730
The last to mature is the prefrontal cortex,
the area associated with executive functions:

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.810
i.e. risk assessment, forward thinking, goal-setting,
evaluations, and emotional regulation!

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:05.420
Ideally, by 25 we understand our place and
ourselves, which explains why teenage emotions

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.670
seem to run so much hotter than adult's.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.500
Emotional development comes in two groups,
basic emotion and higher emotion.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:18.110
The basics are inborn, universal and were
defined by anthropologist Paul Eckman in the

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.540
1970s: joy, sadness, anger, fear, surprise,
and disgust.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.920
Babies, adults, everyone experiences these
emotions

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.470
If I do this… you know I’m disgusted,
right?

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.480
It’s the same thing for everybody.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.850
Higher emotions like jealousy, envy, guilt,
shame, pride and embarrassment come later,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.030
once the brain learns self-awareness and self-consciousness;
but the problem is, emotions aren't easy to

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.030
quantify!

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.630
Just because we don't understand them doesn't
mean we don't experience them, right?

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.390
And that was shown in a hilariously cute study
done by Brigham Young this month.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.300
They looked at children six and under competing
in a block-building contest.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.659
The winners and losers were rigged, so they
could test their emotional responses!

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.770
Losers shrugged it off and moved on right
away, but winners stood, hands on their hips,

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.380
chest out, and had "obvious swagger!"

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:13.920
The brain of a two year old is not self-aware,
or self-conscious, so they shouldn't understand

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.530
pride, but there they were, swagging it up.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.319
When asked about their feelings later, younger
kids who were shown pictures of people expressing

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.870
pride would identify it in others if they
were four or older; but not in themselves.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:33.450
Five-year-olds could see it in themselves
and others; indicating we develop our emotions

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:34.450
as we age.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.050
So, if someone slaps you in the face violently
and unexpectedly, you turn red, feel angry

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.099
and have an indescribable urge to lash out;
but if you're younger, that emotion can override

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:48.830
your rational decision-making and cause you
to do something you might later regret, right?

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:50.140
Not always.

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.730
Studies from the University of California
Santa Barbara found inducing anger in participants

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.270
helped them be more analytical!

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:02.980
Their findings unexpectedly found that even
usually irrational thinkers became careful

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:07.860
thinkers when angry; suggesting that anger
isn't only a physical fight-or-flight response,

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.910
but can also focus the mind for decisionmaking.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.810
This is the problem we have when studying
our emotions.

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.849
They're so fleeting and deep-seated they're
difficult to measure.

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:23.580
But, according to an essay from the University
of California, Berkeley, emotions help organize

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:28.830
our thoughts and keep our perceptions on track
and motivate social interaction.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:33.980
So the more emotional maturity we have, the
better we can learn from our emotional responses.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.160
A scientist from the London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine describes disgust as

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.980
affecting, "who we’re going to kiss, who
we’re going to mate with, who we’re going

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.599
to sit next to… who we're going to shun,"
but disgust is one of the least understood

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:49.900
emotions, because it's not as flashy as the
other basics: sadness, anger, or fear.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.540
Which brings us to another problem with understanding
emotions: there are definitely not just six!

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:59.410
Since the definition of the basic emotions,
scientists have argued there are WAY more

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:03.430
or WAY less; and some have objected to categorizing
emotion altogether!

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.680
There's a lot of strong feelings on the study
of emotion, unsurprisingly.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.290
Sociologists, psychologists, neurologists,
biologists, all have a great need to understand

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:20.019
these physio-psychological reactions that
hold sway over our lives; but sadly, they

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.019
suck at it.

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:23.180
It's a massive blind spot in science.

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:28.930
We can watch blood flow in your brain with
an fMRI, we can scan brainwaves with EEGs,

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.779
measure hormones, blood pressure, skin response,
facial expressions, and many other physical

00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:38.280
reactions to the emotion, but we can't objectively
measure the emotion itself.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:42.999
Evolutionary psychologists theorize emotions,
particularly the outward expressions of them,

00:04:42.999 --> 00:04:47.430
were a way for ancient man to signal to our
social group.

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:54.409
Disgust, joy and anger all have universal
nonverbal cues which tell other social members

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:59.069
what's up with us, which may explain why they've
evolved!

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:03.139
Emotions can save lives and facilitate social
bonding, but even still, there's a lot more

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:05.530
work to do, and we didn't even touch love.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:06.530
Nope.

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:08.129
Too much for just one DNews.

00:05:08.129 --> 00:05:11.199
Want to know more?

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:16.110
Ask some questions in the comments and maybe
we'll make another emotional DNews.
