00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:21.460
[music intro]

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:41.960
Hey guys, Jeff Cavaliere ,AthleanX .com.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.040
Here, with a… back at the gym.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.489
We’ve been on the supplements for a while,
now we’re back in the gym, as a matter of

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.110
fact we’ve got some other new stuff here.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.880
The AthleanX Sneakers that … yes there is
a sneaker but we’re gonna show somebody

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.520
that .. a way up on Facebook soon , a contest
where AthleanX customers will get a chance

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.969
to win their own customized shoes.

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:08.219
Nice add for Nike right there.

00:01:08.219 --> 00:01:10.560
But they are ..
Anyway guys, what we’re gonna do here is,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.439
I’m gonna show you a triceps exercise that
you can do wtith nothing but your own body

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:18.439
weight.

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:21.810
Now I’m gonna show you here at the gym because
it’s very easy to do that but perhaps the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.219
greatest triceps exercise ever is a, lying,
what do you call it, nose breaker or skull

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:31.149
crusher, but is an allied triceps extension.

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:36.079
Now, I showed you a few weeks back a way to
do them correctly by not letting your arms

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:40.130
come too far forward , but I’m gonna show
you now how you can do these as a body weight

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.130
movement.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.039
So we could just take something that requires
the dumbbells or a bar, an easy crowbar and

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.090
we’d made it a body weight exercise that
I call Standing Shull Crusher.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.829
Now, what we do is position ourselves so our
bar is in the squat rack or, listen to me,

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.369
a bed a couch, anything that we can sort of
lean up against.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.419
So I’m proving you can do this anywhere.

00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:05.899
It’s easier on a bar, but you have it here
about almost hip height, a little bit lower

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:06.899
that hip height.

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:13.650
You’re gonna position yourself up into like
an up incline position where your hands would

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.650
be here.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:15.829
This would be traditional incline push up
position.

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:20.680
What we’re gonna do now is put our hands
a little bit narrower, right about shoulder

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.269
width and we’re gonna drop ourselves down
, just under the bar.

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.431
You go under the bar.

00:02:27.431 --> 00:02:31.739
Now you can go right to the forehead and then
push straight up now.

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.719
It’s a real tough exercise.

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:35.230
Put its body weight only.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.530
So you can just go to the forehead and come
out of there or it’s like going for a little

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.459
bit more stretch when you’re doing over
your head with dumbbells, you get yourself

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:44.810
a little bit further back.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.159
We crip down and sneak under the bar and then
come up and out and over,ok?

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:57.180
Down, slow, up and up and over.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.900
[exercising]
Ok?

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:59.900
Body weight version.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:05.549
So, now if you wanna make it a little bit
harder, if you’re that diabolical then you

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:10.610
can pick up your leg right here which is gonna
make, I’ll show you from here, it’s gonna

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.230
make the core actually activate a little bit
more.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.989
So, one leg’s up, drop yourself down, come
up and up.

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.290
Down….. and up.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.890
Down….. and up.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:34.470
So, again, you’re working on about sense
to failure in this.

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.480
But the point is guys that AthleanX is about
not just being unique but keeping things simple.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.770
That you can do and get results anywhere.

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.900
So, that’s why what makes it more effective
is, its full exercise that you can do anywhere,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:55.719
anytime, with minimum equipment but still
get maximum results ,and do it in a creative

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:59.069
and fun way that you might not thought about
in the first place.

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:06.079

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:07.079
