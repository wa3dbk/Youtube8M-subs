00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
What's up?

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:02.620
This is Sean Nalewanyj, of EliteImpactLabs.com.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:07.779
And in today's video lesson, I want to talk
about the issue of whey protein powder versus

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:09.580
casein protein powder.

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.110
Which one is better for muscle growth and
why?

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.980
Now, most bodybuilders who are following a
standard muscle building diet that involves

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.990
about a gram of protein per pound of body
weight are going to be making use of protein

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.990
powders.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.740
It's a very convenient way to get some high
quality protein in your diet and the streamlines

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.740
that you're not, you know, consuming four
or five, six meals a day all from whole foods.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.170
So, two of the most common protein powders
that you come across are whey protein and

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.410
casein protein.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.140
Now, the traditional advice that you're going
to hear on this topic revolves around the

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.200
absorption rates of each source of protein.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:49.400
Most people are going to tell you, whey protein
is a fast-acting protein, and so, it should

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.320
be consumed at times when you need, you know,
a quick source of protein, such as first thing

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.650
in the morning or post-workout.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:02.220
Whereas, casein is a slow-absorbing protein,
and so, you want to stick to that during times

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.659
when you want a prolonged release of amino
acids, such as right before bed.

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:13.189
Now, the reality behind this is that, yes,
some proteins are absorbed more quickly than

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:14.220
others.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.360
But in reality, all protein sources are essentially
slow-digesting proteins.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:26.260
Most people really underestimate the speed
of the process of digestion and absorption.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.009
It's not this rapid process that happens very
quickly.

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:34.759
It's a very complex process that takes place
from the time you put that protein in your

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.600
mouth, until the time that it's actually absorbed
by your cells.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.560
Egg protein for example is absorbed at a rate
of about 3grams per hour.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:47.400
So that means, if you were to consume, you
know, just 20grams of cooked egg protein,

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:52.880
it would take around seven hours until that
protein was fully utilized by your body.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.340
Now, there's no one absolute figure, but if
you look at the research that has been done

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:04.060
on whey protein absorption, the generally
accepted figure is that whey protein is absorbed

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.829
at a rate of about 8grams to 10grams per hour.

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.390
Now, that's if you're consuming the protein
on its own in isolation.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.040
When you consume the protein in combination
with other nutrients like other proteins,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:18.300
carbs and fats, then the digestion rate decreases
even further.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.099
So, the bottom line is if you're following
a standard bodybuilding diet, you know, worrying

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:30.840
about specific protein digestion rate is actually
pretty much a non-issue, you know.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.450
Again, whey protein, if it's being consumed
at 8grams to 10grams per hour, and then even

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.160
slower when you consume it with other proteins,
if you're eating, you know, every three to

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:42.530
four or five hours throughout the day, which
is what most people are doing, you know, you're

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.629
always going to have a readily available source
of amino acids.

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:51.450
So, if the absorption rate of the protein
is largely irrelevant, then, you know, really

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.000
what it all comes down to is just the basic
quality of whey versus casein.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.380
And when you look at, you know, in terms of
overall quality, there's really -- there's

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.440
really no contest.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:05.550
Whey completely dominates casein in every
category, just like whey actually dominates

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:08.330
any whole food protein source that you can
think of.

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:13.519
So, there's really two main issues when it
comes to assessing the quality of any individual

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:14.519
protein.

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:15.709
The first is the biological value.

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.459
And the second is the amino acid profile.

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.580
So when we're talking about biological value,
what we're ultimately referring to is how

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.630
much of that protein source is actually utilized
by your body.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:32.129
So, if consume 30grams of protein from source
A, how many of those grams are actually broken

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:35.280
down and absorbed by your body?

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.320
The plain fact is that whey protein has the
highest biological value of any protein source

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.010
you can possibly consume.

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:43.299
It's significantly higher than casein.

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.790
And when you actually look at casein individually,
casein has a lower biological value than a

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.020
lot of other protein sources, including, you
know, a lot of basic whole food protein sources

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.290
like beef, milk and eggs for example.

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:58.680
So, in terms of biological value, whey is
the clear winner in that -- in that case.

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:04.300
And when we're talking about amino acid profile,
basically proteins are made up of individual

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.470
components called, "Amino acids."

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:12.390
And some of those amino acids are more valuable
than others when it comes to supporting muscle

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.700
growth and recovery.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.220
There's about 22 individual amino acids, eight
of which are essential, which means that your

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.109
body can't produce them on its own.

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.200
And again, whey protein wins in this category
as well.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.930
Whey protein actually has the best amino acid
profile, not just in comparison to casein,

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.100
but in comparison to any whole food protein
source that you can consume.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:37.000
And this is largely due to its high branched-chain
amino acid content, which are the amino acids

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:43.720
L-Leucine, L-Valine and L-Isoleucine, particularly
L-Leucine which is considered the most anabolic

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:44.850
amino acid there is.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.000
A typical, you know, 30gram serving of whey
protein isolate, will generally deliver about

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.961
4grams to 5grams of branched-chain amino acid,
which is going to help you, you know, support

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:58.510
muscle growth and recovery more effectively
than other protein sources.

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.450
So, that's really all there is to it, you
know.

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:03.980
Again, digestion rate is irrelevant.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:08.330
And given that the digestion rate is irrelevant,
all you really left with is to look at the

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.360
individual quality of the protein source itself.

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.220
And whey protein is a much higher quality
source of protein than casein is.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.210
Better biological value, better amino acid
profile, not to mention that whey protein

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:23.199
is also a better tasting, mix is easier and
it's a lot more flexible.

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:27.721
I don't know if you're ever tried a pure casein
powder, but you'll notice that it's very,

00:05:27.721 --> 00:05:33.050
very thick, and it's very difficult to combine
other things with it like, you know, a food,

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.570
oatmeal or whatever else you're putting in
your shakes.

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:38.910
If you're trying to make a pure casein smoothie,
you know, good luck, it's -- it's pretty hard

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.780
to do without turning it into like a really
thick kind of sludge almost.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.139
Whereas, whey protein is a lot more flexible
in that -- in that respect.

00:05:47.139 --> 00:05:50.210
If you're looking for a top quality protein
powder to include in your muscle building

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.830
diet, make sure to check out IsoM3, that's
the whey protein that we make here at Elite

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:55.830
Impact Labs.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.210
You know, again, we don't bother with casein
powders.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:04.050
We don't even bother with, you know, the four-stage
sustained release protein powders that you

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:05.050
hear about.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:06.050
This is just hype.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:10.430
There's, you know, sometimes you see proteins
that give you whey, and casein, and egg, and

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:14.050
milk protein and it seems like a, you know,
like a good idea.

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.270
But again, in reality because digestion rate
is relevant, all you want to focus on is getting

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:20.940
the highest quality protein you can possibly
get.

00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:23.250
And whey protein is the highest quality you
can get.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.200
So, in terms of protein powder, that's what
you want to focus on.

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:30.729
IsoM3 is derived from 100% micro-filtered,
ultra-filtered whey protein isolate.

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:36.680
There's only 1gram of carbs, no fat, low sodium,
no cholesterol, no lactose, and naturally

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.680
sweetened with stevia.

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:39.800
So that's a really high quality of protein.

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:42.330
