00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.740
ponchos are one of the biggest trends this fall season

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:06.460
and they are such a great alternative to a jacket

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:08.500
it it is getting a bit chilly

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.800
what is a poncho actually?

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.040
most of you will say "looks like a blanket" true, it does!

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.780
actually it is a rectangle

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:23.520
which is split up in the middle

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.980
mine has a stitching around the edges and lots of squares in earthy colors

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.980
and now let's talk about how to wear a poncho

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.800
I just had it thrown around my shoulders

00:00:35.093 --> 00:00:37.093
it keeps you warm quite well

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.740
otherwise just take one end

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.960
and put it between shoulder an poncho

00:00:42.974 --> 00:00:44.974
pull the other side a bit down

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.180
and throw the rest over the side

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.640
that's one way to wear it

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.140
the second option how to wear your poncho 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.400
is to drape it around you like a cape

00:00:57.074 --> 00:01:00.674
take one end and put it on your shoulder again

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.160
pull the other side down a bit

00:01:04.734 --> 00:01:06.134
throw it around your back

00:01:06.934 --> 00:01:08.934
and wrap the last bit around your back

00:01:09.454 --> 00:01:11.454
if you want you can just leave the side hanging

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:13.680
or push it inside

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:19.920
I really like this style, looks a bit like out of a fairy tale

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.654
I look a bit like the red riding hood

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.440
that was the second one

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.440
let's get to the third option, you need a belt for this one

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:32.940
better take a wide one out of elastic

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.980
put it around your waist

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.760
you have to pull it a bit into place

00:01:39.855 --> 00:01:41.855
untill it looks good

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.000
all the loose ends

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.480
you can wear it closed like this

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.620
or a bit opened up

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.800
option number 3

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.720
I really like it

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:05.820
I hope you like it too

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.200
All right guys, those were my three different poncho styles

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.320
Just write in the comments if you have a poncho aswell

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.800
if you are going to get one

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.620
and what style did you like best? 1 - 2 or 3?

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.280
I really like this one so I would say number 3

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.980
if you need some more inspiration

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.660
just have a look at instagram, pinterest or even facebook

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.660
even facebook...everybody has facebook

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.380
anyways, I'm looking forward to the next video I hope you too! Bye bye!
