00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:03.496
- Hi I'm Kevin Nealon and
this is Laugh Lessons.

00:00:03.496 --> 00:00:05.322
My guest today is hilarious.

00:00:05.322 --> 00:00:07.304
She's been on The Tonight Show,
she's been on The Late Show

00:00:07.304 --> 00:00:08.797
she's been on the Late Late Show.

00:00:08.797 --> 00:00:10.063
She's done morning shows.

00:00:10.063 --> 00:00:11.608
I don't know when she sleeps!

00:00:11.608 --> 00:00:13.153
Hi Wendy Liebman.

00:00:13.153 --> 00:00:14.451
- [snoring] 

00:00:14.451 --> 00:00:15.297
- Hi Wendy!

00:00:15.297 --> 00:00:17.288
- Hi!

00:00:17.288 --> 00:00:19.224
- Thank you so much for doing this show.

00:00:19.224 --> 00:00:20.559
- Thank you for having me, Kevin.

00:00:20.559 --> 00:00:22.944
- My first question for you
Wendy is this, do you like kids?

00:00:22.944 --> 00:00:24.667
- I love kids.

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:26.390
I don't have any kids of my own.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.114
- Are you sure?

00:00:28.114 --> 00:00:31.039
- I can't have kids according to my lease.

00:00:35.955 --> 00:00:37.019
- Hi!

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:38.251
- Hi
- Hi

00:00:38.251 --> 00:00:40.163
- I'm Wendy, what're your names?

00:00:40.163 --> 00:00:41.482
- My name is Cade.

00:00:41.482 --> 00:00:42.702
- What do you do for a living?

00:00:42.702 --> 00:00:44.144
- (laughs)

00:00:44.144 --> 00:00:45.638
I golf for a living.

00:00:45.638 --> 00:00:47.245
No not for a living. (laughs)

00:00:47.245 --> 00:00:50.032
- Well I don't have any kids of my own

00:00:50.032 --> 00:00:53.377
so maybe I can adopt the two of you.

00:00:54.511 --> 00:00:56.853
I don't know that much about children,

00:00:56.853 --> 00:01:00.221
how often do I have to feed you, Aleese?

00:01:00.221 --> 00:01:02.753
- Dinner, breakfast, and lunch

00:01:02.753 --> 00:01:03.885
- That's it?

00:01:03.885 --> 00:01:05.813
- Well sometimes snack after school.

00:01:05.813 --> 00:01:09.571
- Well this really leads
me into a great topic

00:01:09.571 --> 00:01:12.744
for stand up comedy is to
talk about your family.

00:01:12.744 --> 00:01:17.744
Like my mother, she puts
down toilet paper on the seat

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:19.897
even at our relatives house.

00:01:19.897 --> 00:01:21.945
At the dinner table.

00:01:21.945 --> 00:01:23.731
- That's kind of awkward

00:01:23.731 --> 00:01:26.008
- Yeah, awkward.

00:01:26.476 --> 00:01:28.449
- Are both of you funny?

00:01:28.449 --> 00:01:29.815
- My mom and dad say I am.

00:01:29.815 --> 00:01:33.578
- My dad goes "Yeah, kid,
you're funny...looking!"

00:01:33.578 --> 00:01:36.780
- So timing is really
important in stand up comedy.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.954
Do you know this joke?

00:01:38.954 --> 00:01:40.091
Okay, Knock Knock

00:01:40.091 --> 00:01:41.501
- Who's there?
- Who's there?

00:01:41.501 --> 00:01:44.045
- Interrupting cow.

00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:47.126
- Interrupting cow w..
- Moo!

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.960
- (giggles)

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.091
- How old do you want to be

00:01:56.091 --> 00:01:58.008
when you first start
doing stand up comedy?

00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:00.788
- Any age actually, I don't care when.

00:02:00.788 --> 00:02:04.931
- So are you planning on
going to an open mic night?

00:02:04.931 --> 00:02:06.509
- I don't know what that is.

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.895
- Open mic night, that's
when you test out your jokes

00:02:08.895 --> 00:02:12.233
on strangers who are
drinking a lot of alcohol.

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:14.187
- Oh, okay.

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.897
- Which leads me to how important it is

00:02:17.897 --> 00:02:19.293
to know your audience.

00:02:19.293 --> 00:02:21.546
How old do you think I am?

00:02:21.546 --> 00:02:23.471
- Around...

00:02:23.471 --> 00:02:24.942
- Just take a wild guess.

00:02:24.942 --> 00:02:26.578
- 63.

00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:29.808
No offense.

00:02:30.615 --> 00:02:32.260
- None taken.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.342
- Self deprecating is a
really good form of comedy.

00:02:36.342 --> 00:02:40.592
That's when you make something
that makes you feel insecure

00:02:40.592 --> 00:02:42.353
or you feel bad about yourself

00:02:42.353 --> 00:02:44.755
and instead of having
somebody else make the joke

00:02:44.755 --> 00:02:46.353
you make the joke about it first.

00:02:46.353 --> 00:02:50.227
For example, I have a few gray hairs

00:02:50.227 --> 00:02:53.124
and they are on my chest.

00:02:53.124 --> 00:02:55.265
- (giggles)

00:02:55.265 --> 00:02:57.875
- Were you mocking me when you laughed?

00:02:57.875 --> 00:02:58.946
- No.

00:02:58.946 --> 00:03:00.806
- Seems like you were faking it.

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:02.799
A lot of girls fake it.

00:03:03.939 --> 00:03:05.612
Do you have anything?

00:03:05.612 --> 00:03:08.274
Does anybody ever pick on you?

00:03:08.274 --> 00:03:10.626
- Yes, like I say I want to play with them

00:03:10.626 --> 00:03:13.341
and they kind of just
run away or ignore me.

00:03:13.341 --> 00:03:15.896
- So this is where comedy comes in handy.

00:03:15.896 --> 00:03:18.330
Maybe if you say something
funny to them first

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.350
they might not run away.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.982
Like when I get on stage
and I want people to stay

00:03:22.982 --> 00:03:27.110
the first thing I say is "Oh
I just got in a big fight

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:29.141
"with my spanx".

00:03:31.511 --> 00:03:32.628
Do you know what spanx are?

00:03:32.628 --> 00:03:33.586
- No.

00:03:33.586 --> 00:03:34.597
- Oh okay.

00:03:34.597 --> 00:03:36.465
You guys are not coming
to my shows, are you?

00:03:37.615 --> 00:03:40.720
- Do any of you have a
joke you want to tell me?

00:03:41.487 --> 00:03:44.101
Okay we're going to start with Carson.

00:03:46.548 --> 00:03:49.137
- What do you call a seagull
that flies over the bay?

00:03:49.137 --> 00:03:53.950
- What do you call a seagull
that flies over the bay?

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.868
- A bagel.

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:57.981
- A bagel! (laughing)

00:04:01.029 --> 00:04:04.241
- (giggling)

00:04:04.718 --> 00:04:06.406
- That's funny.

00:04:06.744 --> 00:04:07.977
- Hey!

00:04:07.977 --> 00:04:08.812
- Hey!
- Thank you Wendy!

00:04:08.812 --> 00:04:10.056
How about a nice hand for Wendy?

00:04:10.056 --> 00:04:11.194
Give Wendy a nice hand.

00:04:11.194 --> 00:04:13.192
- These guys are awesome!

00:04:14.808 --> 00:04:16.567
- Thank you for being on the show

00:04:16.567 --> 00:04:18.652
and we're going to be
watching for you out there

00:04:18.652 --> 00:04:19.975
making people laugh.

00:04:19.975 --> 00:04:21.952
Remember if you get in
trouble what do you do?

00:04:21.952 --> 00:04:24.386
- Try to not look blamed for it.

00:04:26.151 --> 00:04:27.818
- Wendy was funny

00:04:27.818 --> 00:04:32.463
She was, don't tell her this
but kind of cuckoo funny.

00:04:32.753 --> 00:04:37.753
- So, a man was in a library
and he said to the librarian

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.199
"Can I have a cheeseburger and fries"

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:42.984
and the librarian said

00:04:42.984 --> 00:04:45.822
"Well you know you're in a library, sir?"

00:04:45.822 --> 00:04:48.340
So the man said "Oh I'm sorry"

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.220
(whispers) "Can I have a
cheeseburger and fries?"
