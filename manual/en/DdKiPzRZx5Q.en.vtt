00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.690
Hey check it out.
Here is the P55 UD4P from Gigabyte.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.050
Very, very nice motherboard 
4 series from Gigabyte,

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.260
so it's their pretty much 
enthusiast class, higher-end motherboard.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.490
Some really high end features,
right off the bat.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.660
I mean, this thing is heavy,
very stiff board.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.550
That's probably thanks 
to the Ultra Durable 3,

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:31.930
basically stick an extra
two ounces of copper

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.970
in between the layers of the PCB,
makes it a little stiffer.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.840
Gives you cleaner power,
less impedance

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.960
and then as a side benefit it actually
decreases the temperatures

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.340
of the socket and of all
the chips on the board.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.150
Just drops your overall 
case temperature a little bit

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.680
so very, very nice board.
Lots of high-end features,

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:49.700
lots of enthusiast level stuff
and we'll jump right into it.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:54.550
Starting off with the CPU socket.
Now, obviously, this an 1156,

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.100
it's your Lynnfield Intel processors,
i5s and i7s, your 750s and your 860s.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.430
Basically if you're going to get an i5,
it's going to fit no problem.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.310
An i7 will work in here, just make sure
it's the socket 1156.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.850
Now from x58 we did lose the QPI
and the triple channel memory

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.120
but to be honest with you,
that doesn't really do much

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.450
as far as performance goes.
Now they're getting,

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.920
the PCI Express bandwidth 
is going directly into the chip

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.680
through something that they call a DMI,
Direct Media Interface.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.400
You no longer have to have the QPI
to bring in your PCI Express now.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:27.130
It does have less PCI Express
bandwidth through here,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.860
there's only 16 lanes in total
but on this board,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.060
if you come down here a little bit,
you will see

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:35.310
that you do have two PCI Express 
x16 2.0 slots right there.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.480
And if you do SLI or Crossfire,
which you can do both,

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.920
they will split x8, x8.
So your x16 will be split into x8, x8,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.050
it will bifurcate and then that will give
you the ability to do SLI

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.190
with just as much speed.
Now on top of that,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.180
since we're already down here,
might as well talk to you

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.400
a little bit about the rest of it.
You have 3 PCI Express x1 2.0 right there

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.170
and you have an additional 
two PCIs down here,

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.570
so you can throw some relics on these,
maybe some TV tuner cards or whatnot.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.270
But most likely, I know you guys,
you're going to have

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.550
two nasty video cards on here.
Now besides that,

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.950
this is your P55 chipset, 
just so you guys know.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.040
It's PCH, Platform Controller Hub,
this is what does everything.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.720
This is what sends everything to the CPU
except for the PCI Express.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:25.560
So all the Gigabit Ethernets, the SATAs,
the USBs all go through this chip

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:27.160
before they go up 
to the processor.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.830
Coming up to here,
let's talk a little bit about memory.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.570
We do have 4 DIMMs in total, so you can
have up to 16GB of DDR3 memory

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.610
on this motherboard
if you use 4GB DIMMs.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.100
Most of you are going to have
a maximum of eight,

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.710
because you're not going to spend
ridiculous money to get 4GB DIMMs.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.600
Up to 2200MHz, you can actually
go even higher than that if you want.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:48.720
I believe it will support
up to 1333 natively,

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.560
but if you're buying 1600, 1800
or 2000MHz memory

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.560
you're going to know how to overclock it
to get it there anyway.

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.530
You have a lot, 
a lot of SATA ports over here.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.800
You have six that are blue,
those are your main ones

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:02.530
that are going directly 
to the Intel chipset

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.370
and these two are going to the same
chip that controls the eSATAs

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:07.470
on the back panel 
and the additional eSATA

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.070
that you can do to your
front panel connector.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.070
So these over here are the ones
that are going to let you do

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.940
your RAID functionality, that's going 
to give you 0, 1, 5 and 1+0

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.820
so you can do just about
anything you want.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:19.220
Moving to the other side
of the board,

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.360
you're going to see right over here,
starting from this side

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.730
we have ten USB 2.0 ports in total,
so here are the first two.

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.730
Here's your PS2 which is both,
your S/PDIF in both coaxial analog

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.170
and optical digital. You have
four more USB 2.0 ports,

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:37.210
two firewires, both the small ilink one
and the full size 400.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.140
And then you have dual eSATAs
which is also very nice.

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.140
You have dual gigabit LANs
which is very nice

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.550
and you have an additional
4 USB 2.0 ports over here

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.600
making the total ten, 
which is just ridiculous.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:53.290
Eight channel audio at 7.1 HD audio,
it does do Dolby Home Theater.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.260
It is that really nice controller,
the Realtek ALC889A,

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.370
so that will do all the very nice,
high-end features.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.070
And in case there's not enough
USB 2.0s in the back

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.610
you do have two additional 
headers right over here,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.280
that's going to give you
an additional four USB 2.0 ports

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.710
to your front panel 
and you have an additional firewire

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.080
which is just pretty silly.
Lots of high-end stuff here.

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:18.310
You just don't see firewires,
sometimes you do, you see one,

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:21.600
but to see three, two in the back
and one via header,

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.190
is absolutely incredible. 
Besides that, you will notice

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:25.830
you have incredible hardware
on all here.

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:29.830
You do have solid-state caps,
ferrite core chokes throughout the board.

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.300
You also have lower RDS on MOSFETs
for your voltage regulation.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:37.580
A really, really nice setup 
as far as all of that goes.

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.340
It also has the energy saver,
dynamic energy saver

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.350
which is basically a hardware chip,
it's also a software program

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.160
that goes into your computer.
It's going to help you save energy,

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.450
be a little bit more efficient.
You also have a Smart TPM,

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:55.960
or a Trusted Platform Module.
Basically, it has 2048 bit encryption,

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.700
you're not cracking that
for anything in the world.

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.600
Basically, it can work via Bluetooth or USB,
you can carry it on a USB key

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.500
or you can set it up
to pair with a phone

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:05.980
so that when it comes
within Bluetooth range,

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.900
automatically unlocks the TPM.

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.080
A lot of people are not going
to use that functionality,

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.200
but some people actually will use that
in certain applications for workstations,

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:18.150
and they just want you guys to know
that it is on here.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.450
It even advertises,
"Smart TPM" right there.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:23.320
So that's very cool, and then finally,
my favorite part about this board,

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:27.630
it's got an outstanding warranty,
three years if anything goes wrong.

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:29.390
You might have to register it,
but three year warranty

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.730
is nothing to sneer at.
Really, really good board,

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:35.240
I like it a lot. It's the P55 UD4P
from Gigabyte

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.240
and if you have questions on it
feel free to email me,

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.900
and I'll see you guys next time.
