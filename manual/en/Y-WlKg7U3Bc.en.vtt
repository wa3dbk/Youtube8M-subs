My name is Christine Marquette, and I'm a
registered and licensed dietitian, and I'm

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.070
going to talk to you about vitamins and minerals
for the immune system. As far as the immune

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:13.000
system is concerned, the primary things that
you want to make sure you keep in mind, as

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.420
far as your vitamins and minerals, are those
that are considered to be antioxidants. As

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.340
far as the vitamins are concerned,that's primarily
vitamin A, C, and E. Beta carotene is also

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.880
a precursor to Vitamin A, and is another item
that is thought of as an antioxidant. As far

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.079
as the minerals are concerned, selenium is
the major mineral that's considered an antioxidant.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.420
Zinc is another mineral that can also affect
your immune system, so you want to make sure

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.800
in considering these particular vitamins and
minerals, if you have a problem with your

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.960
immune system, say for example, you recently
suffered a bout of the flu, or the cold, or

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.899
you're somebody who does get sick very frequently,
it's probably a good idea to go ahead and

00:00:53.899 --> 00:01:00.970
get yourself a multivitamin, multi mineral
supplement, that has about 100% of the RDA,

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:06.130
from most of these major vitamins and minerals.
It's kind of a good insurance policy. You

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.039
don't want to rely strictly on your vitamin
supplement, or your mineral supplement, because

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:15.490
it should be just that. It should supplement
your diet. It shouldn't take the place of

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:20.159
a healthy diet, so as far as your diet is
concerned, to get these particular vitamins

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.539
and minerals through your foods, you want
to make sure you're including a variety of

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.149
fruits and vegetables. You want as many different
colors, as you can get in, over the weeks

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:34.329
time. Each color basically signifies a different
type of nutrient in it, a different type of

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.740
antioxidant in it, so as many different colors
as you can, over the week. It is ok to use

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.939
frozen fruits and vegetables. The way they
are processed these days, they actually are

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.039
harvested when they're at their ripest, and
then flash frozen, so they don't lose any

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:52.909
of their nutrients, so frozen could be a good
way to go. Canned vegetables tend to have

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.899
less vitamins in them, than the fresh or frozen
varieties, and a lot of times, they have a

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:02.859
lot of sodium, so if you're able to, stick
with fresh or frozen, when it comes to your

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:08.720
fruits and vegetables, as far as getting those
vitamins and minerals, to help build your

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.030
immune system.
