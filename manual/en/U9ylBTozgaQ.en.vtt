00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:11.240
I have a simple FSM setup here on game
object 1 and i would like to reuse it

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:13.600
exactly as it is on game object 2

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.190
Now lets say I created something really
important and i didn't want redo all

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.099
that work

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:19.400
there's a simple way

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.729
to save and reuse FSM's

00:00:21.729 --> 00:00:28.200
If I right click here in the
PlayMaker window and choose save template

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.060
i get a dialog box

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.670
right here i can call this

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.000
we call it random selector

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.370
because that's what this little thing
does and it'll save it into a templates

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.440
folder

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.369
and if you

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:42.770
are interested you can look under PlayMaker

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.880
the folder here in your project under
templates and you will see that it's

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:49.300
saved right there

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.510
now i can go to the second game object

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.550
right-click and instead of just adding
an FSM... i can add a template

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.350
and you see here random selector

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.920
is available for me

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.150
i click and add, and there is

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.490
so pretty cool i can just move
entire

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.310
as you can see it's it's the whole thing
it's got the same.. like, theres a wait

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.810
and random pick

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.560
come in here it's got the same stuff for
the same values

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:19.780
and it's not just for entire FSM's
either, which is pretty neat

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.560
say i wanted to add a powerful new state
to do something in here

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.360
uh... and i will call this whatever,

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.500
the state

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.530
and give it in a color

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.270
just make it Cyan

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.419
and let's say i have a new event

00:01:35.419 --> 00:01:37.270
let's make an entirely new event

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.090
and call its um...

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.079
rotate

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:43.280
thing

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.890
and add that to the state

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.630
i can now save just this one state, i could
also put actions and do anything i

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.110
wanted to it they can save just this one
state

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.430
If I come down there to save
template which has fallen just off the

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.930
bottom your screen so let me move that
up and show you

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.580
so i can save template

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:07.510
and once again i get to the same

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:09.419
save box

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:11.979
and now i can choose uh...

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:15.980
new rotator

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.519
and there's my thing

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.129
so let's look

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:21.370
back over here

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.239
if I right click

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.669
uh... i can look in and add just that
one node

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:30.249
so you can add individual nodes, you can
add groups of nodes like i could

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:31.590
save this collection

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.650
or if you just select out here you can
save the entire FSM

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.769
so it's very modular and very cool way
for you to put things together

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.430
let's take a look at the template
browser

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.370
temple browser gives us a little
more control over our templates that

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.539
we've made

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:52.639
you can see have got the new rotator it
shows it to me right there that's just

00:02:52.639 --> 00:02:54.020
that one simple state

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.809
here's our random selector which is the
four nodes that i put together

00:02:57.809 --> 00:03:00.799
and they're both under category of
general

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:05.180
let's say if i wanted to make this

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.949
some new category

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:09.689
"movers", why not

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:12.090
and uh... by now have

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.470
a new set of categories here

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.000
"movers", and "general"

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.639
just like here in the actions
browser

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:21.570
if i select on these i get different
things inside of them

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:25.600
the different actions listed, so works
in the same way if you look at the

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.889
template browser

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:29.710
and you can add it any number in here
that you'd like

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.389
and you'll see multiple ones all
underneath these categories

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:36.790
it's also very cool because you can't
dock it like you would any other

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:37.989
window

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.609
if you're going to use these a lot and
you can edit these

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.249
so for instance i wanted to change
something about this new rotator

00:03:45.249 --> 00:03:49.299
i've got it open right here and i'm
actually editing the template i'm not

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.369
editing anything on one of these

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:55.089
so instead of new state i could call it

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:56.709
rotate

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:59.279
and we could put in a description "this

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:00.500
does

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:02.509
amazing things"

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.040
and i could add an action

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.350
even, lets

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.249
add

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:11.849
a rotate action right there into this

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:17.609
and if i switch back my window which
would have probably should have docked

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.949
i can switch away, see the other one, come back, and you see that it has indeed

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:23.720
held on to those updates

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:25.530
so you can edit the

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:29.190
template directly, you don't have
to bring it out and put it on an object to do that

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:30.879
an important distinction though

00:04:30.879 --> 00:04:32.600
if i look back at this

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.930
this was not updated dynamically okay
once you've applied a template you've

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.580
added it in and it's no longer connected

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.199
but i could really simply delete that

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:44.740
come back and and uh... paste a template
and now i've got

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.900
"movers" and "general" which are the
two categories i set up

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.669
and choose that and i get that

00:04:51.669 --> 00:04:53.300
with the

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.110
action that was that with the

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:59.729
the note i've put on it with the new
name... it even comes in with the event

00:04:59.729 --> 00:05:03.449
the rotate thing which wasnt on this
FSM until we brough that in

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:04.939
.. so that is templates!
