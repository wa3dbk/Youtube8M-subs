00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:28.009
Because Nintenhorses hasn’t been made yet,
it’s Let’s Ride!

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.460
Best In Breed 3D for the Nintendo 3DS.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.980
What a freaking title, and what a freaking
game!

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.860
If you like foals.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.090
Hmph, looks like a pony to me.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:52.340
And actually, as dumb as it sounds, Nintenhorses
would probably be a much better name for this

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:53.340
game.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.220
Not only is it immensely descriptive, but
let’s be honest, almost anything would be

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:00.180
better than Let’s Ride!

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.140
Best In Breed 3D.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:11.950
You have a horse, you wash it, you feed it...you
pet it...aww, come on.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:18.409
Why the long face?

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:23.220
If you decide to pony up the dough and check
this game out, you should know it’s essentially

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.810
a game based entirely on horsing around at
the stables.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.060
There’s not an outrageous amount of content
here.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.010
It’s more along the lines of a virtual pet
for the horse lover who happens to have a

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.010
Nintendo 3DS.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:41.860
I mean, it’s not like you’re an equestrian
superhero or anything.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.810
You’re just...feeding horses.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.420
I didn’t encounter a single boss battle,
which is unfortunate.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.930
I would’ve loved to take this freaking horse
into battle, but as it turns out, he’s more

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.390
into...rolling around in the fields.

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.020
Epona would be ashamed of you.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.310
So there are several areas you need to keep
an eye on.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.410
You have to keep your horse clean, hydrated,
well-fed, exercised and generally happy.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:15.569
You can play catch with toys, you play around
in those aforementioned fields.

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:19.380
And you do it all with the touch screen and
gyroscope of the 3DS.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:24.000
So the more stuff you do with your horse,
the higher its experience and the more stuff

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.430
you can unlock.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.790
If you’re into pet simulators, you’ll
find plenty of things to keep you busy in

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:36.790
this game.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:40.840
Obviously, if you thought Nintendogs was boring,
this is not a game for you.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.290
But for an animal lover, the cuteness of petting
a pony is more than enough to make Let’s

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.290
Ride!

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.530
Best In Breed 3D a game to keep in your stable.
