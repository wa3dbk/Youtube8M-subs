00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:14.430
&gt;&gt; JEZ: Start with a stiff piece of suede, and push the lacemaker into the edge of the circle.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.000
it guarantees that you have a piece of the right width 
but starting it with a scissor cut is sometimes easier.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Then you pull the lace toward you through the lace maker 
letting it spin on the top of your hand. that's the hard way.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:49.430
It's a little easier if you turn it, switch hands, and let the leather spin.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000
just keep pulling the lace and there you go
extra pieces drop off, and you have nice even lace 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
this is a bit of stiff brown chrome tan. I scissor started this one. 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Allow that to rotate on your hand 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
keep your index finger against the back of the leather 
against the back of the lace maker

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
once again you see that action with some lighter chrome tanned, 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:30.000
this is white, fingers  up against the back of the lace maker

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
be sure it's the right way up, there you go, keep pulling, let it spin

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:43.000
a five inch square really makes a lot of lace

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
lets do that with a pair of scissors

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
index and middle fingers hold it away in front of the scissor

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000
thumb and the ring finger hold it at the edge of the scissor

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
and that also gives you a guideline for how wide the piece should be
0:02:11.000,0:01:13.500
be careful not to take too big a cut with the scissor or you will cut the lace off 
0:02:14.000,0:01:06.000
or the scissor will reach out and take a bite of you!
