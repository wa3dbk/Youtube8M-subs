00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.710
Hello Iâ€™m Doctor Heather Moore owner of
Total Performance Physical Therapy.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.450
Today we're going to go through 5 exercises
for runners that you should be doing every

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:16.449
day at home.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:21.860
You can do these every day recommended 3 times
a week at least just so you get that core

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.670
a little bit stronger and you are able to
become a more efficient runner, this will

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.812
allow your legs to be less tired and if you're
experiencing any pain in your knees or in

00:00:29.812 --> 00:00:33.610
your shins it will allow that to also help
go away.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.500
The first exercise we're going to do is a
lunge so with a lunge all you're going to

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.070
do is take a step forward the weight tend
to go to your heel and you're going to push

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.329
backwards with that if you have pain in your
knee when you do a lunge it means that you're

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.410
putting all your weight to your toe so you
want to make sure you have a conscious effrt

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.700
to put the weight in your heel, the weight
of the foot in front should be in the heel

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.739
The next exercise we're going to do is a mountain
climber so you can start off in a plank position

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.540
and if this is challenging enough for you
then hold it right there otherwise you can

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.040
do bringing up your knees to your chest rapidly,
do that for about a minute, do that about

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.420
3 times okay so rest in a little bit in between
each.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.490
The next exercise we're going to do is side
planks, with a side plank we're going to do

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.000
is start off in your hand, you want to make
sure your body is nice and level okay, you're

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.240
not sagging at the bottom, you can also do
this on your elbow if your hand is too challenging

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:42.190
you want to do this about a minute 3 times
each side, next is a reverse plank so what

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.799
you're going to do is just come up on your
hands and your feet, you want to make sure

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:52.850
your butt is nice and high and you're not
sagging again it's a straight line you're

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.520
looking for about a minute 3 times with each
of these.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.729
The next that we're going to do is bridging
alright so this is a single leg bridge, this

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.450
is a little bit more challenging, you want
to make sure your hip stay level that they're

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.780
not dropping as your leg comes up.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.760
To make it more challenging don't let your
butt hit the ground in between each one just

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.049
go nice and easy, you want to go up and down
about 30 times and then you're going to switch

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.239
to the other side again with this one you
want to make sure all the weight is in your

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:29.139
heel, you should be able to lift your toes
up without having any problems.

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:34.579
Those are the exercises that you should be
doing at home a few times a week to maintain

00:02:34.579 --> 00:02:36.239
your running core shape.
