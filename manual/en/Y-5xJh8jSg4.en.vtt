00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.060
There's a lot of different weather conditions
we can encounter out there in the winter,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:22.609
and we wanna be prepared for all of them.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.539
There's a layering system because we're
limited in the backcountry

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.589
with what we can bring, you know we can't
bring an entire closet full of clothes.

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:35.750
we want to have layers that serve
multiple purposes

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.059
that we can either use individually or

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.879
in conjunction with other layers to fit
weather conditions from

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:48.340
hot and sunny to a windy cold snowstorm.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.540
Your base layers typically a mid to light weight

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:56.079
wool or polypropylene long sleeve shirt, 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.790
a mid to expedition weight fleece or wool

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:03.940
shirt that adds an additional layer of warmth.
Beyond those,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:08.650
a windshirt thats very lightweight, it
just provides great wind protection.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.280
An additional insulating layer is
a lightweight puffy jacket.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.500
it can be thinner, it can be synthetic, it could be down,
it could even be a fleece jacket

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.810
it's not so heavy that I can't 
wear it while I'm moving.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.990
My ultimate puffy layer is a big

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.220
synthetic fill insulated jacket or

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.110
down parka with a hood. 
It's big so it can fit over

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:33.440
all of your layers and that is what I put on to

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.340
really stay warm while I'm hanging out at camp.
One other layer for the top

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.729
is a shell jacket of some sort,
so it's uninsulated.

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:45.100
The soft shell is not 100% waterproof

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.170
it's more breathable than a hard shell

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.259
or Goretex jacket and I find that the
soft shell is very functional

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.800
in the winter when we're dealing with
temperatures below freezing

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.530
and we're not getting rained on. 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.929
On our hands me recommender our students 
to bring two liner gloves,

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:06.459
two warmer gloves or mittens either
fleece or wool.

00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:09.929
a big insulating mitt and then a shell

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:14.190
mitten to go over the top of that.  Liner
gloves are because you always want

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:18.660
something on your hands, the warmer gloves start to
add some insulating layers

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.349
because the liners aren't very warm, 
and then the shell mitts

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.469
provide some water proofing for a variety of activities.

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:31.829
I typically bring two warm hats; 
one is a light weight hat

00:02:31.829 --> 00:02:36.579
that I can wear while I'm exercising and
those hats can be made of pretty much anything

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:40.780
as long as they're not made of cotton
and then on a really cold day

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.030
I have a fleece neck gaiter, the 
ultimate compliment is having

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.530
hoods in your various upper body layers.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.060
I start out with a very similar base
layer to the top, lightweight

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.690
to mid weight made out a either 
wool or a synthetic material.

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:02.340
If you're a colder person you probably 
want to bring an extra

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.880
insulating layer like an expedition
weight fleece tight.

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:09.840
I have softshell pants and similar to
the top players

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.550
you can get hard shell which is like a
Goretex or the soft shell which is

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.610
more breathable and less waterproof

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.849
and I find that the soft shell works
really well in the winter environment

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:24.090
because we have freezing temperatures.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:30.060
Your top layer on the bottom you have a big set
of puffy pants and they want to be big enough to

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.709
fit over all of your other bottom layers.

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.480
Cotton is the one material that we do not 
want to bring into the backcountry.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:42.340
When cotton gets wet it takes a while
to dry and if you're having

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.000
a wet layer of fabric against your 
skin that's going to

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.650
pull heat away from your body.  Both wool and

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.200
synthetic materials are great materials in the field.

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:57.310
Wool is a natural fiber, I think it feels
more comfortable against my skin.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.829
It has natural antibacterial properties so
it doesn't get as smelly.

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.440
Cons of wool I would say, is that it
tends to be a little bit heavier,

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.880
it's not as durable and the wool also
tends to be a little more expensive.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.109
Polypropylene is a great synthetic insulating material.

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.049
It tends to be pretty light weight, 
it's very durable

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.090
and it tends to be less expensive than

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.289
a natural fiber such as down or wool.

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:29.260
I'd say the cons to polypropylene are
that they tend to get

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.530
smelly pretty quickly and they hold on to
body odor.  Down is a great

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.400
insulating layer, it can be really 
good in a puffy jacket.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.780
One on the cons of down is that 
when it gets wet

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:45.979
it no longer insulates you.  So a lot of
times we encourage students to

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.200
use synthetic fill materials that

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.660
are a bit heavier but just as warm,
but they do have that benefit

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:56.289
if they get wet you're still 
going to stay warm.

00:04:57.289 --> 00:05:02.450
Polypro or your wool base layer tries to 
move the moisture away from your skin

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.220
so that it can evaporate and not make you cold.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:10.190
The first way to dry things out is 
with your own body heat.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.570
Wearing a wet article of clothing

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.200
is your best way to dry it out.  Obviously

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:20.599
if you're struggling to keep warm yourself
prioritize being warm

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:24.970
and dry that wet layer out later.
We have the majority of

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:28.880
the layers that we just talked about
for rent.  You can come to your NOLS

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.039
course with not a single layer

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.340
and be fully outfitted 
to head out into the mountains.
