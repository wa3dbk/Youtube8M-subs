00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.170
I think Go! is about throwing us in the deep end

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.950
and that could be seen as a bad thing, but I think it's a great thing.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.800
Go! orientation is all about getting back in
the mindset of school.

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.539
It's an opportunity to get to know your classmates, start networking with them

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.839
and just get acclimated to life as an MBA student.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.039
I think it's about getting close with the people you'll be
with for the next two years and

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.799
I think it's very important process and coming back and getting your MBA.

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.300
I think it's pretty important for you

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:34.390
and your team to understand how you are going to work.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.520
Starting off Go! week, there's some great
expectations that have been set. One is that

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.680
I'm gonna work really hard over the next
two years,

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.780
but I'm also gonna have a lot of fun and my challenge as an MBA

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.080
it's clear is to balance those two. ... I was a little surprised to tell you the truth.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.180
I I got the schedule in the mail and I was thinking.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.230
"Oh orientation for week, we'll ease into
things,"

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.690
but I was surprised to find out that we
were in fact in class.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.810
Uh we started with critical thinking and
impactful communications

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:06.229
and foundations for leadership. Again,
it's great to be in class, but I was a

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.809
little surprised. I think it's fantastic that they're getting us going out a quick pace.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.040
I think it's a great way to get everyone uh started off strong.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.490
So, your professors might be a little
tough at the beginning, but it gets you

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.500
in the right mindset

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.920
um and it just sets you up to really be successful while you're here.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.080
I think it really helps people take down
the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.100
boundaries and the a walls that they put up around themselves

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.080
and it helps them get to know each other
and really understand

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.100
you know how you fit into this greater
class

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.150
and how other people fit in. You learn about the skills you have, the skills that

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.159
other people have

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.959
um and where you need to improve and
how other people might help you. It's all about

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:49.600
collaboration and that becomes really
apparent right from the beginning of Go! week.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.440
My favorite part, if I had to choose one event, it would be the Field Day in

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:57.380
Forest Park. It was nice to be in a casual setting and to get to know my

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.680
future teammates and classmates

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.170
in a relaxed environment. I got to know personalities,

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.619
got to goof around a little bit, had a good time, but we also got to see

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:12.019
who's a leader, who's a critical thinker. It was really amazing to see

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.410
um you know different perspectives and
different people from our

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:18.599
from our class coming together and
contributing

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:22.360
from their own personal backgrounds. It's
all about diversity.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.069
You you you just don't have that type of
appreciation when you're outside

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.950
and when you get into it you really think, "okay, we have to talk

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.420
and we have to take care of each other and this is

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.489
totally new for you." ... Go! orientation is ah an opportunity

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:42.530
for the community the start to develop, formulate

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:46.060
ah and and set its own kind of course and trajectory

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.239
moving forward and the community is primarily,

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.010
new student in this case, but it's new students as they interact with all the

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.000
other members and elements of our community.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.840
They're out doing a service project. All
140 working at three different locations so

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:04.260
when you think about it in a short period of
time, there's a lot of building of this

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.030
of this ah sense of belong, this sense of being in the right place,

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.569
but most importantly, the sense of starting to get to know one another,

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.989
getting to know all the resources and people of this university

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.669
that are gonna make the next two years
really great for them.
