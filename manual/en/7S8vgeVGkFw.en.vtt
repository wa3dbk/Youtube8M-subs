00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:08.540
Hi! I'm Rachel for Expert Village. As you
can see, the dough rose nicely and now I am

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:17.750
going to divide into three and each part I
am going to put a different filling in it.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:28.990
This dough is very yeasty nice. You can see
the layers that you are going to see later

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:40.940
on in the Rugelach. So I am just going to
put a little bit of flour on top and on the

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:54.070
baking sheet.
This one is going to be a plain Rugelach.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:12.410
I am going to cut it into triangles and each
triangle I am going to cut again and it's

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:16.900
not going to stay plain afterwards because
I am going to show you how to make a special

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:28.620
syrup to pour on top which makes it delicious.
Now for our second piece of dough, I am going

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:35.360
to show you the filling that we are going
to do. We are going to put 1 tablespoon of

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:47.450
cinnamon, 3 tablespoons of sugar, 1/2 teaspoon
of cocoa and 2 tablespoons of bread crumbs.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:02:00.130
What we do, we are going to sprinkle it on
top and I am going to roll it in with the

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:13.190
rolling pin. As you see the first dough that
I showed you, the plain one, I rolled it all

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:22.910
the way to the size it was supposed to be
cut. This one I rolled it a little bit less

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:29.810
because I knew that I was going to roll it
again with the cinnamon mix so that the cinnamon

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:42.670
will go nicely inside the dough and won't
pour outside while baking it. Here we go.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:55.720
I am going to cut it. As you can see when
I finish rolling it, I am rolling it one more

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.069
time inside the cinnamon that didn't go inside
the dough.
