00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
[narrator] The Boeing 747.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
It opened up the world to long-range flight.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
It carries millions of passengers per year

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
along with millions of tons of cargo,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
and it's widely regarded as the most successful large aircraft ever built.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
But with fuel prices climbing higher and higher,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
the question became, could Boeing make the "Queen of the Skies" even better?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Could the 747 become a model of modern fuel efficiency?

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The 747-8 is an all-new airplane [David Loffing, Boeing Engineer/Designer 747-8 Wings]

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that is really built off the backbone and the foundation of the iconic 747.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
[narrator] To remake the 747, Boeing took the world's best performing large airframe

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and updated it with the advanced technology developed for the 787 Dreamliner.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
In addition to adding powerful 787-type engines,

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Boeing engineers developed an ultra-advanced wing

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
designed with complex curves and raked wing tips.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
[Loffing] At one point during the design,

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
we reached a point where we were really concerned we couldn't form the wing skins

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
into the shapes needed with our traditional building processes.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
So we brought a team together that brought in a new technology to form the wing skins

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000
on the 747-8, and it's been very successful.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
[narrator] With its advanced new wing and engines

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and a host of other improvements,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
the 747-8 offers the lowest operating costs and best fuel efficiency

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
of any passenger plane or freighter in its class.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
In fact, the new 747-8 can boast a double-digit improvement in fuel efficiency

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
from the previous model.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
[Loffing] The 747-8 represents a lot of big milestones for The Boeing Company.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
It is the biggest commercial airplane that we've ever produced,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
it's the world's fastest commercial airliner,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000
and it's one of the most efficient new large airplanes out there in the marketplace.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
At the same time, we wanted to create a really quiet airframe

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:56.000
that also lands in the same airports and can take off from the same airports as the 747-400.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
[narrator] In remaking the 747 for a new era,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Boeing engineers showed that sometimes, innovation means finding a way

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
to make the best even better.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
When you change the wing on an airplane,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
you effectively are creating an all-new airplane.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
[narrator] The result is a next-generation aircraft

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
that sets a new benchmark for large aircraft fuel efficiency and noise reduction.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
