00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.780
Thank you for inviting us here.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.230
The competitors have made their start. 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:39.200
This is a very high speed
4 kilometer per lap course.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.670
It's getting very difficult
to get the top position.

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.670
Looks as if there has been some contact.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.910
Still keeping up. Don't give up yet!

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.920
2nd position Kawajiri,
speeds to the front from the outside!

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.090
Looks like Kawajiri is leading
but Rama is not giving up!

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.020
Now Yamada is at the top
and gets the checker flag 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.460
and right behind him Kawajiri races past!

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.910
The event is off to a start.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.080
What sort of start did Mr. Choi show?

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.210
Looks to be a small accident back there.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.420
There has been some contact
between cars in the top position.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.420
In this chaos, Choi seems to be
protecting the top spot.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.920
Kawajiri races to the front. 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.990
Kawajiri has passed Takahashi
on the 1st.corner 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.960
and is now in front.
He currently takes 2nd place.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.470
Kawajiri has shortened the distance

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.140
between himself and Yoshida.
Right now it's in the 6th lap.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.440
Yamada has risen to the 3rd position.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.840
Yamada has passed Takahashi.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.440
We're into the 8th and final lap.

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:02.920
The lead, Yoshida does a half-spin!
This changes the top position!

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.290
Kawajiri lands on top! Can he maintain
this position to the finish?

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.790
The machine shakes and slides slightly 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.300
and they battle it out just barely
over the control line!

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.870
Which will it be!?

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.470
Yamada 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.570
Or is it Kawajiri!?

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:30.850
Kawajiri lands on top.
He is 0.012 seconds ahead!

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.960
Korea's Choi takes the pole position
at the start line.

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.060
But then Yamada lines up
right next to him.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:55.940
Indonesia's Rama shoots
to the top position.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.610
On the opening lap, each of the machines
race against their rivals.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.050
Yamada and Kawajiri,
who are closest to being champion 

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.810
gradually up their positions. 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.150
These 2 drivers line up
but its Yamada who takes the lead.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.820
Takahashi tries to take
Yamada's inside position

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.420
but just can't seem to get in.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.130
Yamada catches up to Sachai
and takes the top spot.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.630
Yamada finishes the first lap
in 1 minute 44.960 seconds!

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:29.740
It's astounding that
he will not give up!

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:31.610
44sec.6!

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.140
Yamada's lap time is 1 second faster.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.110
Here he aims to take it.
Yamada has got the inside!

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:40.520
He takes the lead!

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:43.050
But driver Rama is not about to give up! 
He is aiming for the inside position.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.550
They are now side by side again!

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:47.990
They go into the last and final corner.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.960
Yamada looks to take the lead!

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:57.400
There goes the checker flag!
Yamada is the winner!
