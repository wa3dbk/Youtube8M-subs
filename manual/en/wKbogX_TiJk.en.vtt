00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:03.110
I get a lot of messages from new
photographers telling me they're

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:05.000
disappointed with their photography

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.620
some even go so far as to say they
despair of taking a good image

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:12.290
now if this represents you then please don't despair because great photos are 

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:13.940
completely achievable

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.320
but first you have to give up your
attachment to shooting

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.840
amazing images yes I know that sounds
completely ridiculous, so be patient 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.410
for the next coupla minutes and let me
explain

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:28.590
first of what causes us to become disappointed?

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.200
any disappointment not just with
photography think about anytime

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.350
you've been disappointed what made you
feel

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:39.270
disappointed was it because an image
was too dark

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:43.840
or not sharp or uninspiring maybe it
wasn't how you remembered the place?

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.420
maybe you've been disappointed because
the meal wasn't great or your date didn't

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.210
show up

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.199
it doesn't matter any disappointment
these are all

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.320
expectations we have about how something should 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.260
or should not be should is a dreadful
word because it implies there's something

00:00:59.260 --> 00:00:59.879
wrong

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.809
for example the picture should be
brighter should be sharper should be

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.369
inspiring, it should be how i remember the place.

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:09.650
the food should have been great, my date should have been there,

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.320
you get the idea but the truth is

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.479
the images and events are what they are

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.470
and the fact they didn't or don't meet our expectations leaves us feeling 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:21.689
disappointed

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.990
and we shouldn't be disappointed right
it's not fair

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:28.720
I spent all his money and my pictures are crap, and my date didn't show up.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.590
the key thing here is not the physical
aspects

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:35.799
the image or the meal or the date, that leave us disappointed

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:39.600
it's the unfulfilled expectation how
they should be

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.320
that is what leaves us feeling pissed off, disillusioned and fed up. 

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.030
so please ask yourself this: how often

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.619
does anything in life match our expectations, it's almost always better 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.290
or worse, or just plain different. when our expectations are exceeded 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:59.610
it's a fantastic feeling is like wow I
gotta

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.619
really good shot, I'm not sure how I did it but

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.659
Wow you know. But when things don't 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:10.319
live up to our expectations we get upset
we get fed up and 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.519
pissed off so how can you avoid

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:16.989
that disappointment well how about
giving up

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.700
unrealistic expectations of how your images should be 

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.920
so you don't have to beat yourself up
about them

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.359
or think you're no good be honest accept
them for what they are right now

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.700
this minute especially if you're a
beginner I mean

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.730
would you buy a saxophone and expect to play sexy jazz after just a week or 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:37.060
two

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.219
or an airplane, would you expect to just jump in it and fly of to brazil,

00:02:41.219 --> 00:02:45.590
I mean that'd be crazy, so why do you expect these kind of things with your photography?

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.060
now some of you'll be saying, but I've been into photography for years and I 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:51.939
still don't take good photos

00:02:51.939 --> 00:02:55.849
well have you been into photography for
years really

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:59.389
how many hours a week do you spend on
your photography?

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:03.370
how often do you watch a video or complete a section of one of my courses 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:09.030
take notes, then go and practice it for an hour? just watching or going for a walk

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:10.849
with your camera, now that doesn't count.

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:13.939
I mean really concentrating without
distractions

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:18.689
on a regular basis the sexy jazz
saxophonist would have practiced over

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:23.109
and over and over until their instrument
has become a part of themselves

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:26.930
to be brutally honest now how much
dedicated time

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:30.959
have you put aside to improve your
photography in the last two months

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.680
and remember when you look at those
breathtaking images

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:38.099
you're not seeing the out takes the
number of times the photographer

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.699
revisited a location

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:43.449
the time they got it wrong you're only
seeing the pinnacle

00:03:43.449 --> 00:03:47.879
of that photographers work in that instance
there's something else which can

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:48.470
disappoint

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.280
photographers the glossy advertising
campaigns telling us to buy this or 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.030
that camera because he can shoot all
these breathtaking images

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.659
in the hands of an experience photographer it certainly can

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:04.169
but for beginner enthusiast
photographers it can lead us to compare

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:08.489
our images with the ones in the advert
then are brilliant brains say

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.650
my images don't like that something
wrong with me

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.370
and you're gonna feel disappointment, you bet you're gonna feel disappointment

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:21.789
so please just be kind to yourself cut
yourself some slack and be honest about

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:22.810
your abilities

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:23.490
right

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:28.509
now and set some realistic goals give up
the expectation an attachment to

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:29.830
stunning images

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:33.330
just for a wall and let your photography
be what it is

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:38.210
right now there is no shame in that
invest in yourself

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.490
on learning and practicing techniques
like exposure

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.970
focal length: debt the field composition
all these can be practiced anywhere

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.419
in the living room the garden the car
park at work in your lunch break

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:53.680
and the really cool thing is as you
practice these things and you learn how

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:55.240
to control your photography

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:58.900
those exciting images that we all crave
will start to come along

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.409
on their I absolutely promise you that
now

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:06.699
I am NOT saying in any way don't
challenge yourself

00:05:06.699 --> 00:05:10.130
I wanna be very clear about this
challenges are great

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.220
they help us grow they help us learn
more achieve more and consequently feel

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:15.860
good about ourselves

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.539
set yourself challenges that will lead
you to become more fulfilled

00:05:20.539 --> 00:05:24.259
and are aligned with the commitment to
improving your photography

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:28.599
allocate time each week to learn the
technique maybe a lunchtime challenge

00:05:28.599 --> 00:05:33.070
like five long lens photos in my place
to work into a wide lens

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:36.530
image challenge the next day use your
imagination

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:40.750
and you'll see the possibilities are
endless so in a nutshell

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.930

disappointment

your abilities and skills
