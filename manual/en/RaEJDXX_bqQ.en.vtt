00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.880
(Childish Laughter)

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:05.020
One more thing.

00:00:05.057 --> 00:00:06.657
(Throws Rack) Perfect.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.200
And they are all in there.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.100
Oh, he is thrilled to be here, as usual.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.140
Guess who found the Psycho Dad shirts?

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.480
And we have it in black too!

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.320
Wait, hold on. Got to do it for the camera. There is the camera.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.740
Yeah, there we go.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:26.860
Blech.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.780
He is going to be missing out on Black Ops 2.

00:00:30.171 --> 00:00:32.251
We got- What else we got in here?

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.520
Cannot really tell...

00:00:33.894 --> 00:00:35.254
Fucking Saints Row.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.220
Got Halo.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.840
Banjo-Kazooie. Fucking Yooka-Laylee is coming out. Nobody gives a shit!

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.280
Aw, man. He is going to be so pissed off.

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.840
Ah, not as pissed as this guy is right now.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.930
(Gnomish Laughter)

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.000
Oh, man.

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.229
Serves him fucking right, little fucking asshole.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.840
(Exasperated Giggles)

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.480
Oh, I cannot wait to see Jesse try and dig this shit up with a fucking spade shovel.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.860
This is going to be fucking hilarious.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.120
Dad? Oh shit!

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.200
Dad, what the Hell are you doing?

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.280
What are you doing outside? You never come outside!

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.875
It is always a problem when you are filming.

00:01:15.933 --> 00:01:16.953
The fuck is going on here?

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.760
What the Hell?! Dad!

00:01:19.881 --> 00:01:21.481
Dad, what are you doing?

00:01:21.481 --> 00:01:24.461
What did you do with my stash, man? Leave my fucking stash.

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.710
Shut the fuck up, dude.

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.670
Dr. Nelson, this is not- She would not approve of this!

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.838
Dr.Nelson is not here!

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.860
I know! I know! But you cannot do this!

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.400
(More Laughter)

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.160
Dad!

00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:36.825
It is happening!

00:01:36.825 --> 00:01:37.853
You will learn!

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:40.920
What do you mean, "I will learn"? This does not teach me anything!

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.387
What do you mean, "Not teach you anything"?

00:01:43.387 --> 00:01:45.987
You were the one that hooked up with the T-shirts, are you not?

00:01:45.987 --> 00:01:49.147
Yes, because I am trying to make money! That is what this is all about!

00:01:49.147 --> 00:01:52.567
Yeah, disrespect me by hooking up with your Mom and creating shirts.

00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:54.449
Disrespect me? You are the one burying all my games!

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.800
Yeah, I am burying your games because you have to let go!

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:59.680
God, you would think it was like a fucking stash of drugs.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.390
I am not going to let you do this!

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.860
Dad. Come on!

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.880
Come on! You destroy my games- Oh, shit!

00:02:06.121 --> 00:02:07.721
You are ruining my life!

00:02:07.721 --> 00:02:10.541
I am not ruining your life, the games are ruining your life.

00:02:10.604 --> 00:02:12.444
I am trying to make my- Fuck!

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.220
What the Heck ails you? What are you do-

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.350
(Impish Laughter)

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.580
Let them go! (Gollum Impression)

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:22.590
LET THEM GO!

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:25.800
I am not letting go shit! Stop fucking filming!

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.440
Selling the Psycho Dad shirts is driving you crazy!

00:02:31.147 --> 00:02:31.647
Hey!

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.360
Holy shit. What are you going to bury me too? Get out of the hole.

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:35.360
Holy shit, I got to get off- Dad!

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.160
Who is the Psycho now?! Dad! YOU ARE!

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.200
It is why I made a fucking shirt!

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.276
Fuck, shit! Dad!

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:43.200
DAD!

00:02:43.749 --> 00:02:45.029
Get out of the hole!

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:49.860
What the fuck?

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.000
Is he moving?

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.020
HOLY SHIT!

00:02:53.525 --> 00:02:54.885
Dumbass. Holy shit!

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.860
Dude!

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.840
Dude, are you alright?

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.960
Is he moving yet?

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.880
Dude.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.900
Holy fuck. (The Resurrection)

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.040
(Coughs)

00:03:04.843 --> 00:03:05.883
What the fuck?!

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:07.120
Hah! Holy shit!

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:10.585
(Wheezes)

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:13.040
Fuck you, dude!

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.740
Fuck, it is all over my-

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:16.960
Ah, you are alright!

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.820
Little hobbits come out of the ground.

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.205
How the fuck do I get out of here?

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.640
Fuck!

00:03:21.748 --> 00:03:23.428
Fucking turn it off! Now!

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.320
You are not putting this on!

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:28.720
Fucking Dad, come on!

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.760
The Precious! I told you to get out of the hole! Must save the Precious!

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.470
Little Hobbits come out of the ground!

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.820
(Laughter)

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.320
(Cracking Up) What's the matter, a little dirty?

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:48.780
Holy shit.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:51.640
Feel better now? Fuck you!

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:57.970
Trying to get water damage on my other camera?

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.560
Dad! Fuck. Fuck. Dad! (Hits Ground) OW!

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.380
(Jeffrey Dies)

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.160
(Moaning Myrtle)

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:13.900
Stay away from the hole, have you not learned your lesson?

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:15.490
Dad! Dad!

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.910
I learned my lesson! I learned my-

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.300
Stand by the hole and I will bury you again.

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.350
DAD!

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:31.740
(Mechanical Sounds)

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.120
Get that fucking- (Laughter)

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.320
Dad! I get it!

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:38.079
I fucking get it!

00:04:38.079 --> 00:04:38.993
(Throws Game)

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.640
What is that going to do?

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:43.760
Get more shirt sales!

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:45.580
(Obnoxious Laughter)

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.180
Dude, you cannot even see them. They are gone now!

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.865
Why do you not get the fucking spade and try and dig that shit up, dude?

00:04:51.865 --> 00:04:53.445
Shut the fuck up!

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.600
(Eats Shirt)

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.340
Dad! Dad!

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.800
(More Mech Sounds)

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:06.300
There!

00:05:06.463 --> 00:05:08.463
Hey, you saved Halo 4 at least!

00:05:08.463 --> 00:05:08.960
(Punts Ball)

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:11.620
Enjoy your games! What?

00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:15.160
I fucking hate you!

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.780
(Launches Ball)

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.580
Yeah, that will show him!

00:05:22.119 --> 00:05:23.639
Shut the fuck up, dude!

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.320
That will show him.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.200
("Salt in Wound"-Laughter)

00:05:30.099 --> 00:05:31.319
Oh, God. Here we go.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:35.560
Oh, shit. The little island native again!

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:36.940
Fucking island native!

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.660
I do not always come outside, but when I do...

00:05:41.660 --> 00:05:44.760
Help me, seriously. Just drop the camera and help me dig them out.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.269
I am not going to help you dig them out, dude. You got a problem.

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.760
You could use a shovel.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.233
Do you know how much fucking money that cost?

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:52.960
I fucking-

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.260
I hope I hit you in the fucking dick.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:00.940
Almost. It was down the other leg.

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.973
This was like over a grand at least.

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.780
I collected these for years. Xbox 360 had like a ten-year lifespan and now it is fucking buried!

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.400
Not all of it!

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:12.140
Could you get a shovel or something?

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:15.940
(Giggles)

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:18.940
What? You saved Black Ops?

00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.440
I got Halo. You got Halo, Dead Rising 2 and Left 4 Dead. I think you are good.

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.459
You will be okay. (Laughs)

00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.320
I just...I just.

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.160
Dude, I was just trying to make money off merchandise.

00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:34.330
Well, Dad did not like that very much.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.320
Dad was not supposed to know about it.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:37.400
Yeah.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.740
Well-

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:41.460
(Incoherent)(Laughs)

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.100
Dude, I just cannot wait until something shitty happens to you.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:48.350
Aw, that is fucked up.

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.230
Oh, and I just got fucking buried and that is not?!

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.460
Well, you should not have gone in the hole when there was a backhoe in front of you.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.960
I am not just going to let him bury my games.

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:01.980
Well- I do not care what fucking Dr.Nelson says.

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:05.640
(Giggles) I am going in the pool.

00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.200
Okay. You might have a game in there too. Who knows.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:13.160
You wait, dude. You wait.

00:07:15.320 --> 00:07:16.900
I am not the only one who likes games, asshole.

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:20.820
And here I go!

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:23.660
And there go my balls!
