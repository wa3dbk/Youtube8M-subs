00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.099
In our galaxy, stars are distributed such
that there is a star roughly every light year.

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:29.449
The actual distance between them depends on
where we are within the galaxy - stars are

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:35.480
closer together near the center and they are
spread farther apart in, for example, our

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.380
neighborhood, the outer spiral arms.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:45.829
The closest star to our Sun is a little over
four light years away, but even at this relatively

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:52.079
close distance, getting to it may prove impractical.
The distances to even our closest stellar

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.620
neighbors is daunting; the voyage plagued
by the painfully slow speeds we are forced

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.340
to abide.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.610
The current state of our technology limits
how fast we're able to go. Our foreseeable

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.170
future does not seem to disclose a path to
enabling the very fast speeds required for

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:20.060
convenient and speedy interstellar journeys.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.970
As an example, let's take a look at how our
current interstellar probes are doing. The

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:31.270
Pioneer 10 and 11, and the Voyager I and 2
probes are all on a trajectory out of our

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.690
solar system and will eventually reach the
stars.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:43.810
As of March 27th, 2011, Voyager I, the most
distant of the probes, was 116 astronomical

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:55.970
units, or 17 435 946 096 kilometers away and
is speeding away at 17 km every second.

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.900
If we include it's circular trajectory as
it left Earth and past the outer planets,

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.350
the Voyager 1 probe has travelled a total
of 19 billion kilometers since it was launched

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.280
in 1977.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.730
Now that it has finally left the boundaries
of our solar system, it's speed isn't likely

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:20.390
to change very much in the future, so we can
use its current speed to answer the question,

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.510
how long will it take to get to the stars?

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:36.590
At this velocity, Voyager is on pace to traverse
one light year in 17,500 years. Slowly but

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:43.780
surely both Voyager probes will reach the
stars. In about 40,000 years, Voyager I will

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:56.890
roam within 1.6 light years of the star AC+793888
in the constellation Camelopardalis.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:04.510
In 296,000 years, Voyager 2 will pass within
4.3 light years of Sirius, the sixth closest

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:08.450
star to us in the constellation Canis Major.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:16.570
These are the fastest vehicles ever constructed
by human beings and their arrival time to

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:21.709
the stars is measured in tens of thousands
of years.

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:28.340
To take almost 300,000 years to travel to
the sixth closest star does not make for practical,

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:33.680
convenient journeys within our galaxy. Either
we must invent new technologies to speed up

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:39.540
our spacecraft, or build generation ships
that would land our very distant decendants

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.250
on the shores of another world.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:49.560
Pioneers 1 and 2, along with the Voyager probes
are inching their way into the vast reaches

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.630
of interstellar space. While the pioneer spacecraft
are no longer functioning, both of the Voyager

00:03:54.630 --> 00:04:00.360
probes are still active. Still recording data,
their distant, feeble signals reaching Earth

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.240
in a whisper.

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.959
As they finally make their way past the closest
stars to our Sun, they will act as our emissaries,

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:15.890
carrying an interstellar greeting card filled
with images and sounds of the planet that

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.910
sent them on their way.

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:26.150
It isn't likely that anyone will ever open
our greeting card, but the fact they every

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:31.380
probe we've launched outside of our solar
system carries one, reflects the hope that

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:36.699
if anyone does, they've likely managed to
survive The Great Filter and are successfully

00:04:36.699 --> 00:04:38.710
living among the stars.
