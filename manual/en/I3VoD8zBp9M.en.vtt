Hello, this is Russ from Salt Lake City Bicycle
Collective. Online at slcbikecollective.org.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:09.550
Also here on behalf of Expert Village. We're
going to show you today how to adjust a threaded

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.210
headset. There's often different sizes. In
this particular situation, we're dealing with

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.850
a one inch. There's also inch and an eighth,
so you want to make sure that if you're ever

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.519
looking for new parts for your headset, that
you're asking for the right size 'cause they

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.699
do look very similar. You're going to need
one bike specific tool for this. If you have

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.269
two of them, it makes it easier; otherwise
you can also obtain a crescent wrench or something

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:31.560
else for the top. It?s really important that
when you're using the tools on these, that

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.980
you don't slip and kind of maul the sides
of them. They do have a tendency to round

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.953
out relatively easily and when you get to
that situation, you're not going to be able

00:00:37.953 --> 00:00:42.790
to adjust it anymore. So the situation that
we have here is that our headset here is pretty

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.690
rattly and loose. So the first thing we're
going to do, is we're going to take this and

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.980
thread this bottom one down. You should be
able to thread this one down by hand pretty

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.650
easily. You're looking for good roll ability.
This one right here is a little too tight,

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.640
so we're going to come back off of it just
a little bit. You should have a situation

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.820
where the handlebars move freely side to side
pretty well. After you have that one located

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.260
where you want it, you're going to want to
hold that one in place with one wrench. Its

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.782
a 32 millimeter on the bottom, sometimes it
can be a 30, depends on how old your bike

00:01:07.782 --> 00:01:12.930
is, could be a 36 if you're on a newer style
bike. Then on the top, you're going to have

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.300
another 32 on the top and what you're going
to do is, you're going to hold the bottom

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.280
one. This is much like doing a hub adjustment.
Hold the bottom one into place and then thread

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.730
the top one down a little bit. I have my leg
against the side of the wheel here so that

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:27.340
the wheel doesn't move on me while I'm trying
to do it. You're just going to bring these

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.229
two wrenches together 'till you get to the
point where you have a proper adjustment.

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.750
Right now, it?s just a little bit on the tight
side, so what we're going to do is we're going

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.220
to take and just back this one off again just
a little bit and double check it again. See

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.040
how it rolls. Still a little bit too tight.
This is normally how it goes. So you're going

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.870
to want to back it off again just a little
bit. We're just looking for that adjustment

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:50.229
where it rolls nice and smooth like that.
After you have everything adjusted, you want

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.670
to double check and make sure that you have
everything nice and tight on the top. This

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.490
one will chronically come loose over time,
so you just want to bring those two wrenches

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.590
together, make sure that it?s nice and tight.
If you feel good about your adjustment there,

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:02.591
then you're good to go, ride no-handed down
the road.
