00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.380
- Hi guys, how's it going, Anne here,

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.510
and today I have another fun
DIY project for back to school

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:08.220
since it's back to school season,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.520
that's what we're going
to be doing this month.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.600
So today, I'm going to show you guys

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.440
a really fun and cool way on how you can

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.610
organize all of your school supplies,

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.940
mostly your pencils, your
pens, and your markers,

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.110
and the great thing about
this DIY is that you

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.410
can take things from your home,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.040
recycle, re-purpose them
into this awesome organizer.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:33.330
So, all you will need for this DIY is

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:35.690
a old plastic bottle, and I will be

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.500
re-purposing my old pair of jeans,

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.250
you can also re-purpose any
other old clothing items

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.510
you have at home.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.970
Next you will need some shoe
laces and a hot glue gun.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.050
So let's go ahead and get started.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.430
Alright guys, so before we do anything,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.520
make sure to clean your bottles.

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:58.140
Starting with one bottle,
tape it down to your table

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.223
so that way it can give you
a nice and secure way to cut.

00:01:01.223 --> 00:01:04.690
I'm using the top line around
my bottle as my cutting guide.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.860
After you cut off the
funnel part of your bottle,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:08.110
put it to the side.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:10.200
Now it's time to cut
off a piece of fabric.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.870
I'm using the leg opening
of my older jeans,

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:18.250
and I'm cutting about 11
inches from the hem line up.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:19.630
This is more than what I need,

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:21.920
but because I will be folding down

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.130
a little loop in order
to insert my draw string,

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.123
it's always good to
cut more than you need.

00:01:27.123 --> 00:01:28.672
Alright, so lay down your fabric

00:01:28.672 --> 00:01:31.350
with the right side facing upward at you,

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.310
then lay down the bottom
of your bottle just like so

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:37.560
and glue the center to the edge.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.230
Now glue the rest of the
fabric around the bottle.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.190
If you have any fabric left over,

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.530
just snip it off and glue
the seams in together.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.160
Just do this to the bottom
part and not the top part

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.910
because you will need
to flip this inside out.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.870
Make sure the glue is set and dry

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.030
and then turn this inside out.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.960
It's now time to attach the draw string.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.340
What you want to do is
lay the draw string in

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.460
and fold the fabric over.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.090
You're going to fold in
about one to two inches.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.510
Glue the fabric together,

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.680
and let the ends of the draw
string peak out on both sides.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.310
Glue the rest of the seams together

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.304
and make sure to just leave enough space

00:02:21.304 --> 00:02:23.320
where the draw strings are peaking out

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.690
so that way you can tie it together.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.860
Before using this, make sure

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.610
that all the glue is set and dry.

00:02:35.442 --> 00:02:37.370
Alright guys, that is it for today.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.572
I really love how this turned out,

00:02:39.572 --> 00:02:41.460
and just like with all of my DIY's,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.750
you can personalize this
to however way you'd like.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.840
You can add decorative
tape on the bottom of this

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.010
or metallic polka dots,
it would look really cute.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.180
There's so much you can do,

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.640
you can use a different plastic bottle,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.270
this is just what I have in my home.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.850
So just be creative, you know,

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.390
think of all the
possibilities that you can use

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:03.230
to make this DIY.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:04.610
