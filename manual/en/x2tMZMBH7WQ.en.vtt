00:00:00.524 --> 00:00:05.906
God is our refuge and strength; a very present help in time of trouble.

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:09.276
That's Psalm 46:1, and in the next few verses of that Psalm,

00:00:09.276 --> 00:00:15.482
we see the beautiful illustration of God being our peace and our comfort in the midst of disaster.

00:00:15.482 --> 00:00:20.087
In verses 2 and 3, we see that even though the icons of strength -- the mountains will crumble,

00:00:20.087 --> 00:00:25.493
the seas will rage, the waves will go crazy, but we have God being our peace,

00:00:25.493 --> 00:00:31.298
and in verse 10 saying, "Be still, and know that I am God."

00:00:31.298 --> 00:00:38.305
Paul calls God, the "Father of mercies," and the "God of all comfort" in 2 Corinthians 1:3.

00:00:38.305 --> 00:00:40.107
Sometimes we go through these things,

00:00:40.107 --> 00:00:46.419
because we can experience those, rely on God and see His comfort, and when other people are going through these things,

00:00:46.419 --> 00:00:48.883
we can comfort them, as well.

00:00:48.883 --> 00:00:53.487
It's not an easy thing to go through -- I'm sure you've been through a lot, too.

00:00:53.487 --> 00:00:59.293
But see, we can either be like Jonah and run directly away from God,

00:00:59.293 --> 00:01:04.097
or we can be like Job, and fall on our knees before God and seek His help.

00:01:04.097 --> 00:01:11.505
It's either pride or humility, and in disaster, may we all seek God and not run.

00:01:11.505 --> 00:01:16.476
Habakkuk -- he was a prophet of God.  It's a very obscure book from the Old Testament,

00:01:16.476 --> 00:01:19.880
but it's a wonderful one -- it's also a book about suffering.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.484
At first, Habakkuk doesn't understand fully what God is doing.

00:01:23.484 --> 00:01:26.287
God is chastising His people with a more wicked nation than they.

00:01:26.287 --> 00:01:34.695
But at the end, when he comes to realize and still knows (he's an obedient prophet of God),

00:01:34.695 --> 00:01:37.698
That even though the fig tree doesn't bear any figs,

00:01:37.698 --> 00:01:39.700
even though the vines don't bear any fruit,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.103
even though there are no sheep left in the field,

00:01:43.103 --> 00:01:47.107
and even though there are no animals in the stalls,

00:01:47.107 --> 00:01:53.080
yet we still know that God is faithful, and he will yet praise Him.

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.685
And that's my hope for you all -- when you go through disaster, trust in God.

00:01:57.685 --> 00:02:01.088
If you know someone who is going through disaster, be there for them.

00:02:01.088 --> 00:02:06.493
Be that incarnate love of God for them.  Share the love of Jesus with them.

00:02:06.493 --> 00:02:11.698
Sometimes just listening is great.  Other times, definitely pray for them while there!  That's huge!

00:02:11.698 --> 00:02:15.902
Our power is in prayer!  It's a gift from God.  It's not our own power and strength.

00:02:15.902 --> 00:02:18.305
But God can work through us.

00:02:18.305 --> 00:02:23.310
So again, if you are going through disaster, or if you know someone who is going through it, trust in God.

00:02:23.310 --> 99:59:59.000
Seek Him first.  Be blessed.  Know that God is our Father of mercies and God of all comfort.  God bless you.
