Hi. I'm Karen for Expert Village. Okay. And
then when you get a good amount of stuffing

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:20.080
in there you can pull your threads. Secure
the stick to the ground a little better, or

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:29.529
to a chair or something to get some pressure.
Okay. And push this stuffed and pull your

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:38.799
thread at the same time. See, that gathers
it up nicely. Now, you want to get your thread

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:50.389
into the groove and wrap around. Go all the
way around once and keeping pulled tight,

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:58.519
you can give it a squeeze to get it pulled
tight. I caught a little bit of the mane there.

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:06.200
I'm just going to pull that out. Get the thread
in the groove holding it taut. Catch some

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:15.100
of the fabric. You're going to have to keep
holding that rather firm. Put the thread in

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:25.500
the groove, go half way around and catch some
fabric with the needle pulling it down and

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:35.610
tight. Get in the groove again and keep going
around like quarter turns and grabbing a little

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:45.490
bit of fabric each time. And that will secure
the horses head. You want to do this quite

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:55.590
a few times. You want that head to be on there
good and secure because children have a knack

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:11.009
of pulling things apart. So you want them
to be good and strong. And keep going around.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.489
When I turn it I'm wiggling the threads into
the groove. I want the threads to stay in

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:43.030
the groove because that's what's going to
hold the head down on the stick. Get those

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:51.440
wiggled up into the groove. Grab more fabric.
Just keep doing this until you get close to

00:02:51.440 --> 00:03:02.290
the end of your thread. If you've only threaded
your needle with a short piece of thread you

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:09.970
can knot this and then repeat it. Re-thread
your needle and go around until you feel like

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:19.170
you've got a good secure head. Okay, I'm going
to go around one more time in the groove.

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:29.050
Push my thread into the groove and I'm just
going to pick a spot to tie a knot. Just catch

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:36.220
a little bit of fabric, do a couple stitches
and then finish off with a knot.
