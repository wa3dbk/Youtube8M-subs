00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.960
So, you want to make it big on YouTube,
but you don’t know quite how.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.360
Well, watch this video, and it will
tell you exactly what you need to do.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.080
Probably.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.560
Just making a video and uploading it
is simply not good enough.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.480
The reason for that is that there are thousands
and thousands and thousands and thousands

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.200
of videos on YouTube,
and yours is just one of them.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:28.160
I mean, just look at this!

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:34.040
You can fly to California,
get to San Bruno,

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.320
got to YouTube headquarters and
beg them to make you famous,

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.840
and they still won’t do it.
Believe me, I’ve tried.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.160
First of all, some things
you should not be doing.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.080
You should not be using copyrighted material,
you should not write misleading text,

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.000
and you should not try spamming.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.960
Using copyrighted material
might work for a little while,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.120
but unfortunately, if you do it
without proper authorization,

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.880
the copyright owners have the right
to take your video down,

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.680
and this may result
in you losing your channel.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.800
And then you’ll have no chance of fame.

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.360
Don’t use misleading text in your
video title, video description or video tags,

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.480
because then people looking for a completely
different video will find yours instead,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.680
and they will get really very annoyed about it.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:22.320
Another way to really annoy people and make them
not want to watch your videos at all

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.600
is to spam them with loads of private messages
and comments and random friend requests

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.840
begging them to watch your videos.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.600
That will just turn you into a spammer,
and nobody likes a spammer.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.720
So how do you do it?
Well, the first thing is to make videos,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.240
and keep making videos.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.920
And make sure that each video you upload
is better than the last video you uploaded;

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.440
this way, people will get lots of fresh content
every time they go to your channel,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:54.400
they’ll be more motivated to subscribe
and watch new videos that you produce,

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.640
and... your videos should improve.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.760
Another important thing is to network:
network like crazy!

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.400
Get to know people, let people get to know you;

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.400
make sure you give the impression
that you are a nice, helpful, generous...

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.200
...knowledgeable, interesting person:

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.280
somebody someone might want to subscribe to
just because they’re so gosh darn cool.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.800
Start off by subscribing to channels
that you’re genuinely interested in.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.400
Watch their videos, comment on them,
make video responses to them,

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.560
but do make sure that your comments and responses

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.920
are actually relevant to the video
you’re commenting and responding to,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.840
otherwise people will think you’a spammer,
and as we said before, you don’t want that.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.800
Also, take part in any contests,

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:43.520
especially if they’re organised officially,
by for example YouTube themselves.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.600
And take part in any collaborations
that you see coming your way.

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.160
Finally, though, don’t hold your breath:

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.880
I can’t guarantee that this is
going to catapult you to YouTube fame,

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.880
although it should increase your chances
just a little bit.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.600
But even if it does, it’s going to take time:

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.240
it’s going to take time
to get an audience together,

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.480
to create a solid fan base you can build on.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:12.520
It’s going to take months, possibly years,
of dedicated hard work,

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:15.360
but stick at it, and it should be worth it.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.120
And now, I’m completely out of breath,
so I’m going to...

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.240
...have a lie-down.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.760
I think I may have done something
to my blood pressure.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.560
Oh, by the way:

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.560
one way to get famous is to make tutorials
on how to make it big on YouTube.
