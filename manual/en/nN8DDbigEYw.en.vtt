When you're in the supermarket and see these
do they scare you? They shouldn't. I'm Jawara

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:15.120
the chef, and today I will show you how to
make eggplant casseroles. The first thing,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:34.870
you have to cut the top off, then the ends,
and then start slicing them; the skin off.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:55.820
Once you finish taking the skin off then you
will start slicing bout a 3/4 inch thick.

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:04.000
After you finish slicing them you put them
on a plate and then you put a little salt

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.110
on them. Put a little salt, salt brings out
the extra moisture in eggplants; they are

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:23.010
very moist. Just a little salt.

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:38.160
Crack three eggs in a bowl and then whisk
them right up. I have my flour, I have my

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:55.570
egg batter, and I have my bread crumbs. Just
a little flour, a little egg, and bread crumbs.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:21.709
Repeat that, just remember try to keep one
clean hand and one use hand. K, then you can

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:30.400
bring it over to your hot pan; I already put
some olive oil in, moderate heat. "flip one

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:45.260
over here". Nice golden brown texture, that's
what you want to have. Now my eggplant is

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:50.370
already cooked, already put sauce, spaghetti
sauce in the bottom of my dish. And I'm going

00:02:50.370 --> 00:03:16.370
to start laying my eggplants in.
Put a little more sauce,

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:56.469
and my fresh mozzarella cheese; "nice". Just
a little more sauce, now our dish is finished.

00:03:56.469 --> 00:04:20.510
Now I already had preheated my oven with 350
degrees, put your eggplant in for 40 minutes.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:27.970
Now 40 minutes is up, I first got it out the
oven now. Still hot and bubbly, look at the

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:36.910
pretty texture and everything. I'm Jawara
the chef and that's how you cook eggplant

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.570
casserole.
