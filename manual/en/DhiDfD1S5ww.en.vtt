00:00:10.915 --> 00:00:12.872
[This question] comes from Rod...

00:00:12.872 --> 00:00:17.461
Do Christians fall down involuntarily

00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:20.461
while worshiping God?

00:00:20.461 --> 00:00:23.312
I've been worshiping God 
with the praise of my lips,

00:00:23.312 --> 00:00:26.312
and had all the strength 
removed from my legs

00:00:26.312 --> 00:00:29.421
which has made me fall to the ground 
or into the chair behind me.

00:00:29.421 --> 00:00:31.219
Is this a Biblical experience

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:33.519
or am I being seduced by another spirit?

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:36.319
I'm not one who wants to 
place my faith in experience,

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:37.388
but the Word of God

00:00:37.388 --> 00:00:39.832
knowing that the heart 
is deceitfully wicked.

00:00:39.832 --> 00:00:42.145
Now here's the thing, listen:

00:00:42.145 --> 00:00:44.268
True Christians have experiences -

00:00:44.268 --> 00:00:45.918
no question about it.

00:00:45.918 --> 00:00:48.166
Being saved is an experience!

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.043
I've never known a person truly saved

00:00:50.043 --> 00:00:53.043
that their salvation wasn't an experience.

00:00:53.043 --> 00:00:56.860
True Christians have 
experiences. That happens.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.225
But you know what? Lots of 
not-true-Christians have experiences.

00:01:01.225 --> 00:01:02.930
There is the Holy Spirit.

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.990
The Holy Spirit, if He 
bears witness with our spirit

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.800
that we are children of 
God? That's an experience.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.452
If the love of God is poured

00:01:12.452 --> 00:01:15.062
into my heart by the Spirit, 
that's an experience.

00:01:15.062 --> 00:01:17.764
If men's hearts are 
regenerated by the Spirit,

00:01:17.764 --> 00:01:20.365
you better believe 
experiential things happen.

00:01:20.365 --> 00:01:22.091
If I become a new man,

00:01:22.091 --> 00:01:23.548
old things pass away;

00:01:23.548 --> 00:01:24.775
all things become new.

00:01:24.775 --> 00:01:26.505
Folks, that's an experience.

00:01:26.505 --> 00:01:28.515
You become filled with the Spirit.

00:01:28.515 --> 00:01:31.695
Acts repeatedly speaks about 
that. That's an experience.

00:01:31.695 --> 00:01:34.861
But, demons also do experiences.

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:38.501
There are unbelievers that 
have demonic experiences.

00:01:38.501 --> 00:01:41.131
And they think it's of God. Ok?

00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:46.451
Here's the thing. How can 
we tell the difference?

00:01:46.451 --> 00:01:49.589
Well, the Scripture talks 
about testing the spirits.

00:01:49.589 --> 00:01:54.449
How do we test the spirits?

00:01:54.449 --> 00:01:57.312
By the Word of God. 
That's absolutely right.

00:01:57.312 --> 00:01:59.083
And when we go to the Word of God,

00:01:59.083 --> 00:02:01.863
the Word of God teaches us 
things about the Spirit of God.

00:02:01.863 --> 00:02:04.004
And where the Spirit of God is,

00:02:04.004 --> 00:02:07.224
the Spirit of God works 
based on the truth

00:02:07.224 --> 00:02:10.201
that is revealed about that Holy Spirit

00:02:10.201 --> 00:02:12.189
in the Word of God.

00:02:12.189 --> 00:02:17.266
And so, there are certain 
things we can look at.

00:02:17.267 --> 00:02:21.217
I would just say this: Sarah Edwards,

00:02:21.217 --> 00:02:23.487
Jonathan Edwards' wife, listen,

00:02:23.487 --> 00:02:25.487
she had an experience that went like this:

00:02:25.487 --> 00:02:27.025
She says, "At one time,

00:02:27.025 --> 00:02:29.505
my strength was immediately taken away,

00:02:29.505 --> 00:02:31.505
and I sunk down on the spot."

00:02:31.505 --> 00:02:34.673
Sound familiar? Just 
like this guy's situation?

00:02:34.673 --> 00:02:37.633
"Those who were near raised 
me, placed me in a chair."

00:02:37.633 --> 00:02:39.272
Sounds very familiar - this guy,

00:02:39.272 --> 00:02:42.072
all of a sudden his strength's 
gone, he falls in a chair.

00:02:42.072 --> 00:02:43.906
All of a sudden her strength is gone.

00:02:43.906 --> 00:02:46.366
She didn't fall in a chair, 
she went to the ground

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.216
and other people put her in the chair.

00:02:48.216 --> 00:02:50.279
There was another time, 
she says she was,

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:53.929
"moved so exceedingly, she was 
drawn so strongly heavenward,

00:02:53.929 --> 00:02:56.594
that it seemed as if her body

00:02:56.594 --> 00:02:59.504
were feeling as if it were 
being pulled upwards."

00:02:59.504 --> 00:03:03.082
She said, "I felt as if I must 
necessarily ascend thither.

00:03:03.082 --> 00:03:04.852
At length my strength failed me,

00:03:04.852 --> 00:03:07.449
I sunk down, and they took me up

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:10.299
and laid me on the bed."

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.254
Well, guess what? I've seen 
pictures of Benny Hinn

00:03:13.254 --> 00:03:15.734
waving his hands and 
people fell to the ground.

00:03:15.734 --> 00:03:17.676
Ok, Sarah Edwards falls to the ground.

00:03:17.676 --> 00:03:20.276
Benny Hinn's got people, 
they fall to the ground.

00:03:20.276 --> 00:03:24.353
So which category does this guy fall into?

00:03:24.353 --> 00:03:26.224
Well, let me tell you something.

00:03:26.224 --> 00:03:27.634
Let me tell you something

00:03:27.634 --> 00:03:31.554
about what Sarah Edwards 
said in the midst of all this.

00:03:31.554 --> 00:03:34.837
She said, "the presence 
of God was so near

00:03:34.837 --> 00:03:36.287
and so real that I seemed

00:03:36.287 --> 00:03:38.287
scarcely conscious of anything else."

00:03:38.287 --> 00:03:40.470
Now listen to what she says,

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:43.410
"God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:46.410
seemed as distinct persons,

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.745
both manifesting Their 
inconceivable loveliness

00:03:50.745 --> 00:03:52.895
and mildness and gentleness

00:03:52.895 --> 00:03:55.904
and Their great and immutable love to me.

00:03:55.904 --> 00:03:58.064
I seemed to be taken under the care

00:03:58.064 --> 00:04:01.533
and charge of my God and Savior,

00:04:01.533 --> 00:04:05.133
in an inexpressibly endearing manner,

00:04:05.133 --> 00:04:10.261
and Christ appeared to 
me as a mighty Savior."

00:04:10.261 --> 00:04:12.890
Can I tell you one thing 
about the Holy Spirit?

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.611
You know what Jesus 
Christ said about Him?

00:04:15.611 --> 00:04:18.151
In John 16:14, speaking of the Comforter

00:04:18.151 --> 00:04:19.751
or the Spirit of Truth,

00:04:19.751 --> 00:04:24.308
"He will glorify Me, for 
He will take what is Mine

00:04:24.308 --> 00:04:26.408
and declare it to you."

00:04:26.408 --> 00:04:30.933
Can I tell you what? Where 
the true Holy Spirit is operating,

00:04:30.933 --> 00:04:35.433
is it any marvel that 
the Father and the Son

00:04:35.433 --> 00:04:40.693
were made much of, 
but where another spirit is,

00:04:40.693 --> 00:04:46.416
the "Spirit" is typically 
made much of. Watch that.

00:04:46.416 --> 00:04:51.826
In the Pentecostal circles, 
the "Spirit" is made much of.

00:04:51.826 --> 00:04:54.482
In these health, wealth, 
prosperity circles,

00:04:54.482 --> 00:04:57.272
the "Spirit" is made much of,

00:04:57.272 --> 00:04:59.512
but where the Spirit is truly operating,

00:04:59.512 --> 00:05:01.296
He doesn't make much of Himself,

00:05:01.296 --> 00:05:03.652
He makes much of the Father and the Son,

00:05:03.652 --> 00:05:06.422
and especially the Son.

00:05:06.422 --> 00:05:12.441
You watch: whatever experiences 
people are experiencing,

00:05:12.441 --> 00:05:17.331
is Christ being magnified?

00:05:17.331 --> 00:05:22.206
Is He the focus? Is He central?

00:05:22.206 --> 00:05:27.808
I'll tell you this: You've got people 
falling down where Benny Hinn is?

00:05:27.808 --> 00:05:29.914
He prophesied that God would destroy

00:05:29.914 --> 00:05:34.434
the homosexual community of 
America by fire in the mid '90's.

00:05:34.434 --> 00:05:37.446
In about 1994 or 1995, 
no later than that,

00:05:37.446 --> 00:05:39.416
he also foretold that Fidel Castro

00:05:39.416 --> 00:05:41.416
would die during the '90's,

00:05:41.416 --> 00:05:43.590
that the world would end by 1999.

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.040
Hinn has taught that the 
biblical Adam flew, had wings,

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.105
that he even flew to the moon.

00:05:51.105 --> 00:05:52.895
He's said that the Christian Trinity

00:05:52.895 --> 00:05:55.505
is actually God in nine 
persons, not three,

00:05:55.505 --> 00:05:59.703
because the Father, the Son, 
and the Holy Ghost

00:05:59.703 --> 00:06:02.703
are each comprised of trinities.

00:06:02.703 --> 00:06:04.938
You know, Hinn said in one broadcast,

00:06:04.938 --> 00:06:07.108
"I've looked for one verse in the Bible,

00:06:07.108 --> 00:06:08.998
but I just can't seem to find it...

00:06:08.998 --> 00:06:11.852
one verse that says 'if you 
don't like them, kill them.'

00:06:11.852 --> 00:06:13.452
I really wish I could find it.

00:06:13.452 --> 00:06:15.530
Sometimes I wish God would give me

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:19.430
a Holy Ghost machine gun and 
I'd blow their heads off."

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:22.585
You know what Sarah Edwards said?

00:06:22.585 --> 00:06:26.895
"My soul was so filled 
with love to Christ,

00:06:26.895 --> 00:06:29.065
and love to His people,

00:06:29.065 --> 00:06:32.755
that I fainted under the 
intenseness of the feeling."

00:06:32.755 --> 00:06:35.721
You know what one of chief marks

00:06:35.721 --> 00:06:39.141
of true Christianity is? It's love.

00:06:39.141 --> 00:06:43.072
And where the Spirit 
of the living Christ is,

00:06:43.072 --> 00:06:46.072
there's love for God's people.

00:06:46.072 --> 00:06:48.713
Hinn wants to blow their heads off.

00:06:48.713 --> 00:06:53.843
Sarah Edwards is so taken up 
with a love for God's people.

00:06:53.843 --> 00:06:56.247
Listen: test the spirits.

00:06:56.247 --> 00:06:59.247
You know them by their fruits.

00:06:59.247 --> 00:07:03.066
Pauline's right, go to the Word of God

00:07:03.066 --> 00:07:06.066
and see the marks of the Spirit.

00:07:06.066 --> 00:07:07.277
Go to the book of Acts.

00:07:07.277 --> 00:07:09.747
Look where the Spirit was operating,

00:07:09.747 --> 00:07:14.307
where places trembled,

00:07:14.307 --> 00:07:16.826
where there were fillings of the Spirit,

00:07:16.826 --> 00:07:19.316
where there were supernatural occurrences,

00:07:19.316 --> 00:07:20.807
where there were experiences,

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:23.537
and look in the midst of all of it,

00:07:23.537 --> 00:07:27.308
and look at the flavor, 
look at the aroma,

00:07:27.308 --> 00:07:30.308
look at the fruits of those things.

00:07:30.308 --> 00:07:32.225
Weigh things out by the Word of God.

00:07:32.225 --> 00:07:35.959
Hinn gives himself away 
as a false prophet.

00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:39.180
Sarah Edwards gives herself away.

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:41.122
She's so entranced by Christ

00:07:41.122 --> 00:07:44.433
and by a love for the people of Christ.
