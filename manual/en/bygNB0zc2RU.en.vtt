Welcome to nishamadhulika.com

00:00:07.966 --> 00:00:10.978
Today we will make vegetable stock.

00:00:11.153 --> 00:00:15.274
Vegetable stock is used in making many soups.

00:00:15.651 --> 00:00:23.291
For making vegetable stock we take 2 liter water and 500-750 grams of vegetables

00:00:23.706 --> 00:00:26.183
Use vegetables as per season

00:00:26.464 --> 00:00:36.853
We are using cabbage, cauliflower, radish, bottle gourd, carrot, capsicum, spinach and green coriander

00:00:37.038 --> 00:00:40.668
You can also use beans, turnip and so on.

00:00:40.995 --> 00:00:43.885
We will chop these vegetables

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.766
Besides these vegetables we will also use some spices as well.

00:00:48.685 --> 00:00:50.503

00:00:50.892 --> 00:00:52.893

00:00:53.276 --> 00:00:55.760
Cinnamon stick - 2 inch pieces (2)

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.327
Brown cardamom - 2

00:00:58.536 --> 00:01:00.576

00:01:00.817 --> 00:01:02.563
Black pepper - 10-12

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:07.663
Coarsely ground these spices and finely chop the vegetables

00:01:08.602 --> 00:01:17.257
Cut vegetables in big pieces and then add them in food processor

00:01:42.781 --> 00:01:45.511
Now boil chopped vegetables

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.489
Pour water in pan and add vegetables into it.

00:02:02.263 --> 00:02:13.096
Add coarsely grinned spices, black salt and plain salt.

00:02:27.191 --> 00:02:32.131
Cover the pan and cook until it starts boiling.

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:40.385
Water has started boiling

00:02:42.207 --> 00:02:48.267
Cover again and cook on medium flame for Â½ hour.

00:03:01.838 --> 00:03:07.231
It's been Â½ hour since vegetables are boiling; turn off the gas.

00:03:07.493 --> 00:03:11.521
Let the stock get frigid then we will strain it.

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:34.239
Vegetable stock is ready

00:03:34.537 --> 00:03:37.862
Store it in refrigerator for up to 2 days.

00:03:38.945 --> 00:03:49.192
If you wish to store it for more days then freeze in cubes tray and then use whenever you want to.

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:55.294
