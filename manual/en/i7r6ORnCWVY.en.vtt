00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:03.919
Welcome back to another Big Iris
Production video. Now in light of the new

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:06.450
GoPro Hero 4 camera having just come
out

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.590
have we decided to do a test testing four
different types and GoPro

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.590
battery brands. So here it goes.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:25.920
Now for this first test I all of the
different battery brands

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.920
were tested at 4k resolution at 24fps.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.079
and all the tests done in this video

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:39.149
well were shot in flat color, ISO 1600,

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.230
low sharpness, Protune turned on and

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.230
white balance at neutral- even though I did
do some color grading to these shots.

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.760
alright and that concludes our 4K tests
with  Newmowa coming in first. 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:11.290
Smartree coming in second, GoPro
coming in third and Wasabi coming in last.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:21.750
Lets do some more tests only this time
we're going to have to go pro at 120 fps

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.290
Newmowa and Wasabi batteries at 1080
at 60 frames per second. 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.649
And the Smartree battery at 2.7K at 48 frames per second. And these
last test are just to give you a rough

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.580
estimate of how long you can expect the batteries to last at these different settings. 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.070
Alright and as you can see in these last tests, it was really interesting because the GoPro

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.920
having been filmed that 1080

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.440
in 120 FPS and actually came in
first place as far as battery power

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.850
 was concerned.  The other two, Newmowa and Wasabi batteries 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:11.950
were fairly similar in time differences
and the Smartree battery came in at a

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.950
low 39 minutes

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.760
Alright, that concludes our test but I'm
gonna leave it up to you guys to decide

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:22.000
which battery you think is best. For me
personally I would go with the Newmowa

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.110
just because it seemed to do the best in
all that the test that I performed. 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.910
