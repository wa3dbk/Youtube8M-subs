00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.069
Hi I'm Jeremy Payne, your host for today's
show on That Was History.

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.809
I'd like to take you on a stroll down sports
history. Now I know not every single person in

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.420
the world is a sports fanatic,

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.100
but just hang in tight with me because this
story has a very interesting set of events

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:23.129
and top scores!

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:28.700
For me, every Friday night has become
sort of a tradition that I go to the local

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:29.450
football game.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:32.700
it's very entertaining to watch these
kids play football, moreover to watch

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.340
some of them progress on into college
ball through walk-ons, scholarships, and

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.940
what not. Well the next day,Saturday, I
enjoy watching my favorite college team,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.540
UGA, but anyways I'd love to see them rack up points and play their opposition. well I

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.970
could never imagine a game getting so
out of hand that the team would score

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:49.260
over 100 points

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.400
much less two hundred or more. Most of the
games that I've gone to at high school level

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.760
and seen on TV, they've only scored around 50 to 60 points.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.159
and that's been when the team has just been
dominating and had the better recruiting

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:05.019
or the bigger team. Well a team would score a total of 222 points shutting out a team on

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.880
October 7th of 1960.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:11.200
Well here's how it happened. Georgia Tech
engineers also known as the Yellow Jackets now.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.000
would face off against a school out of
Lebanon Tennessee, the Cumberland Bulldogs.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.800
Now earlier that year, Georgia Tech had
been crushed by them in baseball, 22 - 0.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.830
which set up the heart of the coach, John
Heisman, who was a baseball and football

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.040
coach at the time

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.980
to want to go and defeat the Bulldogs and send everything they had into this game on

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.630
October 7th. Well Cumberland had
discontinued its football program before

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.300
the season actually began,

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.700
but they were however not allowed to
cancel its game against Georgia Tech Engineers.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.340
If they didn't show up for the
game in any form or fashion,

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.480
they'd have to pay a fine of three
thousand dollars, which back then was a

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.230
huge heap of money to lose.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:50.210
Well in order to get past this hump, George E. Allen, the elected student manager

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.190
would put together a team of 14 to travel
to Atlanta to represent Cumberlands

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.700
football team. As I've already mentioned
before, the score this game was a total

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.880
blow out of 222 - 0,

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.200
and part of coach John Heisman's reason
for running up such high scores in this game

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.710
was because the ranking of teams back
then was based on how many points they

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.810
scored. Now it was not a true mark of success for the team,

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.150
but it sets the most probable and the
only reason that the team would go out

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.930
and dominate these 14 some-odd players

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.510
that were sent down from Tennessee. So
whether your sports fanatic or not,

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.100
you have to admit that is a pretty
amazing thing to see such top scores in a game

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.940
whether it be high school, college, or pro.
