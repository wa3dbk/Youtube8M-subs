Hi! I am Ann Marie for Expert Village and
today we are going to learn the basics of

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:12.909
grooming a dog. In this series we are going
to start with the #10 blade. With the #10

00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:20.060
blade you get the hair out from between your
dog’s eye and shave toward the eyes, be

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.230
careful not to poke the eye with the blade
and then you come away from the eye to get

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.220
the corners. This will help the dog be able
to see and get rid of that overgrown hair

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:41.460
that would poke him in the eye. After you
do between your dog’s eye you then move

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.640
to the inner ear. We will come back later
and learn how to get the hair from deep inside

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:55.150
the ear with the #10 blade we just shave this
hair right here so that we have a clear path

00:00:55.150 --> 00:01:10.590
for when we need to pluck the hair out a little
later. Next we move to the armpit area, its

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.060
best done when the dog is standing. You gently
lift the arm in a position that is comfortable

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:25.130
for the dog. You can shave out in here. This
will avoid any hair getting tangled as the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:38.890
hair grows longer and the dog moves about.
Do the same on the other side then we move

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.530
to the groin area. This is most easily done
when the dog is standing as well. Once again

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.250
if you gently lift the leg in a position that
is comfortable for the dog almost as if he

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:56.570
is lifting his leg to go to the bathroom.
You can then shave out away from the groin

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:04.450
and also back in. This is called a sanitary
part and it will keep the area clean when

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:13.489
the dog goes to the bathroom or runs through
dirt and mud. One other area we need to do

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:18.829
we don’t talk about too much but we just
shave this hair right around the anus that

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:26.469
way when the dog goes to the bathroom you
don’t have things stuck that’s it for

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:27.169
the #10 blade.
