00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.730
&gt;&gt; THE POSTOPERATIVE COURSE
AFTER SPINAL DEFORMITY SURGERY

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:10.770
FOR EARLY ONSET SCOLIOSIS,
THOSE CHILDREN ARE USUALLY GETTING

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.600
A GROWING ROD PROCEDURE
AND THEIR REHAB IS VERY SIMPLE.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.200
THEY'RE UP WALKING
THE DAY AFTER SURGERY.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.070
THEY'RE OFTEN GOING HOME ON THE
THIRD OR FOURTH POSTOPERATIVE DAY.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.630
THEY'RE OFTEN BACK TO SCHOOL
WITHIN A WEEK OR TWO.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.130
AND THEN BACK TO GYM AND SPORTS,
IF THEY WERE PARTICIPATING BEFORE,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.030
WITHIN THREE TO SIX MONTHS.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.600
&gt;&gt; THE ABILITY TO INSERT GROWING
RODS HAS PROVIDED A LOT,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.400 position:56%
IN TERMS OF STABILITY AND PREVENTING
DISEASE PROGRESSION,

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.500
TO THE POINT WHERE MANY OF THESE
CHILDREN, IF TREATED EARLY

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.870
AND AGGRESSIVELY, DON'T END UP
SEEING ME OR SEEING MY COLLEAGUES

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.170 position:59%
IN PULMONOLOGY BECAUSE THEY'RE STABLE.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.700 position:56%
THEIR CHEST AND SPINE IS STABILIZED,
AND THEY'RE ABLE TO GROW

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.730
IN A RELATIVELY NORMAL MANNER.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:00.670
&gt;&gt; AFTER SURGERY THEY NOTICE
THAT THEY'RE TALLER OR STRAIGHTER.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.400
AND OFTEN THE RIB
OR CHEST WALL ASYMMETRY,

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.130
THE SO-CALLED RIB HUMP,
IMPROVES OR GETS MUCH BETTER,

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.270
IN SOME CASES GOES AWAY.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.800 position:56%
&gt;&gt; WITH THE VEPTR APPROACH--
AFTER THE INITIAL VEPTR IMPLANTATION

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.000
THEY'LL SPEND SEVERAL DAYS
IN THE INTENSIVE CARE UNIT

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.200
AND THEN ABOUT FIVE TO SEVEN
DAYS CONVALESCING ON THE FLOOR.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.230
&gt;&gt; WE'RE EXPANDING
THEIR CHEST WALLS.

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.400
THIS IS THEIR DRIVE TO BREATHE.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.530
THIS IS THEIR INTERCOSTAL MUSCLES,
THEIR LUNGS, THEIR DIAPHRAGM,

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.100
EVERYTHING IS BEING CHANGED.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.070
&gt;&gt; IT DOES GIVE THEM
A BIT MORE VOLUME.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.770 position:56%
YOU USUALLY HAVE STRAIGHTENED
THE SPINE IN MANY OF THESE CHILDREN,

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.270
SO YOU'RE IMPROVING
THE DYNAMICS OF RESPIRATION,

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:45.470
THE FUNCTION OF THE DIAPHRAGM.

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.500
&gt;&gt; AND BEFORE THIS IMPLANT,
YOU FIGURE YOU'VE GOT A LUNG HERE,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.430
AND THIS WAS HER.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.700
THAT'S HOW HER LUNGS WERE,
AND NOW THEY'RE LIKE THIS.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.730
&gt;&gt; WHEN I WAS A BABY,
I HAD A HARD TIME BREATHING.

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.730
WHEN I WAS GETTING OLDER,
I HAD TO USE A INHALER.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:02.600
NOW I'M BREATHING FINE.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.330
I DON'T HAVE TO USE AN INHALER.

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:06.870
&gt;&gt; WHEN YOU'RE WATCHING YOUR
CHILD SLEEPING AND YOU CAN SEE

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.270
THEY'RE HAVING A TOUGH TIME
BREATHING AND ALL THAT--

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.970
AND JUST TO GET TO THIS POINT
TODAY, WHERE SHE'S OUT COLD

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:15.030
AND ENJOYING HERSELF.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.370
&gt;&gt; ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES
OF USING RESPIRATORY THERAPY

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.700
IS THAT WE CAN HELP PATIENTS
RE-RECRUIT AND BETTER UTILIZE

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.200
THE LUNG THAT THEY HAVE AVAILABLE.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.700
&gt;&gt; A LOT OF THESE KIDS HAVE
COMPLEX OTHER PROBLEMS.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.400
&gt;&gt; MULTIPLE DEFORMITIES,
SEVERE PROBLEMS.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.770
&gt;&gt; AND THE NURSING STAFF
DOES A GREAT JOB OF KNOWING

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.500
THE INTRICACIES OF WHAT THESE OTHER
DIAGNOSES AND CONDITIONS ARE.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.500
THAT'S ONE OF THE ADVANTAGES
OF BEING AT A PLACE LIKE CHOP.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.770
&gt;&gt; I THINK THAT THE ONLY WAY
TO TRULY CARE FOR THESE PATIENTS

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:54.400
IS TO HAVE AN ORGANIZATION
THAT HAS TOP RATE NICU OR PICU,

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.600
TOP RATE PULMONOLOGISTS,
TOP-RATED DOCTORS,

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.870
TOP-RATED ORTHOPEDIC SURGEONS.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:04.570
&gt;&gt; SO OUR TEAM, FROM NURSING
TO ANESTHESIA TO THE REHAB PEOPLE,

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.270
BRACE PEOPLE, THEY'RE FAMILIAR --
THEY'RE COMFORTABLE

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.230
WITH THESE RARE CONDITIONS.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.970
&gt;&gt; BETWEEN THE ANESTHESIOLOGIST
AND THE PULMONARY

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:16.630
AND THE ORTHOPEDICS,
THEY'RE ALL TOGETHER.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.200
THEY DO THIS EVERY DAY.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.500
&gt;&gt; I HAND OVER MY DAUGHTER TO THEM,
AND I KNOW SHE'S IN GOOD HANDS.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:29.300
&gt;&gt; IT MAY BE SCARY IN THE HOSPITAL,
BUT PEOPLE ARE TAKING CARE OF YOU,

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.400
AND THEY'RE TRYING TO HELP YOU.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.230
SO MOSTLY YOU DON'T HAVE
TO BE SCARED OF REALLY ANYTHING.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.970
&gt;&gt; IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO
MAINTAIN A CLOSE WORKING

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.900
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE REFERRING
PHYSICIAN AND HAVE A BIDIRECTIONAL

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.270
FLOW OF INFORMATION.

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.500
&gt;&gt; WE CAN SEND E-MAIL
COMMUNICATIONS BACK AND FORTH

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.170
WITH IMAGES.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.430
I GET PULMONARY FUNCTION TESTS
SENT BY E-MAIL AND THEN IT GETS

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:55.170
VERY EASY WITH A LITTLE BIT
OF DATA TO PICK UP THE PHONE

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:59.930
AND TALK WITH THE REFERRING
PHYSICIAN AND KEEP THEM TOGETHER

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:00.930
AS A PARTNER.

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:06.400
&gt;&gt; KEEPING THE PRIMARY CARE
TEAM IN THE LOOP, UP TO DATE,

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.770
COMMUNICATING WELL WITH THEM
IS NOT ONLY IMPORTANT FOR US,

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.270
BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
FOR THE PATIENT AND FAMILY.

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:16.870
WE PUT A LOT OF EMPHASIS
AND EFFORT INTO THAT.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:21.400
&gt;&gt; SO THIS IS ALL PART
OF THE TREATMENT APPROACH.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.400 position:56%
NOT JUST TAKING CARE OF A CHILD,
BUT TAKING CARE OF THE WHOLE FAMILY.
