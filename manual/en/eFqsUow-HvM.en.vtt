Hey there, it’s Marie Forleo and you are
watching MarieTV, the place to be to create

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.410
and life you love.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.410
And you know what?

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.510
Here in the US we are just about to celebrate
one of my favorite holidays, Thanksgiving.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.210
I love it for two reasons.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:33.750
One because I get to cook for my friends,
and two because I get to eat a lot of mashed

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.649
potatoes, and those are two things I can do
all day long.

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.970
Now, this is also a time of the year when
we all start to hear a lot about gratitude,

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:47.390
and I love gratitude because I think it is
the number one super tool to transform your

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.579
life.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:55.399
But here’s the thing, gratitude can feel
a little, you know, cliche.

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:56.889
You might think like, “Ugh, gratitude.

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:58.039
I’m so over it.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:00:59.469
Been there, done that.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.730
It’s so Oprah in the 90s.”

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.830
Here is the deal though, if you’ve got gratitude
fatigue I can pretty much bet you’re doing

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.900
it wrong.

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:08.900
I know, right?

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.260
Who knew you could do gratitude wrong.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:16.250
I didn't know that until I read this here
book by Robert Emmons called Gratitude Works.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.180
Now, Robert is the leading researcher on gratitude.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:25.370
Now, here’s the thing, I wanna teach you
one trick that I learned from Robert that’ll

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:30.290
help take your gratitude practice from something
that’s, you know, kinda nice into a total

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.360
miracle smoothie for your emotional well being.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.920
Now, before I tell you this one strategy,
I’ve gotta be up front.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.970
This is about gratitude journaling.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:43.110
And before you go, “Ugh, journaling.

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:44.610
That’s just too much work.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:45.610
I don't wanna do it.”

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:47.460
Stop.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.460
Journaling is awesome.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:49.580
Two reasons.

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.550
Number one, when you journal you start to
uncover personal insights about yourself which

00:01:54.550 --> 00:02:00.320
can really help you unwire any negative patterns
that you have, and we all have them.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.770
Number two, when you journal on the regular
you really develop discipline and discipline

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.400
is awesome for following through and getting
results.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.610
Now, these two benefits never come when you
just think about gratitude, so don't be so

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.409
quick to dismiss the journal practice.

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:20.659
Ok, so here is the big magic gratitude trick.

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:27.640
If you want the most ROI for your gratitude
practice, the dividends are in the details.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.410
It turns out that most of us are pretty lazy
when it comes to our gratitude practice, kinda

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.870
like this.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:49.129
What’s wrong with that?

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:51.629
It is way too general.

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:56.900
So research shows that if we want the most
bang for our gratitude buck, we have got to

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.519
get specific.

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:01.950
That means way more depth and less breath.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:02.999
Check this out.

00:03:02.999 --> 00:03:07.510
The University of Southern California did
a 10 week study on gratitude journaling with

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.510
3 groups.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.989
The first group were generalists: writing
down 5 general things a day they were grateful

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:13.989
for.

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.129
The second group got specific: they picked
one thing a day and wrote 5 sentences about

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:20.129
it.

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:24.200
The third group wrote about ways which they
were better off than other people.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:25.670
Excuse us.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:26.969
Here’s the results.

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:33.120
It turns out that the group that wrote 5 sentences
about one thing were more elated, excited,

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.950
and alert than the other groups and less tired,
sad, and lethargic.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.909
Bottom line, details equal dividends.

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:43.790
And I gotta tell you, this really, really
works.

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:44.819
So I tried it.

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:48.189
I am so grateful for Josh, but instead of
just of just saying, “I’m grateful for

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:53.359
Josh,” I wrote down five really specific
things that I’m grateful for and I want

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:55.349
to read them to you right now.

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:59.799
So I’m grateful that over the 11 years that
we’ve been together he’s brought me a

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:04.859
hot beverage in the morning at least 1,500
times.

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.799
He makes me laugh more than anyone else in
the world because he’s just so funny.

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:15.370
He always says he’s sorry first even if
I’m being overly sensitive, and not just

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.370
to placate me, but because he genuinely is
sorry.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.680
And he consistently hopes… helps me to slow
down to enjoy life.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.330
And, most importantly, he makes the most delicious
blueberry banana walnut peanut butter pancakes

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:38.660
for me and all my friends.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:47.620
Ok, so if you wanna help spread the word about
the right way to do gratitude, then you gotta

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:49.480
share this here tweetable.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:59.060
“When it comes to gratitude, the dividends
are in the details.”

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:04.150
So now I would love to hear from you, and
I want you to get grateful in the comments.

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:10.670
So choose one person or thing that you’re
grateful for and write five specific, detailed

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:12.010
reasons why.
