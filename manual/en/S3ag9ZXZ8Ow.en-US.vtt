00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.470
My name is Kai Rosenkranz, and
at Piranha Bytes I'm mainly in

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.560
charge of music and sound. And a
few other visual and graphical things.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.450
I'm 25 years old and joined the team
in roundabout 1998. I think George Lucas

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.720
said in an interview that
in film, music and

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.220
sound are 50 percent of the
emotional impact.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.380
This cannot fully be applied to
videogames,  but at least

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.220
the conclusion is the same:
That one needs music to

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.970
transfer emotions. It's a process
that goes through a lot of

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:02.820
different stages.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.900
It starts with me sitting in front
of a keyboard, trying to submerge

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.530
in the world musically and emotionally.
Finding appropriate themes that

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.970
fit to the environment,
and generating

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.440
a mood through the instrumentation
that is capable of

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.750
invoking the desired emotion.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.790
Then comes a brainstorming phase,
pretty extensive, where you can

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.270
imagine that I just record everything

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:27.890
while I play around on my keyboard an
later go through the material

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.180
that I captured.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.920
Well, in the last phase, which was
a pretty massive recording event

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.090
with dozens of microphones,
70 musicians and a huge

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.140
team, everything gets

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.140
recorded.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.640
So, last year (2005) in July
the recording session with the

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.660
Bochum Symphony Orchestra took
place, and I can call that day

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.269
the pinnacle of my career as a
games composer so far.

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:10.289
Because, having been limited to

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:14.779
working with the computer
when making the music, and then

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:20.489
standing in front of an orchestra
and realizing that the score I've

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:24.230
composed in the office comes to life.
That is truely

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.239
a very touching moment!

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:27.619
It has been a

00:02:27.619 --> 00:02:30.159
very big event!

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.889
My co-workers have been there
to witness the moment,

00:02:33.889 --> 00:02:37.589
and even press has been
invited. And thus, the

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:40.279
excitement and tension before
the recordings were huge.

00:02:40.279 --> 00:02:42.989
And to realize that everything
goes smoothly and that

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.449
the orchestral performance
goes into a direction that

00:02:46.449 --> 00:02:49.319
sounds great and doesn't
just live up to my vision,

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.769
but even exceeds it

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.499
largely...

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:55.109
That was really

00:02:55.109 --> 00:03:02.109
a wonderful day!

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:04.229
Thanks, that's much better
in part 2.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.400
But it all only turned
out so great because

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.989
the team has worked together
so very well.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.500
I was lucky that Stephan Cahen
from scoreworkers and

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.200
his team have joined the project
in a relatively early stage.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.200
And consulted my both with
regard to technical and

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.200
also musical aspects.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.300
The drummers of the Japanese
taiko band GOCOO,

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.300
which I had included in the musical
vision in the very early stages

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.539
for percussion elements,
were able to contribute the

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:46.519
necessary power

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.949
but also didn't sound too simplistic.
As you can imagine, presenting the Orcs

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:53.549
as a very archaic and animal-like
race is easy.

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.249
One can simple use big drums

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:58.899
and smash them wildly.

00:03:58.899 --> 00:04:02.359
But we wanted the orc culture
to be a lot more sophisticated.

00:04:02.359 --> 00:04:04.149
So, it is not just an

00:04:04.149 --> 00:04:08.119
army of animals, but actually
a civilatization.

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:08.989
With its own history,

00:04:08.989 --> 00:04:10.699
and culture.

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:17.699
And thus the taiko
element was a perfect fit.

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:31.809
The day with GOCOO in Hamburg was
definitely one of the high points

00:04:31.809 --> 00:04:35.430
of the entire production.

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:37.159
I had a very good gut feeling

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:41.949
Not only because of the
vibrations caused by the drums,

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.789
but also because I came to
realize that the band itself

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:45.660
was really willing to

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:50.930
give their very best
for the project!

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.780
And the same applies to
all other participants in

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:55.659
the production of the
soundtrack.

00:04:55.659 --> 00:04:59.279
One could plainly see that everybody
involved was interested in

00:04:59.279 --> 00:05:01.139
making this the best
product possible.

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:04.599
The ethno musician Bobby Glorian
for example flew all the way from

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:05.889
Bulgaria to Germany

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.240
to spend a weekend with us in
the recording studio

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.240
and perform great elements
for Gothic 3.

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.599
And that was one of the moments
where I could feel:

00:05:14.599 --> 00:05:21.150
"Hey, everything will
turn out alright!"

00:06:28.499 --> 00:06:30.500
After the choid recordings
we entered the very final

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:31.300
phase in the production:

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:33.539
The so-called "post production",

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:36.869
in which all the elements created
in 2,5 years of working on the music

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:38.669
had been compiled, edited,

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.719
mixed, and mastered
by the scoreworkers Team

00:06:43.719 --> 00:06:45.169
In this final stage of
the production

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.029
all of us had - for the
very first time - 

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:53.020
heard the final result.
And we were really very

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:55.860
relieved, to say the least,

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.379
that in the end everything
had become much more

00:07:00.379 --> 00:07:01.619
and much better than we
had every dreamed it would.
