Hi everyone! I'm Sharon

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.240
The other day I went drinking with my friends, unlucky me 
 got stopped at a roadblock on the way home

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:21.240
I was asked to do a breathalyzer test and 
 I failed even though I didn't drink alot

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:25.380
so that's why today I want to do a breathalyzer experiment

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:31.180
I went and buy a standard breathalyzer

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.880
And I also bought some beer from nearby my house

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.920
It's Jaz Beer and it has 5% alcohol content

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.489
OK, let's start

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.440
I'll first test the level of alcohol in my body now

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:12.240
It's at 0%, meaning there's no alcohol in my body now

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:26.160
In Malaysia the legal limit for driving is 0.05%, so let's see 
 how many beers I can drink before going over the limit

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.320
Let's go

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.400
So let's bottoms up the first bottle. Cheers!

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.400
Finished!

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.620
Actually this beer is quite nice, easy to drink

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:09.000
I cannot immediately do the test because it will detect 
 the alcohol from my mouth, not my body

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:12.880
So let's wait for 10 minutes

00:02:13.654 --> 00:02:16.580
I've prepared a big clock for everyone to see

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:30.560
Now it's 2.50pm, so we'll continue at 3.00pm. Bye!

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.400
Ok, it's now 3.00pm

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.480
Let's take a test now

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.880
Wait a moment

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.560
Now it's 0.05%

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:26.680
That means I'm still able to drive, so let's try one more

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:35.600
Here's the second bottle. Cheers!

00:03:53.600 --> 00:04:06.800
We'll wait 15 minutes this time so that 
 my body can completely absorb the alcohol

00:04:10.543 --> 00:04:13.880
It's now 3.04pm

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:24.640
So we'll meet again at 3.19pm

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.680
I'm back!

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.160
Let's try again

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.280
I can see that I'm getting very red already

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:19.040
It's now 0.08%, which means I'm not able to drive already

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:35.520
So next time, we'll find out how to cheat on a breathalyzer test

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:39.040
I'll see you again soon! Bye!
