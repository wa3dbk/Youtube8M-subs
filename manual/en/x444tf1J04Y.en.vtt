00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.420
My favorite thing about the University
of Rochester is that it's a passion

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.110
driven University we have over 250
different clubs and activities on campus

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.740
and we're always adding new ones
everybody here has that one special

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.029
thing that they're really interested in
and really passionate about for me it's

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.570
been not only my academics but also
being able to be involved in the

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.410
performing arts community being a
choreographer for ballet performance

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.500
group has completely enriched my
experience and given me a lot of

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.559
opportunities to connect with other
students and also given me a lot of

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.010
leadership opportunities as well I feel
like and really have a university that

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.179
supports me and wants me to pursue all
of my different passions what really

00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:45.600
drew me in was the different majors and
the open curriculum that we had I think

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.069
my favorite part about the curriculum at
U of R is because you can customize your

00:00:50.069 --> 00:00:54.089
own schedule you end up being able to
take classes with so many different

00:00:54.089 --> 00:00:57.209
kinds of people
my biggest involvement on campus is

00:00:57.209 --> 00:01:00.569
student government I initially got
involved just from seeing all the

00:01:00.569 --> 00:01:04.860
different changes that students are
making at U of R the student body here

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.130
is just really enthusiastic about
bettering themselves and bettering the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.700
school I think of the lessons I've
learned from students at Rochester will

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.390
ultimately help me become a much more
global citizen and surrounding myself

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.990
with a community of people that think
that way has just been one of the best

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.040
opportunities that I could have had the
reason why I chose to come to the

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.440
University of Rochester is the research
opportunities we have here I started

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:32.280
doing research when I was a sophomore I
simply sent an email to my professor

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.810
because I was really interested in what
he was doing and now I'm staying here

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.950
over the summer to do research
fellowship I really enjoyed the hands-on

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.790
learning experience and the
collaborative atmosphere we have as a

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.120
university I think a lot of professors
understand that students have potential

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.960
interest of going into graduate school
and they offer a lot of different

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.220
research opportunities for students who
are interested.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.380
I chose to come to the University of Rochester

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.780
because my 10th
grade science teacher was an alum from

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.590
here he really got me into the sciences
and got me really excited for it

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:09.209
it's through his enthusiasm and his honest
love and dedication towards the sciences

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.370
that I decided to kind of pursue science
and later on biology and engineering

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.940
one reason I chose University of
Rochester for its research is because

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.209
right from the get-go freshman year you
can get involved as early as your second

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:23.360
semester I love how easy it was to just
get involved in anything that's

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:26.569
interested in I've grown so much of
these past three years and doing

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.360
research here really helped.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.980
In high school I dreamed to play on the college football

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.440
field and it was really hard to find
mechanical engineering and football at a

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.650
university, Rochester just seemed like
the right fit you know some top

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:42.830
thirty-five school
good in the classroom and also stayed

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.190
competitive on the playing field it was
just really nice to see my freshman year

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:50.840
coming in the camaraderie out here on
the football field and as well as

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.680
everybody supported you in the classroom
they know what it's like to be a student

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.940
and an athlete.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.900
the main factor that
encouraged me and that really excited me

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.630
about coming here was the people
everyone that I met on every visit and

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.680
everyone that I ever interacted with it
all was just so so friendly it all

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:09.830
starts with those friendships that you
make on your freshman Hall those

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:13.280
friendships lead you all the way through
your senior year I think it's making

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.590
those friendships that's been the
absolute best part of my college

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.549
experience and having those friendships
that have pulled me through all of my

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.840
classes and all of my years here the
biggest draw for me to come to Rochester

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.250
was definitely the atmosphere I've been
a part of student government class

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.060
Council I've also been a resident
advisor for freshman I actually

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.010
auditioned for the Yellowjackets my
junior year joining the Yellowjackets

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:41.269
has definitely been the highlight of my
college career just having a group of

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:45.200
guys that you can come together and make
music with and perform for the

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.480
University for the Greater Rochester
area we travel and do a lot of gigs

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:54.440
around Rochester around New York and
around the country so it's really been

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.000
been a blessing to have that opportunity
to share our gift with with other people

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.170
I would say be open to all the
experiences that you're gonna have here

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.910
you're gonna come in contact with a lot
of new people a lot of new things and

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.069
you should absolutely 100% try those
things you're probably gonna find some

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:16.100
things that you've never heard of before
that you're really going to enjoy so

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:19.310
definitely just make the most of your
time and all of the opportunities that

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.090
are available to you.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.660
you
