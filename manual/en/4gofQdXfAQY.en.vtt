00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:09.590
So, When did they start selling those units.

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:16.049
Ah, just recently, not long ago, just TOP.
Last month, last two months back.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.630
So they never tried to pre-sell? I am surprised
by that.

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.189
Ah, of course I think the timing wasn't very
great for them.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.899
Singapore government has imposed legal restrictions
on them.

00:00:29.899 --> 00:00:33.239
Yes, I am aware of all the conditions, I am aware
of that.

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:40.239
So, in that case, emmmm... do you happen to
know the cost base for this house?

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.670
You don't know. So I have to go do my own
math.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.350
Usually construction costs in Singapore, estimated
lah, depending on the quality, 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.650
it varies from $200 to $500 per square foot.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.370
What do you think what is this? What do you
guess?

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.350
I am not into material. Ok, what do you guess?
Per square foot, this construction costs,

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:00.350
how much is this?

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.450
This is a simple brick house.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:09.450
The no.1 has to ask where the material is
coming from. All these will add to the costs.Takea wild guess! I think average for this kind
of house you probably have to pay about $350psf.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.520
Emmm... Good Choice! Very close! I think its
close to...On average, yeah. Not the high end, not the super high end. You can see here a little bit...

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.799
Emmm... Good Choice! Very close! I think its
close to...On average, yeah. Not the high end, not the super high end. You can see here a little bit...

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.600
Emmm... Good Choice! Very close! I think its
close to...On average, yeah. Not the high end, not the super high end. You can see here a little bit...

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.079
Emmm... Good Choice! Very close! I think its
close to...On average, yeah. Not the high end, not the super high end. You can see here a little bit...

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:22.329
I, I believe this is closer to $300 than to
$400.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.490
I, I believe this is closer to $300 than to
$400.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.670
But I wouldn't know exact number. So how much
did they acquire the land for?

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.850
The per square foot, for the per plot ratio
price? This is public info, right?

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.850
I am not quite too sure....$1000 or something?
$2000!!! Because this is the last plot! Last plot!

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:49.490
So many people were bidding, they bidded the
highest plot. Almost $2000..... $2000 plus! $2900!

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.560
The lease hold starts in 2010? Yeah 2010.
So its the newest.Bidded the highest, almost $2800+.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:03.600
Because they want to sell for $3500,I guess...
That would be my guess.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:10.630
How big is the land size, built up, built
up size is around 2000. Ok, that means based

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:18.550
on land I am looking at $5k or $6k even.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.550
Because the big one is asking for $2500. And
that is for 10,000 square feet.

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.940
Actually I, I quite like it here, because
you are not so cluttered,you know, compared to coral island just now. That was very cluttered.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.550
So, from your experience so far,what is the
No.1 reason why they could not sell any?

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.120
So far, beside price.Why they couldn't sell?
They just want to make sure it sells to the right people.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.800
Whoever wants to see the house they don't
allow. We have to register!Really? 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.750
Yeah! They don't show! How come?

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:10.390
They forbid me to bring in anybody.They say:
Please, qualify your buyer!

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.810
What is his background. because I also have
to answer to my other buyers.

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:23.810
Different developer have different strategies,
this developer from what I see, they are not....
