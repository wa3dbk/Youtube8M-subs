00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:06.370
Welcome to Richmond Ford

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.459
2015 brings a great year for ford as we
have many new and exciting products

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:11.339
coming out

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:14.889
one that we have with us right now is
the 2015 Mustang

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:18.070
and wanted to take a quick look at what
differentiates the

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:21.250
GT Performance Pack from the rest of after the Mustangs

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.279
and Keep in mind that the Performance Pack can be had on the ecoboost 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.990
and the GT it just so happens we have
the full blown GT right here

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.320
The GT is an exciting car and Performance Pack this year has done lots of changes

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.660
those changes have added up big time the
new GT Performance Pack is faster than

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.840
the outgoing track inspired boss 302

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.609
and the 2015 5.0 liter engines get components
from the free reving boss 302 block

00:00:43.609 --> 00:00:47.820
starting with the front the performance 
pack adds a larger radiator

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.129
and GT's get a modified front splitter to
make sure all

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:54.370
435 raging horses stay cool

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.340
coming around to the side on this
mustang is really where it exposes its more

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:59.510
menacing nature

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.180
you notice right here the biggest
giveaway are these ebony black

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.490
19 inch rims wrapped in a aggressive PZero Pirelli 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.750
tire which is a summer tire which is
another feature th at comes with the

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.560
Performanc pack

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.630
and if you take an even closer look you
noticed sitting behind these

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.030
awesome Rims are 6 piston Brembo breaks and if

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.790
anything about breaks Brembo is about as
good as it gets business

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.500
Performance pack also adds chassis tuning focused towards driver enthusiasts with heavy

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.630
duty front springs

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.890
Both packs get a beefed up rear sway bar but the GT get some more exclusive 

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:33.880
Suspension modifications 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:36.320
along with a wider 275 rear tire

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:38.110
Instead of Brembo's 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.900
The boosted Stangs get larger rotors  

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.820
The last touches to the Performance Pack  

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.500
are subtle but non the less make it just that cooler, you'll notice that you get

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.119
these two gauges right here at oil
pressure

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.909
PSI and a vacuum gauge and the last
touch would be this

00:01:54.909 --> 00:01:58.080
what they call engine turn aluminum
trim

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.750
which I like got like a nice brushed
aluminum slash carbon fiber

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.410
feel to it very nice place to be in this
Mustang

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.700
and on Ecoboost packs the vacuum  gauge is subtistuited for an always entertaining

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:10.319
boost gauge

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.650
the ABS stability control and steering
feel have all been fine tuned on performance

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.069
versions to let the driver get that much
closer to the edge of the Mustang

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.389
exhilarating performance 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:21.860
Coming around the back of the mustang 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.580
you will notice or you may not notice
that Performance Packs get spoiler deletes  

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.220
and while you can't see it behind this
area right here exclusive   

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.129
to the GT Performance Pack is a 3.73
torsen rear axle 

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:39.060
from every angle the mustang is a great
looking car but its from the rear where you'll really  

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.170
find the best seats in the house and since where're 
already back here why not treat 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.620
our self's to a little american muscle music 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.120
As I mentioned throughout the video
the

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.130
Ecoboost Performance Pack and the GT Performance Pack  

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:00.330
do differ in a couple ways the GT
performance back

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:04.850
gets a couple extra goodies that being be
the 3.73 axle 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.300
on the back well they both have upgraded  suspension

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.620
the GT gets upgraded sway bars, struts

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.840
and a upgraded k a brace and lastly

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.220
the GT Pack gets the awesome Brembo brakes 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:19.020
either way you slice it 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:22.810
