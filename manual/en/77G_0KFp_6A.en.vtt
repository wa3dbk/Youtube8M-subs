The Machine Tool Technology program at Georgia

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:13.980
Northwestern Technical College prepares students
for employment in the machining industry by

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.170
providing hands-on experience with industry
standard, cutting edge equipment. The program

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.820
is taught at the Floyd and Walker County Campuses of Georgia Northwestern

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:28.369
Technical College. Both campuses have fully-equipped
shops that are just as advanced as what corporations

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.789
use in the real world.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.710
(Philip Shirley)
The machine tool technology program is a basic

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:39.710
machinist course and it covers from the most
basic elements of handwork layout and measuring

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.440
metal properties metrology all the way up
through the most advanced of the Computer

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.479
Numerical Control and the software programming.
Students will start off on the most fundamental

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:58.479
skills and build their way up through, over
a sequence of courses, into the CNC work,

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.390
advanced software types of programming. Then
be job ready and go out into the industry

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.800
(Announcer)
Philip Shirley is the Program Director for

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.970
Machine Tool Technology at Georgia Northwestern
Technical College, and the Instructor for

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.670
the Walker County Campus program. According
to Philip, all manufacturing requires machining

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.620
at its core and almost any useable product
requires machining. This means that employment

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.580
opportunities in machining will always be
in great demand.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.710
(Philip Shirley)
Whether building custom motorcycles or working

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:37.190
for a tooling shop that supports Volkswagen
or any other application their all in the

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.909
local service area from Nissin Brake who builds
brake parts for club cars and also for the

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.650
automotive industry, there are just so many
opportunities.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.630
(Jim Owen)
The students that we have brought in from

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:56.370
this program have had the tools and background
necessary to get started immediately.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.270
(Announcer)
Jim Owen is the Senior Vice President of Nissin

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.659
Brake Georgia, Inc. located less than a mile
from the Walker County Campus of Georgia Northwestern

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:05.530
Technical College.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:09.920
(Jim Owen)
One of the major reasons we located in Rock

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:16.700
Spring, GA is the relationship that we knew
that we could have with Georgia Northwestern

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:23.700
and we have accomplished that, a great partnership
as far as their students being able to come

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.030
and be successful here and being able to work
here.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:29.340
(Announcer)
At the Floyd County Campus of Georgia Northwestern

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.700
Technical College, Bart Jenkins serves as
instructor for the Machine Tool Technology

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.050
program.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.510
(Bart Jenkins)
The types of students that normally enjoy

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:44.510
this type of work are students who don’t
like to sit down at a desk. Someone who likes

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:51.010
to work with their hands. Someone who enjoys
doing math when a student comes in I ask do

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.490
you like to work with your hands and do you
like math.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:55.610
(Announcer)
Bart says that the various companies that

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:58.849
need machinists are much more diverse than
most people realize.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.260
(Bart Jenkins)
There’s several different areas where my

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.450
students got to work. I have students up in
the Chattanooga area who are working on Tomahawk

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:14.110
missile parts. I have students in Acworth
who are working on parts for some of the fighter

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:21.110
jets. I have students working for carpet mills
doing simple repair and maintenance. There

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.910
are just many, many different types of jobs
out there for the students in this field.

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.250
(Announcer)
The relationship the Machine Tool Technology

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.150
program has with local industry partners is
beneficial, not only in the course curriculum,

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.489
but also in the placement of students into
careers.

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:39.250
(Jeremy Morrow)
They have had a long-standing relationship

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:44.690
with Roper. Most of the machinists there came
here for their training, just the fact that

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.910
I was in the program here was enough to get
my foot in the door and show them what I could

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:49.160
do.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:52.099
(Dale Jackson)
Phil had a relationship with one of my bosses

00:03:52.099 --> 00:03:58.580
Larry . . He talked to him, told them a little
bit about me. When I went up there he knew

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.319
who I was when I went there. I walked in the
door and he said ‘so you’re Dale,’ come

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:09.410
on in we'll interview you. I guess that pretty
much why I got the job.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.769
(Announcer)
This relationship with local industry is extremely

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:17.840
important. The program has an advisory committee
that is comprised of local industry professionals

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:22.860
that give input on the program needs and what
the students need in order to be prepared

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.979
for a career in machining upon graduation.
In addition, instructors give references to

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:32.889
employers and conduct field trips to give
students exposure to what the working environment

00:04:32.889 --> 00:04:33.759
will be like.

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:38.659
(Jeremy Morrow)
It’s been really beneficial on-hands training,

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:43.150
I’ve used ever bit of knowledge that I have
learned here at Roper, so its very job specific

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.520
to machinists so it’s been real helpful.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.080
(Andrea Marcie Ward)
When I walked upon these machines later on

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:53.419
down the line I knew exactly how they worked,
why they did what they did, and how they did

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:53.960
what they did.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.080
(Announcer)
Graduates of the program may expect to find

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:57.979
a career as a:

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:58.229
Machinist

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.370
Tool and Die Maker

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.960
CNC Operator

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:02.749
CNC Programmer

00:05:02.749 --> 00:05:04.119
Set-up Technician

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:05.240
Supervisor

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.650
Drill Press Operator

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:07.779
Inspector

00:05:07.779 --> 00:05:09.050
Material Tester

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:09.969
Foreman

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:11.129
Lathe Operator

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:12.589
And Machinist Apprentice

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:15.360
(Philip)
Students have a great opportunity they can

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:21.139
work in aerospace, automotive, any one of
a different number of different disciplines.

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.309
It’s so diverse, the trade is diverse.

00:05:24.309 --> 00:05:27.990
(Bart Jenkins)
Several students are working for the aerospace

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:33.580
industries that are manufacturing parts for
the Blackhawk helicopter, the F-22 fighter

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:39.270
a lot of military work is being done in this
area.

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:41.999
(Announcer)
Anytime a company introduces a new product

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:47.009
- it will require new parts. As a result there
is always going to be a need for new parts

00:05:47.009 --> 00:05:51.639
to be created and the high demand for new
machinists will continue to grow and never

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:52.259
go away.

00:05:52.259 --> 00:05:57.180
(Jim Owen)
There’s a great need for students and for

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.360
employees that have this type of background
and knowledge. We still find it very difficult

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:08.399
to find these people that have the background
and have the machine tool experience, so having

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:14.349
people that already have it – have the education,
have the background, have the experience to

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:18.099
come in and hit the ground running is very
important for our business.
