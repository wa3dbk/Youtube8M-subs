00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.750
S!

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:07.340
S!

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.040
U!

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.290
U!

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:11.270
S!

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:12.130
S!

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.870
U!

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:13.570
U!

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.810
S-U-I-K-A!!

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.090
I always forget little promises I make

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.780
Just moments later

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:38.600
After all, I like to keep it casual, no sweat

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.010
It's the only way to live life!

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.340
These souls that gather, worry about the time

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.910
Going this way, going that way, then back again

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.000
It's a waving picture paper show

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.270
For that reason it's fun, for that reason it's painful

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.480
"I'll see you again" and "I want to see you again"

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.150
With such wishes flowers blossom

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.230
Never having time, you'll lose your heart

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:24.940
Day by day, worked to death

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.630
As it's been said,

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.250
"Time is always something you have to make yourself"

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.540
Alienated souls, at their wits' ends

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.020
Go this way, that way, and never return

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.200
It's a paper blizzard, waving back and forth

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.400
Each person coming together, into a mass of relationships and destinies

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.600
Once it's over then yep, that's it!

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.340
Though I'm wrong from time to time..

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.580
It's a waving picture paper show

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.850
For that reason it's fun, for that reason it's painful

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:28.910
"I'll see you again" and "I want to see you again"

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.230
With such wishes flowers blossom

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.310
It's a paper blizzard, waving back and forth

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:41.540
Each person coming together, into a mass of relationships and destinies

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.620
Once it's over then yep, that's it!

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.450
Though I'm wrong from time to time..
