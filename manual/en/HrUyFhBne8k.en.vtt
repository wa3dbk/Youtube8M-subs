00:00:17.440 --> 00:01:26.670
&gt;&gt;Mahindra has just launched the e2o electric
car priced at 5.96 lakh and 6.4 lakh on-road

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:29.890
Delhi for two variants.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:37.880
This car is meant to be a daily commuter,
purely for use in the city.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:54.280
It looks quite contemporary with twin projector
headlamps up front and LED tail lamps at the

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.380
back.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:05.870
The body is made of ABS plastic over a tubular
steel space frame.

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:22.230
It 
is a two door hatchback 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.810
that can seat four adults.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:36.750
It is loaded with features, more than what
regular petrol hatchbacks offer at this price

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:38.010
point.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.990
For instance, you get GPS navigation, touchscreen
infotainment system, reverse camera, power

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:57.110
adjustable mirrors, push-button ignition,
climate 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:18.040
control and a multi-function digital instrument
console, and a mobile phone app to control

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.110
all this.

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:34.709
The car is powered by a 19 kilowatt or 26
bhp motor which puts out 53 newton metres

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:35.709
of torque.

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:46.380
It has an automatic transmission with a boost
mode for overtaking.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:04:05.050
This car can be charged using a regular 15
amp plug.

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:20.979
It 
takes 5 hours for a full charge which lasts

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:33.620
up to 100 km.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:44.060
It also has alternative charging using solar
power and can be used to power your house

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.010
too in an emergency.

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:58.410
However, it's likely to remain a niche product
because of range limitations and a high entry

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:10.910
cost, although running cost is just about
80 paise a kilometre.

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:31.130
It's 
a 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:06:14.590
car meant purely for short city trips, as
the second or third car in a family.
