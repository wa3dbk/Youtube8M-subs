00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.270
Let's cut the paper for our journal, and since
my leather is this big I'm going to lay it

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:16.770
down right beside my paper and I'm going to
measure it. So I have six inches by three

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.199
inches. Now with this, I'm going to take a
half-inch off of that, because by the time

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.630
my paper gets in there, then I'll have a quarter
of an inch room on each side. And then also

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.610
when you fold the paper, it's going to make
it pull up a little bit on the outside. So

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:40.670
I'm going to do five and a half by two and
a half. So come over, and mark my paper...

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:54.850
and I'm going to mark it all the way down,
see how many pieces I can get out of this.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:08.429
So... two and half by five and a half... two
and a half, and five and a half, and that

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:22.670
should be it because that's an eleven inch.
Okay, and, let's see... now where I measured

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.670
here in the center, you're not going to cut
this, because this is where your hole punches

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:35.090
are going to go, they'll go in between here,
and this paper is just going to fold over.

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:51.429
So go ahead and cut it lengthwise, on your
measurements. You don't want to have too much

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:57.419
paper on this one, because you're only going
to do one stack, and if you get too much on

00:01:57.419 --> 00:02:03.689
there, it might be a little too bulky. And
I'm going to have to cut some off the end

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:14.120
of this as well. So, I'm going to fold it
over... I'm going to tuck it in here and kind

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:29.640
of re-measure--go about a half inch up, and
I'm going to cut that again. Little too much

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:44.689
paper in there.

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:53.299
And again, if you want to have a little more
of a rough edge look, you can hand cut these.

00:02:53.299 --> 00:03:00.459
So as soon as you get all of those cut, you're
going to put them together, and then we're

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:07.659
going to mark the top for hole punching. So
I have about two and a half inches here, so

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:14.900
I'm going to come in a half inch, kind of
closer to the center, maybe a little over

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:27.590
a half inch, and then that's where my hole
punching marks are going to go. As soon as

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:32.930
we get all of that done, we'll be ready for
the next step.
