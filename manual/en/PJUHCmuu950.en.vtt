Thank you for joining us today.

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:18.450
I’m Rudy Stebih and welcome to Episode 22
–Annotating A Document In Windows Journals

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.340
here on Help Desk TV.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.769
One of the most useful features of Windows
Journal is the ability it gives you to import

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:33.960
a document from another program and then annotate
the document with written notes, pictures,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.660
and highlights.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:42.660
There are two ways to import a document: Either
the Journal automatically opens the document

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:50.390
in its default program and then uses a special
printer driver, or you open the document in

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.170
its program and then use the printer driver
to send the content of the document to the

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.219
Journal.

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:02.680
Here we will open the documents in the Journal
itself.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:13.910
If the Journal isn’t already running, click
Start -&gt; Accessories -&gt; Tablet PC and select

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.910
‘Windows Journal.

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.080
If this is the first time you’ve run the
program, you will be asked to install the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:45.080
‘Journal’ printer driver, do so when requested.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:56.550
Now click the Import button, select the file
to be used, and click or tap the Import button

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:01.220
in the Import dialog box.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.780
If the Journal can’t open the program for
the type of file you want, open the file in

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:15.260
its correct program, choose to print it with
the Journal Note Printer, and save the print

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:27.530
file as a note.

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:34.310
Use the Journal tools to annotate the document.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:40.630
You will not be able to modify the actual
content of the document.

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:50.730
When completed, save the original annotated
note.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.770
You can share your Journal note using an e-mail
client.

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:01.010
Choose ‘Send To Mail Recipient’ from the
File menu to e-mail the note as a Journal

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.600
file, a Web page, or a tif picture.

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:12.900
You can also choose Export As from the File
menu to create a Web page or a tif file that

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:15.970
you can later send.

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.190
