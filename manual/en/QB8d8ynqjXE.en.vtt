00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:07.029
Scoring in Euchre, although Euchre is primarily
a trick taking game, well actually is a trick

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.700
taking game, it is a bidding game and it's
a game where you obviously try to get as many

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.550
as you can whether you're playing offense
or whether you're playing defense. Now, the

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:26.140
standard scoring unit in Euchre is ten points
equals game. Now there are only three denominations,

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.770
I think that's the right word, but it sounds
right, of points possible in Euchre. You can

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:36.660
earn one point in a hand, you can earn two
points in a hand, and you can earn four points

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.430
in a hand. Now how do you get a point? How
do you get two points? How do you get four

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:45.469
points? Well, the most important thing to
remember in Euchre, the basic, and then there's

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.750
additional bonuses. In order to win a point
you must get a minimum of three out of five

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:57.810
tricks. There are always five tricks in play.
You have to get three tricks. If you name

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:05.660
the trump and you take three tricks you get
one point. It doesn't matter if you take four

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:12.290
tricks. You have to take at least three. If
you take all the tricks you get two points.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:20.300
You sweep, you march, and you get two points.
If you are the defender, and let's just say

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.920
that this person over here has ordered hearts
and you're defending and your side takes three

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:33.350
tricks, you get a bonus of two points and
that's called a Euchre. I don't know why Euchre

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:39.750
is reserved for setting a call, but I didn't
invent the game so I don't know. That's the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:45.560
way it is. If you set the opponent's contract
like in Spades, the difference is that you

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.850
take two points. Now how do you get these
big fat juicy four points? Well, the only

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.560
way you get four points, remember I said Euchre
was a partner's game, however, at any point

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.500
in time, whoever names the trump can declare
that I'm going alone. In other words, they're

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.660
going to play it by themselves without the
help of partner. That makes the task a little

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.450
more difficult because they don't have the
supporting aces and kings in the off suits

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:16.640
and they may not have a killer trump suit,
but if they declare a loner or a lone and

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.820
they take all the tricks, they take all five,
they get a reward of four points. That's a

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:25.250
lot of points because it's a ten point game.
So keep in mind that that's the way the scoring

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:31.320
system works. Three out of five tricks, key
element, getting a loner, key element, game

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.810
ends when somebody reaches ten.
