00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.759
There’s no way a fidgety and skeptical news
anchor would ever have started meditating

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:05.859
were it not for the science.

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:07.430
The science is really compelling.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:14.920
It shows that meditation can boost your immune
system, lower your blood pressure, help you

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.570
deal with problems ranging from irritable
bowel syndrome to psoriasis.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.900
And the neuroscience is where it really gets
sci-fi.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.800
There was a study out of Harvard that shows
that short daily doses of meditation can literally

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.870
grow the gray matter in key areas of your
brain having to do with self-awareness and

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.980
compassion and shrink the gray matter in the
area associated with stress.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.390
There was also a study out of Yale that looked
at what’s called the default mode network

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.390
of the brain.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.390
It’s a connected series of brain regions
that are active during most of our waking

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:53.329
hours when we’re doing that thing that human
beings do all the time which is obsessing

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.110
about ourselves, thinking about the past,
thinking about the future, doing anything

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:00.950
but being focused on what’s happening right
now.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.869
Meditators not only turn off the default mode
network of their brain while they’re meditating

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:07.670
but even when they’re not meditating.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.939
In other words, meditators are setting a new
default mode.

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:12.030
And what’s that default mode?

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.889
They’re focused on what’s happening right
now.

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:16.709
In sports this is called being in the zone.

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:17.709
It’s nothing mystical.

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:18.709
It’s not magical.

00:01:18.709 --> 00:01:21.039
You’re not floating off into cosmic ooze.

00:01:21.039 --> 00:01:28.569
You are just being where you are – big cliché
in self-help circles is being in the now.

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:31.539
You can use that term if you want but because
it’s accurate.

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:33.959
It’s slightly annoying but it’s accurate.

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:38.209
It’s more just being focused on what you’re
doing.

00:01:38.209 --> 00:01:42.569
And the benefits of that are enormous.

00:01:42.569 --> 00:01:47.279
And this is why you’re seeing these unlikely
meditators now, why you’re seeing the U.S.

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:51.539
Marines adopting it, the U.S. Army, corporate
executives from the head of Ford to the founders

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:52.539
of Twitter.

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.359
Athletes from Phil Jackson to many, many Olympians.

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:59.319
Scientists, doctors, lawyers, school children.

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:03.579
There’s this sort of elite subculture of
high achievers who are adopting this because

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:07.329
they know it can help you be more focused
on what you’re doing and it can stop you

00:02:07.329 --> 00:02:10.780
from being yanked around by the voice in your
head.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.780
My powers of prognostication are not great.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.920
I bought a lot of stock in a company that
made Palm Pilot back in 2000 and that didn’t

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:17.920
go so well for me.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.870
But having said that I’m going to make a
prediction.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.560
I think we’re looking at meditation as the
next big public health revolution.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:29.700
In the 1940s if you told people that you went
running they would say, who’s chasing you.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.280
Right now if you tell people you meditate
– and I have a lot of experience with telling

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.750
people this, they’re going to look at you
like you’re a little weird most of the time.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.500
That’s going to change.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.790
Meditation is going to join the pantheon of
no brainers like exercise, brushing your teeth

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.870
and taking the meds that your doctor prescribes
to you.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.100
These are all things that if you don’t do
you feel guilty about.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.650
And that is where I think we’re heading
with meditation because the science is so

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:57.260
strongly suggestive that meditation can do
really, really great things for your brain

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:58.500
and for your body.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:04.590
The common assumption that we have, and it
may be subconscious, is that our happiness

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.850
really depends on external factors – how
was our childhood, have we won the lottery

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.100
recently, did we marry well, did we marry
at all.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:17.850
But, in fact, meditation suggests that happiness
is actually a skill, something you can train

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.080
just the way you can train your body in the
gym.

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.380
It’s a self-generated thing.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.910
And that’s a really radical notion.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.450
It doesn’t mean that external circumstances
aren’t going to impact your happiness.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.360
It doesn’t mean you’re not going to be
subject to the vagaries of an impermanent,

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.360
entropic universe.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:39.480
It just means you are going to be able to
navigate this with a little bit more ease.
