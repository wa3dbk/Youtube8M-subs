00:00:20.334 --> 00:00:22.918
Its mad I've been making Titans for over 20 years

00:00:22.918 --> 00:00:25.542
but I've never made one with an inner mesh capsule

00:00:30.792 --> 00:00:33.125
and I'm glad we did with the hot summer we've just had

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:35.375
because I field tested it myself

00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:38.876
and I thought it was great for keeping out mosquitos and the like

00:00:38.876 --> 00:00:42.000
For our European friends it will have much greater benefits

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.542
keeping out snakes and some other real nasties

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.375
There is a one and two man version of the Globetrotters

00:00:51.667 --> 00:00:55.167
They feature an inner mesh capsule with a waterproof front

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:59.000
where you can lift up panels to expose a mesh door and windows

00:01:05.792 --> 00:01:09.834
Then it has a waterproof over skin with an extended porch

00:01:13.083 --> 00:01:18.792
so if the rain is driving in your face the door can be used pillar box style so you can just zip down part of it

00:01:18.792 --> 00:01:21.167
and look out and there is no water ingress

00:01:25.959 --> 00:01:29.459
In the rear we have built in a zipped flap

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:34.542
so you can unzip that and expose the rear of the mesh capsule

00:01:34.542 --> 00:01:38.667
so you can have air flow through on those hot summer days and nights

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:43.834
This is a Titan in every sense of the word

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:47.959
Its got the legendary Titan frame renowned for strength

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:50.417
In fact they have saved people's lives

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:53.209
So attached to that is a mesh capsule

00:01:53.209 --> 00:01:56.959
This summer on those really hot nights that's how I fished

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:58.918
I didn't have the overwrap on it

00:01:58.918 --> 00:02:02.292
For damper nights and when it is raining just slip the overwrap on

00:02:02.292 --> 00:02:05.959
and because it is twin skinned you will get no condensation drip

00:02:10.542 --> 00:02:13.459
Fitted to the inner mesh capsule is a lightweight groundsheet

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:15.959
That makes it easier to fold up and put away

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.751
but we do an accessory heavy duty groundsheet

00:02:18.751 --> 00:02:25.459
I recommend putting it underneath then if you have sharp stones underneath it won't puncture through the lightweight groundsheet

00:02:30.667 --> 00:02:31.667
So there you have it

00:02:31.667 --> 00:02:35.042
Titan Globetrotter available in one man and two man sizes

00:02:35.042 --> 00:02:38.167
Its a great bit of kit and I think it will be well favoured

00:02:38.167 --> 00:02:40.375
Like I said if we keep having hot summers here

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:42.584
or especially for our European friends

00:02:42.584 --> 00:02:45.000
I hope they think I'm thinking of them now
