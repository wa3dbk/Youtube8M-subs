00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Safety test of novel lithium-metal-polymer accumulators

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The electric car of Dbm Energy has driven 600 kilometers
 (~373 miles) on a single charge - World Record!

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The drive from Munich to Berlin is accompanied
 by amazement and disbelieve, exultation and envy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The long distance record could push Germany
 very far ahead in terms of electro-mobility.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The funding of the project by the Federal Ministry
 for Economics and Technology pays off...

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
...because range is the deciding factor
 for the broad acceptance of electric vehicles.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Extensive safety tests are also necessary.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
The tests are performed in accordance
 with a list of criteria of the UN.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Guarantor for the objective performance
 of those series of tests is the Federal Institute
 for Materials Research and Testing.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000
We have the task of performing safety-related
 tests on new kinds of technologies.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000
At the moment we test novel
 lithium-metal-polymer batteries.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000
For this a series of tests is performed.
It consists of 8 very extensive tests.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Mechanical Vibration
Mechanical Shock
(T3, T4 of the UN test criteria)

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
We see here the vibration test and the shock test.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Here the accumulators are exposed to
 mechanical vibrations of up to 200 Hz...

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000
...or accelerations of up to 150
 times gravitational acceleration.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The test procedures are persnickety
 defined. The technicians of the BAM (institute)
 are testing with routine and precision.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
In the 8 test series, the cells
 of which the novel car battery consists
 are checked for safety in daily use.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Shake und shock tests are naturally a part of
 it, when the battery is meant to be fit for the road.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
In the result one can see, that all test
 samples have passed this test successfully.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Altitude Simulation
Climate Test
(T1, T2 of the UN test criteria)

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Batteries of electric vehicles have to work
 flawlessly and reliably in every season.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:12.000
Also during transportation of cells and batteries,
for example from the manufacturer to the 
customers worldwide, safety issues must not occur.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I'm in 1 and you go to 11 and 12.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:28.000
In the climate chamber the new accumulators
 therefore also have to persist, just like in the
 altitude simulation with an external pressure
 of only 1/10 atmospheric pressure.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:38.000
In those tests we have on the one hand an
 altitude simulation, in which the cells will be
 exposed to the conditions in an airplane.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
On the other hand we have a simulation of
 extreme climatic fluctuations from -40 to +75
 degrees Celsius (-40째F to 167째F).

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The cells have successfully passed the
altitude simulation as well as the climate test.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Electric Short
Electric Overload
Forced Discharge
(T5, T7, T8 of the UN test criteria)

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
During the electric test series the cell are
 on the one hand subjected to an electric short.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
On the other hand the cells are overloaded
 and force discharged through faulty polarization.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000
The cells did not become leaky during the short,
 didn't heat up to over 170째C (338째F) and kept
 more than 90% of the voltage. Conclusion:

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
The electrical safety requirements were fully fulfilled.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Mechanical Impact
(T6 of the UN test criteria)

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:37.000
We see here a so-called Drop Tower. 
From there, a mass of 9.1 kg (~20 lbs) is
 dropped on the respective test object.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Mechanical influences, as they occur, for example,
 in accidents can be simulated by us this way.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Impact of 9.1 kg (~20 lbs) from a height of 61 cm (~2 ft)

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
The tested accumulators have fully passed this test.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Inflammation (additional test)

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
The fire test is a additional test, which
 is not described in the UN Testing Manual.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
It effectively simulates the
 influence of a fire from the outside.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:19.000
In the result the novel accumulators
 behave more or less comparable to
 lead accumulators from automobile batteries...

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000
...where this plastic housing can also catch fire.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000
The fire that was caused by the 
inflammation went out after a few minutes.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Overall the cells proved
 absolutely fire- and explosion-proof.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Conclusion

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.000
In the series of tests very hard
 conditions are set for the accumulator cells.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
The tests so far have all been positive. 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:58.000
We were surprised ourselves, that
 the accumulators fulfilled the safety
 requirements of this internationally 
approved series of tests so well.
