00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:26.040
Bat woke up.
He flew out of his cave.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.500
"I want bugs!"
Bat said.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.190
"I will find bugs.
And I will eat them!"

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:58.340
Bat flew up in the sky.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:06.180
Bat flew over houses.
He flew over trees.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.180
He found some big bugs.
He found some little bugs.

00:01:14.819 --> 00:01:29.000
He ate and ate and ate.
He flew and flew and flew.

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:35.789
Bat was happy.
"It's time to go home and sleep!"

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:44.089
But now it was very dark.
"Where is home?" Bat said.

00:01:45.069 --> 00:01:55.069
A big wind came up.
A lot of rain came down.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.509
Bat was far from home.
