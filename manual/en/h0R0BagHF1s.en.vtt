00:00:00.022 --> 00:00:02.739
- Hey guys, it's been
forever since I did a video

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:03.949
here on YouTube.

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:05.364
So a lot has changed here.

00:00:05.364 --> 00:00:07.011
We now have a beautiful baby boy

00:00:07.011 --> 00:00:08.346
who has joined our family.

00:00:08.346 --> 00:00:11.195
His name is Avery Alexander
and is just the cutest,

00:00:11.195 --> 00:00:12.681
happiest baby.

00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:14.884
(baby coos)

00:00:14.884 --> 00:00:18.497
and then coinciding with Avery's arrival

00:00:18.497 --> 00:00:21.033
we finally we able to
move into our new home

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:24.616
which also coincided
with Thanksgiving week

00:00:25.508 --> 00:00:26.831
and of course the holidays.

00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:28.525
So it's just been a lot of adjusting here

00:00:28.525 --> 00:00:30.989
and it's been really busy.

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:34.305
I'm ready to jump back
on the YouTube train

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:36.135
and get this party started if you will.

00:00:36.135 --> 00:00:37.607
I wanted to talk about my hair extensions.

00:00:37.607 --> 00:00:40.274
(playful music)

00:00:49.036 --> 00:00:51.170
People who know that I've
had extension in the past.

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.229
They ask me well how do they
compare to the other ones?

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:54.414
So the other ones that I had

00:00:54.414 --> 00:00:56.772
they were called Hothead hair extensions

00:00:56.772 --> 00:00:58.394
and they were paneled extensions.

00:00:58.394 --> 00:01:00.990
So I'll leave the link
to that review up here

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.124
you can learn a little
bit more about that.

00:01:03.124 --> 00:01:05.484
But the biggest drawback I felt with those

00:01:05.484 --> 00:01:09.807
were that I wasn't really
able to pull my hair up

00:01:09.807 --> 00:01:12.017
into like a high ponytail
or half up, half down.

00:01:12.017 --> 00:01:13.910
I had to be really conscious

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.883
of where the panels were placed.

00:01:15.883 --> 00:01:17.125
So I wanted something

00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:20.242
where I really could do anything with it.

00:01:20.242 --> 00:01:22.704
Great Length hair extensions
are the ones that I got

00:01:22.704 --> 00:01:24.315
and that's what I have in my hair now

00:01:24.315 --> 00:01:25.903
'cause it's like keratin beads

00:01:25.903 --> 00:01:29.073
that are fused into your hair.

00:01:29.073 --> 00:01:31.035
And they're put all throughout your hair.

00:01:31.035 --> 00:01:34.422
I have 250 pieces in my had right now.

00:01:34.422 --> 00:01:37.608
It took eight hours to put
these babies in, eight hours

00:01:37.608 --> 00:01:39.462
and I was eight months pregnant

00:01:39.462 --> 00:01:41.034
'cause I got them back in September

00:01:41.034 --> 00:01:43.490
right before I did the fashion show

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:45.041
with Strut Moms and Cottonelle.

00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:46.698
So that was kinda crazy

00:01:46.698 --> 00:01:49.842
and that was probably
the worst part I think

00:01:49.842 --> 00:01:52.468
of these extensions was just
the eight hours in the chair.

00:01:52.468 --> 00:01:54.239
When I left there I thought,

00:01:54.239 --> 00:01:55.379
"Oh my god I'm going into labor."

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:57.408
A lot of compliments when
I've had my hair done

00:01:57.408 --> 00:01:58.909
by other hair dresser.

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:00.408
She was meticulous about the spacing

00:02:00.408 --> 00:02:03.016
and how they were put in which is why

00:02:03.016 --> 00:02:06.156
I didn't lose any of my
extensions over time.

00:02:06.156 --> 00:02:07.932
Some people lose one or two.

00:02:07.932 --> 00:02:10.147
I didn't lose any over five months.

00:02:10.147 --> 00:02:13.167
Do your research and make
sure whoever is doing them

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:14.873
really knows what they're doing.

00:02:14.873 --> 00:02:17.170
I've pretty much been able
to do anything I wanted

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.709
with these extensions.

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.850
You just have to be really careful

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:23.696
when you're doing anything
like flat iron or curling iron,

00:02:23.696 --> 00:02:26.143
just be careful with the
beads just as you would

00:02:26.143 --> 00:02:28.269
with the panel or any extension really.

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.506
You just don't want anything to melt.

00:02:30.506 --> 00:02:32.899
And I even got tired of
the color at one point

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:34.049
and wanted a little bit lighter

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.886
and my hair dresser was able
to kind of give me an ombre

00:02:36.886 --> 00:02:39.651
on the bottom which I love.

00:02:39.651 --> 00:02:42.963
I feel like you can't
really tell how light it is

00:02:42.963 --> 00:02:44.027
but it's pretty light.

00:02:44.027 --> 00:02:47.748
The ends, like the other ones
sometimes get a little dry

00:02:47.748 --> 00:02:49.581
but that's I think to be expected

00:02:49.581 --> 00:02:51.709
'cause it's not you know live hair.

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.870
So I've been using these two products

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.573
and that's Biosilk which is amazing.

00:02:57.573 --> 00:02:59.667
Biosilk, honestly this is my favorite one.

00:02:59.667 --> 00:03:01.123
But I got this from my hair stylist.

00:03:01.123 --> 00:03:04.862
She uses the Wella products
and it smells great

00:03:04.862 --> 00:03:08.846
and it puts a nice like
shiny finish on your hair

00:03:08.846 --> 00:03:11.107
so I used this one but
I really used this one,

00:03:11.107 --> 00:03:14.597
the Biosilk on the ends
just to kinda tame the frizz

00:03:14.597 --> 00:03:18.264
because sometimes they
are a little bit dry.

00:03:20.304 --> 00:03:21.328
Okay so after five months

00:03:21.328 --> 00:03:22.615
I was pretty much done
with the extensions.

00:03:22.615 --> 00:03:24.214
There was some matting going on

00:03:24.214 --> 00:03:27.077
and I was just getting really
nervous about breakage.

00:03:27.077 --> 00:03:29.813
So I went in to see my
hair stylist Regina.

00:03:29.813 --> 00:03:31.289
- Hi.

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:33.720
- It wasn't the worst case
of matting she had seen,

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.261
and she thought that I probably
could go another few weeks

00:03:36.261 --> 00:03:37.319
before getting them out.

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:40.209
I was ready so she took them out

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.441
by putting a solvent onto the keratin bead

00:03:43.441 --> 00:03:45.514
and she took what looked like pliers

00:03:45.514 --> 00:03:48.832
and just kind of gave it a little squeeze

00:03:48.832 --> 00:03:52.115
and they kind of just came right off.

00:03:52.115 --> 00:03:56.270
It did take about I would say 3-1/2 hours.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.615
So it was a little bit of a long day.

00:03:58.615 --> 00:04:00.946
As nervous as I was about all the breakage

00:04:00.946 --> 00:04:02.308
and with the matting and everything

00:04:02.308 --> 00:04:04.667
I was really surprised to see

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:06.263
that there really wasn't a lot of breakage

00:04:06.263 --> 00:04:08.884
and my hair actually looked pretty healthy

00:04:08.884 --> 00:04:09.891
when they came out.

00:04:09.891 --> 00:04:12.444
So I think that with the
Great Lengths hair extensions

00:04:12.444 --> 00:04:14.517
it's definitely an investment.

00:04:14.517 --> 00:04:18.816
You're looking at probably
$1,500 maybe a little bit more.

00:04:18.816 --> 00:04:21.805
It depends probably on how
much hair you're getting put in

00:04:21.805 --> 00:04:22.935
and how much time it's gonna take

00:04:22.935 --> 00:04:25.536
and your stylist's rate for her hours.

00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:29.310
So it may vary but it's
in the $1,500 range.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.970
So it's definitely an investment

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.556
but they're really great extensions.

00:04:32.556 --> 00:04:35.180
So if you have any questions
that I didn't get to,

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.938
anything that I didn't
maybe answer in this review,

00:04:37.938 --> 00:04:39.815
feel free to leave them
in the comments below.

00:04:39.815 --> 00:04:41.241
But this has been my experience

00:04:41.241 --> 00:04:42.665
with Great Lengths hair extensions.

00:04:42.665 --> 00:04:45.332
(playful music)
