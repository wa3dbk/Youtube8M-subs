Hey guys welcome back to you
another amazing tutorial my name is

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:04.779
ABDERRAHMANE

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:08.840
from someone pro channel and in
today's video I'm going to be showing

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.330
you

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.990
how to create a bootable USB pen drive
for Windows 8

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.400
without using in additional softwares so
for this

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.520
you are going to need windows 8 iso

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.920
and a 8GB or higher USB pendrive

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.599
so let's begin 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.030
so the first thing

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:42.030
that you wanna do is to plugg in the USB pen drive

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.040
and then click the start button

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.940
and search for CMD that means

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.170
command prompt now type in the following

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.660
commands diskpart enter

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.660
list disk enter

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.759
select disk 1 now clean

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:17.119
create partition primary

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.210
select partition 1

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.439
active format

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.049
fs=ntfs quick

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:37.049
assign

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:44.510
finally exit

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.240
now what I'm basically going to do

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.490
is to extract the files from the iso
here

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.640
so here is my Windows 8

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.619
so right click on that and

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.540
here we have extract files so click on
that

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.630
and then choose your USB pen drive from
this list

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.590
and click OK now after you have done that

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.870
go ahead and shutdown your computer

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:22.870
and once again plugg in the USB pen drive

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:31.370
now go ahead

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.970
power on your computer and I'm going to
click on

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.550
F2 to enter the setup

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:43.610
so here

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.730
we have a the BIOS  settings

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.760
so what I am going to do is to

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.320
click on the right arrow and choose

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:58.240
boot now

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.600
here we have boot device priority

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:05.740
so make sure to click on that and 
once again

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.000
make sure to

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.420
make your USB pen drive at the top

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:16.580
of this list that's very important

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.130
and click on F10 in my case to

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:23.730
exit and save the a changes

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.830
and this is

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:31.280
pretty much it so I'm going to let you

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.280
see the Windows installation

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.760
