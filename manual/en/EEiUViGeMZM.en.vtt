00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:04.810
Hello! My name is Grady Johnson and I'm a
professional painter. And today I represent

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:09.750
expertvillage.com. Okay now we're ready to
roll the ceiling. Now, one thing we didn't

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.940
mention in our basic painting tools is you
are going to need some kind of a pole to roll

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.140
the ceiling. Now I have a pretty nice painter's
pole, but you can just use a regular stick

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.490
that will screw into the end. But you are
going to need something. So I'm going to extend

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.670
that on out to where I want it. So I'm going
to go ahead and lay this up against the wall.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.699
Now, I'm just going to go ahead and grab that
cardboard here and I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.220
place this cardboard here in the hallway to
be sure that that is covered. Now, remember

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.410
as you're going along that you're going to
find little things like that that you've missed.

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.220
Be sure and pick it. Now, of all the work
that you're going to do, this is the part

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.560
that you need to the most careful with. Because
paint from a ceiling will go everywhere. So

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.320
be sure every square inch is completely covered
and keep and eye on it as you're working.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.200
Even if you've dropped it off really well,
you'll find things will pull away from the

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.969
wall while you're working. So keep an eye
on it and then when you're done, go back and

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:05.909
find out where it screwed up because it probably
will. So let's go ahead and get a nice full

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.049
roller of paint and the first thing we want
to do is kind of cut it in where we're working.

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:17.360
Now, what that is is just running it along
this edge right here and cutting that in real

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.150
well so that we have sort of an area that
we can roll to. Now we we're going to do the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:34.890
same thing on the other side and you see the
texture's different too. So you want to get

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.420
kind of close with that so that it has the
same look. So roll it out and then even it

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:47.470
out. So you get the paint up there then even
it out. Now, you want to keep a light touch

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:53.040
when you do that evening out and that's what
gives it that good look. Be careful if it

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.829
starts to slide. That looks ugly and bring
the rest of it on out. Now, once that's good

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.259
and even, then we're going to kind of come
back the other way. So the first thing we

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:10.529
want to do is cut it in again and that's this
ledge right here. You see that slide. We want

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:18.730
to fix that. It's not a perfect size. So just
try to work with the paint too. Now once again,

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:26.780
you're going to have to get this edge up here
too and square that up for yourself. So you

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.150
can see that on this that the one side makes
a line, the other side takes it off. So just

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.410
even that out with a light touch and you'll
get the feel of it after you work with it

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.329
a little bit. Yeah, we have a lot more ceiling
to go. But these are all the basic tips you

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:44.989
need to keep in mind when you're rolling an
interior ceiling.
