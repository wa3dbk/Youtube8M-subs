00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.980
Hello everyone, I’m Jakesteramma with BroCo
Gaming.

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:07.999
Today, I’d like to show you how and why
I farm Pyro Pete the Invincible.

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:12.530
Pyro Pete is not known for dropping the greatest
loot but he’s definitely worth farming for

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.310
a few good reasons.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:24.519
He will drop random Legendary items including
weapons, shields ,grenade mods and class mods.

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:27.390
He drops Seraph shields and grenades.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:32.029
and the main reason for farming him, he’s
relatively easy to beat and he drops a good

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.620
amount of Seraph crystals which can be used
to buy great items like the Antagonist shield,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.399
the Florentine SMG, a Binary Infection and
more.

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.239
First off, there are two things you must do
in order to farm Pyro Pete for seraph crystals:

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:52.489
you must be in Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode
and complete the mission “Pete the Invincible”

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.559
which becomes available after finishing Mr.
Torgue’s Campaign of Carnage DLC.

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.539
When you first start battling Pyro Pete, he
will be wearing a helmet which prevents you

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.960
from doing any critical hit damage.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:08.170
Typically, you need to destroy his shield
and then do enough health damage before his

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.200
helmet will pop off.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.270
This is where the Trespasser Sniper Rifle
comes in.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:16.890
The Trespasser will shoot through shields.

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.189
This will allow you to pop off his helmet
and start doing critical hit damage almost

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.540
the entire time you’re fighting him which
will dramatically shorten the amount of time

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.350
it takes to kill him.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.130
You can obtain the Trespasser as a reward
for completing the mission “Animal Rights”

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.060
in the Wildlife Exploitation Preserve.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.060
So to start off the battle, you’ll need
a few items which will work with any character:

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.399
the Trespasser Sniper Rifle,
something to slag with,

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.010
The Bee shield,
any relic that boosts Sniper Rifle Damage,

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:57.320
and any class mod that will help increase
the damage of the Trespasser.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.740
This will vary depending on what character
you’re using.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.600
While battling Pyro Pete, I’m going to be
utilizing the ledge that’s behind these

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.750
two pillars in the arena.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.769
This can be very helpful especially if you
don’t have the best weapons or if you find

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.890
it difficult to defeat Pete on the floor.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.900
In either corner between the two pillars,
you’ll be able to jump up onto the ledge.

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.000
But I find it easier to jump up to the ledge
using the right corner.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.780
This is the first thing you want to do.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:28.790
So let’s pay to get the battle started and
get up on that ledge.

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.590
Run over to the corner and jump up into this
corner.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.180
After your first jump, keep hitting the jump
button as fast as you possibly can until you

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.230
raise up onto the ledge.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:39.230
If you haven’t done this before, it’s
a good idea to practice this a couple of times

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.230
to get the hang of it before starting the
battle.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.319
As soon as you get up onto the ledge, it’s
best to hide behind the right pillar until

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:46.900
you know what Pyro Pete is doing.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.620
From up here on the ledge, you’ll want to
keep Pyro Pete slagged and shoot his helmet

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.930
with the Trespasser until it pops off.

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.940
There are a few things to be careful of while
you’re doing this.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:01.520
Pyro Pete will do caustic and incendiary blasts.

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:11.349
Just before for he does this, he will make
a warning sound and raise his arms.

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:14.940
When you hear this, hide behind a pillar for
protection.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.480
Also, Pyro Pete will continue to attempt to
jump on the ledge until he’s successful.

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.800
This is a good thing.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.909
Once Pyro Pete is on the ledge, jump down.

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:31.010
Now Pyro Pete is stuck up on the ledge.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:35.430
Once you have successfully removed his helmet,
he will quickly do a fire blast that you’ll

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.240
need to avoid.

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.520
Now make any changes necessary to your setup
to do maximum critical hit and shock damage

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.269
to destroy his shield.

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:51.780
I prefer to use a Shock Sandhawk, an SMG damage
relic, and a Class Mod that’s appropriate

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.970
for your character.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.299
I’ll put some combinations I like to use
for different characters in the description

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.360
of this video and let me know what you like
to use in the comments.

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:06.340
As soon as you obliterate Pete’s shield,
he’ll quickly do a fire and corrosive blast.

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.010
So watch out for that.

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.629
Now change out your setup again to do pure
critical hit damage.

00:04:12.629 --> 00:04:19.510
Some great items for this are a Double Penetrating
Unkempt Harold, Stopping Sandhawk, Lady Fists,

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:25.080
Chaotic Evil class mod, a Sheriff’s Badge
Relic for pistols, the appropriate weapon

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.160
damage relic, and many others.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.230
Here are a few tips to help you out during
battle.

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:37.140
When Pete walks to the very far right or left
of the ledge, avoid going out there with him.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:42.260
It’s difficult to get behind a pillar in
time to avoid his blasts.

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:44.380
Stay closer to the pillars.

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:50.170
If you do get blasted by Pete’s fire or
corrosion, you’ll want to go to this water

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:53.420
valve, turn it on and walk through the water.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:05:01.760
If you don’t do this, the fire or corrosion
will not stop unless you kill Pete.

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:06.320
This water valve will release Spiderants and
the other one will release Rats which are

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:07.660
harder to kill.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.610
A shock singularity grenade like a Quasar
will easily take care of the Spiderants.

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:18.850
If you run out of ammo, just activate this
and two chests will appear with ammo.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:23.070
And speaking of ammo, it’s a great idea
to have a high damage weapon of each type

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.450
with you.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.360
Especially if it has added critical hit damage.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:32.920
This way, if you run out of ammo with one
weapon type, just switch to another.

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:38.210
Just don’t forget to switch relics to boost
each weapon type.

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:43.480
After you kill Pete, collect your rewards
which might entail jumping back up on the

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.480
ledge.

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:49.480
I’ve noticed that sometimes you can’t
jump back up on the ledge after you kill Pete.

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.940
Some of the time this is due to loot blocking
your way.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:58.440
So just jump, pick it up, and you should be
able to get up to the ledge.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.500
If all else fails, you can do a grenade jump.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:05.790
To do this, un-equip your grenade mod so you
don’t have one.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:11.000
Throw a grenade in the corner, run up to it
and jump right before it explodes.

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.060
This should propel you up onto the ledge.

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:18.170
But it does take a few tries to get the timing
down.

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:22.110
When you’re done collecting everything,
don’t forget to check the two chests in

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.560
the room where Moxxi used to be.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:27.860
You have a chance to score Legendaries from
them.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:29.560
And that’s how I farm Pyro Pete.

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:31.460
Thanks for watching everyone!
