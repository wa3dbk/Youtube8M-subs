00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.500
Table for four is there. Table for two is the corner table

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.500
I have here a work experience badge

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:31.000
and this is a picture of me. I am a catering assistant.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Sugar pots to be checked. Move and lay tables.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Knife, fork, and spoon wrapped up in a cutlery, and we put them on this tray, put them out on the table.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:59.500
These are serving spoons, so they can pick out the vegetables.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We get busy, by lunchtime we are full of customers.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.500
And good morning to you! Would you like to take a seat?

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:20.500
I help take orders and help serve teas and coffees, and make lunches in the kitchen.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Customer: And a white coffee for me please.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.500
Penny does the cooking most of the time. I do sometimes give a little bit of help.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.500
Things like the cake are very very very difficult to make. I have to use a recipe.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.500
We have a specials board over there. 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:00.500
We have one board for main courses and the other one is for their sweets, for their desserts.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:18.000
The best job, it would be helping taking orders and things like that.  Make teas and coffees and things like that.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
We have a special notepad to write down orders.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.500
Woman: And I will just have a black coffee please.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:34.500
This is the first time that I have done work experience, and I like it here.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Man: Cappuccino is for me.
Ben: and a black coffee

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Man: Thank you.
Woman: Thank you very much.
