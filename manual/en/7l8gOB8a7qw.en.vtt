00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I love you so, I have no one but you

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
I had nothing and that became a sin

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
For a long time it will be hard

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
But what can I do, I only have you

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
L.O.V.E my love is deeper than I thought

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
But why is it so hard?

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I can't breathe, frustration is on the tip of my tongue, tears flow

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
It's no use to cry and yell and cling

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Instead I bear with it, trying to find you again

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
My lonely days are like scenes from a drama

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Don't ask anymore of my painful story

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
I will show you my heart again

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
You just need to be close to me, without any explanation

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Because I'm a man I will love you

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Because I'm a man I will wait for you

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Don't tell me why 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:12.000
You left me, you threw me away who was in love

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
I loved you like I was crazy

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
I put my whole life into you

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I will look upon you and learn what love is

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If you don't like that, I will forget you

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I loved you like this, like a man

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
I loved you sometimes miserably

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
My life was contingent of coldness and hunger

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
But the thought of having you

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
makes flowers bloom like spring in my heart

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I love you, only you (I love you)

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
My love grows big, and eventually makes you uneasy

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
My obsession of emotions created by my imagination

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Became a heavy burden of love to you

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Separation becomes continuous

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
When I throw away love without anyone knowing my heart or my feelings

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
My heart rips in two without anyone knowing my heart or feelings

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
When I throw away love without anyone knowing my heart or my feelings

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000
My heart rips in two without anyone knowing my heart or feelings

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
Don't tell me why 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
You left me, you threw me away who was in love

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.000
I loved you like I was crazy

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I put my whole life into you

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:34.000
When I throw away love without anyone knowing my heart or my feelings

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
My heart rips in two without anyone knowing my heart or feelings

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000
When I throw away love without anyone knowing my heart or my feelings

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:51.000
My heart rips in two without anyone knowing my heart or feelings

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Because I'm a man I will love you

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
Because I'm a man I will wait for you

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Because I'm a man I wil love you

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Because I'm a man I will wait for you

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I miss the scent of your breath

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
I miss the fluttering feeling 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
I miss the smile of our first meet

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.000
I miss the moment when you were here

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000
I miss the fluttering feeling 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
I miss the smile of our first meet

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I miss the moment when you were here
