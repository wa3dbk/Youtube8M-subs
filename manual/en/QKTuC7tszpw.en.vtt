00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:07.080
New Elder Scrolls Online gameplay footage
and info, Blizzard's unannounced MMO gets

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.400
pushed back, Notch receives a golden PS1,
and the Sonic: Lost Worlds debut trailer!

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.809
Hey guys, I'm Jess, and this is the Curse
Weekly Roundup!

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.090
First up, Bethesda has given the go-ahead
to begin posting gameplay videos of TESO - I

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.480
personally got to try a hands-on with the
game a few weeks ago and it was FANTASTIC.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.770
The quests really feel like classic Elder
Scrolls quests, and the setting includes all

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:32.399
of Tamriel, letting you explore areas like
Skyrim, Cyrodiil, Daggerfall, and more - and

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.020
guilds like the Dark Brotherhood and the Thieves'
Guild will be in TESO, likely in DLC.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:40.100
Anyway, there are TONS of TESO gameplay videos
hitting the interwebs, so we'll link a few

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.170
of those for you in the video description,
and remember for tons more TESO info be sure

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.430
to bookmark the TESO Wiki and TesoFansite,
both of which we'll link for you as well!

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.130
Interestingly, Bethesda has NOT yet announced
whether TESO will be free-to-play or subscription

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.070
based - what do you guys think?

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.470
Personally, with the rise of the free-to-play
model, I'm guessing that's the way they'll

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:00.770
go, but leave me a comment and lemme know
your thoughts.

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.780
Next, Blizzard's upcoming unnanounced MMO
has been delayed.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.439
Now, we're using that term kind of loosely
because technically all this info, like the

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:13.299
codename Titan and the potential 2014 release
schedule, was accidentally leaked - but now

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.520
a statement from Mike Morhaime has confirmed
that the dev team has been reduced from 100

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:22.399
to just 30 developers, and that those remaining
on the team are starting over on Titan.

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:25.700
The rest were reassigned to other areas like
WoW, Blizzard All-Stars, and the Diablo 3

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.719
expansion, meaning that now we shouldn't expect
to see Titan until 2016 at the earliest.

00:01:30.719 --> 00:01:32.590
Moving on, Sonic is back!

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.959
No, I'm not talking about the American fast-food
chain - everyone's favorite speedy blue hedgehog

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:39.039
returns in Sonic Lost Worlds.

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:42.869
The game has QUITE the debut trailer, and
fans are already getting hyped - but many

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.109
are dubbing it "Super Sonic Galaxy," for the
way it mimics Mario Galaxy's use of gravity

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.119
to allow players to walk sideways or upside
on some surfaces.

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:55.439
Also interesting is that Sonic Lost Worlds
is a Nintendo exclusive, it'll be released

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.509
for the WiiU and 3DS only, and you can click
the link below to watch the debut trailer

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:00.990
for yourself.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.669
Next up, Microsoft has filed a legal complaint
in an effort to take ownership of the domains

00:02:05.669 --> 00:02:10.819
XboxOne.com and XboxOne.net - both domains
were registered to some guy in London - but

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.370
interestingly enough, he resgistered both
of them in December of 2011 - well before

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:21.290
the Xbox One had been announced, and purportedly
even before the name had been decided on - so

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.560
it's not like he foudn the name due to leaked
info, he simply...got lucky.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.480
Heck, I'd say offer to sell them to Microsoft
for a couple thousand bucks.

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.790
Finally, Sony has invited Notch to their E3
event in an interesting way: they sent him

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.650
a gold-colored PS1.

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.510
Not exactly sure...WHY, but many are speculating
that this is Sony's attempt to suck up to

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.150
Notch and get Minecraft on the PS4 and Vita
once Mojang's exclusivity contract with Microsoft

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:47.019
ends - what do you guys think?

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.599
Would you play Minecraft on the PS4?

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.690
Leave me a comment and lemme know!

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.510
