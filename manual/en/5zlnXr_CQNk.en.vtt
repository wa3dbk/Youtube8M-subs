What's up guy and girl players of WoW. Tarou
here bringing you this week's WoW Report Episode

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:24.220
44! For more FREE WoW guides, check out my

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.980
Did everyone have a good weekend? Good, good.
I want to take a second to dedicate this weekly

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.290
WoW report to you and thank all you subscribers
for helping me reach 40,000 subs on YouTube.

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.070
I couldn't of done it without all of you.
Mad &lt;3's and thanks again. Now on to this

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.820
week's WoW report.

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:48.030
In Cataclysm news, the guild Midwinter took
the US first title for getting Glory of the

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.110
Cataclysm Raider. Mad grats to them and I
expect other US guilds to follow.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.489
In other Cata news, we once again got more
hotfixes from March 17th to the 24th that

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.829
covered mostly some dungeons and raids fixes
as well as Drums of Forgotten Kings no longer

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:06.890
stacking with some resistance buffs.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:13.260
Patch 4.1 seems to be held up on the PTR for
whatever reason. Some new things keep getting

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.399
added to each build but most aren't even likely
to launch with Patch 4.1. Blizzard is looking

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:24.090
to get early testing on these different tools
so the next PTR can focus on even more. They

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.150
also went ahead and released more info about
Zul'Gurub and Zul'Aman. Everything is looking

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.369
pretty cool especially the better item slot
selection that most players were having trouble

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.229
with. Although, my favorite has to be these
new pets and mounts. Which ones are you looking

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:41.300
for? Let me know in the comments.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.700
Ok, now on to Auction House chaos. While Blizzard
does seem to have some things in the works

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.490
for being more effective in banning botters,
they have yet to stop much if any gatherer

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.709
botters due to the one they would ban, is
just a stolen account anyway. That means the

00:01:57.709 --> 00:02:03.050
botter moves on to another account basically
untouched. They need a way to ban a section

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:08.130
of IPs or something a lot more intricate than
what they have now. So, why am I talking about

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.950
this during the AH segment, well because ore,
herb, and Volatile prices are at all time

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.580
lows. This means the gatherers are suffering
a bit but the crafters are making bank off

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:26.230
these cheap mat prices. Almost every single
profession has had its profit increase dramatically.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.440
Gatherers are still makin' bank so don't feel
too bad.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.959
Alright, moving on to this week's Auction
House tip. Be patient. Be very very patient.

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:41.360
At the same time though, move fast. What the
hell does that even mean, right. Well, imagine

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.810
a Black Panther, maybe a ZG Black Panther,
who waits for their prey. The second they

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.599
see an opening, they leap out and give one
fatal bite to the neck capturing all the life

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:58.590
of their prey in one powerful smashing swoop.
I work the AH the same way, I watch for prices

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.130
to fall patiently and with one big swoop,
buy out everything that is cheap in an instant.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:09.680
In Blizzard news, mad grats to the Blizz team
on their 20th anniversary and they were even

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.720
aloud to ring the bell at the Nasdaq a few
weeks back. If you couldn't tell by my Auction

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.650
House craziness, I'm big into stocks as well
so popping on the TV and seeing them show

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.239
up to ring the bell was pretty funny.

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:27.209
In other Blizzard news, Ghostcrawler recently
posted two new blogs. Well, one is from the

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.390
18th of March but I still think it's a good
read if you haven't seen it yet. Instead of

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:36.069
dungeons, it's about raids this time. He also
made a really interesting blog post a few

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:41.000
days ago giving some true insight into the
development process and open the door for

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.700
future blog posts that will be semi-casual
with some off the wall topics and insight.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.400
Definitely a good read.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:57.110
Normally, I'd have a Q&amp;A here but didn't really
get any new questions this week from anyone.

00:03:57.110 --> 00:04:02.389
So... I'm going to show you a bit of Blizzard's
Q&amp;A with developers instead. They have two

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:07.209
Q/A sessions release recently filled with
tons of interesting questions and answers

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.709
that should have atleast something to peak
the interests of everyone. I suggest everyone

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:15.920
check them out and I'll link them on this
blog post along with all the other topics

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:28.120
I talked about.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.930
Ok, so now to find a YouTuber that I think
is awesome enough to tell all of you about.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.710
His YouTube channel is OMFGcata and his name
is Jesse. This guy can do some insanely good

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.229
voice acting as well as just be super entertaining.
So head over to his channel after this video,

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:48.980
subscribe, and watch his latest stuff. He's
just amazingly talented and funny.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:49.980
Finally, before I forget, here is a list of
my latest releases if you missed them. Please

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:50.980
check them out and don't forget to comment
and rate them so I know where I'm succeeding

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:51.980
and failing.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.980
That's it for this week of Tarou's Weekly

"Now go leave a comment below telling me your
thoughts!"

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.740
Personally, I wondering what is taking Patch
4.1 so long. We're behind schedule Blizzard..

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:15.729
behind schedule I tell ya.
