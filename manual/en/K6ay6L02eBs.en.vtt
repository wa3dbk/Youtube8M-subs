This camp is a YMCA camp, it’s one of 7 camps in Victoria. 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
It’s 45 minutes from Melbourne so it’s great for schools as it doesn’t take them long to get here. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Luckily we sit on 28 acres and we sit in this beautiful ampitheatre of gumtrees,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
so it’s a gorgeous natural setting that groups get to come and join. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What I love about this camp and what makes this special is the natural bush setting

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
and its proximity to Melbourne, because we really do sit right on the edge of Melbourne,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
yet when you come here you feel that you are away from it all.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So even school groups or groups that come that are only ten minutes from here 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
are always astounded that you drive down the driveway and then all of a sudden you are surrounded by trees

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
and it takes you away from where you were moments ago. 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
We have great staff, they’re really committed to providing the best programs.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
High adventure activities, groups love the giant swing and the high ropes and flying fox. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
But, equally at our camp we have ‘wildlife encounters’

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
which is an interactive session with one of our staff and the group where

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
the kids get to learn about different animals.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
We also have a hands-on with a couple of snakes and some lizards as well, so that’s always good fun for the groups. 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
We also do yabbying along our creek, which the kids have fun throwing a line in and looking for yabbies

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
and obviously it wouldn’t be camp if it didn’t have a camp fire,

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
so we always try and encourage the kids to have a camp fire, either throughout the day or at night

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
so that they can have some time around the fire. 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000
If you give yourself the opportunity to listen or to look out you may well see a wedgy or an eagle flying above.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Obviously with camp as well there is that connection with other campers

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000
and with other members of your group as well, so it’s about being part of the community.
