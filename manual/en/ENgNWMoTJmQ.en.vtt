00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:20.020
I don't even know what to say anymore.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:24.290
Like, what am I supposed to say?

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:25.870
Look at this.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:27.550
It's Shrek: Hassle at the Castle.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:34.360
This is getting to be f*cking ridiculous.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:37.960
You know what's crazy about this game?

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.640
It was actually released to good reviews.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.510
Like, really good reviews.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.940
And, for the life of me, I have no idea why.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:53.530
This is such a boring, weird, repetitive,
awful game...I seriously have no idea what

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:54.550
people were thinking.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.860
This game sucks, and if you ever have someone
tell you otherwise...seriously.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.130
Punch 'em in the face.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.890
Like, 27 times.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:01.950
The exact same way.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:04.629
And when they complain about it, say, "Hey!

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.080
Listen, what I just did was basically just
Shrek: Hassle at the Castle, in a nutshell.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.460
I thought you liked this game.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:16.080
I thought this was fun."

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.850
This thing was released in 2002, by TDK Mediactive.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.730
Which was, like...a modern day LJN, for a
while.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:24.990
Before they were acquired by Take-Two.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.810
And hey...if it cost 'em anything more than
a box of tampons, they got ripped off.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.770
Because every game TDK ever released, sucked.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:33.770
Period.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.170
But you know another crazy thing about this
game?

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.890
It was developed by Tose Software, the same
studio that does the Legendary Starfy games.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.640
Wha...what the hell happened here?

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.869
It's, like...The Legendary Barfy.

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:56.909
Anyway, the 
game basically follows along with the movie.

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:01.549
Except it apparently gives all the characters
performance-enhancing drugs, 'cause now they

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:02.549
have huge heads.

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.909
You walk through these straightforward, 2D
levels...and you punch enemies in the face.

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:10.499
And then more enemies come, and you punch
them in the face, too.

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:14.480
Between those punches, you have to do some
minor platforming, and of course, it causes

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.549
a major headache.

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:17.249
So here's the thing.

00:02:17.249 --> 00:02:20.370
Uh, the gameplay itself just...feels kind
of clunky.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.849
Like, there's a strange pause between you
pressing the button to attack...and the attack

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:25.909
actually happening.

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:30.340
It's like the attack animation lasts half
a second longer than it should, or something.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.749
As a result, it's pretty easy to lose health
in this game.

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.310
You get hit a lot, 'cause of the weird timing.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.260
Actually, not only that...but the cheap enemies.

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.879
They just swarm you, sometimes.

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:48.440
Especially on the escort missions.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:03:00.109
So, the movement feels a bit off in this game,
and that obviously makes platforming a little

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:01.109
tough.

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:03.510
But even in general, this is just a frustrating
game.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.040
It's way more difficult than it looks, and
not from anything like...clever level design,

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.200
or puzzles, or anything like that.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.200
There are none.

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.230
No, instead...it's just those simple, boring
mechanics.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.180
No real nuance.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.680
Just...punch.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:18.680
And collect coins.

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.049
Ten coins gives you another life.

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.049
Yeah, that's right.

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:22.049
Ten.

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.319
Which tells you something about how frustrating
it is.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.069
That you get an extra Shrek for ten freaking
coins.

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:28.540
Fortunately, the presentation's a bit better.

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:34.609
The game looks okay...of course, with the
obvious exception being those ridiculous heads.

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:36.129
Like...seriously?

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:39.309
Bobbleheads have better proportions, than
the sprites in this game.

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:42.832
But the environments are fine...the music
sucks, but that's to be expected.

00:03:42.832 --> 00:03:47.459
Still, the presentation's at least better
than the gameplay and level design.

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.859
Also, why is this goddamn game so hard?

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:59.500
You get to play as different characters in
certain levels, and there's a little minigame

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:03.459
for multiplayer play...but none of that alleviates
the boredom.

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:08.809
The gameplay feels weird; the difficulty is
just frustrating; and for the love of god,

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:11.450
who came up with the big heads?

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:16.079
And why?

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.280
Maybe it's a visual representation of your
headache, from...playing this.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.210
It's Shrek: Hassle at the Castle...a Game
Boy Advance game you probably won't want to

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.210
hassle with.

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.849
Thanks to our main man Dylan from Nashville,
Tennessee, for sending it in.
