00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.480
Space Jam!

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.460
Here we go.

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.280
Now, the-

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:06.680
He's a great jungler.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:08.980
Oh, hmm.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.460
Uh, he's really good at uh, dying.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.160
Ladies and gentlemen, here I am playing as Miz, the new character.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.860
Uh, you may recognize him from WWF.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:24.920
He has a shark move.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.280
Yeah, you're dead bud.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.380
[whispered] Oh, hi. Hi. Hi.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:33.380
You just got shark'd!

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.120
What'cha gonna do with that shark?

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:36.280
You're gonna die.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.040
It's like, uh...

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.760
Well, as you know, I'm the-

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.480
I'm the JAWS ride at Universal Park,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:47.900
in Orlando, New Vad- New Vegas... Las Vegas.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:49.960
Look at this bitch!

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.200
You just got shark'd.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.540
Teemo? Oh man...

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.120
I don't know.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.580
I don't know how I feel about this match-up.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:58.780
Teemo at full health...

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:00.460
I got like, 10 health...

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.020
I'm gonna say...

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.720
You know what?

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.920
I'm gonna say, let's do it.

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.700
I'm gonna say, I got this.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.040
Here we go.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.780
Hi!

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:13.080
Ooh.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.140
Not even close.

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.700
I ain't gonna do it.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:20.420
Okay.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.360
I'll just lead with the shark.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.800
Shark's in, Fizz goes in.

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.080
Bonk, you're dead.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:30.500
Teemo, you're done.

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.500
Oh, you're definitely dead Alistar.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:34.860
Oh, Irelia don't even...

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.980
Don't even...

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.280
You're dead too, ahaha.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.160
And that guy just got shark'd, eheh.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.600
Eh, uh.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.780
Hey! Get back!

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.580
Get back here you big- you-

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.860
What is he? A cow?

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:50.180
You big moo-moo.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:54.620
No, no, no, Teemo. No, no, no, no, no.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.680
Oh, no, no, no, no, Ashe. No, no, no, no.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.580
Oh, no, no, no, no.

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:03.300
No, no, no, Caitlyn.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.420
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:07.500
No, no, no, no.

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.100
[beginning to laugh] Oh, no, no, no, no, Irelia.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.520
No, no, no, no, no.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.680
What do you guys think? You think I should do it?

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.480
I think I should do it, I think I should do it.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:20.160
Here we go.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.720
Uh!

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.940
Oh! I just shark'd absolutely nothing!

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:26.480
Alright, and, Terminator 2.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.640
Here we go.

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:31.920
I got the cow on the run.

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:32.540
He's shark'd!

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.840
Ladies and Gentlemen, he's shark'd in, and the quarterback is toast!

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:38.220
Here we go.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:41.060
Oh, Ashe! What are you- Where are you going?

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.020
Where are you going? You can't go over here.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.500
Took a wrong turn at the bake sale, bitch.

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.720
Bum bum bum bum.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:51.660
Hey!

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.500
Teemo, baby...

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.840
Here we go.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:58.720
Ooh, he thought he had me but-

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.520
Shit a put fucking mushroom!

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.620
Alright.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:04.580
Hey, what're you doin' over there, Ashe?

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.720
Caitlyn? Ah, you just got shark'd!

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:08.780
Aw, that's the thing about you.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:10.740
Oh, look at this.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.800
This is t- This is too stupid for me to even be a part of, but I'm gonna be a part of it.

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.500
Now the thing about Miz that you should know...

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.640
Is that he likes to go in with no health.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.880
Look at this Brand.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:27.460
Oh, shit! Garen, you're done.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.320
Alright, they go the Baron Buff and we are down by kills.

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.860
I mean, it's not lookin' favourable.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:35.460
But I'm gonna get this guy.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:37.740
Jump over that Ult.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.240
Yep, there we go.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:42.400
Two more guys though.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.000
We gotta get them outta the picture.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:48.860
Alright, one final dude.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.780
You're going to go ahead and miss that, Riven.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:53.160
And then I'm gonna go and uh,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:54.800
knock your damn head off.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.920
Like a, uh, T-Bone steak, if you catch my drift.
