00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.550
We need to figure out the least
common multiple of 30 and 25.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.850
So let's get our little
scratch pad out here.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.160
And we care about 30
and we care about 25.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.820
And I'm going to do this
using the prime factorization

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.560
method which I just like more.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.080
Let's find the
prime factorization

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.160
of both of these numbers.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.470
So 30, it's divisible by 2.

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:25.520
It's 2 times 15.

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:28.160
15 is 3 times 5.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.770
And now we've expressed
30 as the product

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.030
of only prime numbers,
2 times 3 times 5.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.360
Now let's do the
same thing for 25.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.357
25 is-- well that's
just 5 times 5.

00:00:41.357 --> 00:00:42.440
So let me write that down.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.060
25 is equal to 5 times 5.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.000
Now to find the least
common multiple,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.870
let me write this down,
the least common multiple

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:00.320
of 30 and 25 is going to
have a number whose prime

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:03.510
factorization is a super
set of both of these

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.370
or has all of these numbers
in them as many times

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.734
as we have in any one of these.

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:10.150
So it's the least
common multiple.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.050
Well it has to be
divisible by 30.

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.360
So it's going to need a
2 times a 3 times a 5.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.220
This is what makes
it divisible by 30.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.740
But it needs to also
be divisible by 25.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.010
And in order to be
divisible by 25,

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.430
you need to have two 5s in
your prime factorization.

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.210
Right now our prime
factorization only has one 5.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.885
So let's throw.

00:01:34.885 --> 00:01:36.260
So we have one 5
right over here.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.110
We need another 5.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.670
So let's throw another
5 right over here.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:42.550
So now this thing
clearly has a 25 in it.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.110
It's clearly divisible by 25.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.040
And this is the least
common multiple.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.797
I could have, if we just
wanted a common multiple,

00:01:50.797 --> 00:01:52.380
we could have thrown
more factors here

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.000
and it would have definitely
been divisible by 30 or 25,

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.340
but this has the bare
minimum of prime factors

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.060
necessary to be
divisible by 30 and 25.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.210
If I got rid of
any one of these,

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.950
I wouldn't be divisible
by both anymore.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.170
If I got rid of this 2, I
wouldn't be divisible by 30

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:07.670
anymore.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.860
If I got rid of one of the 5s,
I wouldn't be divisible by 25

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.610
anymore.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.860
So let's just multiply it out.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.680
This is essentially
the prime factorization

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.540
of our least common multiple.

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.230
And this is equal to 2 times 3
is 6, 6 times 5 is 30, 30 times

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.810
5 is equal to 150.

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:31.630
And of course, we can
check our answer, 150.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.340
Check it, and we got it right.
