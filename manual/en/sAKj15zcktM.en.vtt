Hi. My name is Dave Andrews. And today, I'm
going to show you how to make Windows XP look

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:15.680
like Windows Vista. What we're going to use
to do this is a program called Alien GUI that

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:21.650
you can download from Alienware. If you just
search the internet for Alien GUI and Alienware,

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:31.179
you'll find this program. Let's run the installation.
If you receive a security warning, just press

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:39.969
"Run". Now, it's launching the theme installation
for our Alienware program. Select "I Agree"

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:48.600
and "Next". Click "Next", again. Basically,
just click "Next" through the entire setup

00:00:48.600 --> 00:01:13.480
process. It's now installing our new Alienware
theme.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:20.870
Once the installation is finished, simply
click on "Finish". Now on your desktop, you

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:31.780
see a picture of an alien and a program called
Alien GUI. Let's run that program.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:41.540
We have, here, several different themes that
we can use. Let's select "Invader". Say "Apply".

00:01:41.540 --> 00:02:10.860
It's asking if we'd like to apply the Invader
suite, and we'll say "Yes".

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.780
As you can see, our desktop has been dramatically
changed to look like something closer to Windows

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:24.140
Vista. There are many different themes that
you can use. It's that easy to change your

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:32.170
desktop look.
My name is Dave Andrews, and I just showed

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:34.359
you how to make Windows XP look like Vista.
