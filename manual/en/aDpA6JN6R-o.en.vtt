00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:06.700
Let's take a look at a basic Latin beat. This
Latin beat is not specific to any culture

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:14.380
of South America, but it's typically useful
in a broad spectrum of South American music.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:44.260
I'll play it. Let's look at a couple of these
elements. With the left hand we are alternating

00:00:44.260 --> 00:01:01.079
between a rim shot and two strokes on the
tom. Let's add to this the right hand, playing

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:30.180
on the bell of the cymbal, quarter notes.
Lastly, the foot in this rhythm.

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:42.200
This is on beat one and the beat two that
is bass drum is played. Let's put it all together.
