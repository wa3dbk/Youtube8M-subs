00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.720
a typical day for a maths teacher like me
is that I come in nice and early

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.800
have a think about 
what lessons are coming up

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.440
what assessments and big events are happening in
the calandar of my faculty as a headteacher and

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:17.240
and once I've got my head in the right space 
 I have a look at what are the urgent tasks that

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.020
identified the day before that I can
just get started on get straight into them

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.580
the day begins

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.560
I might have three or four or five
lessons and going between them because

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.500
all the planning has been done

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.720
I just really like to make 
sure that I bring energy to my classroom

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.820
I think thats the most valuable thing I can have

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.860
it all prepared I just like to kind of

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.820
let it unfurl and to let  all of those conversations

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.600
and surprising moments unfold in the classroom

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.220
[spoken in class]
Pringles they have a mathematical name

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.040
they are called saddles

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.180
right? just like a saddle

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.920
[students exclaim]

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.720
To study mathematics is really to be able to

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.640
get a hold of "whats reality made of"

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.000
like we walk along the ground and we don't

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.649
race off into the air cause gravity, these
mathematical laws are holding us to the ground

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:08.229
and when we understand the world around
us and you look at a flower and you look

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:12.670
at the number of petals that are there or
the shape of all of the little seeds on it

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:17.630
and all of thats mathematical so for me I
just get so much enjoyment

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.840
number one, from being able to talk about such a interesting thing all day

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.920
but I also love seeing 
when a student has a

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.880
really aha moment, when there's some insight
that they just couldn't wrap

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:33.869
their heads around and suddenly you know
we we talk question we go round and

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.630
round and round, we draw things and
suddenly it clicks and I can literally

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.910
see that moment and their 
eyes kind of widen a little bit

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.630
and they say "ah I get it I get it sir"

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.470
and that moment is priceless

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.960
and I get to see it every day and it's kind
of addictive for students to have that

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.080
experience and for me to have the privilege to help
them get that themselves i just training

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.960
I just wouldn't trade it for anything

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.630
teaching is a really really tiring job
because we're all on our feet but it's

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:09.759
so rewarding when you think back to what
did you just expand all your energy on

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.680
and you can talk about that moment you
have with a student where you got them

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.090
to see this really really

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.300
crucial insight or a student's work
that was just amazing and you had no

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.280
idea they were capable of that kind of
quality and you get to share those

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.240
stories and I think it's a really nice
way to cap off the day

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.840
and be able to go home and say

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:32.000
that's why I come to work each day
