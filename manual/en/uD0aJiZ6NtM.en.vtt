00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.000
So here's an apple signed by some guests and vendors

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Ticket validated successfully! Woohoo!

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.200
What are you doing?

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.300
I'm walking

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:18.400
I'm sticking with Jona

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.200
I'm looking at the Schedule

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.500
I'm being assaulted by a stranger

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.200
I'm gonna die

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Pony!

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.360
He's going to transform!

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.180
Pony!

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.540
At first I was scared

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.560
I thought I had won the painting on the first draw

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.100
She gave me the apron! I was so disapointed!

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.602
I sat down

00:03:22.602 --> 00:03:24.198
Then she said "497" and I thought...

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.140
Wait... That's mine again!

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:28.320
I had all of my tickets on the floor

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.760
That's why it took me so long!

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.260
The tickets were on the ground?

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.500
You know who picked them up afterwards? Volunteers!

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.856
And... You also bought stuff?

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:40.860
Yup!

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:43.460
Princess Banane

00:03:44.378 --> 00:03:45.498
And Rainbow Dash

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:55.840
Thanks to (See all of the above)
