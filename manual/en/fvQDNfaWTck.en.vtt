00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.159
"Enhanced Athletic Recovery Without Undermining Adaptation"

00:00:06.159 --> 00:00:10.387
Ultramarathon runners 
may generate 

00:00:10.387 --> 00:00:13.348
so many free radicals 
during a race

00:00:13.348 --> 00:00:16.071
that they can 
damage the DNA 

00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:18.305
of a significant percentage 
of their cells. 

00:00:18.305 --> 00:00:21.738
Now some have looked on the 
exercise-induced increase 

00:00:21.738 --> 00:00:24.204
in free radical production 
as a paradox.

00:00:24.204 --> 00:00:26.827
Why would an apparently 
healthy act, exercise, 

00:00:26.827 --> 00:00:28.829
lead to detrimental effects 
through damage 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:30.781
to various molecules 
and tissues? 

00:00:30.781 --> 00:00:33.414
This is somewhat of 
a misunderstanding 

00:00:33.414 --> 00:00:37.107
as exercise in and of itself is 
not necessarily the healthy act, 

00:00:37.107 --> 00:00:40.365
it's the recovery after 
exercise that's so healthy. 

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:44.962
The whole that-which-doesn't-kill-us-
makes-us-stronger notion. 

00:00:44.962 --> 00:00:48.760
For example, "Exercise training 
has been shown to enhance"

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.027
"antioxidant defenses, for example"

00:00:51.027 --> 00:00:54.031
by increasing the activities 
of antioxidant enzymes. 

00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:57.298
So yeah, during the 
race ultra-marathoners 

00:00:57.298 --> 00:00:58.898
may be taking hits 
to their DNA, 

00:00:58.898 --> 00:01:01.529
but check out 
a week later. 

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:03.551
Six days after 
the race, 

00:01:03.551 --> 00:01:06.555
they didn't just go back to the 
baseline level of DNA damage, 

00:01:06.555 --> 00:01:08.996
they had significantly less, 

00:01:08.996 --> 00:01:13.818
presumably because they had so revved 
up their antioxidant defenses.

00:01:13.818 --> 00:01:17.873
So maybe, exercise-induced oxidative 
damage is beneficial,

00:01:17.873 --> 00:01:19.464
kinda like 
vaccination. 

00:01:19.464 --> 00:01:21.464
By freaking out 
the body a little, 

00:01:21.464 --> 00:01:23.363
maybe you'll 
induce a response 

00:01:23.363 --> 00:01:26.097
that's favorable 
in the long run. 

00:01:26.097 --> 00:01:29.333
This concept that low levels 
of a damaging entity 

00:01:29.333 --> 00:01:31.833
can up-regulate 
protective mechanisms 

00:01:31.833 --> 00:01:33.599
is known as 
hormesis. 

00:01:33.599 --> 00:01:37.901
For example, herbicides 
kill plants. 

00:01:37.901 --> 00:01:41.060
But in tiny doses may 
actually boost plant growth, 

00:01:41.065 --> 00:01:43.100
presumably by 
stressing the plant 

00:01:43.107 --> 00:01:47.760
into rallying its resources 
to successfully fight back. 

00:01:47.764 --> 00:01:50.130
Wait a second, though.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.260
Could then eating anti-inflammatory, 
anti-oxidant rich plant foods

00:01:55.263 --> 00:01:58.100
undermine this 
adaptation response? 

00:01:58.108 --> 00:02:01.750
We saw that berries could reduce 
inflammatory muscle damage,

00:02:01.753 --> 00:02:05.550
and greens could reduce the 
free radical DNA damage.

00:02:05.551 --> 00:02:10.000
Dark chocolate and tomato juice 
may have similar effects.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.500
The flavonoid phytonutrients in 
fruits, vegetables, and beans 

00:02:14.506 --> 00:02:16.930
appear to inhibit the activity 
of xanthine oxidase, 

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:21.360
considered the main contributor of 
free radicals during exercise. 

00:02:21.363 --> 00:02:23.620
And the carbs 
in plant foods 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:25.730
may decrease stress 
hormone levels.

00:02:25.731 --> 00:02:30.230
So in 1999, a theoretical 
concern was raised. 

00:02:30.233 --> 00:02:33.960
Maybe all that free radical stress 
from exercise is a good thing, 

00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:37.160
and increased consumption of 
some antioxidant nutrients 

00:02:37.165 --> 00:02:41.630
might interfere with these 
necessary adaptive processes.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:44.960
So if you decrease the 
free radical tissue damage, 

00:02:44.964 --> 00:02:46.240
maybe you don't 
get that increase

00:02:46.242 --> 00:02:48.700
in activity of those 
antioxidant enzymes. 

00:02:48.703 --> 00:02:52.840
The cherry researchers 
responded, 

00:02:52.848 --> 00:02:56.240
look, although 
it's likely that 

00:02:56.247 --> 00:02:58.300
muscle damage, inflammation, 
and oxidative stress 

00:02:58.305 --> 00:03:00.660
are important factors in 
the adaptation process, 

00:03:00.663 --> 00:03:03.440
minimizing these factors
may improve recovery 

00:03:03.448 --> 00:03:06.300
so you can train more 
and perform better.

00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:09.100
So, there's kinda theories 
on both sides, 

00:03:09.103 --> 00:03:13.570
but what happens when you 
actually put it to the test? 

00:03:13.571 --> 00:03:15.790
What does the 
data show? 

00:03:15.793 --> 00:03:19.970
While antioxidant or 
anti-inflammatory supplements 

00:03:19.971 --> 00:03:22.830
may prevent these 
adaptive events, 

00:03:22.836 --> 00:03:25.240
researchers found 
that a berry extract—

00:03:25.243 --> 00:03:27.040
black currant 
in this study, 

00:03:27.048 --> 00:03:28.870
although packed 
with antioxidant 

00:03:28.871 --> 00:03:30.140
and anti-inflammatory 
properties 

00:03:30.146 --> 00:03:33.580
actually augmented, 
boosted the health effects

00:03:33.582 --> 00:03:35.490
of regular exercise 
even further. 
 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.870
But you take 
antioxidant pills

00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:40.140
—vitamin C and vitamin E 
supplements&nbsp;—

00:03:40.146 --> 00:03:42.250
and you can actually 
reduce the stress levels 

00:03:42.251 --> 00:03:43.440
induced by 
exercise, 

00:03:43.447 --> 00:03:47.150
but in doing so you 
can block that boost 

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:50.270
in antioxidant enzyme activity 
caused by exercise. 

00:03:50.276 --> 00:03:52.770
Now maybe you don't 
need that boost

00:03:52.773 --> 00:03:54.620
if you don't have 
as much damage, 

00:03:54.625 --> 00:03:57.730
but vitamin C supplements 
may impair

00:03:57.732 --> 00:03:59.430
physical performance 
in the first place. 

00:03:59.432 --> 00:04:01.750
Whereas with 
plant foods, 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.270
you appear to get the 
best of both worlds.

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:07.820
Check out this recent 
study on lemon verbena,

00:04:07.821 --> 00:04:10.140
an antioxidant-rich 
herbal tea. 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.960
Protects against 
oxidative damage, 

00:04:11.968 --> 00:04:15.540
decreases the signs of muscular 
damage and inflammation, 

00:04:15.547 --> 00:04:19.940
all without blocking the cellular 
adaptation to exercise. 

00:04:19.947 --> 00:04:21.420
They showed that 
lemon verbena 

00:04:21.426 --> 00:04:25.170
does not affect the increase 
of the antioxidant enzyme 

00:04:25.171 --> 00:04:27.340
response promoted 
by exercise. 

00:04:27.347 --> 00:04:30.750
On the contrary, glutathione 
reductase activity 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.060
was even higher in the 
lemon verbena group. 

00:04:33.068 --> 00:04:36.140
Here's the level of antioxidant 
enzyme activity 

00:04:36.147 --> 00:04:38.700
before and 
after 21 days 

00:04:38.703 --> 00:04:41.470
of intense running exercises 
in the control group. 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:44.190
With all that free radical 
damage that, that caused, 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:47.160
the body started cranking up 
it's antioxidant defenses. 

00:04:47.161 --> 00:04:49.220
But give a dark 
green leafy tea, 

00:04:49.222 --> 00:04:52.090
and not only do you put 
a kabosh on the damage 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.240
due to all the 
phytonutrients antioxidants, 

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:57.220
you still get the 
boost in defenses—

00:04:57.221 --> 00:05:04.160
in fact, in this case, 
even better.
