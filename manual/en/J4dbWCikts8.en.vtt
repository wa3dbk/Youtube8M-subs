Hey guys, Houstonproductions1 here again today,
and today is my 1000 subscriber special!

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:39.219
Um, as you can see, I have evolved over around
2 years, maybe more like 1 and a half, but...pretty

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:40.310
much 2.

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.460
Um, and it has been an awesome ride.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.870
I'm not saying I'm stopping, because I'm definitely
not.

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:49.250
This is my main, um, hobby.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:56.939
I love doing this, but thank you guys SO MUCH
for subscribing, um I now have at the exact

00:00:56.939 --> 00:01:03.900
moment I'm filming this, 1059 subscribers
and so it's growing pretty fast!

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.770
Pretty soon it'll 2000 and I'll have to make
another special, you know?

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:18.200
I was wondering if you liked that whole evolution
feel to the whole thing, it was sort of self-glorification

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.450
for my channel, but nevertheless I just wanted
to make that so show how you guys have influenced

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:25.479
my channel so well.

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.549
If I hadn't had this many subscribers, my
videos would still be AS BAD as they were

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.030
when I first started out.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.149
You guys have helped me so much, I've gotten
so much encouragement from people like thebrickboxchannel,

00:01:37.149 --> 00:02:13.160
who now goes by, Bricks of Awesome.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:06:56.940
Just great, great people.
