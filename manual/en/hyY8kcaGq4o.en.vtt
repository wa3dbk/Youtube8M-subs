00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:12.030
Our kitchen is busy place, so

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.250
it doesn't take much to turn it into a
big mess. To make some more space and keep

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.220
things organized, I'm going to

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.990
turn this small false drawer front into a tip out drawer where I can store lots of

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:23.990
little things that would normally be
cluttering up my counter top.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.150
Now, there are a few ways to turn this
drawer into a tip out,

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.190
but the easiest is with a kit like
this from Lowe's.

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:35.900
In the box, you get all the stuff you need, tip out hinges, baskets and all the hardware.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.680
Before you can begin, you need to
make sure that your false drawer is the right

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:41.159
type for this conversion.

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:44.930
You need enough clearance between the sink
basin and the drawer face for your

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.839
hinges to fit,

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:49.010
and you need an existing drawer hole
behind the false front.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.809
Start by tracing the hole on the back
the drawer face so you can see where you'll need

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:54.799
clearance for your drawer basket and
hinges.

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:57.850
Loosen the screws or if it uses staples
or clips

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.019
just tap the drawer face out gently with
a hammer to get it loose.

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.970
Start with the hinges. Attach them to the
cabinet using screws,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.119
then mark the positions of the holes on the
drawer front.

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:12.799
Attach the hinges to the drawer front,
then you can attach the screws for the

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:13.400
basket.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.870
Don't make it too tight you wanna be
able to remove the baskets for cleaning.

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:21.130
If you're worried about the sponges
staying wet in the baskets, you can

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.960
drill some small holes in the bottom to
increase airflow.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.160
Also since we left the screws looser, you can remove

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.920
the baskets regularly to wash them out. Now, you can attach the whole piece to the cabinet.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.920
And finish by adding the handle on the
front.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.630
And now you have a working tip out drawer to
store helpful kitchen items

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.860
that now have a new place to live and
your kitchen looks

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.790
nice and organized. And remember, you can
find lots more great projects like this

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:53.790
