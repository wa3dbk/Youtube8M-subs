00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.230
[narrator] This is the story of how successful
advertising works.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.509
This is Tommy.

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:07.709
Tommy works in a skyscraper.

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:11.410
Every morning, Tommy rides the elevator up
to the 18th floor.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.690
Emily rides the elevator too.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.070
She gets off on the 11th floor.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:17.970
Tommy is taken with Emily.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.040
But he can't figure out how to ask her out.

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.500
The elevator is always packed – and the
timing never seems quite right.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.000
But one day, everyone gets off the elevator
on the 7th floor.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.750
Tommy knows that he and Emily will be alone
for the next 4 floors, and he jumps on the

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.230
opportunity.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.340
Tommy asks Emily if she would like to meet
him for a cup of coffee in the cafe downstairs.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.850
She says YES!!…and they live happily ever
after.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.470
Now, let’s look at a different situation.

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:51.070
Tommy and Emily have never seen each other
before.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.570
It’s happy hour at the bar next to the skyscraper.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.500
Tommy walks up to Emily and asks her if she
would you like to go out.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.220
We can all agree that Tommy’s chances in
the first scenario are FAR HIGHER than they

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:04.670
are in the second.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.680
Why?

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.590
Because Emily is familiar with Tommy.

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.090
And Familiarity is the foundation of Trust.

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.709
She believes she knows certain things about
Tommy – and feels safer, and more confident

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:18.689
in her decision.

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.270
That is the story of Advertising.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.609
The elevator ride every day for months is
your opportunity to build a relationship with

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:26.609
your prospect.

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:33.000
This is called the Relational Phase – and
it’s where 95% of Consumers are 95% of the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.829
time for virtually every product and service
sold in the world.

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.670
Media that are ideal for engaging Consumers
in Relational Phase include TV and Radio – as

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.140
they are excellent at communicating the essence
of your business, AND are the natural places

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.039
people spend lots and lots of time, every
day, before they have a need for your products

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:55.789
and services.

00:01:55.789 --> 00:02:01.729
Then that one day, from floors 7 to 11, is
your time to seize the moment when your prospect

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:03.880
is in the Market for what you offer.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.009
This is called Transactional Phase – and
represents about 5% of your Target at any

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.170
time.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.750
Places people naturally go to find information
about the products or services they need when

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.000
they are in the market are ideal for Transactional
Phase.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.150
Google is an ideal example.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.000
Relational and Transactional Phase work together
to make Advertising work.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.769
This is the story of successful Advertising.
