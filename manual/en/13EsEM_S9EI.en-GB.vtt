00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:03.320
Will we ever be able to Teleport?

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.500
Every science fiction buff has wondered, will
we ever be able to teleport?

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:12.180
In films teleportation is normally portrayed
in the following way:

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:17.819
Alice steps into some sort of teleportation
pod. She is broken down into tiny fragments

00:00:17.819 --> 00:00:23.229
and those are sent across to final her destination
where her fragments are reassembled.

00:00:23.229 --> 00:00:27.869
We have not found a way to do this however
scientists have found an alternative called

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.509
quantum teleportation.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:35.239
A phenomena called quantum entanglement between
two particles connects them in such a way

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.980
that when the property or rather quantum state
of one particle is changed an instantaneous

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.949
and opposite change in the quantum state of
the other particle occurs.

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:51.579
So, if we have a set of entangled particles,
particle A and B, simply by knowing the quantum

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.809
state of one particle we can know the quantum
state of the other.

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.839
This ability to know the quantum state of
particles using quantum entanglement have

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:03.640
allowed scientists to teleport particles.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.089
Here’s how it works:

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.649
two particles are entangled and separated
by a large distance. A third particle, particle T,

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:16.950
is brought in and this is the particle
that we want to teleport. Particle T interacts

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.640
with particle A and we learn how the quantum
state of particle T relates to particle A,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.110
this information is then sent across to where
particle B is kept.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.719
As particle A and B are entangled, this information
about how the quantum state of particle T

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:38.490
relates to particle A will also reveal how
the quantum state of particle T relates to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.670
particle B.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.000
Particle B will then be manipulated to replicate
the quantum state of Particle T becoming an

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.420
exact copy of particle T.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.300
Meanwhile the original particle T is destroyed
as it’s information was extracted and sent across.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.620
So if we can do this for one particle and
humans are after all made up of nothing but

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.110
particles will we eventually be doing this
with humans?

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.540
Well a single human being contains a huge
amount of particles - the number would have

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.330
twenty eight zeros behind it - that would
mean an immense amount of data would need

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.500
to be transferred for human teleportation.
Transferring this amount of data using the

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.540
means we have today would take upwards of
a quadrillion years.

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:28.100
At the same it opens up a philosophical debate
of whether particle T is actually particle T

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.800
or a precise copy of Particle T.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.080
Imagine that human quantum teleportation became
a reality.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.840
Say Alice wants to travel from London to Tokyo.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.860
Two chambers of entangled particles would
be in each city.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.110
Alice would step into a scanning device and
the quantum state of each individual particle

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.650
would be measured in relation to the chamber
of particles in London.

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.600
This information would be relayed to Tokyo
and there the chamber of particles would be

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:56.820
manipulated to replicate the quantum state
of each of Alice’s individual particles

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:59.940
creating an exact replica of Alice.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.660
Meanwhile the original Alice in London has
been destroyed.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:09.480
The question is, as the original Alice dies
in the process of teleportation but is reconstructed

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.090
at her destination in Tokyo, is the final Alice
still Alice?

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.430
Tokyo Alice is identical to the last atom
as the London Alice and is in full possession

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:24.590
of London Alice’s knowledge, experience
and memories and Tokyo Alice even believes

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.690
she is the London Alice while the original
London Alice no longer exists to debate the

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:31.180
issue with her.

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.480
It’s a philosophical and ethical dilemma
but it may not be one we will need to face.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.630
As we have discussed human teleportation would
be extremely difficult and although theoretically

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:45.150
it is not impossible it is improbable.
