00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.830
Today we've got an exciting afternoon trip
that we're going to be taking.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.790
We're going to Wolfe Island, which is just
off of Kingston.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.300
We're going to be taking a ferry.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.520
The best part about it is that it is free.

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.220
We're just going to be having a really cool
time over there.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:19.920
We're planning on doing a lot of walking just
wandering around to get away from the city

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.180
for a little while.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.800
After spending the morning touring historic
downtown Kingston and Queen's University we

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:36.080
decided to take a free 20 minute ferry, boarding
the Wolfe Islander III, over to Wolfe Island.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:49.300
The ferry runs daily throughout the year starting
at 5:45 am with a final run at 2 AM.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.720
As the largest of the world-renowned Thousand
Islands, the 29 kilometer long Wolfe Island

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.600
is situated at the entrance of the Saint Lawrence
River in Lake Ontario.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:09.859
We're out here on Wolfe Island and it is a
Friday afternoon and the streets are pretty

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:10.859
empty.

00:01:10.859 --> 00:01:15.079
We've just been driving around the island
and pulling over whenever we see something

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:16.079
interesting.

00:01:16.079 --> 00:01:21.790
We just found some cows over here in a field
so we're photographing them.

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.990
Yeah.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.639
This is the kind of cute little island where
you'll enjoy the slower pace of life, farmland,

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:35.909
windmills, beaches and other recreational
activities.

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:47.439
We are here at the ferry terminal and this
must be the smallest border inspection area

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:49.469
I've ever seen.

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:55.069
For those with time to spare, you can cross
over to the United States via ferry from Wolfe

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:00.259
Island to Cape Vincent, New York with frequent
daily routes between May to October.

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:04.319
This is awesome.

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:15.920
I've never been so close to a windmill before.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.060
Other attractions on Wolfe Island include
a corn maze, bicycle routes, a golf course

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.480
and country roads.

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.470
What are you doing?

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:29.470
We stopped for a little ice cream break.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.940
I'm having black cherry and strawberry and
this is what you're having.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.490
And you've got it in your hand.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.780
It look gross.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.360
Are you going to eat it?

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.650
It looks gross.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.650
Yeah.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.650
Rude.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.440
With time to spare before we caught our Ferry
back to Kingston, we enjoyed eating ice cream,

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:58.590
tanning and walking out on the pier.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:10.760
Our time went by so quickly and before we
knew it we were boarding the ferry again.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.540
Along the way you'll spot wildlife, pass various
other boats and have a great view of the Royal

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:25.880
Military College of Canada campus.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.130
If you're visiting Kingston, Wolfe Island
is a perfect little day trip -- especially

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.910
during the summer months.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:35.140
We enjoyed a nice family outing and we hope
to back again soon.
