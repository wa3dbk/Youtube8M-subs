00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:05.020
For me, it's all about getting the shot that
no one else is willing to get.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:12.880
I'm always looking for the next big thing,
whether it be base jumping, whether it be

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.170
rolling down a mountain in a big, gigantic
ball.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.669
It's all about creating content that the world's
never seen before.

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:24.169
It's about putting people in a whole new world
that's different from their office or living

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.169
room.

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:33.030
I'm Devin Graham, and I'm a filmmaker.

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.570
I call myself a social media content creator.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:37.859
There's really no job description for what
I do for a living.

00:00:37.859 --> 00:00:42.460
I create content on YouTube with the hope
that millions of people will watch my videos.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.690
When I got into it, it wasn't about the views,
and it's still not about the views.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.110
It's always been about creating content that
I was passionate about.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:58.129
And I 
have a blast with what I do, and I feel if

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:09.380
I'm not passionate about it, my audience sees
that.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.689
In order to get noticed, I think to myself,
"How does everyone else shoot this, and what

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:16.210
can I make it unique and stand out on its
own."

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.520
One of the things that's unique to my videos
is movement.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.009
One of my favorite pieces of equipment that
I use is the GlideCam.

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.150
It allows me to get the camera right into
the action.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.270
It makes it so I can run right with the athlete,
makes it so I can jump with the athlete.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.740
I'm constantly running, I'm constantly exhausted,
but it puts the person right up there so they

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.299
feel like they are that kiteboarder, that
athlete.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.420
It's all about capturing how amazing life
is.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.220
I want everyone there to have a blast.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.359
The people I choose to be on set with me are
fun people because more than anything, it's

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:00.979
about doing what I love to do with people
that I love to be around.

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.820
We always say that we are living the dream,
and we kind of laugh at that because once

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.950
we reach one of those dreams, those dreams
just get bigger and bigger.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:14.030
As this has happened, I realize it's not about
the dream, it's about getting that whole process.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:19.330
It's that whole idea of pursuing your passion,
and that's what it comes down to - finding

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.800
something you absolutely love to do and making
it happen.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:26.330
My name is Devin Graham, and I absolutely
love what I do.
