This is a simple tutorial on making a display

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.899
area for false eyelashes so you can store
them easily.

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:28.250
It's simple and very space effective.
You will need cardboard, pretty paper, lace,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.279
tape, scissors, a glue gun and a clear plastic
sheet.

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:34.370
I reused the materials from one of these that
I made two years ago.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.940
Cut a piece of cardboard as big as you want
the finished result to be and a piece of nice

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.410
paper which is a few centimeters bigger than
the cardboard.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.899
Lay the paper good side down and the cardboard
on top.

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:50.469
Fold the edges of the paper over and tape
in place.

00:00:50.469 --> 00:01:01.679
Flipped over you've got this.
Place it inside the clear plastic sleeve.

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:07.960
You can use any kind of plastic but I just
used an old plastic office display sheet.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:14.560
Pull the sleeve tight and tape it in place
so the front is completely smooth.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.590
You should have something like this.
Next, cut a length of tape and place it sticky

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.810
side up across the right side of the board.
Repeat with 2 more pieces of tape.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.960
Make sure that they are all sticky side up.
This is what will hold the lashes on the board

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.680
so make sure you have enough tape for the
number of lashes you have.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.329
Now place a piece of tape along the edge of
the board sticky side down so it is on top

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:38.329
of the first three.
Repeat with another piece of tape on the other

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:46.130
side.
Lift the whole thing up.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.620
Fold the edges of the tape over to the back
and stick them down.

00:01:51.620 --> 00:02:00.700
Snip off any overhanging tape.
What you should have not is a board with 3

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.110
sticky tape strips to hold lashes.
Time to decorate.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.850
I'm going to use some cute lace.
using hot glue, fold the edge of the lace

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:14.350
over and stick it in place.
Glue it down to one side of the board.

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:24.290
Fold the corner into a point and continue
gluing the next side.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:47.200
Keep gluing all the way around.
There are lots of other things you could use

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:55.090
for decoration such as ribbon, stickers or
flowers.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:01.740
When you reach the end, cut off, cold the
edge over and glue in place.

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.050
Now transfer your eyelashes on and you're
all done.

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:12.100
Done!
See the lashes are held with the tape but

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:19.200
are able to be removed and restuck easily.
Just make sure not to use duct tape or something

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.270
super strong.
