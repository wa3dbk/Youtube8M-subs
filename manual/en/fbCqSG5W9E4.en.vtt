00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.640
Alright, today on this 2012 Chevrolet Silverado
3500HD, were going to install part number

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.930
RP50066-58.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.449
To make our install easier to see and perform,
what weve done so far is move the two back

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:15.449
wheels.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.580
Weve also lowered the spare tire and the spare
tire guard we removed as well, and we also

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.939
removed the exhaust.

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.230
Those are pieces you dont have to take down,
but it does make things a little easier to

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:25.230
do.

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.089
If you can do it, it makes it a lot easier
and you got a lot more room to work in.

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.980
To our first step for install, well get in
the bed of the truck and well add our first

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:40.640
rail and well measure it according to instructions.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.630
We found our length that we need to settle
at.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:51.870
Well put our rail there and then well make
sure its even from left to right.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.620
Once we have it in its correct spot, well
go ahead and mark and drill our holes.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.510
To mark our holes, well use a 1/2-inch drill
bit to find the center of our hole and then

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:14.960
we'll use a 1/8-inch drill bit to make our
pilot hole.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.420
Once that's accomplished, now we'll go ahead
and take our side brackets and hold them to

00:01:18.420 --> 00:02:10.000
the frame and align them with the pilot 
holes we made 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:35.480
to make 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:04:11.599
sure 
everything 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:27.420
is 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:05:52.220
in alignment.
