00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:14.850
My name is Mike Pelky, I've worked in construction
for 20 plus years. I've been here with LeBlanc

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.000
for 10 years, going on 11 and I'm a carpentry
rough framer.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:36.600
Full fall protection means anything like over
6 feet you need to be tied off, or working

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.000
on a ladder, or on scaffold.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Sometimes we use ropes, and then we use the PSFAs, or personal fall safety arrest systems.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.000
They are kind of like a yo-yo, that cable

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.600
that comes out. and it retracts and goes back
and forth.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
I was telling the guys earlier, we try to
do a lot of work on the ground because its

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.560
a lot easier than when you are up in the air.
Anytime you are up in the air it is harder work,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.920
on a ladder, scaffold, on the roof,
anything. It's always harder and more difficult

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.100
to navigate through things and do things.
So its better to do, like try to figure out

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.930
where your swing fall is going to be, build
your trusses on the ground, and then try to

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:35.259
get your anchor points on those, so when you
send them up in the air you have a good anchor

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:39.219
point already there and you're not fumbling
with it, with the ladder and trying to get

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:42.000
to it and figure out how to get to it.

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:50.060
Gearing up is not too bad, once you already

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.689
have the fall protection in place and the
anchors in place, its not to bad.

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.820
Getting to that point takes a couple of hours, and
then the harnessing is not that bad, I mean

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.090
to put on a harness only takes maybe 5 minutes
at the most, and then there is checking all

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.920
of your equipment, and making sure everything
is in good working condition. So it's not

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.550
really that much of a time, once you get into
a habit of doing it, it's not that bad.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.550
My experience is, it was rough, very rough
at the first time, very hard to get used to

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:29.990
and it's a little complicated to figure it
out. But we got through it, we figured out

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:36.990
easier ways how to do it, and we're doing
it, and it's working out.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.370
I fell a couple of times, when I was working
for another company. I broke 3 ribs, and that

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.000
wasn't fun, that was hard. Because I was out
of work for 4 months, with 3 broken ribs it

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.000
was, it was not a good thing. If I'd have
had fall protection, it would have never happened.

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.380
They have to wear it, but I, if you ask those
guys, I don't know how they feel about it

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.750
but I think they should wear it, especially
on tall roofs, when they're working 20 feet

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:20.750
plus above, I mean even 10 feet is a good
fall, so, they should be wearing it then.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:31.000
Go into it with an open mind and say look,
we can make this work, these guys are making it work

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.000
so, it works.
