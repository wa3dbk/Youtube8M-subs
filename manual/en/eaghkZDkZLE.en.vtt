00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:09.590
Let's look now at a demonstration of fixed
limit betting. All the cards are dealt. Got

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:18.289
two card starter hands, that's Texas Holdem.
Now this is demonstration of Two-Four Limit

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:29.310
Holdem. What that means is, that the initial
bet, the betting amounts for pre-flop and

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:38.390
the first betting round after the flop, the
betting amount is two, two chips, two dollars.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:45.379
Then on a turn and the river the betting amount
is four. Now in that scenario, in the two-four

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:52.970
scenario, the small blind is half of the big
blind. So the small blind is one, big blind

00:00:52.970 --> 00:01:00.659
is two. The person to the left of the dealer
is the forced action small blind and the person

00:01:00.659 --> 00:01:06.800
to the left of him is the big blind. The person
to left of the big blind acts first. Looks

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.270
at their cards, decides that they are going
to fold. This person looks at his cards, likes

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:26.680
his hand, and if he wants to raise, he can
raise one big blind. So he says raise, goes

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:36.000
up to four. Big blind is two, he got four
out there. This person can fold, call or raise

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:45.540
again. Being that he's on the button he decides
he is going to call, puts his four up. Now

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.930
the action goes to the small blind. Small
blind maybe doesnâ€™t like his hand, but it's

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.230
only three chips to call. He decides to call.
And the big blind, he's probably going to

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:04.530
stay in no matter what, because if you do
the math here, he's got one, two, three, four,

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:12.460
five, six, seven big blinds out there and
unless he looks at a seven deuce, he's probably

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.700
going to call because he is getting seven
to one on his money.
