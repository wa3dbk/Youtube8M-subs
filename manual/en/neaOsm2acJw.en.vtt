00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:51.600
The main purpose of this training days is to draw together the different members of the team.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:01:03.200
staff, medical, mechanic, coach and riders to create a team spirit with people who don’t know each other.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:09.600
This session is a rehearsal of the event one month before. Same places, hotel, track…

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.160
Gautier Paulin, MXGP rider, Romain Fevebre, Open rider

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:24.880
and Benoit Paturel, substitute MX2 rider, are taking part of this training sessions.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.020
Unfortunately, Marvin Musquin can’t be with us. He’s still in USA.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:44.840
All years long, riders are competing for an individual title and they are fighting each other.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:54.320
And now, they have this common challenge : to fight together.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.940
It’s time to share private moment, create and strengthen links.

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.980
This training session, reveals a real pleasure for riders to be together,

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.780
same age, same generation, 25 or 26 years old.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.960
They are so proud to wear the french jersey and represent France.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.100
Finally, it’s only competition

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:31.680
and it’s important to win and hear the “Marseillaise”.

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.740
I believe that’s really important for them to represent France at this time.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.340
We took part of playful activities like karting sessions.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.340
It wasn’t a race.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.300
The key words were “have fun” and

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.780
“who is capable of pushing someone off track”.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.620
It was fair play fighting with a good cohesion between us.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.760
After karting session, there were lot of discussion. Everybody was open minded and relax.

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.620
We have worked on starts as well.

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.100
We have to try different strategies.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.860
It’s important to know which riders will be first and second behind the grid.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.780
Performance isn’t the question.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:48.420
Gautier and Romain are leading the World GP classification.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.320
We put asunder performance.

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:57.260
The atmosphere was really positive

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:00.420
without group pressure.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:06.880
It’s very important. Normally it’s an individual sport.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:14.680
For MXoN, we have to be a strong team to defend the title and keep the cup.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.200
All sounds good with Romain.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.560
We have exchanged lot of things on and out track.

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.240
The Benoit presence was important.

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.400
We need a MX2 rider on track like a marker.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.320
Benoit is in Top 10 in GP for his first year. I respect that.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:38.120
He’s a funny guy and has created a good atmosphere inside the group.

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.080
I don’t know the best approach for this race.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.680
It will be first time for me. I’m taking this race like a GP.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.120
The MXoN’s atmosphere will be insane, in France

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.800
with the plates 1, 2 and 3. We are on top in GP and USA.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:07.960
This moment will be great.
