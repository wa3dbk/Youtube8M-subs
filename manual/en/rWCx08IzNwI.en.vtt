00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:09.940
The first European city I visited,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:15.940
It’s Vienna, a city of dream: Waltz, old historic cafes, and Mozart.

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:20.960
Today I’m making Viennese cookies, sables viennois. 

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:24.360
Those are simple, delicious and perfect for tea time. 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.110
For this recipe, you will need: 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:33.110
butter, confectioners’ sugar, vanilla, salt, an egg, and flour.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.110
First, with a whisk, work on ¾ cup of softened unsalted butter until smooth. 

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.780
Some people ask why my butter is yellow. 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.780
Well, I use Anchor butter from New Zealand which is made of free-range cow milk. 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.270
Then sift in confectioners’ sugar: ½ cup and 1 tablespoon. 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.120
And whisk until creamy and homogeneous. 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.950
And add in 1 egg white. 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.900
Make sure your egg is at room temperature. 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.900
Then add 2 teaspoons of pure vanilla extract and 1/8 teaspoon of salt.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Salt makes a huge difference, much better, when it comes to cookies.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.660
 And whisk until combined. 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.960
And sift in 1 ½ cups of all-purpose flour and fold until smooth. 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:25.400
It is a fancy cookie but it is an easy recipe which requires only a few ingredients. 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.700
It suits me perfectly. 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:37.790
Then transfer to a pastry bag fitted with a large star pastry tip. 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.790
Today I’m using Wilton 4B.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.560
And I will pipe the cookie on a Silpat. 

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:05.820
W is a typical shape for sables viennois. 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.410
And O shape will make a popular Korean cookie, ButterRing cookie. 

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:21.870
Now bake in the oven preheated to 360 degrees F. (180 C.) until the edges turn brown for about 10 to 12 minutes. 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:38.400
Voila!

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.570
Sables viennois, Viennese sable cookies.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:48.570
Now if you want to make impressive cookies, dip cookies in the melted chocolate and let them set.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.820
Bon appetit!

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.270
Hm.. I love Viennese sables so much. 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:12.030
This rich butter cookie is softely broken into very fine sands in the mouth. 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.000
It's light as air to the center. I just love it.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
