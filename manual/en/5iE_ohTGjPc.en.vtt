Hello everyone this is Breanna Rutter author
of one of my most popular books the natural

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.759
hair Bible and founder of howtoblackhair.com
for these videos I love to answer the questions

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:22.330
that you all send me via email so if you have
any questions that you will like for me to

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.220
answer check out the description box below
for more information this video is because

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.870
of an email I received from Latasha Latasha
goes on to say that she liked the straighten

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.140
her hair pretty often to where straight styles
but the problem is that with the styles that

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.140
she wear it often doesn't turn out so good
because it's constantly frizzy so she needs

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.640
some help to maintain a sleek look to her
hair so Latasha I have a couple of tips for

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.019
you to help you get your hair exactly how
you want it to so that way it is not frizzy

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.480
too much when you are wearing your styles
so my very first tip is that usually dry or

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:59.760
damaged hair will constantly become frizzy
when you straightening now the problem with

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.610
straightening your hair is that you are depleting
water from your hair so it usually if you're

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.180
going to be straightening you have to make
sure that you're properly moisturizing it

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.640
so before you straighten your hair it is proper
that you do a deep conditioning treatment

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.980
and then allow your hair to air dry blow dry
and then straighten if you do your best to

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.330
put in as much moisture as you can delete
to your hair it won't cause her hair to be

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.850
frizzy and straightening it now my next tip
is that if you are in a humid environment

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.190
your hair will soak up the moisture from the
air depending on the humidity levels in your

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:38.300
area when the humidity levels are high the
water vapors in the air of a higher count

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.680
which means your hairs are going to boards
absorb that now the air is pretty dry is going

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.700
to be the opposite your hair usually tends
to be on the dry side so in order for you

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.290
to maintain sleek hair when it's humid or
when it's dry is that when you are straightening

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.060
you have to use things or elements in your
products that is going to block out water

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.570
such as silicones and polymers you can go
ahead and research more information on this

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.770
on my website if you want to know more about
how to make sure that you're making her hair

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.220
resistant to absorbing the moisture in the
air so make sure that your one deep conditioning

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.569
before you straighten your hair and two using
products that has some type of silicones or

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:20.989
polymers in it to blackout moisture and then
my last tip is that is probably a good idea

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:27.079
if you opt for a straight type of weave so
you can do this by doing a partial sewin or

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:31.370
you can create your own u part wig so that
way you only straightening a small amount

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:35.370
of leave out the smaller amount of leave out
that you can control when straightening her

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.190
hair also limit the overall frizz that you
see so incorporate all of these elements if

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.989
you want to maintain straighter hair longer
period of time and also have sleek results

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:49.609
