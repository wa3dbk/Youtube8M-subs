Hi. This is Jessica Smith with Blands Nursery
in North Jordan, Utah. Today we're talking

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:11.440
about peonies. Either pronounced peony or
peony, depending on what part of the country

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:17.410
you're from. They are an old time favorite
in old fashioned gardens with huge blooms

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.190
in the springtime and then after they're done
blooming, it makes a nice little green shrub

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:28.360
in any type of a flower bed or a shrub bed.
There are two types of peonies. The herbaceous

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.830
types that die down to the ground each year
and then emerge with new leaves each year,

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:40.280
or the tree types. The tree types are a woody
type of a plant, more like a flowering shrub.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.040
Both of them produce those huge plants in
the spring. When planting peonies, make sure

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:50.420
you prepare the soil with some nice, organic
matter. Now peonies, if you're planting bare

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.910
root, you'll want to make sure that you plant
the herbaceous types at least two inches below

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:59.990
the soil level and the tree types at least
four inches below the soil level. If you plant

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:06.429
a peony too deep, it actually will not bloom
for you. And also if you're using a bare root

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:11.999
type or one that somebody's giving you off
one that they've just divided remember, it

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:17.110
may take some time for it to reestablish,
so it'll be a while before it blooms. Peonies

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:21.520
like a full, sunny location. One of the best
things that you can do for your peonies is

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.670
actually give them support. They're so top
heavy that those big blooms will actually

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:34.039
make them fall over. So put a peony cage around
them. Put it down around the plant early enough

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:40.700
in the spring so as the plant grows up, it'll
grow through it. If you try to put a big peony

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.840
around in here, you can actually damage a
lot of the foliage or the stalks itself. So

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:52.499
let the plant actually naturally grow around
the support. Also watch for blight on peonies.

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:56.749
It's probably one of the bigger problems that
they have. Clean up your dead blooms. That

00:01:56.749 --> 00:02:01.889
can invite the fungal problems and and iron
problem. Sometimes they need some chelated

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:08.030
iron put down on them. For the most part,
they're relatively pest free. A few ants around

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.150
is actually beneficial. The ants get on the
buds and feed off of the little secretion

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.471
that comes out of the bud and actually will
help it bloom. So unless the ants are in a

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:22.840
huge mass, let them be around the peony. They
actually need them.
