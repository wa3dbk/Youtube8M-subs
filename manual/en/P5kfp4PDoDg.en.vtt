00:00:00.348 --> 00:00:03.598
(bright calming music)

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.330
- Hi, I'm Natasha from
natashaskitchen.com,

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:10.100
and today I'm gonna show you how to make

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.550
the Russian version of crepes.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.010
There's just something
so special about crepes.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.350
Did you know there are
entire restaurants devoted

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:19.270
just to making crepes?

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.360
And crepes are probably
one of the fanciest

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:22.380
breakfast you'll have.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.340
And after watching this video,

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.270
I think you'll see that crepes
aren't any more complicated

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.750
than making waffles.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.583
Just think of them as
really skinny pancakes.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:35.340
So let's talk about the ingredients.

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.470
We're gonna start off with
half a cup of lukewarm water,

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.250
one cup of milk, four large eggs,

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.510
four tablespoons of
unsalted butter, melted,

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.610
one cup of all purpose flour,

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.493
two tablespoons of sugar
and a pinch of salt.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.203
For the filling,

00:00:51.203 --> 00:00:53.770
we'll need an eight ounce
package of cream cheese,

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.230
room temperature preferred,

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.550
a 16 ounce tub of cottage cheese,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.550
a third cup of sugar and 3/4
cups of raisins or craisins.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.060
What I love about this recipe

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:06.000
is you just put everything into a blender

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.960
and give it a whirl until it's well mixed.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:08.793
It's easy.

00:01:08.793 --> 00:01:09.973
I love easy.

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:13.410
Add everything in this order:

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.243
the water,

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:17.763
the milk and butter,

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.883
your four eggs,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.293
one cup of flour,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.133
your sugar,

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.653
and just a pinch of salt.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.740
Put the lid on

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.023
and mix it just until
it's all evenly blended.

00:01:41.371 --> 00:01:44.704
(blender running noise)

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.243
And it's done.

00:01:49.243 --> 00:01:52.390
These are the tools I use to
make the crepes process easier.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.370
I start with a really thin edged spatula,

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:58.210
and this really helps me get
under crepes to flip them,

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:59.790
then a small ladle.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:01.320
And if you don't have a small ladle,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.410
go ahead and use an ice cream scoop.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:06.020
And finally, you need a
really good non-stick skillet.

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.620
I use the Circulon brand.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.750
And make sure that the bottom
is not scraped or scratched,

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.850
otherwise, your crepes
will stick to the pan.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:16.690
Heat your non-stick
skillet over medium heat

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.880
and add just a small dab of butter.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.130
Let that melt and just
swirl it around the bottom

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:22.660
to coat it.

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:26.600
Then we're gonna ladle your
batter into the skillet.

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.810
And as soon as you do that,

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.350
make sure that you swirl
the pan right away.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.140
Once you can easily get under the edge,

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:33.593
go ahead and flip it over.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.860
And just saute for
another 30 seconds or so.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.100
You can tell when it's done

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.520
because it has a really nice golden top.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.800
Transfer it to a cutting board to cool.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.690
And don't stack them on top of each other

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.370
while they're hot, let them
cool down a little bit.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:49.203
Oh, my God!

00:02:49.203 --> 00:02:51.750
I can see myself in the
reflection of the lens

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.920
and this is really freaky. (laughs)

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.800
Okay. (laughs)

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:58.680
Oh, my goodness.

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:59.670
I had to eat it.

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.380
I have to eat one before they're done.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.720
They're so good.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.040
That's what's great about things.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.770
This makes about 15 really
soft and perfect crepes.

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:10.030
You're gonna love these.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:13.420
Rinse your cottage cheese
in a fine mesh colander.

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:17.253
And just continue rinsing it
until the water runs clear.

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.210
Once it's done, drain the water well.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.010
You'll see individual
curds of cottage cheese.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.410
Go ahead and transfer this
to a flat bottom bowl.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.360
Next, you're gonna add an eight
ounce block of cream cheese

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.823
and 1/3 cup of sugar.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:37.863
Mash everything together.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.340
Once it's pretty well
mashed together, it's done.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.870
It's not gonna be smooth.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:47.530
As you can see, it's still pretty lumpy

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:48.930
but that's okay.

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.370
Our crepes are ready.

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.100
The cheese filling is done.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:53.543
Let's finish this up.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.230
You're gonna start by putting
a generous amount of cheese

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.500
right in the center and just
spread it out to the edges.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.060
Then top with about 10, 15,
as many as you want, really.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.960
I'm using craisins but
you can also use raisins.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:10.040
I've also used chunks of pineapple,

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:11.300
which was really good.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.840
And just start rolling from the edge.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:16.810
I like to cut them in
half, you don't have to,

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:18.200
but I do.

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:20.700
And then just transfer
them to a Pyrex dish.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.680
Alright just finish these up.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.900
This means crepes for breakfast
for the next few days.

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.560
Yum.
I can't wait.

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.900
Just cover them with plastic
and put them in the fridge.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.250
What we like to do is we saute it up

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.210
in a little bit of butter

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.400
just 'til it's a nice
golden brown on the outside.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.110
And then top it with whatever you like.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.440
You can put fresh fruit or bread,

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:41.950
put some berry sauce.

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:43.650
I love it with sour cream.

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:45.760
Really anything you can think of.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.021
I know you'll love this recipe.

00:04:48.021 --> 00:04:51.271
(bright calming music)
