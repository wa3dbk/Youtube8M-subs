00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:20.400
Yeah, I'd never heard of Astal either.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.369
It kinda fell into that memory hole of early
Saturn releases, back when CD media was just

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.689
getting its legs under it and there were as
many wide misses as genuine hits.

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.510
But, as Jeanie from PA assured me, this one
falls into that "genuine hits" category.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.980
That is, if you don't mind the weird, bug-eyed
wannabe-proto-Sting visual style, or the fact

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.719
that the vocal performance leaves Japanese
interjections in the gameplay action but dubs

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.239
all the other audio into English, using a
voice actress who makes our weird little hero

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:57.120
with the egregious haircut there sound EXACTLY
like U-1 from Gitaroo-Man (and, by extension,

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.260
Musashi from said Samurai Legend).

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.090
And that's a thing that usually stops me cold
in my tracks.

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.990
I blame Jeanie.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.890
So after going through the world's creation
myth in the opening video (a kindness not

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.390
commonly offered to we gamers), we understand
that bad haircut there is trying to save his

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:19.390
sister.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.330
Unfortunately, the path to said sister is
laden with platforming and evil things that

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.720
happen to be formed from crystals: crystal
goblins, crystal birds, crystal pig-bear-lookin'

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.180
things... and all you have are your bare,
grotesquely-oversized hands.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.810
These are perfect for either picking up and
throwing mobs (potentially knocking out other

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.509
foes coming up on your six), or doing an axe-handle
from the air.

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.670
Either way, the emphasis is less on speed
and more on "how to do the most damage with

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:47.909
a single attack."

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:52.490
Or, of course, you could just uproot a big
freakin' tree and drop it on 'em.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.540
After the halfway point of the first stage,
you're assisted further by a bird, who can

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:02.210
deliver a diving attack, fetch weird eggplant-looking
foodstuffs for restorative purposes, or provide

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.740
context-sensitive support like clearing out
a swarm of bats or taking care of a certain

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.400
boss' backup winged eyeballs.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:13.640
These abilities expend energy from the bar
down at the bottom of the screen, which charges

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.780
by one segment every time you defeat an enemy
with that weird greenish glowing aura about

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.319
it.

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:27.980
There's a fairly steep learning curve when
approaching the game, as the difficulty and

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:32.150
timing can be tough to get down, and there
are plenty of strange wrinkles to the gameplay,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:33.900
like this sea-creature-ride of peril.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.750
The most frustrating part is the physics,
where the momentum of dashing jump can be

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.400
almost completely halted in midair simply
by attacking.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.050
It's a good thing your little bird friend
there can bring you those eggplants, else

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.870
you'd be in dire pain from one side of the
level to the other.

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.181
But for its rather strange mechanics, Astal
sounds quite good (in both languages), the

00:02:55.181 --> 00:03:00.020
sprite art is very lush, as are the backgrounds,
and... well, the mechanics kinda grow on ya,

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:03.080
if you're masochistic enough to really try
to figure them out.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:07.670
As an in-house Sega development, and one of
the earliest Saturn releases, Astal wanted

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.450
to push this brand-new hardware, and... well,
to those who could dig the rather strange

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.430
style, it presented a pretty sound argument.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.760
Problem was, there just weren't that many
such gamers in '95.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.360
Shame, really.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.819
This could've been the game I go to whenever
I hear that rather distinctive, kinda whiny

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:26.160
voice, instead of Gitaroo-Man.
