00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.210
You or someone you know may have an ongoing
pulmonary, or lung, disease.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.880
This video will show you how a pulmonary rehabilitation
program can help you live better with lung

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:25.990
disease.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:31.700
Before you start your program, your healthcare
team will learn about your health history.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:36.160
For example, you may have had problems with
your heart or blood vessels.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.310
Then, they will test how well your lungs are
working.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.920
Breathing tests will measure how well you
can breathe in and out, or how much air your

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.750
lungs can hold.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.800
A six-minute walk test may be performed.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:01.590
Your heartbeat, blood pressure, and blood
oxygen level may be monitored.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.049
Your healthcare team will use your health
history and test results to custom design

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.530
your program.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:15.820
Your program may include three main parts:
exercise, education, and counseling.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:23.789
Over time exercise can make your lungs and
heart work better.

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.979
It may also increase the amount of time you
can perform your daily activities, such as

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.499
work, shopping, and exercise.

00:01:32.499 --> 00:01:38.090
If appropriate for you, your program will
include aerobic exercise.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:42.929
This type of exercise makes you breathe harder
and your heart beat faster.

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:49.539
In addition, strength training exercises can
make your muscles stronger and stretching

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.520
exercises can improve your flexibility.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.229
Education could include classes that will
help you understand, manage, and cope with

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.729
your lung disease.

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:06.649
These classes will explain how the lungs normally
work.

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:11.200
They will also explain how diseases, such
as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.380
or COPD, affect your lungs.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.319
You can learn two ways to manage your breathing.

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.900
In pursed lip breathing you slowly inhale
through your nose and exhale through your

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.770
mouth with pursed lips.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:36.989
In belly breathing you train the diaphragm
muscle to do most of the work of breathing.

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:43.659
Your healthcare team will talk to you about
your medication and lifestyle changes.

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:48.200
You will be shown how to use oxygen if you
are receiving this therapy.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.079
Talk to your doctor if you have questions
about your medication or have any side effects.

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:59.629
It is important to take your medications as
directed by your doctor.

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.819
If you smoke, lifestyle changes will help
you plan to quit.

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:14.629
A diet expert will help you make an eating
plan if you need to gain or lose weight.

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:20.890
You will also learn ways to prevent respiratory
infection, like certain types of pneumonia

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.400
or the flu by getting vaccinated.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:30.310
The healthcare team may work with you to help
make a plan to help save your energy.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.900
This can help you get more done while avoiding
too much activity.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.560
Your program may also include counseling.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:49.629
This will help you cope with worry or depression
you may have about your lung health.

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:57.469
After a few months on the program you may
be given additional exercises and lung tests.

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:02.299
These tests will help your healthcare team
know if you are reaching the program goals.

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:11.439
These goals may include increased tolerance
for daily activity, less disease symptoms,

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.170
and self-management and coping skills.
