00:00:00.989 --> 00:00:04.910
In this video I'm doing body weight only chest
flies, using two round

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:13.139
dumbbells, and this exercise is working mostly
your chest muscles.

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.440
This is
how you get set up to do this exercise correctly.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.890
First you need two round
dumbbells.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:22.420
Then you get into a push up position, like
this.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.680
Then you roll
out slowly, under control, until your chest

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.980
touches the floor.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.289
Then you
come back up to your starting position.

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.730
The main thing you want to do is
roll out under control, real slow.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.020
You want to come down slow for two
reasons.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.020
Number one is so you don't go down so fast
and out of control that

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.450
you hurt yourself.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.720
Number two is the slower you go down equals
the better

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:52.620
chest workout you'll get, leading to a better
looking chest.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.190
Whatever dumbbells you use, you may have to
loosen up the ends of the

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.890
dumbbells to make them roll on the floor as
you do this chest workout.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:06.740
If
this exercise is too hard for you, you can

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.039
do this exercise the same way
but you do it with your knees on the floor,

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:14.320
so you don't have to use all of
your body weight to make this easier.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.990
You can also do this exercise by
coming down on top of some boxes, like I'm

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.340
doing here.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.929
And as the exercise
gets easier you use lower and lower boxes

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.870
until you can make it all the way
down to the floor.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.241
If this exercise gets too easy for you then
you can

00:01:31.241 --> 00:01:34.640
start using the weight vest or you can wear
a book bag filled with weights.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:41.520
Or you can have a friend place a weight on
your chest.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.439
If you don't have two dumbbells you'll need
two dishrags or two old shirts

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:52.409
and a slick floor, and do the same exercise,
just like I'm doing here.

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.700
You
want to start off doing sets of 5 reps, working

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.049
your way up to sets of 8 to
12 reps to really build a good looking chest

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:00.079
with this exercise.
