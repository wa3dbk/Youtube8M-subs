00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:24.700
Broken windows and empty hallways,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:32.600
a pale lit moon in a sky streaked with grey.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:42.500
Human kindness is overflowing,

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:53.000
and I think it's gonna rain today

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:06.800
Scarecrows dressed in the latest styles,

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:15.700
the frozen smiles to chase love away

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.500
Human kindness is overflowing,

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:37.000
and I think it's gonna rain today

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:56.500
Lonely, lonely

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.600
Tin can at my feet,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:10.700
I think I'll kick it down the street

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:15.100
That's the way to treat a friend

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:30.900
Right before me the signs implore me:

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:38.300
Help the needy and show them the way

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:48.300
Human kindness is overflowing,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.600
and I think it's gonna rain today

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:12.000
Today
