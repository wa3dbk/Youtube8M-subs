00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.629
Ok, I'm going to start a new series of videos
here.

00:00:07.629 --> 00:00:12.360
And basically what I'm going to be doing,
is I'm going to be mounting my Auto Meter

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:18.369
gauges to the backside of my factory gauge
bezel for my 77 C10.

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.660
Now this is a brand new gauge bezel that I
bought.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.000
I had to buy a new one.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.270
My last one, like I said, my truck is a 77,
the previous owner put one in from an 81-87.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.570
So it wasn't the right one anyway.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.430
And it was junk as well.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.820
So, had to buy a new one.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.720
This is just the hundred dollar one.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:39.720
Nothing fancy.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:46.030
Just got some silver on some of the writing.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:51.290
Other than that, it's just the basic black
plastic gauge bezel.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:56.560
But, I am going with the quality Auto Meter
Gauges.

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:03.690
And basically what I'm going to do, is I'm
going to mount them behind there just like

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.690
this.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.630
Now these are the 2 and 5/8" gauges.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.110
So they're a little bit big.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.090
If you wanted to you could probably use the
2 and a 1/16" gauges.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.880
I think I've measured.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.460
I know I've measured out this diameter to
be about 1 and 3/4".

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:22.450
So the 2 and 1/16" could work just fine.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.210
Then I'm going to have a 5 inch speedometer
and tachometer in here.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:36.219
Now a lot of people, from what I've seen,
they'll make like an aluminum cover that may

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:40.789
not go all the way over to here, but certainly
goes from here over to the end.

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:46.039
Then they cut out the plastic behind there
and they take their gauges and drop them in

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.959
from the front like this.

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:55.380
And that's not all that bad, except the problem
is the gauges, they need to point up.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.859
So when you're sitting in the truck, they
need to point up kind of at your face.

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:05.450
And when you mount this flat, the gauges are
now kinda pointing at your stomach, like that.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.289
When they need to be like that.

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:13.240
So, I'm going to put this together myself.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:16.530
I do believe in giving credit where credit
is due.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.610
You know, a lot of this is going to be my
design, but I basically, I saw this online

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.980
on a message board.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.730
Or like the homepage of a message board.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.390
And I believe it was 73-87.com.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:41.010
I don't know who, I'm not a member of that
board, I don't know who posted those pictures,

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.010
but that's where I saw it.

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.239
So I'll at least give credit to that person.

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.150
I'm not sure if he is the first one to ever
do this.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.129
I kind of doubt it.

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:54.061
But, like I said, give credit where credit
is due.

00:02:54.061 --> 00:03:00.439
So, I'm going to show you how I'm going to
mount the gauges behind this factory gauge

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:00.869
bezel.
