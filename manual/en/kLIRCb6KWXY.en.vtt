00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:03.760
No, no! I'm NOT nervous. I mean I know I should be nervous,

00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:06.799
but I'm confident, you know, like
it's umm,

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:10.559
it's my time! You know, Mom? It's gonna be good! I'm ready, Mom!

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.639
What? No, don't put Dad on!

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.320
Hi Dad

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.100
Yeah, no... how's your apnea? Oh, it's that swollen, huh?

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:29.100
(THEME MUSIC)

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.760
My ass is numb!

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.670
Yeah, why'd we have to get here so early?

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.750
Because we love Liz.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:40.890
Thank you, Soph.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.869
Yeah, and look, guys, we got the best seats in the house!

00:00:43.869 --> 00:00:46.649
Yeah, that's because cool people never show up on time.

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.029
I'm always on time!

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:53.140
Guys, would you want your friends to be
late to your show? Or movie? Or concert?

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.960
That's right, we're here for Liz. Not for ourselves.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.760
Great endorsement for her show!

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.520
You know what I mean.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.340
But I already ate all my snacks!

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.620
You had a huge bag!

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:04.740
It's gone.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.759
Just relax, okay? Liz is
the first one up.

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.979
When she's done, we can bail. And I'll buy you all a beer after the show.

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.599
Oh! No, Nathan can't have beer, remember? He gets violent.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.200
No I don't!

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:18.660
OW!!!

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.220
Would you two knock it off?! I'd rather not get kicked out before the show starts...

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.020
for a third time this week!

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:31.300
Yeah, that was me, alright? I feel your eyes. Keep to your business.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.980
ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, your host for the evening, Joe Bereta!

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.160
Hey guys, thanks for coming out tonight.

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.100
Give yourselves a round of applause, 'cause really, we're here for you.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.719
Now stop! That's a complete lie, we're here for us. We all have 'Father Issues'.

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:50.310
Anyways, I just had a son. Thank you.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:56.070
He's very adorable and the whole experience so far has been... shitty.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.460
Yeah.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.320
That's an inappropriate poop joke about my son. Like I said, I didn't have a father.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.170
When you have a kid this day in age, it comes with a whole slew of problems that

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.840
our parents never had to deal with. I feel that raising children is very relative

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.069
to the time that you were raising your
children. So, for example

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.239
when I was a adorable, charming, sexy
little baby,

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.459
my parents didn't have to worry about much. Y'know, they made sure that I was alive,

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.700
because the first three years of having a child is literally just called,

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.980
"Keep the Thing Alive Game".

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:29.030
I am terrified of when my daughter
and my son

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.819
grow into students at a high school, or a jr. high, or even earlier these days, because they have

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.900
cell phones, and Facebook, we have all
this technology

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.549
that keeps these kids constantly connected and it's frightening, because the new,

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:45.309
"Don't you dare have sex" talk has turned
into,

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.859
"Don't you dare take a picture of your dick."

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:54.049
Don't you dare, because that is out there forever. Everything I did in the past is forgotten

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.480
unless I say it on this stage. And all you people are recording this performance

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.579
and putting it next to pictures of your dicks and that makes me uncomfortable.

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:07.159
Thank you! Let's keep the laughter rolling for our first standup comedian of the night.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.840
She's a bright shining star in the form of a 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:15.140
candy-coated lady from Central Florida. Everybody give it up for Liz Morrissey!

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.420
Sorry, sorry.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:22.540
(FEEDBACK)

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.480
Sorry, so sorry.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.240
Careful, it's expensive.

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:27.460
Can I use this?

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.480
I don't know, can you?

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:41.579
(FEEDBACK)

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.330
So, how's every---

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.190
(BELCH!)

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:57.480
So sorry, I didn't mean to do that.

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:04.120
Curry... was a bad choice. Gah, that burns.

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.000
DAVE: C'mon Liz, you can do it! Woo!

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:32.900
So, uhhh... what a great looking' grope!

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.880
-- group!

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:41.940
...and... so uh, hi, sir...

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.380
That is a bright shirt! Where'd you get that?

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.180
The Bright Shirt... Store?

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:49.980
Or something?

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.280
No, really, it is like distractingly bright.

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.560
Can you move down? You are right in my line of vision. I can't remember anything.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:05.500
If you could just move down a couple... you, on the end, could you just switch with him? No you're not going to...

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:11.080
Maybe, do you have like a sweater you could put over it? Like a shawl? Could somebody pass him one?

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:13.440
(CLEARS THROAT)

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:16.460
(CELL PHONE RINGING)

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.680
Oh, great, guys.

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.711
I'll wait. Live show, no big deal, don't worry about it.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.700
Uhh... silence your pagers and pacemakers...

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.720
Oh! That is me. I'm so sorry. God, there is so much boob sweat on that.

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:39.020
That's my dad. My dad has, uhh...

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.410
Okay, oops, I took a picture.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:48.800
Okay! (CLEARS THROAT) Okay, I'm ready. I'm so sorry. It's my first...

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:55.220
Hey, don't ya hate it when spaghetti --

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:58.640
Wait, is that the light? No, I haven't started -- I didn't get to do my thing --

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:02.160
That's Liz everybody! Give it up for her! That's her time.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:05.540
Better luck next time, kid.

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.240
Speaking of shitty, I just had a son.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.320
(BIG LAUGHS)

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.960
That was like watching a train wreck...

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.180
except the conductors are baby seals and the train crashes into an orphanage. Nobody should have to watch that!
