00:00:00.817 --> 00:00:02.178
I'll tell you a story.

00:00:04.098 --> 00:00:06.521
You know the one about the mother lion and her little cub?

00:00:07.171 --> 00:00:08.368
They lived in the woods.

00:00:08.368 --> 00:00:09.344
The Kingswood.

00:00:09.807 --> 00:00:14.704
Yes, my love. In the Kingswood there lived a mother and her cub.

00:00:15.657 --> 00:00:16.994
She loved him very much.

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:22.257
But there were other things that lived in the woods. Evil things.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:23.259
Like what?

00:00:25.469 --> 00:00:27.688
Like stags.

00:00:28.838 --> 00:00:31.340
Stags aren't evil. They only eat grass.

00:00:32.912 --> 00:00:33.406
And wolves.

00:00:33.926 --> 00:00:35.184
My Lord!

00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:39.273
He could hear them howling in the night. The little cub was frightened.

00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:44.645
His mother said, "You are a lion, my son. You mustn't be afraid..."

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.788
For one day all the beasts will bow to you.

00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:02.673
You will be king.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.652
All the stags will bow, all the wolves will bow.

00:01:07.994 --> 00:01:11.799
The bears in the North and the foxes of the South.

00:01:13.889 --> 00:01:16.652
All the birds in the sky and the beasts in the sea...

00:01:17.338 --> 00:01:24.591
...they will all come to you little lion, to rest a crown upon your head."

00:01:30.974 --> 00:01:35.420
And the cub said, "Will I be strong and fierce like my father?"

00:01:36.853 --> 00:01:42.815
"Yes," said his mother, "you will be strong and fierce just like your father."

00:02:00.114 --> 00:02:02.580
I will keep you safe...

00:02:03.434 --> 00:02:08.053
...my love. I promise you.

00:02:15.622 --> 00:02:17.650
Back to the boats!

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:21.586
Stand and fight!

00:02:23.156 --> 00:02:25.871
Stand and fight, damn you!

00:02:31.174 --> 00:02:32.343
Father.

00:02:37.746 --> 00:02:39.361
The battle is over.

00:02:39.693 --> 00:02:41.644
We have won!
