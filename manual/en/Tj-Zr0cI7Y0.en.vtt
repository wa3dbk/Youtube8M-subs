she needed more than fifteen people to

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.260
out of the water she sought about 30

he added died of natural causes

75 feet through the water apparently or

in sightings are the creatures are rare

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.780
and they're largely unstudied so they

in out early they gonna bury it in some
sand and wait for it to decompose so

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.329
they can reconstitute itself

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.880
bone structure but there you have it
folks

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.250
