00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000 position:97%
So. Who wants to tell us what answer you want to explain, and tell us how you did it! Your strategy.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Okay. Why don’t you start?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Um, one?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And how did you get it?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000 position:97%
Um, I put 26 on the top, and 4 on the bottom, then I timesed it. And then I timesed 6 times 4 equals 24,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000 position:58%
Okay, and what’d you do with that 24.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000 position:97%
I put the 4 on the bottom of the 4, and the 2 on top of the 2, and 2 times 4 equals 8, plus 2 equals 10.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000 position:56%
And I just put the 10 next to the 4.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.000 position:58%
Okay. Did anyone else do it that way?

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000 position:97%
Okay. Remember this idea, you guys? A picture is worth a thousand words?

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Do we have a picture for that?

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
No.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Do we have a picture for that?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Yeah.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000 position:98%
Does someone… if you do, maybe I’ll try your way? How would you draw a picture of that?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000 position:63%
You do 26 circles and put 4 in each one.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Okay…

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Or 4 circles in 26 rows.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Either one?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Either one.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000 position:97%
Okay. Instead of drawing lots of … since 4 circles is easier to draw, I might do that.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Instead of drawing, um.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
26 in

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000 position:89%
26 dots, can I make a shortcut? And put the number? Okay.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000 position:98%
And then … this is pretty close to what we were doing down there, so if I wanted to make it like boxes,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000 position:86%
That are all the same, then I could put 26 in each one?

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.000
How ‘bout the dots?

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000 position:97%
Okay. Another strategy. Who had a different strategy, not the stack and multiply strategy.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Um… what’d you do?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
I had… I had one for the drawing.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
What was your drawing?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.000 position:69%
26 plus 26 equals, uh, what you call it? 26…

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000 position:75%
So one person—are you defending the same answer?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Yeah.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000 position:75%
Okay. So you used 26 and 26. And what’d you get?

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I got… 52.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
No! that’s not the answer!

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.000 position:73%
And… on the drawing, that might look like that?

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Bottom of the 52 I put another 52,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Where’d that 52 come from?

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000 position:64%
‘Cause there’s 2 ways. One you could do..

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Oh! I know!

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000
52 plus 52! Equals 104.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000 position:98%
Do you want to… do you want to finish your thought? Or do you want someone else to finish your thought?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Okay, go ahead.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Yeah, I put a 4 on the bottom,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
You put a 4 on bottom.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
I added 2 plus 2

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.000 position:89%
Oh, oh, you were adding, sorry. I thought you just… okay.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Added 2 plus 2 equals 4.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Uh huh…

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And 5 plus 5 equals 10, so… yeah.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000 position:95%
Okay, so on the picture could I also say that that equals 52?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Yeah.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.000 position:97%
And… I’m gonna call that.. can we call that, “double?” You doubled 26? And doubled it again?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
The double double?

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
A triple!

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000 position:98%
Okay. Is that a triple strategy? I don’t know if that’s the same. It’s a double double… okay.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000 position:59%
Did anyone… break the number 26 apart?

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
No.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
And do that?

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
No, I did another way.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000 position:89%
Or do you have a different way. Derek, what was your way?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:37.000
I have a different way.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
What’s your way.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000 position:98%
I looked, when I saw the number up there, I just looked at it, and, but I didn’t do it the right way.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000 position:97%
I did…2, I did, I knew the 20 was in the tens place, so I did 20, 40, 60, 80, 4 times.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.000 position:75%
And then, um, after that I did the 6 four times.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
So how did you do the 6 four times?

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:07.000 position:98%
I jumped it by 6, is all. So, 4. I did 6, 12, 18, 24. And then I added those to 80, and 24 together

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:19.000
80 and 24 together and made 104.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.000 position:98%
So that’s 24, and that’s 80, and all together.. 104. Whoa. Let’s try that in a picture.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000 position:97%
And see… 20, plus 20, plus 20, plus 20, hey, that’s like our groups over here. Equal groups?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000 position:98%
So I’m gonna try drawing that. Here’s 20, then 20 more, then 20 more, then 20 more, and how many did we get all together?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
80.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.000
80?

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000
80.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000 position:97%
20, 40, 60, 80. Okay. So that is… 80. And then he did the same thing with the 6?

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:09.000 position:59%
Where did this 20 and the 6 come from?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000
26?

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000
Oh! I got it from the 26.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:16.000 position:98%
Oh! So wait a minute. I’m gonna go right up here and say, you started with this idea, 26. You did break it apart!

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.000 position:97%
Here’s 20, and here’s 6. So 26 is made up of a 20, two tens, and 6 ones.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.000 position:91%
So here’s his… and we had to do what with it? Multiply by…

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000
4.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000 position:98%
4? Okay. So let’s see. Here’s our 4 20’s, here’s, maybe, our 4 6’s? and you said that’s 24.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000 position:98%
Cool. And then 24, my mess, getting kind of messy here! 80 and 24 you said, all together, is…

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000
104.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000
104? Okay. Pretty cool, you guys.
