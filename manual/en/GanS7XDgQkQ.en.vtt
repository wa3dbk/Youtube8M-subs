00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:19.779
Your doctor has recommended that you undergo
a balloon angioplasty.

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.839
But what does that actually mean?

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:27.189
The heart is located in the center of the
chest.

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:32.009
It's job is to keep blood continually circulating
throughout the body.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:37.670
The blood vessels that supply the body with
oxygen-rich blood are called arteries.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.170
The arteries that supplies blood to the heart
muscle itself are called coronary arteries.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.350
Sometimes, these blood vessels can narrow
or become blocked by plaque deposits, restricting

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.129
normal blood flow.

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:57.789
In simple terms, a balloon angioplasty is
a procedure used to increase the amount of

00:00:57.789 --> 00:01:01.739
blood flowing through the coronary artery.

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:07.680
During a balloon angioplasty, a heart specialist
will insert a thin tube into an artery in

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.159
your arm or leg and gently guide it towards
the problem area in your heart.

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.690
Once the tube is in place, a small balloon
is briefly inflated in order to widen the

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.880
narrowed artery.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.320
During and after the procedure, your doctor
will take x-rays in order to monitor your

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.320
progress.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.679
Your Procedure:

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:34.619
On the day of your operation, you will be
asked to put on a surgical gown.

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.989
You may receive a sedative by mouth and an
intravenous line may be put in.

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:44.729
You will then be transferred to the operating
table.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.869
To begin, your leg and groin are swabbed with
an antiseptic solution.

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.539
Then the doctor will make a small cut over
the femoral artery in the upper part of the

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:58.509
leg.

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:04.929
A special needle is then inserted into the
artery itself.

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:10.039
Then a guide wire is carefully passed through
the needle and gently pushed into the artery

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.730
and upwards towards your chest.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:26.090
A narrow tube, called a catheter is threaded
along the wire until it too has reached the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.150
coronary artery.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.900
Next, the doctor uses the catheter to inject
a dye into the artery itself.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:40.879
The die shows up on a TV monitor and is used
to pinpoint the exact location of the blocked

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.209
area.

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.430
Once the restricted area has been identified,
a thin wire is inserted into the catheter,

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:59.680
and is guided all the way to the blocked area
and then slightly beyond.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.209
This wire acts as guide for the balloon catheter.

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.560
It allows your doctor to position the deflated
balloon precisely in the middle of the narrowest

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.510
part of the coronary artery.

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.109
The balloon is briefly inflated.

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:23.599
As it expands, it squeezes the plaque deposits
against the wall of the artery.

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:29.370
It also stretches the artery wall and enlarges
the channel through which blood flows.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.370
Your doctor will continue to inflate and deflate
the balloon until normal blood flow has been

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:38.260
restored.

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:45.650
Finally, after a thorough investigation of
the region, the catheters and guide wire are

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:54.620
withdrawn.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:04:03.650
The dye that had been injected will break
up and leave your body as waste.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:33.419
Slight pressure is applied to the incision
in your leg in order to prevent bleeding.
