Hi. This is Melissa Dacher here with model
Susie Chhuor for Expert Village. Today we

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:09.699
are going to teach you how to do vampire makeup
for Halloween. Next, I'm going to teach you

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:16.449
how to curl your lashes and apply mascara.
Take your lash curler, look down slightly.

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:23.800
Apply it right over your lashes. Try to get
it as close to your base as possible without

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:32.250
pinching yourself. Clamp down. And you want
to do five to ten short, but hard crunches

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:43.930
with the curler. I'm going to fan out any
clumps you might have. Do it once more, back

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:55.450
through your lashes. If you feel it pinch,
just open it up and move it further down so

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:05.501
that you don't get your skin. Just quick and
short. Release them and fan them out if you

00:01:05.501 --> 00:01:13.959
like. This just avoids any clumping before
you actually add the mascara. Take your mascara

00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:23.369
wand and lightly coat the lashes starting
at the base and working out the tip. You are

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:35.420
going to coat your lashes and make a nice
even build up. Always start at the base first

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:44.030
and then work it upward and build it up. Make
your coats thicker and your lashes longer.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:56.299
Apply enough, that way it stands out. But
you don't want to make it over dramatic, otherwise

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:02.409
it will clump. And if you prefer to curl your
lashes even further, wait until after the

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.880
mascara has already dried before proceeding,
otherwise it will clump and will get all messy

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:14.630
and look horrible. So, wait until your mascara
dries before you crimp them again. And you're

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.780
set.
