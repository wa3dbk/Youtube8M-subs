00:00:11.719 --> 00:00:12.169
if there was

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:16.800
action and beauty in it they were there
they've captured something that will

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:17.350
stay

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.789
in many hearts and passions for a long
time the Rosenfeld work had a real

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.539
sense of art to it that people
appreciated and magazines wanted to

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:28.220
portray

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.430
I would say the most recognizable
image

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.610
that the Rosenfelds captured is
Flying Spinnakers, it was the cover

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.550
Life Magazine in 1938

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.600
and its interesting it has its own
branding that many people don't realize

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.030
that that image

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:53.300
was photographed by Rosenfeld family

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.820
with over a million images more of these
things are very well documented

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.800
so he truly was a curator in the sense
and it it almost is another

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:04.480
serendipitous thing that the collection
ended up here Mystic Seaport

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.440
being cared for in the same way that I
think he would was caring for it in his life time.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:13.090
Our tremendous staff
at Mystic Seaport

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.630
can look at these photographs and tell
stories about

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.280
women and yachts

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.360
we can look at technology development
and yachts

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.670
it's not just a single picture it is a
picture that is in a series of

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.780
studies regarding many many elements of maritime history

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.790
of course there are folks that
want to have one hanging in their home

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:41.080
and call the museum or email us and buy
a print online before they know it

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.340
they've got a Rosenfeld

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:45.700
right in their study.

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.920
Just look at a Rosenfeld it isn't a static

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.020
picture, it is a moment in time

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.020
but it invokes that sense of movement

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.460
and power it is that drama that I think
they're they're so good

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.970
at catching.
