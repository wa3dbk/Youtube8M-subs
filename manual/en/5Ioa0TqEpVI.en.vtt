00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:01.729
Hey guys.

00:00:01.729 --> 00:00:02.729
Michael here from The Daily Note.

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:06.160
In this video, I'll show you how to get any
app that is inside the multi window tray and

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.830
get it to pop up in Pen window.

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.139
Unlike the app we looked at in the last episode
that did something similar, this trick will

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.500
work on even stock and system apps. it does
not require any modification or reinstall

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.580
of the app.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:30.570
And this works without needing a rooted device,
so let's check it out.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.369
As always, I have an unrooted device.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.649
To get any multi-window compatible app to
work in pen window, there is a free method

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:40.600
to do this, and a slightly more convenient
method to do this for about $2.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.609
Let's look at the free method first that was
inspired by a comment contributed by a Mahmod

00:00:45.609 --> 00:00:46.920
Saber.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.660
As you can see, there aren't many PEN window
compatible apps to choose from.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:53.390
There are just a few stock and Google apps
in here.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:58.550
Even S Note, S Planner, My Files, E-Mail,
etc. are all missing from this list.

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.420
However, there many more apps, and 3rd party
apps, that are multi-window compatible, and

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.450
we can get any of these apps to work inside
pen window.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.640
So here's the free method.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.580
Let's first install the free app, Floating
Window Shortcuts.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.110
Then launch it.

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.090
And hit the Create Shortcut button.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.220
Select Choose App, and pick the Play Store.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.780
This will create a shortcut to the Play Store
that works inside of Pen Window.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.750
Once you have that open, you can find the
app you want to launch by going to My Apps

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.770
or you can search for it.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.470
Just make sure it is multi window compatible.

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.320
So I'm going to choose 3 apps that I know
for sure aren't pen window compatible: Twitter,

00:01:36.320 --> 00:02:04.160
Chrome, and Facebook.

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.200
You can see I have all 3 running now in floating
Pen Window.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.979
And you can see that if I push the home button,
they all minimize.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.840
Now you will see that Samsung stock apps are
not directly accessible through Google Play.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.360
So here's a work around.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.760
You will need to install an app called APK
Backup.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.159
You will not be backing up any apps with it,
however, it is a multi window compatible app

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.609
that can launch system apps through it.

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:29.030
So that's what we'll do.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.859
After the install, open the APK Backup app
inside Pen Window.

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.129
Set this setting one time.

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.150
Go to settings and make sure Show System Apps
in enabled.

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.400
And now let's try to launch 3 system or stock
apps that we normally can't launch through

00:02:42.400 --> 00:03:19.200
PEN window: S Note, S Planner, and E-Mail.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.200
There you go.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:23.540
A few more steps but after you get used to
it, it's not that bad.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.420
Now, there is a more convenient method if
you don't mind purchasing a pro license key

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:30.010
for about $2.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.480
You can just create shortcuts for the apps
directly, and you can launch them with the

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.769
shortcuts that you create.

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.060
If you think you can benefit from multi tasking
with a particular app, you can try and use

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.170
it with the free method.

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.290
If you find yourself using it often, maybe
it's worth investing in the pro license.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.819
So that's it for today.
