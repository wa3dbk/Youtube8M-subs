00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.945
"U.S. Meat Supply Flying at Half Staph"

00:00:03.565 --> 00:00:07.114
May 2011, researchers 
published an investigation

00:00:07.114 --> 00:00:11.428
into the prevalence of 
multidrug-resistant staph bacteria

00:00:11.428 --> 00:00:13.939
in the U.S. meat supply.

00:00:13.939 --> 00:00:17.299
Antibiotics are used extensively 
in food animal production

00:00:17.299 --> 00:00:19.989
for growth promotion 
and disease prevention,

00:00:19.989 --> 00:00:21.377
due to the stressful, overcrowded,

00:00:21.377 --> 00:00:25.429
and unhygienic conditions in 
which they’re often confined.

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:29.884
Surveys conducted by NARMS, 
the CDC monitoring system,

00:00:29.884 --> 00:00:34.377
“indicate that retail meat and poultry 
products are frequently contaminated

00:00:34.377 --> 00:00:40.559
with multidrug-resistant Campylobacter, 
Salmonella, Enterococcus, and E. coli."

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.467
But what about staph infections,

00:00:42.467 --> 00:00:44.319
which, in people, can cause everything

00:00:44.319 --> 00:00:48.268
from skin infections to 
pneumonia and meningitis?

00:00:48.268 --> 00:00:53.469
Researchers “collected and tested a 
total of 136 meat and poultry samples

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.469
from 5 US cities, encompassing 80 
unique brands from 26 grocery stores.”

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:03.499
They tested retail beef, 
chicken, pork, and turkey.

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:06.829
Any guess as to which 
was most contaminated?

00:01:06.829 --> 00:01:09.316
Staph “contamination was most common

00:01:09.316 --> 00:01:14.420
among turkey samples, followed 
by pork, chicken, and [then] beef.”

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.560
Three-quarters of 
retail turkey tested,

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:26.501
and overall, 47% of U.S. retail meat 
tested was found contaminated with staph,

00:01:26.501 --> 00:01:31.080
and “multidrug resistance was common.”

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.007
Here are 18 different common 
clinical antibiotics used

00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:36.901
in human medicine, across the top.

00:01:36.901 --> 00:01:42.525
Important drugs, like erythromycin, 
penicillin, ampicillin, ceftriazone.

00:01:42.525 --> 00:01:45.731
And then, going down, these are 
some of the staph bacteria they found

00:01:45.731 --> 00:01:48.861
in turkey, pork, chicken, and beef.

00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:52.849
Orange means intermediate 
resistance to the antibiotic;

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:54.761
red means complete resistance;

00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:57.119
and black is multidrug resistance

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.841
to three or more classes of antibiotics.

00:02:00.841 --> 00:02:04.892
These bugs were not 
from some hospital ICU,

00:02:04.893 --> 00:02:08.852
but right off of grocery store shelves.

00:02:08.852 --> 00:02:13.832
Conclusion: “Conventional concentrated
animal feeding operations

00:02:13.832 --> 00:02:16.243
(CAFOs [or, so-called factory farms])

00:02:16.243 --> 00:02:20.393
provide all the necessary components 
for the emergence and proliferation

00:02:20.393 --> 00:02:25.973
of multidrug-resistant zoonotic 
[or animal-to-human] pathogens.

00:02:25.973 --> 00:02:28.242
In the United States, 
billions of food animals

00:02:28.242 --> 00:02:30.675
are raised in densely stocked CAFOs,

00:02:30.675 --> 00:02:33.777
where antibiotics are routinely 
administered in feed and water

00:02:33.777 --> 00:02:36.487
for extended periods to healthy animals.

00:02:36.487 --> 00:02:39.458
[The CDC] has shown 
that multidrug-resistant

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:43.166
E. coli and Enterococcus 
species are prevalent

00:02:43.166 --> 00:02:45.216
among US meat and poultry products.

00:02:45.216 --> 00:02:49.107
Our findings indicate that 
multidrug-resistant Staph aureus

00:02:49.107 --> 00:02:52.685
should be added to the list of 
[antibiotic]-resistant pathogens

00:02:52.685 --> 00:02:57.786
that routinely now 
contaminate our food supply.”
