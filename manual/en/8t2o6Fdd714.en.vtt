Sweets Tales

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:13.300
Today's topic: "Kawara Sembei" made one-by-one using an iron mold.

00:00:18.334 --> 00:00:23.050
Azabu Juban,
the district where decorum and friendliness intersect.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.869
On the corner stands a sembei shop founded 104 years ago.

00:00:35.167 --> 00:00:38.800
At the back of the shop,third-generation proprietor,

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:46.000
Masami Suzaki is making Kawara sembei crackers,
a traditional Meiji Era treat.

00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:51.384
The sembei he's making today are rich with eggs.

00:00:52.468 --> 00:00:58.251
Using a 5-kilo mold, he bakes 500 sembei at one go.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.218
This mold is the heaviest. My hand gets tired.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.500
The ingredients: wheat, sugar and eggs.

00:01:24.385 --> 00:01:30.117
Kawara sembei became popular in the Meiji Era as a stylish treat.

00:01:36.019 --> 00:01:42.000
From that period,
the flourishing Azabu Juban district became known for kawara sembei,

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:48.000
although no kawara tile-shaped sembei were actually produced.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.418
They didn't want to imitate.

00:01:52.267 --> 00:01:57.300
After all,there were many kawara -shaped sembei in the Kansai area.

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.278
Ten different flavors,
like perilla, green tea, and sugar-filled Aruheimaki:

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:11.500
Creating these original flavors has maintained the brand.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The fourth generation to inherit is Masanori.

00:02:21.034 --> 00:02:30.000
It's amazing that my father continued by himself

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:38.500
even during the recession when everyone in this area was having difficulties.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:44.500
In Azabu Juban, one accomplished man ---- ten flavors of sembei.
