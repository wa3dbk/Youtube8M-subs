00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
Welcome to Ahmet's kitchen, today we take a Swabian specialty

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.320
Lentils with spÃ¤tzle

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:10.439
I have soaked lentils, 250g

00:00:10.439 --> 00:00:12.499
I have a day earlier, soaked in water

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:16.710
first to the side so that

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.050
30g flour

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.929
30g tomato paste

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.890
20g sweet peppers

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.019
Salt and pepper

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.490
Garlic something

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:33.760
green

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.030
a carrot

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.880
2 onions

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:40.220
and sausages 300g

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.590
let's get started

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.050
we put everything first side

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.120
By Position

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.520
that is to

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:53.400
500g noodles and I still

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.740
first to the side that come off later

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.000
Magerine purely

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.670
into the pot, about 50g

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.060
Then we cut the onions

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.060
which must be finely cut

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:26.160
into the pot purely

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.680
now we cut the carrot, peeled I have previously

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.680
halve first

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:05.970
halve again

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.039
and chop

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:20.189
the onions have some color, now the carrot comes in

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:27.189
Cook for one minute

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.759
as long as we cut the sausage

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:42.759
we cut obliquely

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.879
so ready

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:54.949
one minute now rum

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:59.289
now comes in tomato paste

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:04.669
the sweet peppers

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:09.259
and flour

00:03:09.259 --> 00:03:16.259
Stir everything

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:20.119
stir one minute no longer

00:03:20.119 --> 00:03:22.089
one minute rum

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:29.080
200ml chicken broth purely

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:44.959
the soaked lentils purely

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:07.679
again 100ml water

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:17.199
put in salt and pepper

00:04:18.979 --> 00:04:23.439
and fresh garlic

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:25.199
Stir everything

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.449
cover up

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.439
Cook for 15 minutes

00:04:37.439 --> 00:04:40.169
I have 2L water

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:45.009
I agree with 1 tsp salt pure

00:04:45.009 --> 00:04:46.529
and 500g noodles

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:03.930
we cook until it is al dente

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:07.419
OK

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.539
which take 10 minutes about

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.639
15 minutes now rum

00:05:12.639 --> 00:05:18.229
I have checked until they are soft enough

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.039
as long you have to cook them

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:26.050
it has too little water, we do something about it

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:33.189
stir

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:36.759
so you can see how easy it is

00:05:36.759 --> 00:05:39.819
the sausages purely

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:48.319
stir

00:05:48.319 --> 00:05:52.749
cover up

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:57.029
and again let boil for 10 minutes

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:01.519
the noodles are done, al dente

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:02.919
I take this down and do it seven

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.529
am back

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:11.069
we see that the sausages are ready to look good

00:06:11.069 --> 00:06:12.770
we control again

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:16.309
Do not forget, stirring occasionally

00:06:16.309 --> 00:06:22.509
otherwise they stick on the floor, so I've taken as a pot

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:24.860
Yes, finished

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:28.849
off times

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.419
now we can serve the whole

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:38.819
something on it on one side of the plate

00:06:38.819 --> 00:06:44.069
because even

00:06:44.069 --> 00:06:51.069
turn around

00:06:51.389 --> 00:06:58.389
now the lentils with sausage on it

00:07:02.349 --> 00:07:07.919
which gets the cameraman Murat

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:10.319
to decorate

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:11.879
Parsley on it

00:07:15.460 --> 00:07:17.229
OK

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:19.960
so you can serve them

00:07:19.960 --> 00:07:23.840
I wish you a good appetite with the lenses with spaetzle, until next time, Ahmet, bye :)
