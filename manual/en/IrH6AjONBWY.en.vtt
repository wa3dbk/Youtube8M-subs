00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:07.607 align:start size:97% position:3% line:76%
&gt;&gt; I NOTICE YOUR COFFEE FILTER
IS ALREADY WET.

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:12.011 line:76%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, I LIKE TO PRE-WET MY
FILTERS TO TAKE AWAY THE PAPERY

00:00:12.111 --> 00:00:13.279 line:71%
TASTE.

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.749 align:start position:0% line:76%
IT ALSO HELPS TO PREHEAT THE
CONE SINCE IT'S CERAMIC AND COLD

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.886 align:start position:0% line:76%
AND HELPS TO PREHEAT THE CARAFE,
TOO.

00:00:19.986 --> 00:00:23.122 line:76%
YOU'RE GOING TO BREW HOT COFFEE
INTO SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY

00:00:23.222 --> 00:00:23.789 line:71%
PREHEATED AND WARM.

00:00:23.889 --> 00:00:25.258 line:71%
&gt;&gt; SHOW ME HOW YOU DO IT.

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:30.162 align:start size:91% position:9% line:76%
&gt;&gt; I ALWAYS GRIND MY COFFEE
FRESH.

00:00:30.262 --> 00:00:31.897 align:start size:97% position:3% line:76%
&gt;&gt; WHOLE BEAN COFFEE, GRIND IT
AT HOME.

00:00:31.997 --> 00:00:32.865 line:71%
&gt;&gt; ABSOLUTELY.

00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:34.867 align:start size:94% position:6% line:76%
I LIKE TO WEIGH OUT MY GROUND
COFFEE.

00:00:34.967 --> 00:00:40.472 align:start size:97% position:3% line:76%
THE STANDARD RECIPE IS 1.5 TO 2
GRAMS PER OUNCE.

00:00:40.572 --> 00:00:44.644 line:76%
&gt;&gt; NOW, AT HOME, WOULD WE REALLY
DO THIS OR WOULD WE EYEBALL HOW

00:00:44.744 --> 00:00:48.314 align:start position:0% line:76%
MUCH TO PUT IN THE COFFEE FILTER
AND POUR AND HOW DANGEROUS IS

00:00:48.414 --> 00:00:49.815 align:start size:91% position:9% line:76%
THAT FOR RUINING OUR CUP OF
COFFEE?

00:00:49.915 --> 00:00:52.852 align:start position:0% line:76%
&gt;&gt; YOU'RE NOT GOING TO RUIN YOUR
CUP OF COFFEE.

00:00:52.952 --> 00:00:56.121 align:start size:94% position:6% line:76%
I TYPICALLY RECOMMEND A
TABLESPOON PER CUP AND A BREW

00:00:56.221 --> 00:00:58.324 line:71%
TIME OF TWO MINUTES.

00:00:58.424 --> 00:00:59.025 line:71%
&gt;&gt; WATER IS HOT.

00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:00.527 line:71%
&gt;&gt; JUST OFF BOIL.

00:01:00.627 --> 00:01:03.295 align:start size:97% position:3% line:76%
MY WATER TEMPERATURE SHOULD BE
BETWEEN 195 AND 205.

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:04.463 line:71%
&gt;&gt; THAT SOUNDS REASONABLE.

00:01:04.563 --> 00:01:06.465 line:71%
WE CAN DO THAT AT HOME.

00:01:06.565 --> 00:01:08.735 line:71%
&gt;&gt; NOT TOO COOL.

00:01:08.835 --> 00:01:10.069 line:71%
NOT SCALDING HOT EITHER.

00:01:10.169 --> 00:01:13.906 align:start size:97% position:3% line:76%
&gt;&gt; WHY NOT FILL THE FILTER AND
LET IT PERCOLATE DOWN.

00:01:14.006 --> 00:01:17.576 align:start size:97% position:3% line:76%
&gt;&gt; THERE'S A LOT OF FRESH GASES
INSIDE OF THIS COFFEE.

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:19.045 line:71%
IT WAS JUST ROASTED YESTERDAY.

00:01:19.145 --> 00:01:21.247 align:start size:94% position:6% line:76%
COFFEE NATURALLY HAS A LOT OF
GASES.

00:01:21.347 --> 00:01:24.183 align:start position:0% line:76%
ESPECIALLY AFTER THAT DYNAMIC
ROASTING PROCESS, WHEN YOU BEGIN

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:26.919 line:76%
TO BREW THE COFFEE, YOU'LL
NOTICE THAT BLOOM HAPPEN.

00:01:27.019 --> 00:01:29.655 line:76%
IT'S BEST TO FIND A COFFEE THAT
WILL HAVE A ROAST DATE ON THE

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:31.791 align:start size:88% position:13% line:76%
BAG SO YOU KNOW WHEN THE
COFFEE'S ROASTED.

00:01:31.891 --> 00:01:34.260 line:76%
THE CLOSER YOU CAN GET TO THE
ROAST DATE THE BETTER TO REALLY

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.561 line:71%
ENSURE THAT FRESHNESS.

00:01:35.661 --> 00:01:37.964 align:start position:0% line:76%
&gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE A COFFEE PERSON,
YOU'RE WILLING TO GO THROUGH ALL

00:01:38.064 --> 00:01:40.266 align:start position:0% line:76%
OF THIS WORK FOR THIS ONE CUP OF
COFFEE.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.434 line:71%
&gt;&gt; YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

00:01:41.534 --> 00:01:43.836 align:start size:94% position:6% line:76%
THIS IS THE FINAL STEP IN THE
CHAIN.

00:01:43.937 --> 00:01:47.773 align:start position:0% line:76%
THIS IS ARGUABLY ONE OF THE MORE
IMPORTANT PARTS.

00:01:47.873 --> 00:01:51.076 align:start position:0% line:76%
YOU CAN HAVE A FABULOUS, AMAZING
COFFEE THAT THE FARMER RAISED

00:01:51.176 --> 00:01:54.647 line:76%
AND TOOK CARE OF AND HERE AT THE
ROASTERY THEY ROASTED WELL, BUT

00:01:54.747 --> 00:01:57.650 line:76%
IF I DON'T BREW IT PROPERLY, I
CAN REALLY DESTROY EVERYTHING

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.520 line:76%
THAT HAPPENED BEFORE THAT, SO --
&gt;&gt; YOU MAKE ME FEEL REALLY LAZY

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:02.855 line:71%
ABOUT MAKING COFFEE.

00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:06.392 line:76%
&gt;&gt; I THINK THE MORE YOU GET INTO
COFFEE, JUST LIKE ANY FOOD, YOU

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:07.794 line:71%
GET INTO PREPARING FOODS.

00:02:07.894 --> 00:02:11.264 line:76%
IF YOU GRILL AT HOME, YOU KNOW,
YOU REALLY ENJOY WORKING WITH

00:02:11.364 --> 00:02:13.232 align:start position:0% line:76%
THE COALS AND UNDERSTANDING YOUR
FOOD.

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:15.201 line:71%
COFFEE'S THE SAME WAY.

00:02:15.301 --> 00:02:17.970 align:start position:0% line:76%
IT JUST KIND OF BECOMES A LITTLE
BIT OF A PASSION PROJECT, AND

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:20.073 line:71%
IT'S A LOT OF FUN.
