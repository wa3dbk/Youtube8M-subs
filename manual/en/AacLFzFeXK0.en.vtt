00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.460
Hello friends of analog Entertainment and welcome to Hunter and Cron. 

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:06.240
Today, with "Bruges the city on the Zwin". 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.580
And not how I mistakenly thought the city on the thread. It is the first expansion to Bruges, 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:14.299
of course again by Stefan Feld.

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:20.539
And now no longer for 2 to 4 players, but playable for 2-5 players. 

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:26.200
You get an extra game board, there is also a second gatehouse on it. 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.610
And then you can just play Bruges with 5 players. 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.260
It's as cool as with 4 and it is not too much longer. 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.660
Since you need even more cards as contained in the base game, 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.780
you also get even more cards and there is added an entirely new group of people. 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:48.810
The travelers. Apart from that it contains of two modules. 

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:53.670
The Zwin with ships and the stock market. 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.600
They're both really quite short and 
simple and integrate fast. 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.480
and change nothing in principle in the ruleset 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.349
but rather complement existing mechanisms.

00:01:05.349 --> 00:01:09.629
And the ships improve action building a canal. 

00:01:09.629 --> 00:01:16.720
If the dice are rolled, then the 3s and 4s are important now. 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.860
They did not matter in the base game . 

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:25.450
With a yellow 3 and a blue 4, a blue and a yellow to ship will arrive. 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.100
One also sees what's coming beforehand, so you can say 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.060
"For God's sake, when this the purple ship arrives I must not miss it under any circumstances".

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.140
And if you now trigger the action building a canal, then you have an additional option, 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:48.020
Namely, one can activate a ship, you only must submit a henchman in the ship's color. 

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.860
And then you can use the extra action or effect of the ship, some of which are very strong. 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:01.020
For example, this blue ship gives one step in the town hall. This can of course be extremely strong. 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.520
And then there are a lot of other things, for example, you can pay a henchman

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.390
and this gets you 3 henchmen of any color, also very strong. 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.590
You can also exchange a henchman against six coins. 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.920
There is a ship, that let you use all individuals with lightning symbol, you have collected, 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.860
which have a unique effect, because it can be very strong at times, 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.520
but with this ship you can activate them again. 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.660
Especially attack people are often lighting actions, where you can distribute threat marker 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.980
or even kill other people.

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:43.800
With this ship those cards become even more dangerous and stronger.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.760
Now strong combos are possible, you can look to collect persons with lightning symbol

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:56.720
and speculate on activating them again with this ship.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.040
So there are sexy things feasible.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.880
Then there's a ship, where you can leave any 2 threat markers. 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.220
And then there's a ship that let you draw one more cards

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:14.439
and with this card you may immediately perform another action. So all strong stuff. But costs henchmen. 

00:03:14.439 --> 00:03:25.419
An element which appealed to me very much, because it makes building a canal so much more attractive. 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.040
In the base game, I must honestly say, that was a bit boring. 

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:36.780
Yes you get victory points, but in the end it is only a card in the suit, pay money, build a tile.

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:41.820
That was not as exciting as building a house and let a fancy person move into it, 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.420
which has a cool effect. 

00:03:43.429 --> 00:03:47.749
And of course also the henchmen get pimped. The action was indeed a bit boring. 

00:03:47.749 --> 00:03:50.529
Simply give a card, get 2 Henchmen. 

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:54.620
Now the henchmen have become even more important, because you can do the additional action with the ship 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.609
So that's one element, which really improves Bruges. 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:06.560
Yes, the second element: the stock market. Because with power and wealth, you also need a stock market. 

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:13.240
The people of Bruges tried, with more or less success 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:20.660
Because the stock market just improves a randomly determined actions in each round. 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:25.420
It is revealed a stock market card in each round. In this case: the crane. 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.980
"The next six players that do the canal action 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:34.400
may build on a field regardless of the color. 

00:04:34.409 --> 00:04:43.049
One can not just use them indefinitely, but only so often, how many scrolls are on it here. 

00:04:43.049 --> 00:04:45.169
Although one must say it is a bit strange, 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:47.749
because it has indeed something to do with how many people play. 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:52.460
If you play as a couple, you will never use 6 times the canal action in one round. 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:58.420
While if you are playing with 5 it's more likely that all the tiles are used up. 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:05.090
So that's one element of the stock market, that seems not so refined.

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:12.750
One action is always pimped, for example, I can build a house without paying a henchman. 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.930
There is a bit of a luck thing. Does it fit me in my strategy, 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:22.550
to build a canal now, then it's great when the stock market improves the action. 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.200
If not, the improvement is usually not so strong that I will change my strategy. 

00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:34.080
So I would even say, very good that you can omit the stock market. 

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:37.940
Is it worth now or not, in any case this extension is worth 

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:43.080
if you want to play with 5. Bruges is a great game you want to play with five.

00:05:43.089 --> 00:05:46.320
Now you can play with 5 and that's great. 

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.780
And now you can do much much more, because everything got pimped. 

00:05:50.789 --> 00:05:58.949
This is somehow a level upgrade, or the level cap has been raised.

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:03.529
This allows us to do much more, collect more people cards in a round. 

00:06:03.529 --> 00:06:09.340
Thus we can also use the effects that build on each other partially, much more often. 

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:15.500
So even more strategies are possible than before. Therefore, a recommendation. 

00:06:15.509 --> 00:06:23.449
But who no longer plays Bruges much, can also leave the city on the Zwin at the Zwin. 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.009
You see, Hunter is somehow inbezwin...
