00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:13.119
Travelers to Maryland are discovering a little
slice of heaven nestled nicely on the banks

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:15.900
of the Elk River and the Chesapeake Bay.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.170
This is Buttonwood Beach RV Resort.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:25.769
For nearly 40 years Buttonwood Beach RV Resort
has set the standard for campground living

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:32.460
with a game changing concept – offering
a lifestyle that is both beautiful and unique.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.309
It's very hard to expect anything at Buttonwood
that is ordinary - we're a very unique campground.

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.999
We sell 99 year leases, we have people that
have been with us now for four generations

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:48.860
- we started the property in 1973 with the
same management that we have today.

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:54.600
So, you can expect to a find a peaceful, quiet,
serene, fun, safe environment for you and

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.600
your family.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:00.850
We’ve been “sold out” for years but
maintain a list of properties available for

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:01.850
resale.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:07.170
Our staff is happy to work with you to find
just the right spot for your new summer place.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.740
Accommodations at Buttonwood vary - we have
rental properties that our site owners actually

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.340
rent out and that is done weekly, monthly,
even seasonally for the person that wants

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.060
to see if this is their type of an environment
- it's the perfect way for them to visit,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.860
bring their family and see if it's a good
fit.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:30.789
Here at Buttonwood Beach RV Resort, the beautiful
sights and sounds are everywhere you look

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:36.281
– from the best that mother nature has to
offer to clean, comfortable, stylish RV resort

00:01:36.281 --> 00:01:38.079
style homes.

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:42.119
Tour the grounds and you’ll find plenty
of fun for the entire family – whether you

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.539
fancy a dip in the pool or a game of basketball
with the kids.

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:51.109
Buttonwood Beach RV Resort sits right on the
shore – giving you direct access to the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:53.609
beach to soak in the sun.

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:58.329
And for more fun away from dry land, we have
our very own boat ramp for when you’re ready

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:00.670
to test those sea legs!

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.150
And don’t worry – at Buttonwood Beach
we love your four-legged friends just as much

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:06.509
as you do!

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.290
Well-mannered dogs are welcome anytime – and
we even have a special place built just for

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.670
them to run and play!

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.860
Like any top RV Resort, here at Buttonwood
we have our very own General Store with a

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.189
chance to pick up a special memento from your
time spent here, or grab some of the essentials

00:02:24.189 --> 00:02:26.120
you may need during your stay.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.150
Our modern laundry facility is standing by
when you need to clean up some of those beach

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.069
clothes you’ll be wearing!

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.140
And our helpful staff is here daily to make
sure that your every need is met.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.820
Reconnect with your friends and with mother
nature here at Buttonwood Beach RV Resort

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.010
– and start a legacy for your family.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.989
The one thing that I like people to know about
Buttonwood - you have to really start with

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.260
the 99 year lease that's passed along to your
heirs.

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.470
Basically, that means that for the rest of
your life, and the life of your children and

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.720
their children - if you want to keep your
special place at the shore - you've got it

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:08.629
- it's yours - it's protected, it's private,
it's secure.

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:13.470
And I think that that setting - and it's a
little hard to explain initially, but that's

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.660
what makes us so special, you have a family,
a continuity, the same people year after year

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:24.099
- that build a group and build a family.

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.730
Like we always say here at Buttonwood Beach
RV Resort – “Come through our gate once

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:32.439
and you’ll never want to leave!” – which
is just how we planned it!
