Hi my name's Jimmy Clewes

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.180
I'm gonna show you how to rough out a
square - from square to round

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:44.620
then how to use a skew chisel

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:49.200
then to roll beads and coves with a spindle gouge

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.300
a little bit with the parting tool in conjunction

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.900
with the spindle gouge to form a little captive ring

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.780
the second thing is going to be an endgrain vase - that's turned from a piece of sycamore

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:08.500
I wanna show you the various hollowing tools that you can use - how they work

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.620
and take that through to completion

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.940
the third project is a platter

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.760
I've got a gorgeous piece of rippled and quilted Maple

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.360
the grain in it is really good,
it's not often I've seen quality like this

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.080
and what I want to do with
that is to color the rim

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.140
the off piece will be a box - a lidded box

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.060
the thing I want to do about this - instead of doing your normal cylindrical type of box

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.440
I'd like to make an oyster box - the
oyster box has to fit on a fairly small spigot

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.480
so we're getting into a fitting job here

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:52.200
I'm gonna use a really nice piece of Cocobolo

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.540
and I should get a really, quite a nice turning at the end of it

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.300
again I'm gonna explain the
tool techniques and why I do it that way

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.480
and I would also like
to show you the way I sharpen my tools

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:12.050
and the techniques I use to do it so without any more ado - I'm gonna crack on
