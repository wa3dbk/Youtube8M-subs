00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.340
Well, my name is Rob Bettcher. 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:12.660
I’m an engineering manager here at the Braun Corporation, and today is my day in the chair.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.700
We received some prototype parts today for some seat testing,

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:43.040
and we also have some material plastics that dropped off and to get to the seats.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.039
I had some material plastics in the
way. You know, normally step around them and

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.579
not worry too much, but today I had to try
and get the plastics parts moved out of the

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.499
way so I could get to the seats. It took a
little longer than normal, and it was definitely

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.480
a lot more difficult. In a normal day, we
have to always get into our manufacturing

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.979
facility just to do line checks and to see
if there are any issues, talk to our supervisors

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:11.710
to see if there’s any way to help them to
better perform their responsibilities, to

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:17.050
better do their job, make their job easier.
And today on my way over there, normally it

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.810
would just consist of either walking over
to the plant or jumping into the car real

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:27.810
quick, but today, just the thought of going
over there, was more difficult. 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.300
How do I get there? What’s the best path? What door should I use?

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.440
The things I would normally never consider.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.620
That’s what I was wondering, if we don’t
need an item number

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.519
One of the difficult parts of the day was

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:27.519
doing a manual transfer into my normal car
and having to take apart the wheelchair. 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.370
Once I got transferred in it became an apparent task that the wheelchair that I’m in has

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.629
to come inside this car with me. I’m going
to need it once I get to Plant 6 and back

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.870
to our engineering shop. So trying to reach
outside of the car and not lose your balance

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.969
and to take apart the wheelchair piece by
piece and squeeze it between my chest and

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:50.389
the steering wheel. And at one point, you’ll
have to lay back the driver’s seat just

00:02:50.389 --> 00:02:55.389
so that there’s adequate room to be able
to do that. And you know, it was a nice day

00:02:55.389 --> 00:03:01.060
today. The weather was beautiful, and had
it been snowy or rainy, I would have been

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.049
pretty, pretty wet and pretty uncomfortable
by the end of it.

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:11.430
Compared to the access into my car to the
Rampvan, the Rampvan had a lot of nice features

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:17.859
to allow me to enter into it quickly. The
power door, the power ramp assembly. You know,

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.400
it’s deploying as I was approaching, and
by time I got up to the van, it was ready

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:28.400
for me to enter. Was able to center up on
the ramp, go inside, and once inside, I found

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:33.049
it to be very roomy and the transfer was a
level transfer. I was able to get the chair

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:39.749
much closer with the seat than I was in the
car, and it was a much more, I’ll say, enjoyable experience.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.400
There were challenges that I had to face today

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:51.409
that I’ve never really gave any consideration
to, and you know, the challenges were minor

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.169
in detail compared to those that are out there. But it was an eye opening experience to shed some light on

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:03.639
how much space is required for maneuverability and how our products feel from a wheelchair.

00:04:03.639 --> 00:04:08.249
I’m not trying to claim that I have a perfect
understanding of what it’s like to be in

00:04:08.249 --> 00:04:12.549
a wheelchair or the challenges that face everyone,
but it’s definitely been an eye opening

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:18.609
experience for me, and it’s something that
we will try to keep in mind as we go forward

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.049
and develop new products for everyone for
society.
