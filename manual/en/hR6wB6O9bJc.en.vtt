00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.049
Good day.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.920
Multiplayer shooters are a dime or perhaps
even twenty cents a dozen these days so finding

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.720
one that differs from the norm is somewhat
difficult.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:29.250
If the multiplayer shooter is a dime a dozen
then the zombie shooter is probably a dime

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:38.930
a hundred, zombies have been done to death,
Killing Floor thankfully offers an experience

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.420
that is thankfully different from both multiplayer
shooters and zombie shooters as well.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.510
Killing Floor is a first person survival horror
wave shooter, essentially Killing Floor has

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.089
one game type wherein you fight waves and
waves of genetically engineered monsters,

00:00:55.089 --> 00:00:58.470
ranging from the basic Clot to the hard to
kill Scrake.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.269
Now, this may seem basic, but believe me,
shooting things in this game is anything but.

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.830
For one you may be wondering just where the
targeting reticule is - there is none.

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.490
The guns all behave pretty much like real
guns.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.490
Also, the enemies all do a good amount of
damage and you can die very fast.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.420
As you complete more and more waves, more
and more enemies spawn, also, as players enter

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.770
your game, the enemy count goes up to compensate.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:34.660
When faced with this many enemies, suddenly
you don�t feel like the ten foot tall badass

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:50.310
you thought you were.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.030
When you first start the game you have to
pick a perk, and they all have different effects

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:57.240
and they all give different buffs to different
weapon types.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.159
After every round the trader opens up and
she will sell you guns.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.260
You earn money by killing enemies, and when
you do get to the trader you can buy combat

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:08.610
armor, which you must do otherwise you will
die.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.390
Playing Killing Floor requires a great deal
of team work and a sound strategy to survive,

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:17.190
if you just run and gun, you will die sometimes.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.580
That�s the great thing about this game;
no one strategy works all the time.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:25.019
You just have to play it by ear.

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:29.730
At times you can trigger a bullet time like
effect that can be both a help and a hindrance

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.540
depending on the situation.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:37.560
At the end of every map you will have to fight
the boss known as the Patriarch; in addition

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.720
to having a rocket launcher and chaingun he
also can turn invisible if you hurt him enough.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:49.680
Believe me, there is nothing more annoying
than getting killed by him in the end.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:03:02.950
So if you haven�t tried Killing Floor, get
it; you will become addicted and you will

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.750
be playing this at 4 in the morning when you
have work the next day.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:13.040
And so this is Jon wishing you good
Red Orchestra, Good Serious Sam, or whatever

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.149
makes you happy.
