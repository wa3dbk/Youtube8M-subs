00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:07.520
G'day her i've got a pair of Arnette Hazard
sunglasses, with a bit of damage on the lens.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:14.680
So I'm going to show you how to replace sunglass
lenses using lenses from the sunglass fix.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.860
You can order new lenses directly through
the link in the notes below, or you can search

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.060
for other arnette models on the sunglass fix
site, they custom cut almost any make and

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.800
model sunglass, as long as it's not one piece.
Once you have ordered your replacement lenses,

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:40.149
they will arrive like this. Here we have chosen
a polarised black replacement lens. First

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:46.859
you will need to remove your damaged lens.
This is very easy, just turn the glasses over,

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:53.530
pinching the frame with your thumb and index
finger, pull apart, and twist in. These hazard's

00:00:53.530 --> 00:01:04.689
have a nice strong frame, with firm pressure
the damaged lens will pop out quite easily.

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:13.270
So once again, pinching the frame, pulling
out, and you can see I've made a little gap,

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:20.159
and pushing the lens out.
Then we get our new sunglass lens here from

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:28.950
the sunglass fix, start with the bottom outside
edge first and work our way up toward the

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:38.009
nose, more flexible part of the lens here.
So popping the outside corner in, and using

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:42.470
the same action of pulling the frame apart
and pushing the lens in.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:53.750
That has snapped in with no trouble at all.
Walk thumbs around to make sure it is in place.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:02:10.539
Repeating with the other side. Done.
When you order your replacement lenses, the

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:22.049
sunglass fix will send you a microfiber cloth
bag, to keep them well protected. Now you've

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:31.260
given your arnette hazards another life. So
wether your damaged sunglasses are this exact

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:37.349
model, the arnette hazard, or almost any other
sunglass, you can go to the sunglass fix .com

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.590
and get yourself some new sunglass lenses.
Enjoy!
