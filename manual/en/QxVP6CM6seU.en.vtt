00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.579
all right so we are two and a half hours into this turkey cook

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:11.410
been wrapped for about an hour now i
suspect

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.019
it's probably done

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.009
so we're going to pull this thing up

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:16.980
always use towels

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.019
I like towels towels are neat they keep you from burning your hands

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:22.849
uh... you can pick up brisket with them you can pick up other meats with them

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:24.079
you don't have to puncture meats

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:25.159
you don't have to do anything

00:00:25.159 --> 00:00:28.750
towels are great

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:30.829
smells good

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:31.980
looks pretty good

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.590
so we're 173.4 on the thigh

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.220
i'm callin this bird done

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:39.420
let it rest for about thirty minutes

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.739
and with the butter that's left in that pan im going to scoop it up and make a

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.739
rue for our gravy so I'll take this little guy inside

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.290
all right so we're going to let this turkey rest

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:56.910
gunna open it up a little bit

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.400
the important thing about turkey any any
meat for that matter

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.820
is you have got to let it rest as it's cooking

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.420
the muscles are tightening up they're
squeezeing up moisture

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.890
you need to get some of that moisture
back if you slice it while it's still raging hot

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.260
it's still kinda cooking, all the juices are going to run out its going to look awesome

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.230
but it's going to end up dry

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.950
twenty thirty minutes is about right for
turkey

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.310
if you look in here we just got a
ton of butter got all kinds of good

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.540
i'm going to use that butter to make a roux ive got a small saucier

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.670
and a roux

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.360
is the foundation

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.240
of so many french sauces

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.260
it's a perfect thing. this is what you'd make a gumbo out of or a gravey out of

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.820
shoot for the color kind of a hershey's milk
chocolate bar

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:43.210
the darker it is it'll have less thickening power but it'll taste a lot stronger

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.180
it'll taste really really good. so we're going to take a third cup flour to a third cup butter

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:53.190
hopefully get it in here, not burning anything

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.150
that looks really good, maybe we'll throw in extra

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:00.910
just loosly wrap that thing back up so it doesnt get too cool

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:03.200
im going to go with a pretty low heat

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.909
this stuff will burn really really easily 
so we're going to whisk it in really quickly

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:11.919
before the flower starts to clump 
it'll probably take about ten or fifteen minutes

00:02:11.919 --> 00:02:18.919
gotta keep it moving

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.099
so this color here this is perfect it
looks like melted chocolate

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:32.929
so i've got the roux finished it's exactly the color we want it

00:02:32.929 --> 00:02:35.999
this is where it gets pretty loose with 
gravy or sauces

00:02:35.999 --> 00:02:39.549
i'm going to sautee some onions in some of the
turkey butter before i put the roux in there

00:02:39.549 --> 00:02:42.669
and then i'm going to put a stock in there
you can make your own stock

00:02:42.669 --> 00:02:44.319
unfortunately I didnt have time so

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:51.319
im using a big thing of chicken stock

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.900
going to do almost a high heat here. medium to medium high

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.559
now that the butter's hot

00:02:57.559 --> 00:03:02.059
we're going to throw a small handful white onion finely chopped 
chopped

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:08.579
just going to sautee these things a little bit

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:12.039
so now that we got the onions ready to go im going to stir up the roux a bit because its

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:13.839
kinda settled a little bit

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:17.529
gonna pour that in there and im going to put three cups of

00:03:17.529 --> 00:03:21.199
chicken stock again i didn't have time
to make my own stock and that's

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:22.609
a little embarassing

00:03:22.609 --> 00:03:25.620
but that's just the way it is and that
is

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.979
a beautiful color

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:33.979
very exciting

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.649
now im going to add three cups of chicken stock

00:03:41.649 --> 00:03:45.939
oh yeah

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:48.959
got all the ingredients in here i'm going to bring it up to a boil and turn off the

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.920
heat and let the roux thicken it while it's cooling down

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:55.159
and at that point im going to season it with salt and pepper

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:02.159
I think it's going to be good

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.469
smells good looks good too

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:38.250
turkey's ready

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.539
happy thanksgiving yall

00:04:40.539 --> 00:04:46.479
hey get over here and eat

00:04:46.479 --> 00:04:46.889
