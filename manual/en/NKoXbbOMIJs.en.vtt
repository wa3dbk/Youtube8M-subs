Join us for a guided hike to the Burgess Shale in Yoho national Park

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000 position:75%
and spend a day with a Parks Canada interpreter.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000 position:97%
So one of the things that we'll see when we get up to the quarry

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000 position:81%
is we'll see a real amazing diversity of body plans.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000 position:98%
So we see creatures that were predators, creatures that would have been scavengers,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000 position:89%
creatures that were at the very bottom of the food chain,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000 position:80%
and animals with all kinds of defensive techniques.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:13.000 position:98%
A visit to the Burgess Shale is very special because you really get to be hands on with the rock,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:21.000 position:98%
to step into a little bit of history and see some spectacular fossils

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000 position:58%
and do it in a fantastic surrounding.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000 position:84%
I mean, one of the most beautiful spots on the planet.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000 position:70%
So the mountains are young but falling apart.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000 position:66%
But the Burgess Shale fossils are ancient.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000 position:97%
Half a billion years old and still perfectly preserved waiting for us to come and see.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
This is more than what I expected.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000 position:98%
I didn't really expect that much other than a long hike, but it has it's benefits

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000 position:92%
and it's definitely been nice to stop and enjoy the scenery

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000 position:97%
and especially to get up here and kind of look around for fossils and stuff like that.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000 position:98%
You really feel like you're doing something and you're not just behind a velvet rope,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000 position:88%
you're really touching and feeling it - it's really fun.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000 position:97%
I'm very surprised that there are so much and that they are so old and that you can see them everywhere.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000 position:91%
You just sit here and pick up a rock and there's a fossil.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000 position:98%
You just look here and there and, um, it's beyond what I thought it would be.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000 position:98%
It's amazing. It's almost humbling that this is almost half a billion years old

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000 position:88%
and it's still here and we can see it and experience it.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000 position:84%
And this is the start of life that's you and me today.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000 position:98%
You expect to see maybe half a dozen, and there are just everywhere, all the fossils.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.000 position:97%
