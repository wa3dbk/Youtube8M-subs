00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.560
 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:17.560
 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:25.010
 

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:34.420
 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.460
 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.460
 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.800
 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.350
 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.490
We were talking about Jerry Reed some,
you know your were talking about Reed and stuff like

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.340
that so

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.670
that's where I started my playing. My dad

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.450
played fingerstyle and I've always kept
that even though I've

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:07.900
just, you know I'm in sessions and do a
lot of different things I've always kept this

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.490
fingerstyle thumb picking thing. It was
pretty much thumb and first finger.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.159
You know

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.929
 

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:23.340
you know that kinda thing. That's where I
got it I was watching him

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.490
then he had bought some Chet Atkins - Jerry
Reed albums and then I heard the

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.200
song called the Claw.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.890
you know, Jerry Reed.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.900
 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.960
 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.660
 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:47.409
 

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:48.280
 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.280
 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.490
 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.030
 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.590
 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:12.330
 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:16.230
He asked me if I improvise a lot in the studio.
In Nashville they gives us a lot of

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:17.530
creative a room there.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.340
Our identity and character goes into a lot of those records.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.380
You know we come up with hook licks and
stuff and we all do.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.370
It is a guitar town. It seems like
they're all guitar intros

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:32.040
somehow the guitar

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:35.110
you know was the king of the hill there.

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.030
Well, takes - okay, well I like to do a solo

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.880
and then maybe three or four takes on a
solo

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.070
because I mean again like I was saying over  there's it's like a record. You know it

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.600
is a record, it's not like a record, it is a record you don't want to

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.709
spend 10 minutes on a quick
solo - You'll go home and go "gah" I'm going to hear this over and over

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:56.450
and I knew I could have played
this one cool thing

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:01.540
better. You know, I'll do different takes,
maybe four different tracks on a solo-

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.630
we'll cut the song, we'll go over the song maybe we'll cut two songs, maybe one song

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.280
a session, a three-hour session

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.760
two if it clicks. It's always
good to go with that

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.930
instinct you have on a song- you get the 
emotion from it right away.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.459
I find that you try to play things that
you already played that you liked on the

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.680
other one and you should have 
kept the other one so fix the other one more than anything.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.000
 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.860
 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.850
 

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.720
 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:39.720
 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:48.720
 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.000
 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.900
So its got a good reaction with
these pedals; that's a Wampler Hot Wired.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.290
You know there's so many distortion
pedals now but you know you got

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.840
Fuzz Face which is more like
the

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.560
you know, what Hendrix used and Eric
Johnson just

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.210
designed his own where there's little switches  
inside where you can add and take the high end and low end

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:10.590
and they're great pedals.

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.820
and then you've got the Plexi sounding ones
you know the one's that sound like Marshall

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.700
and then you've got the Tube
Screamer that have that nice warm

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:19.880
mid range. You've got different kinds you know,

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.990
this one's kind of a blend of that like a Tube
that it has that Plexi thing plus a little

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.420
mid-range thing and it's got a bass
boost on it-one thing that's really cool.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.330
If you're using an open back, you know sometimes you use a closed back you get that

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.920
push that

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.240
bass push out of a Marshall stack or
something and this one,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:41.590
you can flip the switch on normal or
if you're using a closed back like this you

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.340
can flip it on fatter and it gives you that

00:04:43.340 --> 00:04:48.100
push, you know that big bass push.

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:55.100
 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.720
 

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.590
 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:02.900
 

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:08.009
 

00:05:08.009 --> 00:05:13.670
and then this new ones got the clean
blend on it.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:16.729
 

00:05:16.729 --> 00:05:19.630
 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.950
 

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.190
 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:29.740
 

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:33.590
 

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:38.160
 

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:40.190
 

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.569
 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:46.649
 

00:05:46.649 --> 00:05:53.649
Thank You!

00:05:58.949 --> 00:05:59.199
