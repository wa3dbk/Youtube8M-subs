Hi! I’m Tracy Tenner with Better Behavior
Dog Training here at Extra Care Animal Hospital

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.530
in Davie, Florida. We’re here on behalf
of expertvillage.com and we’re going to

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.460
be teaching you how to teach your dogs tricks.
The next trick or command we’re going to

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.290
show you is a little command called wait.
Wait is the command that requires the dog

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.780
wait for permission before crossing a thresh
hole, stepping off a curb, walking out the

00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:33.480
front door or crossing a street. This is also
a command that can save your dogs life in

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.629
a real situation. So Sarah’s going to walk
by with Ed to the closed door and ask him

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:44.600
to wait as she opens the door, she’ll step
in and then allow Ed to come in behind her.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:56.769
Let’s give it a shot, walking to the door,
open the door with a command “wait” we

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:03.499
see that Ed waits and then when Sarah calls
him in then he comes in, good boy. This is

00:01:03.499 --> 00:01:07.820
not only a great trick but it also teaches
your dog not to dart out into traffic which

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:19.610
is very, very important. Let’s try that
one again Sarah if we can please!

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.240
Walking through Sarah gets to the door, brings
him right up to the door and ask him to wait,

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.050
you notice Sarah’s inside Ed is out and
when he is released he goes right out the

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:36.420
door on command where he’s nice and save
and Sarah has already scoped it out so that

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.060
we know he’s not going to get in trouble
in that room or out the front door. And that

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:43.950
command again is called wait, well we hope
that you’ve learned a lot about teaching

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.530
your dogs tricks today and if you would like
any further information you can contact us

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:56.300
