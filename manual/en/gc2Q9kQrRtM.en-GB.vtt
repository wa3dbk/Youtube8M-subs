Hi.. assalamualaikum wrt wbt!

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.820
today.. I'm going to make an unboxing video 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.220
of my new smartphone..

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.200
that is, iPhone6 and iPhone6 Plus!

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:13.840
so, let's do this unboxing together..

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.560
this video was recorded on the 6th November 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.000
on the first day

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:53.920
when the iPhone6 and iPhone6 Plus were officially released all over Malaysia

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.520
the moment I opened this box was such an excitement..

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.580
just like a kid opened her birthday present box

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.960
okay, here we are.. the iPhone6..

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.220
for this 6th generation series of this iPhone

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.420
the Apple company ventured on iPhone6 and iPhone6 Plus..

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.460
to replace the previous model that are iPhone5s and iPhone5C

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.360
besides the size is bigger than the previous model

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.260
that is 4.7 inches for iPhone6 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.780
and 5.5 inches for iPhone6 Plus

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.980
this iPhone6 series is also thinner than before

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.300
and of course they come with A8 processor capacity which is much faster 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.500
haa.. this is how it looks inside these iPhone6 and iPhone6 Plus boxes ..

00:01:58.075 --> 00:02:00.075
let's see what we have inside ..

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.400
so .. here is our new iPhone6

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:11.380
as usual, we are given the usb cable ..

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.320
3-pinned-socket.. adapter for cable charger ..

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.520
a pair of earphones ..

00:02:21.983 --> 00:02:25.383
and also the manual and warranty card ..

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.500
and yes, the sticker ..

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.240
eventhough iPhone5s was once said have the most effective size

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:38.760
for one-handed use

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.240
however, the new feature put on this iPhone6

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.120
and iPhone6 Plus

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.340
give user the ability of one-handed use

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.740
eventhough their sizes is much bigger!

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.500
now.. first let's see the difference between iPhone5 and iPhone6

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:58.780
the size is for sure different

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.360
which iPhone6 is bigger than iPhone5

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.280
much thinner ..

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.200
and one more different is ..

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.300
the restart button 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.000
i.e the on/off button for iPhone5 is on the top right corner

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.500
while for iPhone6

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.880
the on/off button is on the right side ..

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:24.920
