00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:07.339
Spring has a habit of being a
pricey time of year

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:10.259
thanks to all those seeds and equipment that have to be purchased.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.400
Thankfully, seed pots needn't add to the shopping bill.

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:20.260
It's easy to make your own from nothing more than egg trays, toilet tubes, and newspaper.

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.080
In this video we'll show you how.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.120
Newspaper pots are easy to make,

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.780
and like all of these
home-made seed starter pots

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.900
they're environmentally friendly as well
as free.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.200
All you need is an old newspaper, some scissors, and a jar, which will act as your mold.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.140
It's important to only use newspaper for your pots.

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.229
It rots down quicker than glossy magazine
paper,

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:47.529
and is less likely to contain ink with traces of toxic heavy metals.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.180
Prepare your newspaper by cutting it into strips about an inch (3cm) taller than your jar.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.120
With your strips stacked up, you're ready to roll.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.780
Begin making a newspaper pot

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.240
by folding a flap along the length of
a strip, like this.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.740
Now unfold the flap to leave a crease.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.000
Take your jar and place it at one end of the strip

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.480
so that the open end sticks out.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.160
Tightly roll the strip around the jar.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.240
Holding the paper closed, turn the jar on its end

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.700
and fold the loose ends of the paper like this to create the base.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.830
Push down, and pinch along the edges to
firm them up.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.460
Now, holding the bottom flaps, 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.140
pull out the jar, firm up the base,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.600
then fold it along the crease to create
the rim of your pot.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.080
And there we go - a newspaper pot! 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.260
Don't worry if the pot looks a little wobbly -

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.780
once they're filled with potting soil they
become much more stable

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.100
Nestling your pots side by side within a
tray like this

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.660
will help them to remain secure as the
paper becomes saturated.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:03.780
By using different size jars, you can create a range of different pots tailored to different seedlings.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.420
When it's time to plant your seedlings out,

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.750
simply dig a suitable sized hole
into prepared ground

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.770
and plant the pot as it is.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.770
There's no need to unpeel the newspaper - 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.820
it will completely biodegrade within a
matter of weeks.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.840
Toilet paper tubes make ideal seed pots.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.160
Cut them in half for standard seedlings,
or leave whole for those seedlings such as

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.180
peas, corn and tomatoes that appreciate a
longer root run.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.940
You could also use paper towels tubes
cut down to the right length.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.960
Set your tubes within trays so that
the potting soil doesn't fall out at the bottom.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.080
As the seedlings grow, their roots will
help to hold the potting soil together.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.740
Just like our newspaper pots, positioning
the tubes side by side like this

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.280
gets additional strength as the cardboard
soaks up moisture and softens.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.360
You could also group pots together with
string or rubber bands.

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.100
To create a bottom to your cardboard pot,

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.130
cut 4 inch-long slits into one end of the tube

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.820
at 12, 3, 6 and 9 o'clock.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.780
Fold the flaps down like the end of a
cardboard box,

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.790
alternating the tucks to create a strong interlocking base.

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.160
You're now ready to fill with potting soil, and sow.

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.560
Cardboard tubes are slower to
rot down than newspaper.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.780
Roots will find their own way out of the
pot,

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.300
but if you prefer you can peel off the cardboard before planting.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.680
This is very easy to do
when the cardboard's wet.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:40.000
Using cardboard egg trays for seed sowing is
undoubtedly the easiest method of all.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.760
Simply cut off the lid, then place it
underneath the base for extra strength.

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.700
Fill the compartments with potting soil,
pressing down with your fingertips to firm.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.780
Than moisten with a mister, and that's it - you're ready to sow!

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:55.520
Due to their smaller size,

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:59.340
the roots of some crops will soon
become constricted in egg trays,

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.940
so use them for starting off crops that will
quickly be moved on or planted out.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:08.200
When sowing, be guided by the
instructions on the seed packet

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.029
which will tell you how deep to set the
seeds.

00:04:11.029 --> 00:04:14.049
Sow one or two seeds per cell or pot.

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.989
You can either create holes to the correct depth using a pointed tool such as a skewer, 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.569
sow, then backfill, 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.880
or sow the seeds before
covering with more potting soil to the right depth.

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.240
Egg tray cells are very easy to separate once they're wet.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.940
Just tear the cells apart, then rip away the base to help the roots escape into the ground.

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.160
Growing your own vegetables from seed
will save you a lot of money,

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:46.349
and making your own pots from paper and
cardboard will save even more.

00:04:46.349 --> 00:04:50.539
It's a great way of reusing materials you'll
almost certainly have lying around

00:04:50.539 --> 00:04:53.039
and its environmentally-friendly.
