00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:04.970
now it's time for the first in
submission this was sent to us by high

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.980
school student by the name of shine from
this very and he actually asked the

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.440
question about the transition from high
school to college are and i think we can

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.980
give us some pretty good advice about
this let's watch i've been wondering how

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.119
you make that transition

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:21.599
from smart high school kids

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:23.960
never has to study at all

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.989
to college kids and has to study all the
time because i hear all the time of kids

00:00:28.989 --> 00:00:32.550
that burn out when they get the college
because it's so used everything coming

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:34.180
easy

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.920
that uh... they just can't just

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.070
uh... do you have any advice nights
analysis and reporting to us for forrest

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.260
defending his championship hanoi's i
don't know how and why is that i just

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.190
made that up but i dont like that was
some potent created by guess i could say

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.670
it was a care about this on the
likelihood

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.390
inside information included danielle
economies are being in a manner at some

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.549
actually love that question i think it's
a good question and it's something that

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:04.350
i personally struggled with in my first
year of college

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.340
idea until as well as i thought i would
do in college in my first

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:09.560
and it is because

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.040
you you transition from high school
which in my opinion was to reason still

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.649
college where you actually have to do a
significant amount of radio killed read

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:18.299
this

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.290
uh... i guess

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.000
and to ask not answer and as a personal
question how much agrees not people

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.300
don't like as a

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.430
you what was your idea of not doing

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.290
my time before old zero three eight oh
my god now i think that and i'm guessing

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:36.150
here and and i think i mean life and
myself 'cause i think it might have been

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.359
a little higher than this

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:43.029
but and for some reason remember three
point two wishes that's unseen and a few

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:47.099
days it is and it because i want i went
from graduating with and for those of

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:48.710
the plane in high school

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.000
i have a perfect four point oh something
as the hospital as i have but how how

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:53.890
long

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:54.540
didn't have

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.630
and my i do remember the first and
contemplate she's actually have to spend

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.869
time standing you can't just go in the
lectures and you will on the test you

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.810
have to do your own independent study

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.399
yeah right went on and don't listen to
what the professors say because the

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.680
professors say that for every hour of
lecture initiative three hours of

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.720
studying done certain fiascoes all
depends on the glove subject depends on

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.299
your major inside things are going to
get into

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:23.789
but i think his lab limits with my
expenses for the different time which is

00:02:23.789 --> 00:02:25.240
why you can't take this

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:28.949
for what it's worth a million if that
was coming from

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:31.330
the professors are going to teach you
everything

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.599
that's visits will be what you think you
won't find yourself which

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.400
which is was goes to what you were
saying about the need to study a yeltsin

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.749
had been so u what you need to get to

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:44.599
and then new ways you can get to it with
and i can tell you where to go and read

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.889
this volcano siri bills for shabbos and
do the things that and have to get their

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.309
i'll come back with something for me to
make sense

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:55.189
yet to be a part of m_s_ were actual
high school for acting

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:59.139
i don't know i i don't really remember
sending has the will of college sites

00:02:59.139 --> 00:03:03.089
it's different because you need to take
notes during your lecture classes

00:03:03.089 --> 00:03:06.750
identity notes during lecture is a
million times more important

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.099
and actually reading that textbook in
pens during a lecture the professor is

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.439
basically telling you

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.489
this is what will be on the test

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:20.369
answered still question number one is
being is all of that easy just pay

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:22.639
session a lecture take as many notes as
you can

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:26.079
when i take notice shorthand that's the
most important thing we need to learn

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:31.249
college anderson answer you'll do fine
you'll find a precedent pulled back if

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:34.489
it is different and unified professes
that one

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:35.549
it seems like

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:36.709
that is wrong to say

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:38.329
that what you fail

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:42.379
yeah those defenses activists ovalbumin
cryptic and things they say or the know

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.519
make things harder on you know first
place

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:47.679
uh... just so you may be up to figure
out do they want to think that they're

00:03:47.679 --> 00:03:48.659
trying to teach you

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:50.220
how to get around their hurdles

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.730
previn to get to the import

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:56.439
and that it was unbearable thing if you
know furthering my professor dot com

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.530
while almost immediately identify
professor as being shady okay so

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.659
check that out before you sign up for
classes i did that there was a really

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:08.200
help us old era classes that i avoided
because their work there are professors

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.079
like that like they get some sort of
thrill out of making their class like

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.189
this year's obstacle course that's
impossible to pass

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.949
so just as a research i a professors to
write before you actually role further

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:22.610
costs event is that i think partially
one from

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:25.199
start bypass with the physician breezed
through

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:26.509
their classes from

00:04:26.509 --> 00:04:28.460
you know they probably

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.559
through the business does a lawyer

00:04:30.559 --> 00:04:34.589
is easy continued to be on the receipt
of himself we had to take those classes

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:37.739
even if it's good to have you know
there's a lot of things on the how much

00:04:37.739 --> 00:04:39.930
we upjohn but

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.060
you know this is just

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:45.110
take what you know and applied to past
and don't expect to get anything and t
