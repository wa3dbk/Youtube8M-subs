Come down! Come down!

00:00:35.432 --> 00:00:42.679
Dr. Essam Sharaf, its shameful of you 
to ignore your fellow university professors

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:48.807
We are asking you to come down 
now to listen to their demands,

00:00:48.807 --> 00:00:52.742
..or else there will be a revolution beginning 
at the start of the academic year

00:00:52.742 --> 00:00:55.951
We are standing here 
outside the Cabinet building

00:00:55.951 --> 00:00:58.526
We were attending the faculty members' conference

00:01:08.763 --> 00:01:10.066

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.241

00:01:11.241 --> 00:01:14.617
4)For demonstrators and assistant lecturers 
to be given permanent positions as staff members

00:01:14.617 --> 00:01:18.550
Where are you Field Marshal? 
Dr. Khorshed is standing between us

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:25.616

Mohamed al-Awady, Spokesman
University Faculty Members Youth Union

00:01:28.556 --> 00:01:31.067
5000 faculty members have declared..

00:01:31.067 --> 00:01:33.827
..their refusal of the 
announced electioral process 

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:37.706
The main revolution demand 
was reform of the educational system,

00:01:37.706 --> 00:01:38.944
..changing the corrupt leaders, 

00:01:38.944 --> 00:01:41.473
the educational system will not improve 
while they are in their positions

00:01:41.473 --> 00:01:43.177
Adopting respectable electoral mechanisms..

00:01:43.177 --> 00:01:44.873
We didn't demand salary raises,

00:01:44.873 --> 00:01:48.585
..we demanded a 3-4 year plan 
in which salaries are increased..

00:01:48.585 --> 00:01:50.994
..to allow for a respectable living

00:01:50.994 --> 00:01:52.753
During the conference, 
the demands were determined..

00:01:52.753 --> 00:01:55.600
..and we came here to the cabinet building 
to present them to Essam Sharaf..

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:59.096
..to tell him that [these are the demands] 
of the university community, 

00:01:59.096 --> 00:02:02.064
..which he is a part of and since 
he understands its problems

00:02:02.064 --> 00:02:07.120
Where are the changes oh Field Marshal?

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:16.643

We are standing outside of Parliament 
and the Cabinet building..

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.658

which they will not waive

00:02:30.034 --> 00:02:36.632
