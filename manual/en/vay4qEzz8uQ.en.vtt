Hello, my name is Claire and I study German, and English also, at Carleton University.

00:00:22.412 --> 00:00:29.412
The Japanese program at Carleton is really diverse, the way they teach it encompasses various forms of learning, 

00:00:29.412 --> 00:00:34.600
So you do things like skits, where you get to speak and listen to other people performing, which is really fun. 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.140
You have writing assignments, where you're focusing on the writing aspect,

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.260
And you have listening exercises and that.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:43.440
My professors sometimes bring Spanish speaking people, 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.560
It makes you feel a little bit like you are already in the country,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.383
and you can't speak English at all and you have to just speak in Spanish.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:58.560
My name is Victoria, I study Applied Linguistics and Discourse Studies, and Spanish at the University of Carleton.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.780
We are interested more in teaching them how to use the language in actual situations,

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.220
Rather than just memorizing words and grammar.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.000
The best part about my professor, for German especially, is that because she's from Germany, 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:18.220
when you have any questions about the culture, she knows the answers.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.260
As with many of my colleagues here that teach Modern Languages, 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:23.700
we have an approach that is what you would call learner centered.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.900
He's fully invested in, not only teaching the language, and getting people into the language, 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.160
but encouraging them to use it, and get better at it. 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.120
It's given me a whole level of confidence that I didn't have before,

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.640
Getting past the barrier of actually learning a language, and putting myself out there, 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.980
I used to be shy, I used to sit at the back of the class, I used to hide, ASL changed all of that. 

00:01:54.426 --> 00:01:58.386
I really would recommend it because even if you do go to Germany, yes the people speak English,  

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.120
But it's so much more freeing, and its so much more exciting if you can speak in their own language, 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.700
Even if you do get it wrong, they do appreciate you trying.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:15.100
Languages are to convey ideas, through learning the language they don't just see how the language is, but the people themselves.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.680
Language is like a mirror, to see others.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:31.600
So, I'm Rebecca McArthur and I am studying Japanese at Carleton University.
