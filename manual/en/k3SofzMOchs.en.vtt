00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.030
[oh]

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.860
Wait, what? What is this?

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:10.710
oh no, [Kiteman] hey what's going on?

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:18.449
[IHE] Really? [Kiteman] what is it? [IHE] it appears in our search for a new background, We've somehow wound up in Minecraft! Damn it

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.758
I was hoping to do an episode on cardboard Tube dueling, but I guess I have no choice, but to cover Minecraft now... fuck...

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.340
Minecraft the game where you... where the objective is to...

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.030
Where you have to?

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.670
No...

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.219
Ok Minecraft is a game. It's a game where you... No, fuck it

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.809
Minecraft is one of the biggest hits in gaming from the last few years and whether you like it or not the

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.940
influence it has on gaming culture is

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:03.718
astronomical, with the lifetime sales just about to surpass 50 million units, there has to be something to this game,

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.969
right? and let me just get out there. I... I really like Minecraft.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.400
HUEY, FUKE YU, YUR TITTLE SES YU H9 M9CARFT YU GAHDEM BCH UNSUEB!!!11!!1!!!!!!!11!!1! &gt;:(

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.819
I will admit when Minecraft was this relatively small an upcoming game, I was one of the people who said "I don't get it."

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:25.109
Because I didn't!  From an outsider's perspective, of course you're gonna react that way.

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.519
Primarily because when someone describes the idea to you, it does sound kind of boring.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.639
Minecraft. The Indie game with no objective where you're placed into an Endless Sandbox and expected to do...

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.979
something. but when I finally got my hands on it, the puzzle pieces finally fit into place,

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:44.130
And it was made abundantly clear to me.  It's lego.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.320
It's virtual Lego.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.610
And I love me some Lego.  you might say there's no point to spending hours and building a Minecraft castle or mining for Diamond

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.379
But really, how is any different than building a house or helms deep out of Lego?  The thing is, to me

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.050
Minecraft is not a game. It's a tool you choose what you want to do with it

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.449
and that's the Magic behind it. But here's the thing.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.739
Anyone can pick up a hammer and use it, anyone can use a tool.  And this... this is where my problems of Minecraft Lie.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.470
You're probably sick of me saying this sort of thing by now, but there is nothing fundamentally wrong with Minecraft!

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:25.319
There's nothing wrong with the tool. IT IS THE FANBASE THAT USE IT.  Much like Facebook, deviantart,

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:32.729
whatever! there is a Minecraft subculture that is completely out of fucking control millions of YouTube accounts avatars videos twitch streams

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.099
Merchandising parodies the capital and exposure that Minecraft has drives me freaking insane

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.229
I like to preach how it's nearly impossible to [Avoid] my little Pony but in comparison to

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:48.059
[Minecraft] my little pony is just a tiny blip in the endless sea of stylized Blocky Minecraft

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.959
I am so so [burn] out on Minecraft at this point

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.679
I'm not even played it [for] a good year [or] two the [overexposure] is just too much

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.650
And while I find it fascinating that the whole reason Minecraft is so popular is thanks to [Youtube] at the same time?

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:09.119
The [YouTube] Minecraft culture is seizure-inducing. I'm sorry there is not even one Minecraft Central [YouTube] account I can even stand

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.739
To me they all just follow a similar formula play Minecraft scream

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:21.239
Then laugh about it actually I guess that's every gaming YouTube channel in the end though. I'm so burnt out

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:25.529
I can't even come up with a conclusion that makes any sense. So here's my summary backwards

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.399
Seola's [ish] still a blessing [are] wanger gift for this animosity

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.850
We're just having us a [few] tears nicer ones it d good no one out. This is nice here onesie Nick

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:39.539
You know [we'll] now as me I'll be like Mr.. [Schiavelli], not one, scintilla

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.319
So those are my thoughts on [Minecraft]

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:49.619
So please tell me what you think if you're a huge [Minecraft] fan and like a bunch of the Minecraft based Youtube accounts

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.859
Please drop a comment and explain to me why I would love to hear it so as always thanks for watching

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.580
All comments [and] ratings are appreciated. I'll see you next time. Bye

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.500
Seriously a goddamn plane had to fly right over my house as I was recording this damn one damn part

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.240
There's another there's God damn another one

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:20.340
You serious. I can't record all it. There's gonna be a plane. No audio forget about it

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:29.190
