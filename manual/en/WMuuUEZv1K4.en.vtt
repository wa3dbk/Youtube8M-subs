00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:05.920
So we now have our
panel all powered up,

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:08.150
everything connected,
our keypad installed.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.920
So what we're going to do
now is address our keypad.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:15.550
Any Honeywell Vista Series panel
that's going to use a wired

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:19.570
keypad, the keypad needs to
be addressed before it works.

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.890
We get calls all the time,
people telling us hey,

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.761
my keypad's not working,
my screen is blank,

00:00:23.761 --> 00:00:24.760
my connections are good.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.070
Not sure what's wrong.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.980
And they have not
addressed the keypad.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:32.170
So keypads come with a default
address of 31, for some reason.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:36.430
31 is an unaddressed address,
so it doesn't do anything.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.180
So basically, the first
keypad you have when you power

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.870
your system up, you have
to address it to 16.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.530
16 is the default address of
the system as a keypad address.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.110
There are other
available addresses.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.000
Once we get one
online, we can then

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.480
enable the rest of
the addresses and have

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:57.220
other keypads hooked up.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:01.040
But for now, this is going to
be our only console keypad.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.690
We do have a tuxedo, but
that's a whole other story that

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.320
uses AUI addresses.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.360
So what we're going to do
is the panel is all ready,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.587
it's powered down right now.

00:01:10.587 --> 00:01:12.170
I have my assistant
in the other room.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.290
On my word, he's
going to plug it in.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.070
And the way to address a keypad
is as soon as you power on,

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.690
you have up to 60
seconds to do this.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.170
So it's important that
you do it very quickly.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:25.300
You're going to press
and hold 1 and 3.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.450
The keypad will come on
with Con Address Equals,

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.810
and we're going to switch it to
16 and get it up and running.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.530
So if my assistant
would be so kind

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.690
as to plug in the transformer.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.200
Thank you.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.600
And we are now going to
press and hold 1 and 3.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.815
Con Address, you can
see it says equals 31.

00:01:46.815 --> 00:01:48.640
We're going to set it 16.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:51.700
And then star
confirms the address.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.950
It's going to ask if we
want the voice chime.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.000
We do want it on, so we're
going to leave it on.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.083
We're going to press star.

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.125
Keep that star.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:12.900
Busy standby.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.000
This is the normal screen
when you're booting up.

00:02:17.476 --> 00:02:18.600
I'll give it a minute here.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.360
Any time you power your
system down and power back up,

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.132
the keypad will show this
once it's been addressed.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.170
Takes a minute or so to go away.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.820
And we can now see,
system shows disarmed.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.660
Hit star for false.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.440
We've got also a check
103 long range radio.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.460
That's our internet device
that we have enabled.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:53.710
That's why it's beeping at us.

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.230
If we press star,
it'll silence it.

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:57.910
And you can see the check 103.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:00.225
If we press star, we'll
also see all of our faults.

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:04.830
We have a fault on zone 8.

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:11.840
So I'll have to look at
his own and see what kind

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:13.100
of resistor value we have.

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.050
I imagine I may
have made a mistake

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.670
and put the wrong resistor.

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:21.570
The rest of the zones are happy,
though, so that's a good sign.

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:27.050
So that is how you address a
Honeywell Vista Series keypad.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.045
This is a 6160V.

00:03:29.045 --> 00:03:30.890
It gives the voice enunciation.

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.430
Once we program our zones,
we can show you that.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:39.252
This is our keypad
fully installed.
