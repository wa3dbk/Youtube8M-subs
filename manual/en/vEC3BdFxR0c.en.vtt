00:00:01.968 --> 00:00:07.674
Last week, I said that I am still young enough that if I wanted to, I could climb Mount Everest. 

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:12.946
Obviously not tomorrow - I have nothing like the skills or the fitness, and anyway I've got a drinks do in the evening. 

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:18.284
I mean, I could probably push it back a bit, but I gather climbing Mount Everest is generally an all-day-thing. 

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:26.926
But my point was that if I had a certain sort of mid-life crisis, I reckon I could still acquire the skills, do the training, and climb Mount Everest. 

00:00:26.926 --> 00:00:33.266
After all, anyone seems to be able to climb it these days: Brian Blessed, people in wheelchairs, nuns, toddlers. 

00:00:33.266 --> 00:00:38.738
I can only put the fact that Everest was not climbed until 1953 down to rightful indifference.

00:00:38.738 --> 00:00:42.342
I mean, I can't see the point of it. It's shrouded in cloud. 

00:00:42.342 --> 00:00:49.082
 So I suppose that's why people are interested to climb it: 'There's the tallest thing in the world, I wonder if I can get to the top and not die? 

00:00:49.082 --> 00:00:53.620
And I bet there's a hell of a view. Of the other side of the cloud that's obscuring the summit.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.923
It's a natural human impulse, though not one I share. 

00:00:56.923 --> 00:01:00.493
 What I cannot understand is why people run marathons. 

00:01:00.493 --> 00:01:07.133
Why is the difficult but unnecessary act of jogging 26 and a bit miles accorded special reverence? 

00:01:07.133 --> 00:01:12.005
Why, if you wanted for whatever personal reasons to prove to yourself you can do something so difficult 

00:01:12.005 --> 00:01:17.110
would you choose to do it in the midst of tens of thousands of others doing exactly the same thing,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.248
and thus graphically demonstrating how unremarkable your nonetheless exhausting feat is? 

00:01:22.248 --> 00:01:29.656
And what is the connection between you deciding you want to get fit in this particular way, and me giving money to charity?

00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:36.629
Let me make it clear that getting fit is basically a good thing, I suppose, and giving money to charity certainly is. 

00:01:36.629 --> 00:01:41.301
I just don't see the connection. If you are raising the money in order to be allowed to run the marathon 

00:01:41.301 --> 00:01:46.372
- because I believe with the London marathon at least you have to show that a certain amount has been raised to be able to take part 

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:51.044
- then why are you asking me to indirectly pay for your new fitness regime?

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:57.484
If, on the other hand, you're running the marathon to raise money for charity, isn't this a terribly inefficient way of doing it? 

00:01:57.484 --> 00:02:02.422
How many runners can honestly say that they've raised more in sponsorship than they would 

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:09.062
if they'd spent all the hours of training and running doing extra work at a temp agency? Or hooking?

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:17.403
And you could boost that by getting your friends to sponsor it: they could pay extra for every letter you correctly file or businessman you fellate. 

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:22.575
I'm sorry, that's disgusting. I mean, businessperson you fellate or go down on. 

00:02:22.575 --> 00:02:28.281
Then there'd be earned money on top of given money: sponsorship for a marathon isn't really earned 

00:02:28.281 --> 00:02:34.187
because running 26 miles, difficult though it is, is not a service than any of your sponsors actually require.

00:02:34.187 --> 00:02:37.757
The only person who requires that activity to happen is the runner 

00:02:37.757 --> 00:02:41.828
who has arbitrarily picked it as a physical challenge in order to reboot their life. 

00:02:41.828 --> 00:02:46.132
So, while in the short term it looks like exhaustion and pain in aid of a cause, 

00:02:46.132 --> 00:02:53.706
what it actually is is a sense of achievement and a valuable life-experience for which your friends are expected to both pay and congratulate you.

00:02:53.706 --> 00:03:00.113
Of course in fact, most people run marathons not because they're selfish, but because they feel the need to 'do something'. 

00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:02.482
To honour the memory of someone they've lost, 

00:03:02.482 --> 00:03:06.386
to raise money to try to stop whatever happened to them ever happening to anyone else, 

00:03:06.386 --> 00:03:08.855
or just to respond to a an unjust world. 

00:03:08.855 --> 00:03:13.393
And there's nothing cathartic about moonlighting as a temp, let alone turning tricks. 

00:03:13.393 --> 00:03:17.096
So a marathon is a devotional thing, basically - a penance.

00:03:17.096 --> 00:03:22.735
A secular ritual we've established, but unsubstantiated by anyone having cooked up a religion around it.

00:03:22.735 --> 00:03:25.171
But if it helps, then, I suppose, fair enough. 

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:31.945
On the other hand, those chancers who want sponsorship to walk the Great Wall of China or go cycling in Vietnam can get lost. 

00:03:31.945 --> 00:03:35.048
You don't get sponsored to go on holiday.
