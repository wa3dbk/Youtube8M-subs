00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:09.420
&gt;&gt; W: A computer at the University of Reading
passed the Turing Test? Don�t know what

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:13.179
the Turing test is? What�re you some type
of person with a life? Let us tell you.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:16.850
&gt;&gt; M: The Turing test is a test of a machine�s
capability to exhibit intelligent behavior

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:22.140
that is indistinguishable from that of a human.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.679
&gt;&gt; W: So we�ve advanced computers far enough
that they�re able to convince people that

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.640
they are actually� People. So I�d like
to take this moment to be the very first person

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.500
to state: The Revolution Is Here. We all gon�
die by the cold dead hands, or should I say,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.190
extended USB cables of the machine.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.050
&gt;&gt; M: Now that they can �think� what�s
stopping them from doing the murder?

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.100
&gt;&gt; W: I just want to know who�s going to
be the first person to fall in love with a

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.420
computer.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.750
&gt;&gt; M: People already do that now!

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:50.550
&gt;&gt; W: No, I want to see who�s the first
person to get cheated on by a computer because

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.129
there�s someone else the computer likes
more! They should make a movie about! They�ll

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.459
call it Her 2: Him!

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:56.440
&gt;&gt; M: You haven�t seen Her have you?

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.809
&gt;&gt; W: Nope. Strangely, in order for a computer
to pass the Turing test it has to convince

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.789
at least 30 percent of the judges that is,
in fact a non-computer person but duly and

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.030
surely a person-person.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.830
&gt;&gt; M: 33% of the judges were convinced that
instead of talking to a fake non-person-person

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.220
that they were talking to real life, flesh
and blood person, who they believed was a

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.190
13-year old boy named Eugene.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.820
&gt;&gt; W: Why is it that every time someone thinks
they�re talking to a 13-year old boy on

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.150
the internet it turns out they�re kind of
stupid? First of all people should have known

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.640
this wasn�t a real person because there
isn�t a single 13 year old boy named Eugene

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.200
in the entire world.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.480
&gt;&gt; M: This isn�t 1937! You�ll get beat
up if your name is Eugene!

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.690
&gt;&gt; W: Pretty much everybody named Eugene,
Earnest or Mable are all dead.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.020
&gt;&gt; M: Except for the software engineer Eugene
Demchenko who created the program with fellow

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.270
software engineer Vladimir Veselov. Who hope
that the program will do more than just fool

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.010
people to their inevitable doom, but help
stop computer crime.

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:50.280
&gt;&gt; W: Others claim that Eugene is not the
first robot to pass the test including the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.100
Cleverbot website, which is hilarious to be
on when you�re home alone don�t ask me

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.560
how I know.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.220
&gt;&gt; M: Do you think having a computer fast
enough to mimic human intelligence is awesome

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.759
or scary?

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.970
&gt;&gt; W: Would you be best friends with a robot
or do you have real friends? Let us know in

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:07.970
the comments down below?
