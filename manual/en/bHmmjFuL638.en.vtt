00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:07.930
A: The lob is an effective shot in tennis.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:08.930
What is it?

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.400
It's a ball where you're trying to hit the
ball substantially high in the air perhaps

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.980
over a net player's head or perhaps just to
make someone in the back court have a difficult

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.949
time with a high bouncing ball.

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.430
Generally there are two types of lobs, defensive
lobs and offensive lobs.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:31.180
A defensive lob you would hit when you're
chased off the court and your opponent perhaps

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.510
has come forward and you're in trouble.

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:39.559
The logic is send it high, buy some time to
get back in the court, and try to reset yourself.

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.579
The offensive lob is a whole different animal.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.440
Someone's come to the net against you.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.749
He thinks you're going to hit a driving passing
shot, and you cross him up by brushing up

00:00:50.749 --> 00:00:53.050
a lob hitting it over his head.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.879
If that ball gets over his head he's done.

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:00.979
He's done because an offensive lob is hit
with top spin where you create a tremendous

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:03.149
amount of rotation on the ball.

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.030
You hit it very high over your opponent's
head.

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.880
And when it bounces it's ungettable, because
when it bounces it takes off.

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.729
A defensive lob doesn't have top spin.

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:18.450
It's simply a desperation shot that you try
to get over your opponent's head, so that

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.439
it doesn't have any spin but you have a lot
of control over it.

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:25.700
You hit it very high, but when it bounces
it takes a very lazy bounce.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.310
It bounces almost straight up.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.859
So, often a net man can run back and get a
defensive lob after it bounces.

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:38.109
But the key is to try to make them run back
and hit a ball when they're running backwards

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:40.189
rather than having them hit an overhead.

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:43.830
So, a lob you want to get over your opponent's
head.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.090
Think twice about hitting lobs from the middle
of the court.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:52.109
If you happen to hit a poor lob you might
want to check how paid up your life insurance

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:53.109
is.

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:57.060
So, usually you'll use the lob when you're
behind the baseline and you have a little

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.289
time to handle a well hit overhead.

00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:05.679
B: I tell my students, I rarely use superlatives,
but I tell them never lob a short ball unless

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:08.600
your opponent is basically draped over the
net.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.760
Because it's very hard to control a lob from
a short position.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.330
You basically want to be behind the baseline
when you execute a lob.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:17.170
That's what a lob is all about.
