Brazil, United States, Australia, New Zealand,

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:39.489

the project has success because

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.960
is having maintenance at all times
all the time we are fixing things

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.539
we are developing new features that people
need

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:51.230
the new Apple's iPhone platforms are supported
as soon they're out in the market the have

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.879
a very simple design the people likes
it is not so hard to understand

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.789
and it's fast, does the things that has to
do, it's efficient

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.280
Which games does Cocos2D

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:08.980
some famous for example
Farmville witch is the most popular game ever

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.080
made by Zynga

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.390

using Cocos2D
there is some

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.610
How was Cocos2D created

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.750
Basically with some friends
we used to make always mini-games for a programming

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.660
competition in python we had to make a game
in one week

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.700
we may made 3,4,5 games we always re-type
the code

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.030
we always started the menu systems, the
sprites sections

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.210
and one day we said we got all gathered in
a programming camping

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.270
Bro, if we do a framework to do games, so
we don't to

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.190
do again, well do it,
and from there, all the ideas that we had

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.240
making those mini-games
we turned into this framework

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.800
what do you advised to the ones that wants
to start with Cocos2D

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:02.750
