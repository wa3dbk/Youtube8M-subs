Hey everybody!  This is Randy Santel, "Atlas" with Atlas &amp; Zeus Promotions

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.500
and proud owner of FoodChallenges.com

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.969
Today I'm going for my first slider burger challenge win!  I'm going for win

00:00:23.613 --> 00:00:30.333
#191.  I'm in East Village of New York City at Mark's Burgers taking on their Slider Record Challenge!

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.320
My friend Ramsey "The Mantis" Hilton did 28 sliders back in January, so I have to eat 29 to win.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.175
I've got 15 here. I learned the hard way a while back that you only need to order them as you go

00:00:47.175 --> 00:00:50.360
and you don't want them getting cold.  We have 15 here and then go on from there.

00:00:53.348 --> 00:00:58.548
If I win and break the record I will get them all free and be on their Wall of Fame!

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:01.420
Lets get win #191!

00:01:18.133 --> 00:01:23.653
They got a rule I don't like!  I can't stand.  I have to sit and can't kneel or anything.

00:01:23.653 --> 00:01:27.435
There's no time limit.  I just have to finish them in one sitting.  Lets get it started!

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.240
One, two, three!

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.120
Number 15!

00:02:56.713 --> 00:02:59.273
Under 14 minutes in.  This is number 20.

00:03:52.673 --> 00:03:55.873
25:00 - This is number 28 to tie Ramsey's record.

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:20.980
29 to break the record.  Just like my taco record challenge last night!  Lets get it down!

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:45.860
The official record - 29 sliders!  Did it in 27:24!  Delicious!

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:54.020
I was thinking about going for 30, but the record hasn't been beaten since January of last year.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:00.220
If you think you can beat the record, all you have to do is eat 30 in one sitting and get them all free!

00:05:02.734 --> 00:05:04.814
Win #191.  Thanks for watching!
