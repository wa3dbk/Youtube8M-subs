00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.910
Okay.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.530
So now we're going to talk about locking up
your bicycle in New York City.

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:14.740
This is definitely one of the highest cities
of theft, for bicycles especially, so you

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:18.490
want to make sure that you secure your bike
'cause you don't wanna come out and have your

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:25.250
wheels missing or your frame missing or your
entire bike missing 'cause that is never fun.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.119
So let's go through the different locks.

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.939
So in New York City you want to make sure
you're getting a lock that's usually around

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.590
$60 or more and basically what that's gonna
assure is that you have the proper security

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.890
rating.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.430
So all the locks are made out of different
materials.

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.800
If you get a lock that's too cheap it's gonna
be really easy to break.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.670
Here at the shop with the tools that we have
some of these locks can break really, really

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.320
easily, so you want to make sure that you
get a lock that's $60 or more usually.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.890
So this is our most common lock.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.789
It's a U-lock which are very, very strong.

00:00:57.789 --> 00:00:58.880
It's not very big.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.969
The bigger that you go in locks the lower
security rating they get 'cause it's easier

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.210
to put like a crowbar in there or like a car
jack, something like that and break them open.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.690
So let me demonstrate how that works real
quick on this bicycle.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:15.470
Legally you're not supposed to be locking
to signs or a street post and things like

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:19.830
that, but a lot of the times you don't have
any other option, so just make sure that the

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:26.640
sign or post has something at the top of it
so somebody can't lift your lock up and over

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.860
and take it right off.

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.770
Also never lock to scaffolding.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:31.420
Scaffolding can be undone.

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.640
Never lock to trees 'cause it hurts the trees
and also the trees can be cut if they're small

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:35.640
enough.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.310
So basically what you want to do is you go
up to the rack and you take your cable, unwind

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:48.110
the cable, and you're gonna put it through
your front wheel and weave it through the

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:50.850
hole here.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.530
And then you're gonna take your U-lock and
you want to make sure that you're locking

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.460
to the frame, or if you want to protect your
back wheel a nice thing to do is to go inside

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.319
this triangle, so you have a back triangle
on your bicycle, and you can actually go through.

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.170
Make sure you're attaching to the actual rack
and go through and attach to the wheel.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:19.310
Attach to the actual rim and then put the
cable on, make sure it's locked, give it a

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.320
nice tug, make sure it's locked securely.

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.040
Basically what that does is it locks your
back wheel with the U-lock and your frame

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.590
because even if you took the wheel off it
can't get outside the frame just 'cause you're

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.410
inside the triangle, so it's a nice way to
lock it up.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.160
Or you can just, if you're going into a store
really quickly, you can lock up just to the

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.680
frame and hope that your wheel is still there
when you come back.

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.530
We recommend a lot of people get these pinhead
locks.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:54.040
Basically what it is, is it replaces the quick
release and uses a key mechanism to keep 'em

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:55.040
safe.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.650
That's a really nice thing because then you
don't have to use this cable.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.020
You can just have the pinheads on.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.330
Make sure you keep the key with you in your
repair kit and just lock the frame and basically

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.310
your wheels and your frame will be locked,
and make sure you have the seat chain and

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.000
don't leave it out for very long.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.160
In New York City or most cities, you don't
want to leave your bike out for more than

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.520
an hour or two and you definitely don't want
to leave it out overnight if you don't have

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:18.520
to.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:24.069
What you want to do is you want to lock down
anything that is easily taken off, so your

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:32.520
wheels, your frame, and your seat post, and
just don't leave it out for very long.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.069
That's how you lock your bicycle.
