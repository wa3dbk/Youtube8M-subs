00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:06.609
Hi I'm Karen for Expert Village now I'm ready
to put the lattice on the pie. First I'm going

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:13.080
to brush the edge with a little egg white
so that those lattice pieces will stick to

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.160
the bottom pie crust. So just take that egg
white and brush just the edge there lightly.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:36.160
We would start by laying 6 strips across the
pie evenly across the pie 1,2,3,4, there move

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:46.550
them a little bit a little closer there 5,
and use the short ones for the ends 6. Okay

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:56.230
now we are going to fold back every other
one just to the center and then place a long

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:16.880
one right down the center and fold those back.
Now fold that back every other ones and place

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:27.950
a strip across and fold it back. Being careful
not to tare the crust as you go. Now again

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.460
we are going to fold back every other one
the opposite ones and we would use the shorter

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:44.520
piece for the finishing of it and then fold,
fold that back. And you have a nice woven

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.999
pattern. Lets turn it around now we are going
to start again from the center and go in this

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:56.009
way. You want to think about now this is a
over so this has to be a under. So all the

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.159
under we are going to fold here is a over,
now next we need a under. Let's fold that

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:15.459
back every other one. Place our pie crust
gently across, fold it back, and now repeat

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:30.430
with the other one, every other one. Place
your pie crust there, fold it back and one

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:41.519
more fold that over and now we are finish
with the lattice and next we are going to

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:42.569
crimp the edge.
