Hi, I'm Ann Myrick and today I'm going to
show you how to get rid of what you don't

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:13.960
want. And that could be clothes, it could
be toys that the children grew out of. So,

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.750
first, what you want to do is go through each
room, each area, basements, attics, and look.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:27.690
And you want to have pencil in hand with paper
and you want to just make a list. I would

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:33.010
write down each room. I would write down what
you want to get rid of in that room. And then

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.900
how do you want to get rid of it? Do you want
to, there's probably going to be several different

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.010
ways. There's probably going to be a box or
a sack for garbage. There's probably going

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:52.440
to be a box or a sack for Goodwill or Salvation
Army or your favorite charity. Or there's

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.470
also probably going to be a box or could be
a box, if you want to make a little extra

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.530
money, for a garage sale. So the first thing
you want to do is just go through and decide

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:10.420
what you want to get rid of and a rule of
thumb with clothes, if you haven't worn it

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.470
in two years then you probably won't. So you
want to get rid of those. If the children

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.970
have outgrown them, toys, then you probably
want to get rid of those. Give them to a friend

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:30.540
that has a younger child, whatever. So you
want to just go through each room and work

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:38.380
with organizing, taking out. Also remember
to, like this is a great little piece that

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.250
I store linens in. But, and I have it alot
of times I will shut it and use it for a little

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.110
table. What you want to do is if you have
pieces like this, if you have things that

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:57.450
have tops on them that you have stored in
those containers you want to open them up

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.409
and look in them. Because there could be a
full chest that I really want to get rid of

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:08.610
but if I don't look in it I'm going to forget
that I have these things. So if I'm going

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.260
to the trouble of having a garage sale or
doing all this you really want to go through

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.880
and pull out all the drawers, boxes, take
the tops off and look to see what you have

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.940
where you won't miss anything. This is Ann
Myrick and that is how to get rid of what

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:25.440
you don't want.
