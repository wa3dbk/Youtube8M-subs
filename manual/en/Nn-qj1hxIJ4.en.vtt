00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.850
-[distorted voice]:
Pear... I am your father.

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:07.165
-Please. Stop.

00:00:07.165 --> 00:00:08.793
-[distorted voice]:
Father.

00:00:08.793 --> 00:00:09.741
-Stop it!

00:00:09.741 --> 00:00:12.449
-What? Are you not a "fan"?
[laughs]

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.653
[distorted voice]:
Father.

00:00:14.653 --> 00:00:17.083
-[grumbles]
-Yo, shut the mouth.

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:20.329
-Yeesh. Talk about a
"sour" grape. [laughs]

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:25.289
-Not for long. Ah, yeah.
Gotta get my tan on.

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.765
-Dude! You can't smoke in here.
[laughs]

00:00:28.765 --> 00:00:30.033
[flames erupt]

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:31.829
-Whoo! Look at me
and my perfect tan.

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.649
I am beautiful.

00:00:38.425 --> 00:00:39.331
-I don't get it.

00:00:39.331 --> 00:00:42.437
You grapes really think
you look better all crinkly?

00:00:42.437 --> 00:00:43.619
-Absolutely.

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:45.843
The darker the tan,
the hotter I am.

00:00:45.843 --> 00:00:48.217
-The wrinklier the skin,
the sexier I am.

00:00:48.217 --> 00:00:51.279
-First you get your tan on,
then you get your swag on.

00:00:51.279 --> 00:00:53.153
-Whoop-whoop!
-Whoa!

00:00:53.153 --> 00:00:56.765
Now, those are some
"grape" expectations. [laughs]

00:00:56.765 --> 00:00:59.735
-Whatevs. You just jealous
of my bodacious physique.

00:00:59.735 --> 00:01:01.740
-Yeah, that orange's
skin is so smooth

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:04.259
you can play ice hockey on it.
[laughs]

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:07.389
-Hey! That's cold.
[laughs]

00:01:07.389 --> 00:01:10.539
-Orange's skin is so smooth,
he's uglier than Yogi.

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:12.312
-(grapes)
Oh!

00:01:12.312 --> 00:01:13.987
-Hey! Not cool!

00:01:13.987 --> 00:01:16.421
-Whoa! An albino raisin.

00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:20.085
-No, I'm covered in yogurt.
That's why they call me Yogi.

00:01:20.085 --> 00:01:21.689
This yogurt is like sunblock.

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.259
No matter how hard I try,
I can't get wrinkly.

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.753
-Which makes him different.
-Which makes us laugh.

00:01:27.753 --> 00:01:29.159
[all laugh]

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.989
-[groans]
-Don't listen to him, Yogi.

00:01:31.989 --> 00:01:33.382
[flames erupt]

00:01:33.382 --> 00:01:35.751
-Oh yeah!
Look who got his swag on!

00:01:35.751 --> 00:01:38.157
-[groans in disgust]
Stop!

00:01:38.157 --> 00:01:41.825
-Hey, guys, I'm, uh, I'm kind of
having second thoughts here.

00:01:41.825 --> 00:01:42.691
-Don't listen to him, grape.

00:01:42.691 --> 00:01:45.621
-Yeah, they're just a bunch
of baby-faced haters.

00:01:45.621 --> 00:01:46.927
-I don't wanna.

00:01:46.927 --> 00:01:49.231
[flames erupt]

00:01:49.231 --> 00:01:51.141
Look at my wrinkles!
Look at 'em!

00:01:51.141 --> 00:01:53.976
-Okay. Somebody needs
to call a doctor.

00:01:53.976 --> 00:01:56.583
-Well, I know a good "shrink."
[laughs]

00:01:56.583 --> 00:01:59.485
-What? Don't like looking
at beautiful beach bodies?

00:01:59.485 --> 00:02:02.175
Fine. Come on, raisins.
Let's roll.

00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:04.452
-Um... I can't.

00:02:04.452 --> 00:02:06.973
-It's the wrinkles.
The wrinkles won't roll.

00:02:06.973 --> 00:02:08.979
-Hey! Hey, raisins, hey!
-What?

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.723
-I think I just
had a "bright" idea.

00:02:11.723 --> 00:02:14.333
-Bet that's a first.
-No, for reals, yo.

00:02:14.333 --> 00:02:16.691
You wanna hear?
-Fine. What is it?

00:02:16.691 --> 00:02:18.129
-Magnifying glass.

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.571
[raisins screaming in agony]

00:02:22.571 --> 00:02:24.329
-Eww! Do you smell that?

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:27.667
Something really "shrinks."
[laughs, then grimaces]

00:02:27.667 --> 00:02:29.623
-Okay. I've seen enough.

00:02:29.623 --> 00:02:32.419
-Whoa! That was crazy!

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.327
-Yogi! You're not smokey!

00:02:34.327 --> 00:02:36.364
-It's my yogurt sunblock.

00:02:36.364 --> 00:02:38.595
It saved me from
those harmful rays.

00:02:38.595 --> 00:02:39.377
-You know, guys?

00:02:39.377 --> 00:02:42.205
I think we learned
a few valuable lessons today.

00:02:42.205 --> 00:02:44.953
-I know I did.
Take it from me, kids:

00:02:44.953 --> 00:02:47.417
winners always wear sunscreen.

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:52.029
-And we also learned
that peer pressure

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:54.393
is no match for
high self-esteem.

00:02:57.147 --> 00:02:59.963
-Yeah, and I learned that
stars love yogurt.

00:03:02.601 --> 00:03:04.133
-Wait. What?

00:03:04.133 --> 00:03:05.655
[star laughs evilly]

00:03:05.655 --> 00:03:08.131
[Yogi screaming]

00:03:08.131 --> 00:03:11.011
[Orange and Pear scream]

00:03:11.011 --> 00:03:14.579
