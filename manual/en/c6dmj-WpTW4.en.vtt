00:00:08.573 --> 00:00:10.674
You want to wait here for me?

00:00:10.742 --> 00:00:12.342
No.

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:14.778
Well, then let's go.

00:00:20.951 --> 00:00:23.320
Helen:
And lock the car.

00:00:25.556 --> 00:00:27.891
Man:
Hey now.

00:00:27.958 --> 00:00:30.594
Want something,
baby?

00:00:30.662 --> 00:00:33.229
I got it for you.

00:00:36.267 --> 00:00:37.701
Yo, baby...

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:39.569
Which way you going?

00:00:39.637 --> 00:00:42.205
Just going inside.

00:00:42.273 --> 00:00:44.140
Yeah?

00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:46.176
Hey, come up in here.

00:00:46.243 --> 00:00:48.211
Who you looking for?

00:00:48.279 --> 00:00:49.813
A friend of ours.

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.881
Sure you not
the police, huh?

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.250
Look like
five-oh to me.

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:57.253
Ask blondie
where she going.

00:00:57.322 --> 00:00:59.456
Who you going
to see?

00:00:59.524 --> 00:01:02.192
Let's take the stairs.

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:03.259
Come on.

00:01:07.332 --> 00:01:08.632
( &lt;i&gt;boy whistling&lt;/i&gt; )

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.166
Head's up, people!

00:01:10.234 --> 00:01:12.936
&lt;i&gt;Five-oh coming up&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;the back door.&lt;/i&gt;

00:01:13.003 --> 00:01:15.238
It's okay.
They think we're cops.

00:01:15.306 --> 00:01:18.241
They're not going
to follow us.

00:01:23.948 --> 00:01:25.615
Hang on.

00:01:47.505 --> 00:01:49.706
Look at this.

00:01:49.774 --> 00:01:51.441
This is great.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.512
Bernadette:
"sweets to..."

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.648
Helen:
"...To the sweet."

00:01:58.716 --> 00:02:00.884
Bernadette:
"sweets to the sweet."

00:02:01.886 --> 00:02:03.887
Hurry up, helen.

00:02:03.954 --> 00:02:06.256
Let me just get the door.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.261
( &lt;i&gt;barking&lt;/i&gt; )

00:02:13.398 --> 00:02:14.765
Sorry.
