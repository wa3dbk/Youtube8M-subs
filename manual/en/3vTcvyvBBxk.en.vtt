- [Voiceover] It's the Marshmallow Show

00:00:11.207 --> 00:00:14.511
- Hey everybody! Welcome back
to the Marshmallow Show! Yay!

00:00:14.511 --> 00:00:16.330
It was my birthday last
week, and I got a whole bunch

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.185
of awesome presents!
Come look at them! Yay!

00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:22.694
Behind curtain #1 is the
gift my Aunt Fluffy gave me.

00:00:22.694 --> 00:00:24.812
And now, Bike! Yay!

00:00:24.812 --> 00:00:26.842
Look how shiny it is!

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:28.557
And now, look behind
curtain #2, my Uncle Puffy

00:00:28.557 --> 00:00:30.974
gave me this real puppy! Yay!

00:00:32.285 --> 00:00:34.871
That tickles! Oh oh! He's kind
of eating me a little bit.

00:00:34.871 --> 00:00:37.772
Oh! And the best gift of
all is right over here.

00:00:37.772 --> 00:00:39.713
- Hey Marshmallow!

00:00:39.713 --> 00:00:40.595
- Yes Joe?

00:00:40.595 --> 00:00:42.503
- I don't think the audience
wants to just watch you

00:00:42.503 --> 00:00:44.323
show off your new toys.

00:00:44.323 --> 00:00:45.200
- They don't?

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.136
- No! In fact, it's kind of rude, Marshy.

00:00:47.136 --> 00:00:48.332
You're being a show off.

00:00:48.332 --> 00:00:49.198
- I'm sorry.

00:00:49.198 --> 00:00:50.880
I won't show you what's behind curtain #3.

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:51.862
I promise.

00:00:51.862 --> 00:00:52.761
- Cool.

00:00:52.761 --> 00:00:54.261
- Very polite of you, Marshmallow.

00:00:54.261 --> 00:00:55.269
(horn blaring)

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:57.188
- Oh! It's time to
interview today's guest!

00:00:57.188 --> 00:00:59.085
If you're online, you probably
know today's guest well.

00:00:59.085 --> 00:01:00.579
That's right, today we're
interviewing the whole

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.079
Ehbee Family! Yay!

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:05.714
Welcome to the show!
Please tell us your names

00:01:05.714 --> 00:01:07.533
and something interesting
about yourselves.

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:09.221
- I go by the name of AB.
And something interesting?

00:01:09.221 --> 00:01:11.304
I speak Spanish fluently.

00:01:13.478 --> 00:01:16.898
- Hi. I'm Momma B and I practice yoga.

00:01:16.898 --> 00:01:21.111
- What a coincidence! I
practice yoga too! Yay!

00:01:21.111 --> 00:01:23.184
- Stop showing off Marshmallow!

00:01:23.184 --> 00:01:25.489
- Sorry! Please continue.

00:01:25.489 --> 00:01:28.980
- I go by the name of Arby
and something interesting

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:31.647
about myself is I do Tae Kwan Do

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:36.342
- Hi. I go by the name of
the Star of the Show, yo!

00:01:36.342 --> 00:01:38.372
And I get all the followers!

00:01:38.372 --> 00:01:40.776
- Why do you have to have to do that?

00:01:40.776 --> 00:01:42.061
- I'm sorry

00:01:42.061 --> 00:01:43.809
- Well it's a pleasure to have you

00:01:43.809 --> 00:01:45.596
all on the Marshmallow Show!

00:01:45.596 --> 00:01:47.769
- All this marshmallow
talk is making me hungry.

00:01:47.769 --> 00:01:50.405
- Uh oh! I don't like
the way things are going.

00:01:50.405 --> 00:01:52.429
- Marshmallows, yo!

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:55.096
- Oh no! That's my cousin Billy!

00:01:56.215 --> 00:01:57.552
- Mmm cheers!

00:01:57.552 --> 00:02:00.530
- All right, Ehbee family, first question.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.135
What does this inkblot look like to you?

00:02:02.135 --> 00:02:03.359
- Looks like a Unicorn.

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:04.639
- Aww, you're cute!

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:07.601
- You know, I see Unicorn
riding a unicycle.

00:02:07.601 --> 00:02:10.334
- In Marshmallowia, all the
Unicorns ride Unicycles.

00:02:10.334 --> 00:02:11.526
(laughs)

00:02:11.526 --> 00:02:12.591
(burp) - Excuse me

00:02:12.591 --> 00:02:13.876
Wow!

00:02:13.876 --> 00:02:15.525
(laughing)

00:02:15.525 --> 00:02:16.959
That was pretty good.

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.527
But let's try this on
for size (long burp).

00:02:20.527 --> 00:02:22.214
- Whoa Marshmallow, that was incredible!

00:02:22.214 --> 00:02:23.874
- There you go, showing off again!

00:02:23.874 --> 00:02:26.185
- Oh, I don't mean to show
off, but I can't help it.

00:02:26.185 --> 00:02:28.231
I'm too talented in too many ways.

00:02:28.231 --> 00:02:30.509
I'll right, Ehbee Family, it's time

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:32.047
to get down to the hard questions.

00:02:32.047 --> 00:02:33.409
Swings, or Teeter Totters?

00:02:33.409 --> 00:02:35.158
- Teeter Totters and Tator Tots

00:02:35.158 --> 00:02:36.580
- And Taffys!

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.740
- And Taffys. Teeter Tots,
Tator Taffys, and Taffers.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.207
- Yay! What a great answer!

00:02:41.207 --> 00:02:43.159
Next, super duper difficult question.

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:44.726
Can you whistle your name?

00:02:44.726 --> 00:02:45.610
(whistles)

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.231
- Oh My god!

00:02:47.231 --> 00:02:49.100
- That's the most terrible
noise I've ever been

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.588
subjected to in my short
marshmallowy life! Yay!

00:02:51.588 --> 00:02:52.740
Oh, another question!

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.161
Does anyone in the Ehbee Family
have a stupid human trick?

00:02:55.161 --> 00:02:56.534
I love stupid Human Tricks!

00:02:56.534 --> 00:02:57.814
- I could do a cartwheel.

00:02:57.814 --> 00:03:01.222
No, yeah... a cartwheel,
back flip, front flip.

00:03:01.222 --> 00:03:04.205
- That's so cool! So can I! Yay!

00:03:04.205 --> 00:03:06.356
- Marshmallow! You're showing off again!

00:03:06.356 --> 00:03:08.771
- Sorry! Thanks so much
for being on the show,

00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:11.049
Ehbee Family. Where can people see more

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.185
of your family's antics?

00:03:12.185 --> 00:03:14.227
- Well, you could see us on vine.

00:03:14.227 --> 00:03:16.420
So if you go to "Vine.co/Ehbee"

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.175

00:03:21.175 --> 00:03:22.528

00:03:22.528 --> 00:03:24.822
Ehbee Family raps, maybe?

00:03:24.822 --> 00:03:27.322
- (Beatboxes)

00:03:29.725 --> 00:03:31.752

00:03:52.792 --> 00:03:54.092
- That was a really good rap!

00:03:54.092 --> 00:03:56.033
That was proably the
best rap I've ever heard!

00:03:56.033 --> 00:03:57.748
- Me too! I love raps.

00:03:57.748 --> 00:03:58.994
Oh, and that reminds me!

00:03:58.994 --> 00:04:00.737
Can I show you what's behind curtain #3?

00:04:00.737 --> 00:04:02.358
- Marshmallow, we just went through this!

00:04:02.358 --> 00:04:04.018
Nobody wants to see...

00:04:04.018 --> 00:04:05.132
(sirens sounding)

00:04:05.132 --> 00:04:06.825
- Uh oh! It must have excaped!

00:04:06.825 --> 00:04:07.658
- What?

00:04:07.658 --> 00:04:09.042
- Yeah, what escaped?

00:04:09.042 --> 00:04:11.038
- My grandpa gave me a Velociraptor!

00:04:11.038 --> 00:04:12.599
- A Velociraptor?

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:14.513
- Yeah! And I guess
because we waited until

00:04:14.513 --> 00:04:15.981
the end of the show it had time

00:04:15.981 --> 00:04:17.205
to test its cage for weaknesses

00:04:17.205 --> 00:04:18.622
and escaped. Yay!

00:04:19.686 --> 00:04:21.853
- No! Not yay! So not yay!

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.244
- Everyone keep still. It can only see you

00:04:26.244 --> 00:04:27.386
if you move.

00:04:27.386 --> 00:04:30.617
- Then why is it coming directly for me?

00:04:30.617 --> 00:04:32.283
- Oh, well, it can
definitely smell coffee.

00:04:32.283 --> 00:04:33.595
So I guess you are in trouble, Joe.

00:04:33.595 --> 00:04:35.928
(screaming)

00:04:37.798 --> 00:04:38.972

Yay! First things first.
