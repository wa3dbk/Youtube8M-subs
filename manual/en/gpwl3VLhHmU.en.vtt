&gt;&gt; Shaun: Hey everybody. What's up? Shaun
Hadsall; Get Lean in 12, coming at you with

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.060
another short Fat Loss video. Today's video
is The Best Fat Loss Vegetables. So I have

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.539
a list of six of them over here and I want
to uncover the power that using these vegetables

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.689
can have on targeting lower belly fat. Now
I always get these questions about vegetables

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:35.510
like, "Do I need to avoid peas, corn and carrots?"
And the truth of the matter is, depending

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.350
on what you eat them with and when you eat
them, no, you don't have to avoid them. They're

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.220
not horrible vegetables for you and they're
definitely not going to make you store more

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.120
fat. But if you use them the wrong way, or
combine them with the wrong foods, or eat

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.140
them by themselves at the wrong times, it
definitely can put your body out of a fat

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.100
burning environment.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.070
But the green vegetable I'm going to talk
about in this video, or the cruciferous vegetables

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.910
I'm going to talk about in this video, will
have a profound impact on your health and

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.820
your fat loss. A ton of benefits I've listed
up here. Then, at the end of this video, I'm

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.429
going to reveal how you can get your hands
on an article where you can actually use a

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:14.920
couple of these vegetables, of your choice,
to actually double or even triple fat loss

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.619
after a weekend food bender or after a weekend
food binge where maybe you've went period

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.819
where you ate unhealthy or you went on vacation.
You can use this carb depleting strategy with

00:01:24.819 --> 00:01:28.700
these green vegetables to literally double
or triple fat loss for three or four days

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.729
in a row after you've fallen off track. So
I'll tell you how to get your hands on that,

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.020
for free, at the end of this video.

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.759
First, let's talk about the power of green
cruciferous vegetables or just cruciferous

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.729
vegetables. Now the most common ones are broccoli,
cauliflower, and cabbage. And I recommend

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.560
that you consume all these as much as possible.
I actually eat all these and we usually go

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.830
in kicks. So, the ones that are really unknown
fat burning greens are kale, bok choy, Swiss

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.619
chard, arugula, and collard greens.

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.979
Now these particular greens have several different
benefits that I want to talk about but the

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.649
most potent ingredient that you need to understand,
that's inside these greens, is something called

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:14.410
DIM and it's derived inside these vegetables
because they contain something called IC3.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.650
Now what this DIM does is it acts like an
anti-estrogen. Now, whether you're a man or

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:24.569
a woman, this is huge because we are constantly
exposed, in today's day and age, to these

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:30.099
xenoestrogens or these obesogens in the environment,
just from the food that we eat and the toxicity

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:36.060
levels in our food, from just the agriculture.
And, over the years, what ends up happening

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.390
is we get bad estrogen, whether a guy or a
girl, bad estrogen levels are blocking a lot

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.079
of people's fat loss. So this will actually
act as an anti-estrogen and, indirectly, it

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:50.040
will stimulate your immune system and if you
look it up on Wikipedia, if you just type

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.319
in DIM, you'll be amazed it even touts it
as a cancer fighter.

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.709
Now any time that you consume any of these
types of vegetables you're also going to get

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.469
several other benefits. So, first of all is
fiber and this is huge. You need to be getting

00:03:03.469 --> 00:03:07.239
at least twenty-five to thirty-five grams
of fiber a day and you need to be getting

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:11.450
the majority of them from your green veges
because, number one, it's going to help you

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.459
stabilize and keep blood sugar stable. And
when blood sugar is stable we keep our body

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.950
in a fat burning environment. Most people
live with chronically high insulin levels

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.639
and this keeps their body in a fat storing
environment and, over time, this is what causes

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.889
insulin resistance and it's what's leading
to the type 2 diabetes epidemic. So, if you

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:32.060
want to prevent that stuff, consuming a lot
of these green vegetables is really, really

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.180
going to help you.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.790
Now the other thing that this will really
help with is blood flow. Now blood flow is

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.569
critical to a couple things. Number one, health,
our heart, thing about it, our brain, it needs

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:46.329
blood flow. Number two, if you're having a
hard time getting rid of belly fat or stubborn

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:50.769
pockets of cellulite, these green vegetables
can actually increase the blood flow to those

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:56.569
areas. And science shows that getting blood
flow to stubborn pockets of fat is critical

00:03:56.569 --> 00:04:00.180
to burning it off and getting rid of it and
these green vegetables are going to help you

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.760
do that.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.999
Now that last thing that these green veggies
do, and this is the most amazing research,

00:04:04.999 --> 00:04:09.779
and its newer research that I've been reading
a lot about, is the vegetables like this,

00:04:09.779 --> 00:04:13.349
if we consume them regularly, like five or
six days of the week, we make an effort to

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:17.040
get a lot of these, you're still allowed to
eat some cheat food once or twice a week but

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:22.250
try to get these because they actually can
turn off, or express, bad genes and turn on,

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.930
or express, good genes. So we can never change
our genetics. Genetically we're made up the

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:32.930
way God made us. However, we can turn off,
or express, or turn on, or express, certain

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.410
genes that may prevent cancer or certain genes
that may cause cancer. Certain genes that

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:42.070
may help fat loss of certain genes that may
make you store more fat. So by consuming more

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:47.090
of these green vegetables, you actually can
turn on good genes and stack the deck in your

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:48.880
favor when it comes to your health and your
fat loss.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.480
Now when you combine these green vegetables
with a certain macro nutrient, the right way,

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:59.300
you actually increase the absorption of these
vegetables greatly. You also increase their

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:04.690
effectiveness. And I teach you how to do this
through a strategy called carb depleting and

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:09.780
I teach you a three or four day trick that
you can use, after a weekend food bender or

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:14.430
after a period of time where you've fallen
off track or maybe came back from a vacation,

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:19.410
you can really double or triple your fat loss
and make belly fat your go-to energy source

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:23.300
aggressively, for three or four days in a
row by combining these greens with another

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:27.400
certain macro nutrient. And what I did is,
on a separate page off YouTube, I posted an

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.480
article, for free, that you can read through,
and I give you four strategies that you can

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:36.730
actually use to apply this to make belly fat
your go-to energy source or what I call carb

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.180
depleting. And I also give you a chance to
get my free report. So just click the link
