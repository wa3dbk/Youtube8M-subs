00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:33.460
It’s good to be the king and it’s good
to be the Overlord.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.620
Sure your minions are little, ugly, noisy
and smell funny, but hey, they’re loyal

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.940
and they like bringing you shiny things!

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.530
This is Overlord for PC.

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:53.130
Released in 2007, developed by Triumph Studios
and published by Code Masters, Overlord is

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.530
a bit of mix when it comes to genre and play
style.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.380
You control the Overlord, stalking around,
swing weapons and casting spells leaning toward

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:07.140
action-adventure, there also RPG elements
with upgrades to your gear and stats, but

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.180
you will also simultaneously control a small
horde of minions with an almost RST feel to

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.180
it.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.820
Combine all of this with the satirical nature
of the whole game makes for a good time of

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:24.950
tyrannical hack and slash.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:29.020
Your objective is to reclaim dominance over
the land and rebuild your tower taking your

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.580
rightful place as evil Overlord.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.299
To do this you have your helpful servant Gnarl,
pretty much leading you the whole way through

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:44.780
the game, a mistress to redecorate, and bunch
of little germlin like minions.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.600
Four different types are unlocked during your
journey, tough brown melee ones, ranged red

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.710
fire guys, green stealthy minions and blue
ones that can survive in water and heal.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.260
Your minions will also help you get through
certain obstacles as well, red for fire, blue

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.090
water and green poison for areas.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.590
You can tell them what to do and where to
go all while doing some damage yourself.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.180
At first this was a bit awkward for me until
I got used to sending the minions to attack

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.510
and taking out baddies myself at the same
time.

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:19.440
You can send out sweeping movements and attacks
with all of your minions at once also.

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:23.170
It’s pretty entertaining to see them go
town on some barrels and run back to you with

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.880
the spoils.

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:32.220
So you’re pretty menacing looking and you
might kick your jester on occasion, but actually

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.120
you don’t really have to be a bad guy.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.820
The game gives you choices at times to be
generous and merciful or just mean and violent.

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.900
Choosing the later will add to your corruption
effecting your look and a few other aspects

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.489
of the game like villagers reactions to you.

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:52.530
This is one of a few similarities to Fable
that kind of glared out to me.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.751
There are morality choices woven into the
game play and not only that, but the over

00:02:56.751 --> 00:02:59.270
all style and presentation seems a lot like
Fable.

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:06.310
Maybe it’s the accent of the townsfolk really...

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:20.130
I wouldn’t say they were necessarily stealing
ideas from Fable, if anything the game is

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.230
poking fun the various genres mashed together
in Overlord.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:28.980
Luckily the parody enhances the whole experience
and doesn’t get in the way of being a fun

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:29.980
and interesting game.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:36.129
There are a few other options of playing besides
the single player campaign, there are some

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:37.390
multiplayer options as well.

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.629
Now to my knowledge, the online version is
no longer works, but you can still play over

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.330
a LAN or split screen as well to see who’s
the best Overlord of them all.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:51.800
There is an expansion “Raising Hell” which
will add new levels as well as some new items

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.230
and upgrades.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.319
There is a sequel, Overlord II, as well as
a spin-off for Wii, which was reviewed here

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.760
on CGR Undertow and another one for DS.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.580
The game is a bit dated now, but it is still
a lot of fun to play.

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:12.290
You can play Overlord on Xbox 360, PlayStation
3 or on PC which is available through Steam

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:17.109
that has an Overlord Complete Pack, giving
you Both Overlord I and II as well as the

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.930
expansion for the first one.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:31.219
So take a break from killing dragons and saving
the day, let your evil overlord out for 

00:04:31.219 --> 00:04:35.439
a little bit.
