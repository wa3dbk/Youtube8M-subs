00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:20.500
There are similarities between Washi production and running a marathon

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:30.780
Washi production is about taking the time and effort in hand crafting a product using natural materials

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:40.180
Marathon is about taking the time and effort to practice, to increase your speed or extend your distance

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.700
These are the similarities

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.100
I am really glad, yes, that’s really all

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.540
I enjoyed it more than last year, thank you very much

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:51.220
As there is no ending, no ‘I’m done!’, in Washi production or running

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.540
I hope I can continue to take small steps forward to push farther
