00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.180
Ana Padron : So now we're going to discuss
what to wear.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:12.840
So the Argentine Tango, just like it's always
been, even from the beginning, has been very

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.100
fashionable.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.590
So with the tango came the slits along the
ladies dresses because they made it easier

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.730
to move around the floor and it's always been
fashionable.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:31.210
The tights, the berets, the dresses, very
stylish and especially the shoes.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:36.580
So for the shoes, it is very important that
a lady wears a shoe with a strap.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.290
The size of the heel is going to be up to
you in comfort and the design, of course,

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.620
is up to your style.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.660
I'm wearing polka dots.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:49.300
So another important thing is that this one's
made with a leather sole, so it makes it easier

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.300
to slide.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.690
And what you tend to do, so you have a little
grip if you have leather soles, is you could

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.010
just brush it and create a little bit of friction.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.730
But the soles also come in suede, which helps
you with the friction.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:02.939
Diego Blanco: Like so.

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:05.530
Ana: That's a suede sole.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.940
So that at the end of the day it's up to your
preference and your style.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:17.330
In a Milonga, which is much more of an elegant
dance party, you can dress as elegant as you

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.270
want but with comfort.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:24.580
Makeing sure that your dresses are not too
long ladies because you might have the tendency

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.140
to step on it and there's a lot to go around.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:32.720
But it is very important that you bring your
style, your jewelry, it's all up to you.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.740
Diego Blanco: For the leaders, it depends
on whether it's an elegant Milonga.

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.400
There are Milongas that are elegant and there
are Milongas that does not necessarily have

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:43.550
to be elegant.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.730
Then there's Practicas, which means "to practice"
so you don't have to be elegant at all.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:56.950
Before Tango was very elegant; nice pants,
suit, tie, the hair slicked back, you know,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.950
presentable.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.320
Nowadays, it's a little more loose.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.549
If you wear jeans and a nice shirt you probably
will be okay in a Milonga, other than if it's

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:08.009
a special Milonga.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.190
As far as our shoes are concerned, today I
am wearing patent leather but as long as you

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.230
are able to pivot you are okay with whatever
shoe you want to wear.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.220
We don't recommend for you to wear shoes that
are square.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.510
You want to have shoes that are more pointy.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.050
This allows you to shape the foot of your
follower better when you do Parada, Sacada,

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:39.140
many different other steps that you can do
in Argentine Tango, but really you want to

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.140
feel comfortable.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.500
You want to have fun with this and enjoy yourselves.
