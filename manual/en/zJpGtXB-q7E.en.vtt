00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:12.790
&gt;&gt; Ann-Marie: Welcome back.

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.551
It's Ann-Marie Fleming here with DogQuality.com
and we are going to be taking a look at the

00:00:17.551 --> 00:00:19.910
Dogger, our latest and greatest dog stroller.

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.070
But we're going to look at it from a different
perspective, from your perspective.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.180
We've been very fortunate to get so much great
feedback, and so we've been able to collect

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.410
a list, our top-10 list of why customers like
you love their Dogger.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:39.590
We're going to start at number 10 and work our way up to the number-one reason, so follow me

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:44.940
 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.480
Number 10 on the list of reasons why customers
love their Dogger is the ability to use it

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:51.480
for two dogs.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.720
Not only does it have enough room for two
dogs, but it also has two safety leashes,

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:56.580
which makes it nice and secure.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.610
Dogs don't get out.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.860
Everybody's happy.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:03.870
Everybody gets to go for their ride.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.660
Number nine is maneuverability.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:17.730
People love being able to spin the Dogger
on a dime.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.800
Number eight is the secure basket.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.780
All around the top of the basket is a nice
secure frame that keeps the dogs nice and

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.780
safe inside.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.070
None of this squishy, soft material.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:38.930
It's actually got protection for the dog.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.960
The seventh most favorite thing is the amount
of windows and visibility that your dog gets,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.170
even when the basket is fully enclosed.

00:01:51.170 --> 00:02:02.550
You can see out of everywhere, front, back,
side, you name it, top.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:16.900
The sixth most favorite thing is tons of storage
that you have underneath the Dogger that not

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:21.459
only holds a lot of items, as you can see,
we've got it filled here, but it's also very

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.179
easy to access.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.010
Number five on the list is the handy drink
holder that you can get as an accessory to

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.290
the Dogger, and what people love is A, you
have a little compartments to hold your keys

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:44.849
and notes and whatnot and dog bags, but also
you have something that actually holds your

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:46.239
drink without spilling it.

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:50.549
If you've ever used a plastic tray that comes
with most strollers, you'll know exactly what

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:51.549
I'm talking about.

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:55.319
I guarantee you that those drinks will spill,
so if you really want to take your coffee

00:02:55.319 --> 00:03:00.419
with you or your water, you're going to want
a drink holder like this.

00:03:04.779 --> 00:03:09.029
Number four on the list are the big, chunky
air-filled tires that you get, 12-inch tires,

00:03:09.029 --> 00:03:14.980
to be exact, that will take you over every
terrain possible.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.980
Nice and wide.

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.439
Number three on the list is the rear suspension.

00:03:25.439 --> 00:03:30.010
You won't find this on any other dog stroller
on the market, I guarantee that.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.260
These are fabulous.

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:37.500
They are extremely helpful to keep the ride
really, really smooth for you and your dog.

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:47.970
Number two on the list ... We're getting close,
folks to the number one, but number two are

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.970
the adjustable handlebars, which people love.

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.269
The reason they love it is because it fits
all different heights, so no matter if you're

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.780
tall or extremely small, you will have a very
comfortable position to be pushing your stroller

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:08.329
and you can go for hours.

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:13.529
Extremely comfortable.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.040
And reaching the number one spot on our top
10 list of reasons why people love the Dogger

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:24.620
is the versatility of the basket.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.310
Check this out.

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:45.700
Everything can unzip, you can remove, you
can remove more, and this can go this way

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.780
and as you're pushing your stroller with your
dog he can look back at you at anytime and

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.170
you have complete openness.

00:04:53.170 --> 00:04:59.510
I can even take it one step further.

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:06.730
You can have it open like that, and if you
really want it wide open, you can even take

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.160
the canopy entirely off.

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:13.590
What I've heard from customers is their dog
can see them no matter where they are, no

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.500
matter if they're in the front or the back,
they can always see the owner and that comforts

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:18.500
them and they love it.

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.030
They love the visibility to their dog and
the dog loves the visibility to the owner.

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:25.540
That is our number-one reason why people love
their Dogger.
