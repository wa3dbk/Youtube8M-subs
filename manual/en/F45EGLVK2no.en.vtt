00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:12.760
[Theme Music]

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.670
Randompiglet asks, 

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:17.880
"What's it like to not be Asian in Korea, and do they treat you any differently?"

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.900
Well I think it's pretty clear we're treated differently because we stand out a lot; 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.410
we do look very different, Korea has a very homogeneous society, 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.300
not to say everyone looks the same, but majority of people

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.410
do have dark hair and dark eyes here…and Simon's--you know--

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.530
red chicken head sticks out. (Like a man!) Yes.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.310
And my blue eyes and blonde hair tend to stick out a bit,

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:38.240
so we do tend to get a lot of things like…AH--

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:42.050
"Oh! It's a foreigner!" "It's an American"

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.930
"Oh, no. I'm Canadian."

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.760
And at first it was a little bit uncomfortable for us 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.870
because I'm not used to people constantly pointing me out and saying

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.960
that I'm a foreigner, that I'm different. We're from Toronto,

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.190
and it's not like in Toronto we ever point to someone and say,

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:00.880
"Oh look, it's a foreigner…oh look that's an immigrant…oh look that person is different"

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:05.100
because everyone is a part of Toronto and everyone is different.  Here we really do feel

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.310
like we're outsiders. Now to be fair, Korea is pretty new to having foreigners in their country

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:14.020
so some people will react shocked; they honestly have never seen blue eyes in person

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.710
and other people, they don't care. (Mmmhmm) They'll just walk right past you

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.130
like, "so what, it's a foreigner" and they don't care.  So it's not like we get it from

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.250
every single person but every once in a while you will hear someone point us out

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.130
and say "foreigner". But what's funny about that is, since we can understand Korean

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.770
we usually try to combat that by saying something different, so if someone says

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.690
"AH! It's a foreigner" we usually go, "AH! It's Korean! [Hangook Saram]!

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:35.600
What are all the Koreans doing here!? OHH!!!"

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.630
Now because some people haven't really been around foreigners,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.230
there are some insensitive moments that we've experienced…yeah….

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:46.430
So we do have friends who are a little bit overweight, and they have experiences

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:50.740
in which Korean people are like, "OH! You are fat! Look at you, you are fat. Why are you fat?

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.280
You are fat. (Is that really what…*Martina laughs uncomfortably*) FAT! FAT FAT FAT. FAT.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.690
FATTY FATTY FATTY FATTY FATTY FAT FAT FAT." That's not going in the video.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:05.410
No? Okay. Or we do have some friends who are of darker skin, and Korean people are like

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:10.400
"Oh! Your skin is dark. Can I touch it? Can I touch you hair?" for example. And that's not really….

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.550
polite? Yeah….But you know it's still a novelty for them so, a lot of Korean people who do act 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.660
this way, they just don't know that they're doing something wrong. They're not being racist about it,

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.560
they're just, you know, genuinely intrigued it seems.  Yeah, we kind of feel when you're an English

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.790
teacher in Korea, it should be your job not just to teach English, but also to teach these kind of things

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.690
out of your students.  To be a kindof cultural ambassador--yeah.  Now for the more grievous

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.520
culturally insensitivtlyies we tend to notice this more with the older generations than the younger.

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.600
Yeah, the grandfathers and the grandmothers--but that's like the same in most countries…

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:47.150
you sometimes have the racist grandmother. *laughs* You know, they racist grandmother!

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.470
"Hi there racist grandma! What did you say about black people? Oh no!" "Hey you! Get off my lawn!"

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.680
I actually have a funny story about this. I remember when we first came to Korea and I couldn't

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.580
read or understand or speak Korean. I really wanted to try some Korean street food, 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.520
so I went to this one really angry looking Korean lady--oh I remember this!--yes because

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:08.920
I really wanted some dukbokki. So I go up to here and I say, "Um…one please." 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.930
And she looks at me and she goes, *waves hand to shoo us away* And I'm like,

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:16.040
"What…just happened?" No, I have money, here I will show you money, please give me

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:21.750
some street food. And she looks at me again and she goes *waves hand to shoo us away again*

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.260
And she just like, walks away from us. She walks away and she poo-poos me away. 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.270
And I think to myself, "did I just I just experience racism? INCONCEIVABLE!!"

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.970
So then afterwards we went back with one of our Korean co-teachers because I said

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:37.880
I really want to try this street food, and we're determined to figure out why so won't sell us

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.890
--yes we want to figure this out. So we go with our Korean friend, and the Korean friend

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:46.300
is talking to this lady said that she thought that her street food is too spicy for foreigners

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:49.810
and she's worried that we won't be able to handle it and that we will die.

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.630
And I said, "NAHH I love spicy food, give it to me I can handle it." So I bought some of

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:57.740
the street food , and I'm like I 'm going to go home and eat it and it turns out she was dead

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.370
right. We almost died from eating that food.  This is like, the demon dukbokki. 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:08.190
We LOVE spicy food--yes---okay, but this is called "bul" fire dukbokki, is intensely,

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.020
unbelievably horrible. So I think our final comment is, if you visit Korea and you find that

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.160
people are looking and glancing at you, don't take it too personally, it's not like a negative thing. 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:20.960
I know, just imagine if you saw someone in your city that had green hair and purple eyes, 

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.360
and you might think "oh this person looks different" and you might look at them a little 

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.070
bit more than usual but that doesn't necessarily mean you're being racist towards them,

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:29.070
it just means that you're a little bit curious about it.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.150
So that's it for this week's TLDR

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.080
If there's a question you want us to answer for next week's TLDR,

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.080
Leave your question in the Google Moderator page,

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.980
Or, you can take a look at the questions already asked,

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.480
and you can vote them up or vote them down 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:40.790
and we'll answer them next week.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.580
It is so freaking hot in our house.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.810
It is.  Our air conditioner is broken.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.810
WAAAHHHAAA!

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.000
Touch me with his sweaty gross hands! 	 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000
GONG!
