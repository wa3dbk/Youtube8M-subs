00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.440
Dex is a very unexpected 2D side scrolling
open world cyberpunk RPG.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.750
It's yet another indie game, but is it compelling
enough to keep you entertained?

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:21.539
Let's find out in the Dex first impression
review.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:29.230
This is a first impression because the game
has a pretty expansive world and I only had

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.520
a chance to play it for a few hours, but I
can definitely give you the jist of this game.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.900
You play as a blue haired female protagonist
who wakes up and is suddenly on the run as

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.360
you've got law enforcement chasing you down.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:56.250
Your only help is from a mysterious connection
with Raycast who you don't even know.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.900
As you get out into the world, you find that
it's incredibly dangerous and dark.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:04.080
In this world hackers are the underground
people rebellion.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:07.450
Most people have to �Jack in� kind of
like in the Matrix, but your character has

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.450
the ability to do it spontaneously.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.139
You seek out a specific hacker who is going
to help you find out why you are being chased.

00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:18.880
This game has a strong resemblence to Blade
Runner, The Matrix, Total Recall, or any Sci

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.909
Fi action movie from the 80s and 90s.

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:23.320
It's dark and gritty.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.299
The world is futuristic but dangerous at the
same time.

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:27.700
I love it.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.729
For fans of cyberpunk, you will definitely
be pleased.

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.909
The world is large and each area is completely
different.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:37.450
One moment you'll find yourself in the sewers
fighting criminals and gang leaders other

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.499
times you'll be in town at the shops.

00:01:41.499 --> 00:01:45.240
Another aspect I was really impressed with
was the character development and voice acting.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.509
There is a lot of dialogue with multiple paths
to take, but there is voice acting for all

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:50.509
of it.

00:01:50.509 --> 00:02:01.189
And the voice actors are very convincing.

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:05.689
It really adds to the story and makes the
2D world come alive and like a true role playing

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:06.689
game.

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:27.629
Characters have real emotions of fear, hate,
or even comradery.

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.010
And there's plenty of mystery in the first
few hours of the game as you discover what's

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.010
really going on.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:35.340
Combat is another surprising aspect.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.340
You start off very weak and each enemy encounter
actually puts fear into you.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.750
But the game is somewhat forgiving as there
are occasional health packs and your character

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:45.010
does level up fairly quickly.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.209
You start off with just hand to hand combat,
but there are weapons that you can purchase

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.209
later on.

00:02:49.209 --> 00:03:02.599
You have to actively block or dodge otherwise
the enemies will tear you apart.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.880
Dex is a very surpisingly good game so far.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:10.380
For those who love cyberpunk or unique 2D
side scrolling RPGs, you may want to explore

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:11.439
this game.

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:14.480
It retails at $20 on Steam.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.579
