00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.430
The sauce is reduced nicely. I'm going to
add the seafood (including the crab meat this

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.889
time) into the stock. We're going to add a
little more water to this, just enough to

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:23.689
cover the seafood. It smells good. You can
smell the seafood, it's very good, very nice.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:30.110
We'll bring this up to barely a boil. When
you see the bubbles come up around the edges,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:40.520
it's time to remove the seafood.
While we're waiting for our stock to come

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.340
back up to a boil, let's get out rue going.
The rue will thicken up the sauce. That consists

00:00:47.340 --> 00:01:06.430
of about a quarter cup of butter, an equal
amount of flour. There are different types

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:14.180
of rues that you can use. What we're doing
here will be a blond rue. You're going to

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:22.110
cook it, it will have a smooth texture. It
will start to take on a nutty smell, that's

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:28.230
the flour and butter cooking. The longer you
cook a rue, the less thickening power you

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:34.940
have; however, the longer you cook it, the
more flavor you get. A brown rue is typically

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:44.810
used for brown sauces. Blond rues are typically
used for white sauces, or off-cream sauces.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.650
The Newburg sauce is pretty much an off-cream
sauce, so we will be using a blond rue. I

00:01:52.650 --> 00:02:01.820
see the Newburg sauce is starting to come
to a boil, so we'll let the rue roll as we

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:12.120
remove the seafood. Again, we don't want to
overcook anything here. We just want to get

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:42.060
more flavor out of this. We'll bring this
back up to a boil, and we're going to add

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.010
our herbs, our rue to thicken it up, add the
seafood back, and we'll be ready. Here's our

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:56.280
fresh herbs; fresh basil, tarragon and dill.
We're also going to squeeze in some lemon,

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:16.230
like so. One more time.

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:22.770
Check our rue, it's looking good. It's starting
to take on a light color around the edges.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:39.459
That's what we're looking for. Back to a boil
here, and I'm going to add just a little cream

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.989
to this. That takes the harshness off it and
smoothes it off a bit; not that this is a

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:52.550
harsh sauce, it's just a good compliment.
Typically, if you're going to add a lot of

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:57.099
cold or room temperature cream to something
hot, you should heat it up first. If you're

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:03.660
just going to add a little bit, like one cup,
you can do that. Add a little bit at a time,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:09.599
and stir it in right away. If you add too
much and it's ice cold, it will break. Your

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:25.020
whole sauce will be busted. You don't want
that. Let's hope that doesn't happen here.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:33.330
That's all we need; that has the typical Newburg
color, a rust color, if you will. We're going

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:41.460
to bring this up to a boil. We're going to
add our rue, it's perfect right now. You can

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:50.020
see it's a smooth texture, and the smell I'm
getting is nutty. That's what we're looking

00:04:50.020 --> 00:05:00.509
for.
The Newburg is coming up to a boil. It's almost

00:05:00.509 --> 00:05:01.330
show time.
