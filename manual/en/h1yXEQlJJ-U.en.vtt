Hello, my name is David Kautzky. You can know me as "Thorus", and this is story of my life.

00:00:21.551 --> 00:00:25.200
I'm a simple guy who work on the farm; I am fond of archery,

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.000
horse riding, and walking in nature. 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:42.360
I like to learn new cultures, new languages and get new friends all over around the world.

00:00:44.644 --> 00:00:47.315
When I was 10 I started to play computer games.

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:53.288
At that time RPG and strategies were popular, and 'cool' action games didn't attract my attention.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.957
When I entered the university friend of mine told me: 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.100
“Hey, I have access to a closed beta of World of Tanks. Should I get you in?”

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.620
And I said "Wow, tank action, that should be amazing. Let's do it!" So I start playing this game.

00:01:13.992 --> 00:01:21.039
During the beta I learned that every type of tank has a really nice background and you can play really anything you want. 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.160
Currently our team have new sponsor and we are named as TCM-Gaming

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.720
and thats what can you see us in offline finals of the season number 4.

00:01:40.294 --> 00:01:46.514
The most important person for me is my brother, he didn't used to play this game, but he was my fan

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:56.342
and now he start to play a game and have a great feeling from it. I'm proud that he can teach each others and they can become really great.

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:07.011
Many people ask me how I achieve results like this.

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.989
Its a lot of hard work. I’ve been playing World of Tanks for 4 years 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.720
and now it's not just a game for me, it is a part of my life.

00:02:23.265 --> 00:02:27.359
So I wish to all new players to believe in themselves, never give up no matter what

00:02:27.434 --> 00:02:33.651
and remember that everyone can be a winner in World of Tanks where everything depends on you.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.240
Let's battle!
