00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:07.420
The biggest thing that you need to master
is which stabilizer goes with which fabric.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.190
Once you have the basics, then you can start
to experiment.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.200
Here's the thing with stabilizer, you get
strength with the layers.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.650
I always use a minimum of two layers of stabilizer.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.400
If you're going to just use one, you might
not get the results you're looking for.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.220
That's going to depend on how many stitches
are in a design.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.270
If it's a very heavily stitched design like
a tiger's face, you're going to need more

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.500
stabilizer; two, maybe three depending on
the fabric that you're working with.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.760
Let me go down a quick little way to remember.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.480
If your fabric stretches, so you have tee
shirts, sweat shirts, that type of thing,

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.970
you need to use a cutaway stabilizer.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:53.160
This stabilizer is literally cut away around
the outside of the design and left to support,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.500
to be the foundation inside a project.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.370
For example on this sweatshirt, you will see
the stabilizer still inside.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.820
If you've ever had a sweatshirt and you're,
"Gosh, why did they leave the stabilizer in

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:06.820
there?"

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.030
It's to support the stitches.

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.170
That means I can actually pull on these stitches
and they don't pop.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.170
If I had tear away stabilizer on that, and
I pulled, those stitches will all start to

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.420
break; cutaway stabilizer on anything stretchy.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.049
Is denim stretchy?

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:25.180
It is.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.950
I prefer to use cutaway stabilizer on the
back of jean fabric, denim fabric.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.189
It does have stretch.

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.630
I don't know about you, but when I take my
jeans out of the dryer after they've been

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.619
washed, they're a little tight.

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.540
About noon time, they're just right.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.470
I've stretched them out.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.490
Some denim these days have the lycra in them.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:48.470
They're actually stretch denim, so definitely
need the support system for those stitches

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:49.470
going on there.

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:54.520
Two layers on the back of this made the design
really turn out nice and flat.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.630
This has been washed a couple of times.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.020
We really see the results of good, quality,
properly amount of stabilizer in your project.

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:04.869
A lot of you are quilters.

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.579
We're talking about quilt fabric, cotton fabrics,
medium weight woven fabrics.

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:13.129
This is silk, we just went ahead and used
a tear away stabilizer.

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:18.349
If your fabric is a woven, you can use tear
away stabilizer.

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:22.829
That will allow you to tear it away nicely
from back behind it and then be able to quilt

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:28.010
it or not see it if it is going to be seen
on the back side and not covered up or quilted

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.049
in.

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:30.629
That is a nice stabilizer.

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:35.139
Remember just because you want to not see
it doesn't mean you want to change out on

00:02:35.139 --> 00:02:38.019
stretchy fabrics.

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:44.150
On the fabric that is a terry cloth, people
always ask is that a woven or stretch?

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.609
Technically, all fabric is stretch because
I don't know about you, but last time I tried

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:54.299
to sew on the diagonal, it was a little wavy
because it stretches on that bias edge.

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:55.879
All fabric has stretch to it.

00:02:55.879 --> 00:02:59.989
If you're going to run out of stabilizer,
don't run out of the cutaway.

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:06.749
You can always use cutaway stabilizer on the
back of a woven fabric.

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:11.149
It's like the universal stabilizer; maybe
not the best one for the final result.

00:03:11.149 --> 00:03:14.659
Would you want cutaway stabilizer on the back
of a towel?

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:18.419
Probably not;
you'll probably want to use a tear away stabilizer.

00:03:18.419 --> 00:03:21.359
You want to remove it so nobody sees it on
the back side.

00:03:21.359 --> 00:03:27.450
There's also stabilizer that we use on the
top for fabrics like a towel, terrycloth,

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.609
fleece, things with a nap.

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:35.290
If you don’t put a little water soluble
stabilizer on top, the loops come showing

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.709
through your stitches.

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:37.920
That does not look good at all.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.879
What you want to do is you'll hoop up your
fabric with your stabilizer, two layers.

00:03:43.879 --> 00:03:48.339
Right before you embroider it, you can just
put a small piece of stabilizer just over

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:50.680
the area right on top of the fabric.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.419
Once that stitching starts, it will hold it
in place.

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:59.049
There's some other key things that I like
to use, some spray adhesives.

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.079
My favorite, the 505 spray now, the new web
bond.

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.790
This one sprays a little bit more direct so
I don't get so much overspray and gumminess

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:08.790
on my hoops.

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:14.569
This one has, I would always suggest spraying
maybe over in a box or with an area covered

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:15.979
with a sheet.

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:20.509
That way overspray doesn't get on tables or
sewing machines and that type of thing.

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:22.069
Both are really really good.

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:23.910
They're a temporary spray adhesive.

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.270
Often spray my stabilizer.

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:30.200
By the way you'll always want to spray the
secondary layer, not your project.

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.130
You want to spray the stabilizer.

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.949
That stick will not transfer to your fabric.

00:04:35.949 --> 00:04:37.110
That is of course what you want.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.110
Also, it's just temporary.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.510
Once you start to wash it, it goes away.

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.800
Even in the air it will dissipate and completely
come off your project unless you use too much.

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.480
There has been issues where people are spraying
and spraying.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:50.620
It might get too gummy.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:53.690
It might take more to get it off your project.

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:58.120
Another thing that water soluble stabilizer
that you can get, you could use that in place

00:04:58.120 --> 00:04:59.770
of a tear away.

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.319
A tear away, once it's actually stitched,
it's perforated.

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.610
You find yourself with nothing really back
there.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.949
It really was just during the embroidery process
that it was holding things together in the

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:12.250
hoop.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:16.180
A water soluble stabilizer on the back of
something that you're going to see a lot,

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:19.020
that would be one thing you can substitute
out.

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:25.330
For example this is a recipe towel, something
I like to do, take a famous family recipe

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:26.419
and do it out.

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:31.169
You can do some great gifts, maybe put together
a little gift basket if it included grandma's

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:36.590
famous apple pie and put in with a new bushel
of apples fresh from the orchard.

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:40.410
This would be something where I would use
a water soluble stabilizer on the back.

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:45.050
Then I don't have to pick out that tear away
stabilizer from every little letter in there.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.389
It really makes a difference.

00:05:47.389 --> 00:05:48.389
That's one place.

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.479
I sometimes will use water soluble stabilizer
on the top of something that probably doesn't

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:54.099
need it.

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:59.229
It actually helps keep your stitches a little
bit more raised and professional looking.

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:03.969
If you really want it to look good, you can
add that little extra layer on top.

00:06:03.969 --> 00:06:06.030
Everything washes away when it's done.

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:10.599
Those stitches really show up a little bit
taller and a little bit fuller when you're

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:11.599
finished.

00:06:11.599 --> 00:06:18.830
This one was actually just a cross stitch
design that was stitched on a towel where

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:20.180
you'd normally do by hand.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:21.949
This was done with embroidery software.

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:27.550
That's something you want to talk to your
local Husqvarna Viking dealer about software

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.460
to add and go on further and use your machine
for something totally more fun.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:37.539
Another thing people will sometimes use, you've
got a lot of designs that are considered quilting

00:06:37.539 --> 00:06:38.539
designs.

00:06:38.539 --> 00:06:44.530
Very easy to stitch, these designs almost
… they don't take hardly any time at all.

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.249
We're going through all the layers.

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:49.240
We're going through your quilt top, your batting,
and your back.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.090
You don't need stabilizer.

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.819
The batting will act as your stabilizer.

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:57.210
I will tell you this looks so good.

00:06:57.210 --> 00:07:01.389
It will take you longer to hoop up the project
than it will to actually stitch the design

00:07:01.389 --> 00:07:02.389
out.

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:08.169
By the time you get it hooped and on the machine
and fabric moved around, that design stitches

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:09.520
out super quick.

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.740
That's just a quick rundown with stabilizer.

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:14.719
You heard me talk about hooping the stabilizer
with your fabric.

00:07:14.719 --> 00:07:20.279
You're going to have a much better success
if you do that when all the fabric stabilizer

00:07:20.279 --> 00:07:22.090
is all together in the hoop.

00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:23.629
There's times where you can't hoop something.

00:07:23.629 --> 00:07:27.400
You could use the stabilizer and just hoop
the stabilizer.

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.279
You can use some temporary spray adhesive.

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:31.229
Spray the middle of the hoop and stick it
down.

00:07:31.229 --> 00:07:35.789
Some of the stabilizers are actually a sticky
stabilizer where they actually have a peel

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:38.270
away and you stick your project down.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.249
It doesn't go anywhere while it's embroidering.

00:07:40.249 --> 00:07:41.610
It's usually a tear away.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:46.340
Then you tear that all away from your project
and really holds it very nice.

00:07:46.340 --> 00:07:49.770
Also, stabilizers come in usually a couple
different sizes.

00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:55.749
If you're working with your smaller hoop for
a project, why waste the extra stabilizer

00:07:55.749 --> 00:07:57.169
from a taller roll?

00:07:57.169 --> 00:07:58.210
Spend the extra money.

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:59.870
Get a small roll.

00:07:59.870 --> 00:08:01.650
You'll use it up.

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:05.879
That way it's just right for the hoops that
you're working with.

00:08:05.879 --> 00:08:10.020
We're going to get into a little bit more
detail on hooping and take a look at all the

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:11.871
other videos that we've been doing for this
machine.
