00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.419
liberty university which some of you
right now is the extremely religious

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:08.399
carry follow university they had just
decided to allows students

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:13.329
to carry dyndns into campus buildings
classroom buildings all buildings except

00:00:13.329 --> 00:00:14.549
the dorms

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.570
uh... if u have a concealed carry permit
uh...

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.580
now there are very few colleges

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.610
around the nation that allow concealed
carry on campus i think there's about

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.539
twenty five colleges around the entire
country they do allow this so most still

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:29.279
down

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.400
um... and i think obviously with the

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:35.520
hot topic of gun control right now this
is still kind of a controversial issue

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.589
of do we allow concealed carry on campus
or do we not

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:44.210
andheri state-by-state what it takes to
get at concealed carry permit according

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.809
to having to impose it's a very easy to
obtain of concealed carry permit in

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.890
virginia so uh... i think the argument
against a says will now just any seem to

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.170
be criminal containers of concealed
carry permit

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.820
come onto campus

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.490
and you know should everybody up

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:03.490
the n_r_a_'s argument is always well it
takes a good guy with a gun to stop a

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.160
bad guy with a guy and so now we're
gonna have more good guys and girls with

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.420
guns on campus

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.220
so if there is the masoud and maybe
somebody can prevent it uh... what's

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.270
your take on

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.080
concealed carry on kanye think the the
the basis for rational discussion about

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.510
gun control should always start with
arbitrarily labeling some people is good

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.930
guys and it was bad guys because that's
how the world really

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:27.070
hashes out

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:30.860
uh... know their gradations in people's
ethics and morality are influenced by

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.540
their emotional state of mind how much
they've been drinking i would stress

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.410
they have

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.429
of three of those things are are
pleading brooklyn college from time time

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:41.289
and it changes for people like it's easy
to just imagine

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.900
that's a bad guy he's a villain and i
will stop him but that's not

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:48.290
so how the world actually works like yet
you might be the person is a go on

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.180
campus here to stop the shooter and i'd
make you a little work warlord someday

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:56.110
we all have fantasies about what's going
to go down in the rest of our life uh...

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.780
but the most further cynicism bailey
we're going to talk about this before

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:01.780
uh... like there there there

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.090
people on both sides they'll they'll
have that argument

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.459
depart that i want to focus on feel free
to should not do this uh... is that this

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.419
is this is our religious university

00:02:11.419 --> 00:02:15.709
and it just seems like i'd totally get
liked it if you're big on liberty and

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.019
you know you want to write senior
freedoms you'll do you think it's

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:22.039
perfectly fine heavy guns at jaxx
intellectually right a lot to be

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:24.700
consistent at least weather not actually
results in

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.159
in good things for the country

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.549
but for like the religious school to be
like we need guns in campus

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:37.549
jesus would not have been packing doing
then

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:49.989
but follow his example any exit routes
and things yet it may be the decades

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.889
after he died and it went through
coupled intermediaries

00:02:52.889 --> 00:02:56.639
but he was pretty clear on aren't
turning that the other cheek and stuff

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:57.819
in than packing

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:01.750
and so it just seems totally off base in
in the hypocritical i think what i think

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.020
it's interesting about this valley is

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:07.549
mother jones if you like haven't seen it
had done some incredible

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.519
studies on mass shootings over the last
you know

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.649
thirty-six year something like that
uh... and has found that of big dozens

00:03:14.649 --> 00:03:20.079
and dozens of mass killings no good guy
with a gun had ever stopped a bad guy

00:03:20.079 --> 00:03:23.759
with a guy and that's not necessarily
only because they word stephanie's

00:03:23.759 --> 00:03:27.079
nationals were in places that unsworn
allowed i think they were some of them

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:30.399
were in places where concealed carry was
allowed so i think

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:34.210
it's just not often and it according to
mother jones pretty much never

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.590
that a good guy with a gun will stop
about guy with a gun side by no means

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.599
think that second then arranged to be
completely taken away

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:44.220
i don't think that every single person
who wants to own a gun is a bad guy in

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.879
this means that there's gonna be a bunch
of

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:48.569
people a concealed carry or about to
shoot up the campus

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.409
uh... but i do think that it is possible
to take second any breaks too far

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:55.650
all right they have resides in its
inception the second then it was meant

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.730
to have limitations you can't have an
f_-fifteen fighter jet you can't have

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:01.539
any sort of bipin of protection that you
want

00:04:01.539 --> 00:04:03.049
and i think that

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:07.369
you know it's just again a turkey
conversation about

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:11.329
date and what's not and especially if
concealed carry permits are lied to

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:12.249
obtain

00:04:12.249 --> 00:04:15.719
it becomes a lot less faith in my
opinion and i also think if you don't

00:04:15.719 --> 00:04:19.659
get used to seeing time's on campus
because so many people can legally carry

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:21.139
them in and are not

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:22.199
harmful

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:25.939
you're going to be less alerts when
somebody then does bring back onto

00:04:25.939 --> 00:04:29.360
campus who doesn't want a great harm and
so you're gonna see if i didn't think

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:32.960
well probably in not doing anything you
kind of has a concealed carry permit and

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:37.749
offer all you know he could be ready tvb
the nasa next match you dare whereas if

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:40.009
you're not allowed to have guns on
campus

00:04:40.009 --> 00:04:42.960
granted there might not be the good guys
there to stop them but at least as soon

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:46.229
as you see somebody with a gun you may
know something is wrong to use our

00:04:46.229 --> 00:04:47.990
spirit what my yet

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.309
so i could get there

00:04:49.309 --> 00:04:53.379
and on and on stresses on somalia can
explain to me it's not about this in the

00:04:53.379 --> 00:04:55.150
main show yesterday

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.849
we did when we say you're more likely to
accidentally shot yourself your

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:02.780
girlfriend when you're driving arguing
or something let me know that that any

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:07.150
person watching this thinks no i'm
responsible because a special were young

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:10.490
all humans think that they're there
distinct from everyone else in the world

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.029
this is an end billion people or
whatever but i think the responsible and

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:15.700
i know what i'm going to do

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.100
in the canadian army needs a
conservatism class independent safety

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:22.649
class and united shooting nobody's
safety everything

00:05:22.649 --> 00:05:26.360
but uh... i just yesterday uh... a
deputy had a party people came over his

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.090
house at some point he showed his guns
to his friends or something like that

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.509
and afterward a little girl walked up
into the bedroom found where the guns

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:34.969
and shot and killed his wife

00:05:34.969 --> 00:05:38.879
that deputy had been taking gun safety
classes well probably more than the

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:40.240
average college student

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.500
we all think that were responsible while
thinking we're gonna be safer guns

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.979
it just doesn't bear out these accidents
happen every single day and sustain

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:50.050
yourself and your family
interrelationships of trouble in the

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.230
future just don't have to go
