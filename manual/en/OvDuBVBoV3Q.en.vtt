Hey guys, Dr. Axe here.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.920
I'm founder of DrAxe.com, one of the largest
natural health websites in the world.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.160
One of the most common questions I've been
getting on my Facebook page as well as my

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.940
webpage recently is, people have been asking
"Dr. Axe, is coffee good for me?" or "Is coffee

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:23.250
good for you?"

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.890
The answer is yes and no.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.730
There's a lot of research, actually, that's
been coming out on coffee and coffee is one

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:34.170
of the most popular beverages around the world
today.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.860
But let me just first talk about why coffee
can be good for you and then also, why it

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:39.940
can be bad for you.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.690
For starters, one of the biggest reasons why
coffee is beneficial is because it contains

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.450
massive amounts of antioxidants.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.320
You know, one of the things that we're exposed
to all around the world today is large levels

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:54.320
of toxicity.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:00.030
So antioxidants can really help and slow the
aging process, it can help protect yourselves

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.170
against free radical damage.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.180
Coffee is actually one of the five highest
foods in antioxidants in the world today.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.799
So again, coffee, incredible in terms of its
antioxidants.

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.420
Also, coffee increases circulation and can
stimulate the liver.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.170
So it actually has maybe some supportive benefits
for the liver.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.850
Increases circulation, it's been shown to
improve overall exercise.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.140
It's been shown to increase blood flow to
the brain.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:31.090
So for those reasons, because of the mass
amount of antioxidants and the increase in

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.979
circulation, that's where the benefits of
coffee come from.

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.060
Now, here are the negatives of coffee.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.890
The big thing is caffeine and consuming that
much caffeine can have a, kind of an addictive

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:47.090
side effect as well as it can overstimulate
the body and it can burn out your adrenal

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.980
glands and really over-tax your body.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.630
So that's the big negative.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:58.220
For a country in America and then across the
world, 80% of people will suffer with some

00:01:58.220 --> 00:02:02.100
form of fatigue or adrenal fatigue sometime
in their life.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.420
Because of that, if somebody is struggling
with fatigue on a regular basis or has thyroid

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.900
issues, adrenal issues or hormonal issues,
for that reason I do not recommend those people

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.430
consume coffee because of all of the caffeine
that you're going to find there.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.439
Again, that caffeine is really the main issue
with coffee is that it will burn out your

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.439
adrenal glands.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:22.439
Think about this.

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:26.549
Do you think you were created to rely on stimulants
all the time?

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:28.650
That's really what caffeine is, it's a stimulant.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:34.819
So doing large amounts of caffeine is not
good at all for people with adrenal fatigue,

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:40.749
thyroid problems or people with even autoimmune
disorders or other chronic illness, I do not

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:42.450
recommend coffee for those people.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.180
But, if you're already generally healthy or
let's say you just struggle with some circulation

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.599
issues or you're trying to support the brain
and you don't have autoimmune disease or any

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.639
type of thyroid or adrenal issue.

00:02:53.639 --> 00:02:59.060
In that case, consuming coffee in moderate
amounts can be fine and even good for your

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:00.060
health.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.579
Now, when you're consuming coffee, you need
to consume it in the morning or before lunch.

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.760
Because what happens, if you start drinking
it in the afternoon or especially in the evening,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.169
the life of coffee and the caffeine and how
long it will affect your body can be around

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:15.269
12 hours.

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.920
If you're consuming it in the afternoon, it
can definitely affect your sleep cycle that

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:21.920
night.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:25.930
Not just you falling asleep, but your overall
quality of sleep while you're trying to sleep

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:26.930
that night.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:27.930
So again, is coffee good?

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.090
Is it bad?

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.120
The truth is, coffee, it just really depends
on your body.

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.510
It depends on if you have one of these conditions,
coffee can make it worse.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.400
Versus if you're looking for a little bit
of a pick me up, you're going to do it earlier

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.269
in the day, you need more antioxidants and
circulation, for those reasons, coffee can

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.420
have some of those major health benefits.

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:48.719
And when buying coffee, here's the other thing.

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:52.970
You must by organic, natural coffee if you're
going to consume it.

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.260
Coffee is one of the most highly sprayed plants
in the entire world today and I think, really,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.900
a better option than coffee in general as
well is doing things like teas.

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:09.689
Matcha green tea, an amazing superfood that
has about a third the amount of caffeine as

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:10.689
coffee.

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:13.840
Also, white tea, rooibos tea, oolong tea.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.959
These are good teas as well that you may consider
adding in and most of those have about one-third

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:18.959
the amount of caffeine.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.700
So you could consume a couple cups a day and
you're actually going to be getting more benefits.

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:27.110
So that's what I would recommend overall.

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.360
If you want to, just get a little bit of caffeine
and support your organs as well, then again,

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.290
switching over to tea is your best option.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.380
I know there's a lot of coffee lovers out
there.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.840
So again, if your body does well with coffee,
you do it earlier in the day and you do an

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.060
organic brand, I think you're going to do
coffee.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.560
But for other people, doing some herbal teas
with some of those medicinal benefits is a

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.560
better option.

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.880
So this has been myself, Dr. Axe, answering
your question "Is coffee good for you?"

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:53.850
The answer is yes and no.
