00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:11.300
Embryonic stem cells are a huge next step
for medicine, but they’re mired in controversy.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.410
So what if you could have all the benefits
of regenerative medicine, without the thorny

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:23.259
moral dilemma?

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:25.790
Hello Science Lovers, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:30.310
There’s been a huge breakthrough in medicine
this week; Induced pluripotent stem cells

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.620
were used in a tissue transplant for the first
time ever.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:34.620
We did it!

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.620
Yeah!!

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:38.440
Oh am I going to need to explain that?

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.440
Ok.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.910
First, let’s get everybody up to speed on
stem cells.

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.940
This is more important to you than you realize
because you were at some point nothing more

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.249
than 50 to 150 of them.

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:51.610
You probably don’t remember, it was only
4 days after you were conceived.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.859
What makes Embryonic Stem Cells amazing is
they are pluripotent, meaning they can become

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:58.429
almost any type of cell.

00:00:58.429 --> 00:01:02.670
This means they can be used to replace damaged
tissue and may one day be an alternative to

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.780
organ transplants.

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:04.780
This is huge.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:09.490
In the United States an average of 79 people
receive an organ transplant every day, but

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.130
another 18 people die waiting for a transplant
that will never come.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.250
The 79 who do get a donor will have to take
medication to prevent transplant rejection

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.210
for the rest of their lives, but even then
the risk remains.

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.790
That problem doesn’t exist with embryonic
stem cells.

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.520
So we can save thousands of people a year
and improve the quality of life and lifespan

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.020
of tens of thousands more.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:30.020
What’s the problem here?

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.229
Well the only way to get pluripotent cells
is from embryos.

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.450
Which are pre-people.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.260
Or current people, depending on where you
stand on the issue.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.909
Obviously, there’s a heated controversy
there and I’m sure the comments will reflect

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.610
that (be nice, guys).

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.299
Umbilical cord blood has multipotent stem
cells, but they’re more limited.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.570
And we all have adult stem cells but those
are even less versatile.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.280
So there are no alternatives.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.280
Until now.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.969
Shinya Yamanaka of Kyoto University discovered
a method to create pluripotent stem cells

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:00.060
from adult cells.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.900
It’s like diet stem cells: all of the flavor
with none of the calories.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.460
Though “flavor” in this case means life-changing
benefits and “calories” means severe moral

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.020
dilemma of using undeveloped humans in medicine.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.500
And for his breakthrough, Yamanaka shared
the nobel prize for physiology in 2012.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.600
And now, here we are, September 2014, where
on friday, at 2:20 local time, japanese doctors

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:28.200
stopped the macular degeneration of a 70 year-old
woman by transplanting a sheet of retinal

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.280
pigment epithelium cells derived from induced
pluripotent stem cells made from reprogrammed

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.010
cells of the patient’s own skin!

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.580
We did it!

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:38.580
Probably!

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.980
Now we wait and see if the procedure checks
the macular degeneration without becoming

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:45.110
cancerous or rejected.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.460
By the way the sheet of tissue used was just
3 by 1.3mm.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.400
That’s about that big.

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.730
And what a huge step that is.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.680
If you’d like to learn more about how your
eye works and why the macula is important

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:59.810
to vision, check out THIS video.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.540
As a bonus, you can stare deep into Trace’s
dreamy, dreamy eyes.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:08.790
Can you think of any creative potential uses
for induced pluripotent stem cells *cough*

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:10.970
Wolverine *cough*?

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.260
Let us know in the comments.

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:14.880
Hopefully it stems productive discussion.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:18.900
