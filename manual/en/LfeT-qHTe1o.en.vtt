00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.780
Today I will be making potato skin.

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.600
Boiled potato filled with spicy chickpeas.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:23.500
It’s a mouth-watering snack.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.600
It looks great and tastes yummy.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.760
This is a great appetizer for the people

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.509
who don’t like to eat fried food and oily food.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.520
It takes very little oil.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.400
This recipe will serve 4.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.180
For this recipe we need:

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.520
4 medium size red potatoes

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:52.940
I like to use the red potatoes for this recipe.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.000
Because after boiling they hold the shape.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.760
2 tablespoons of oil

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.280
2 teaspoons of salt

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.440
For filling we need

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.640
1/2 cup of garbanzo beans

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:11.520
I have already soaked for about 8 hours.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.800
And as you see it has become more than double in volume.

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.520
1/2 teaspoon of salt

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.880
1/4 teaspoon of black salt

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.280
1/2 teaspoon of roasted ground cumin seed

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.920
1/4 teaspoon of black salt

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.060
About 1 tablespoon of finely chopped ginger.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.620
1 green chilli finely chopped, adjust to your taste.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.280
1/2 teaspoon of mango powder

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.559
1/2 teaspoon of garam masala

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.680
1 teaspoon of lemon juice

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.200
About 2 tablespoons of tamarind sweet sour chutney.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.180
About 2 tablespoons of hari cilantro chutney.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.940
To check the recipe you can go to my website.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.360
Water is boiling.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.220
And I am using about 3 cups of water.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.130
So add the oil.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.580
And salt.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.780
And then I am going to add all the potatoes.

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:24.080
And let it boil over medium heat.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.160
And this should take about 15 minutes.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:29.980
And I will cover this.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.840
While potatoes are boiling I will make the filling.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.320
I have already boiled the chickpeas

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.740
using the pressure cooker.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.620
After pressure cooker starts steaming.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:50.960
I have lowered the heat and cooked for 6 minutes.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.000
And I used 1.5 cups of water.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.960
If you are not using the pressure cooker

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:59.380
it will take about 1.5 hours.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.320
But while you are boiling the chickpeas

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.480
do not use the salt.

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.140
It takes longer to cook and it does not come out this soft and tender.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.440
Heat is on, medium high.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.060
First I am going to add the chickpeas.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:24.160
And all the ingredients.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.500
Salt

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:30.860
Garam masala

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:33.800
Ginger

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:37.920
Green chillies

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.420
Black pepper

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.500
Mango powder

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:46.520
Roasted cumin seeds

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.080
And lemon juice.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:52.440
Mix it well.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.080
And after it comes to boil,

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.780
let it cook for 3-4 minutes.

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.640
As you see chickpeas are boiling.

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.420
So now I am going to mash them slightly.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.820
And let it cook for another 4-5 minutes.

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:16.020
This should have the thick gravy.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.520
Chickpeas are ready and smelling great.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.760
It has taken about 3 minutes.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.500
I have already turned off the heat.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.220
And do not dry any more than this.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.820
Because after it cools off, it will dry little more.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.460
So as you see they are ready.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.700
Potatoes have been boiling for about 12 minutes.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.240
So let’s check it if they are ready.

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.171
And just put the fork in and they are very soft and tender.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.740
So it’s time to take them out from the water.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:05:03.360
And we will let it cool off, before we will scoop the potatoes out.

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.220
Potatoes are ready too be assembled.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.960
These potato bowls are looking really good.

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:14.260
Very firm and good in shape.

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:20.320
So first I am going to coat them with hari cilantro chutney.

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:25.360
And it gives a nice color and very nice flavor.

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:34.520
And now we will put some spicy chickpeas.

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.600
And drizzle with tamarind sweet and sour chutney.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.180
And how pretty it looks.

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:06.800
So I am going to first coat it with the hari cilantro chutney.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:19.680
Now put the spicy chickpeas.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.100
And drizzle with tamarind sweet and sour chutney.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:39.720
This is looking beautiful potato skin.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:47.400
Potato skins are looking great.

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.920
Very tempting.

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.960
This makes a great party food.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:58.140
It’s a very healthy appetizer for the people

00:06:58.150 --> 00:07:03.590
who like to avoid oily food and still likes spicy.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.020
