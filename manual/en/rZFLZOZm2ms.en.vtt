Hi! I’m Tiffany Windsor. I have a project that you can create for Father’s Day.

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:24.230
We’re gonna get the little ones all dressed up.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:28.849
And I am using my Aleene’s Fabric Fusion Peel and Stick Sheets.

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.190
These are no sew

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.190
permanent and washable.

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.840
So what you can create is lettering to put on the little one’s wearables

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:40.560
and this is so easy!

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:45.520
The first thing that you want to do is select your fabric and I always like to pre-wash my fabrics,

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:47.039
whether it's the

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.780
little onesies  or shirts and also the fabric that you’re
actually going to be 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:58.570
gluing down on to your wearable. This is the Aleene’s Fabric Fusion Peel and Stick Sheet and

00:00:58.570 --> 00:00:59.159
you just pull off

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.210
that back liner and put it right down.

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.570
I need to tell you, this is very, very, very
sticky so try and keep your fingers

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.890
out of that glue.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:17.350
Press it very firmly along the edges. If you have a die cutting machine you can run this 
right through your die cutter 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.790
You could also transfer any sort of lettering patterns right on

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:28.600
and draw right onto this piece of lining that is on the back
of the Aleene’s Fabric Fusion.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.550
So, once you have your letters all cut,

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.140
you needed to decide where you're going
to place them on your wearable.

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:42.740
And the key to releasing these is to make sure that that glue is very

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.940
firmly pressed down along the edge

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.250
and then you peel 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.190
off the backing

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:57.190
and again this is very sticky so be
careful when you take it off.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.440
And I want to be sure that I have
this placed exactly where I want it to line up

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.169
and you just peel and stick.

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:13.649
So there's no ironing 

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:19.589
to put this lettering down.

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:21.989
Peel and stick!

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.739
You know if you wanted to, if you needed to
keep your letters nice and straight you could

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:30.770
use a piece of your blue tape or you could use
a disappearing ink pen

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:35.269
and follow that when you're putting
your letters down,

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:38.299
onto the wearable.

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.599
Rub your fingers over that… make sure
that you get all of those edges down

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.789
securely because you want to be sure
that those stay right in place

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:50.459
when you wash this piece.

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.769
It’s fun also to take some

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.670
other designs… again you can use your
die cut machine

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.179
put some flowers down

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:04.269
put some other cute shapes down on your wearable.

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.780
That is how quick and easy it is for you to decorate

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.579
a wearable  for the little ones for Father's Day.

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:17.059
The Aleene’s Fabric Fusion Peel and
Stick Sheets are available at Michaels.

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:21.099
It's terrifically tacky and creatively cool!
