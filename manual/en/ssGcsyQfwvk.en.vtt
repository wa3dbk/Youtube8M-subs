Yo, Matt Guf here for The House Snowboard
Shop. This is the Burton Access snowboard

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:14.111
jacket. It's part of the Slim Fit series.
It's going to fit like a street wear jacket

00:00:14.111 --> 00:00:19.289
almost. There of course is the T fit which
is the largest and most relaxed, there's the

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.830
Sig fit which is about right in the middle,
and then there's the Slim Fit, and that's

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:29.960
what this is. Kind of that emo rocker look
to it. The jacket has the 2-Layer Durashell

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.860
DRYRIDE technology. It's a combination of
two things. 1) The abrasion-resistant fabric

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:40.970
on the outside, and 2) the waterproof and
breathable membrane that goes just right underneath

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:48.080
it. This jacket has 10,000mm of waterproofing
material and 5,000mm of breathability. So,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:53.510
it's going to be not as water-resistant as
some of the jackets that are out there, it's

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.961
going to be quite breathable though. So if
you're not riding too cold of conditions this

00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:01.530
is going to be a great jacket. Again, you
know, as you look at it, it looks like you

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.630
could wear this to a bar if you wanted, you
know. You get done riding, you don't want

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:11.850
to have that huge dappered jacket, you just
kind of want to just be a normal dude. You

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.780
could definitely go to the bar or just drive
around in this jacket if you want. Now this

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.751
jacket has a lot of cool features inside of
it, a lot of cool features on the outside

00:01:18.751 --> 00:01:23.560
of it, of course. Even though it doesn't look
like much more than a shell, it actually has

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.750
a lot of insulation to it. It has 40 grams
of Thermacore just throughout the jacket,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.110
of course. There's a Taffeta lining which
gives it a nice socky, I guess it kind of

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:41.200
feels like a sock in here, soft, maybe a brand
new sock. An elastic hem closures, of course,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:48.110
and then fully taped seams, that's another
nice feature. A lot of jackets have, of course,

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.810
seams and there's lots of, there's thousands
of holes in your jacket. You could have the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.100
most water-proof Gore-Tex material out there,
but if your seams aren't taped, water is going

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.899
to penetrate through the membrane of your
jacket through those small little holes. This

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.890
jacket has fully taped seams all over. It
doesn't add too much bulk, it doesn't add

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.349
too much weight, but it definitely keeps this
jacket a lot more waterproof than it would

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:17.409
be if it didn't have the fully taped seams.
Of course the jacket hood is completely contoured

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:24.079
and you can adjust it as well. With a pull
of the string, you can make this baby nice

00:02:24.079 --> 00:02:27.870
and tight. It doesn't matter if you're wearing
a helmet or not a helmet or even just a baseball

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.519
cap, the hood's going to fit on your head
very well. There's, of course, adjustable

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:38.769
cuff closures. And on the belly pockets the
pockets are actually fleece-lined, and then

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.310
there's elastic closures on the inside and
you can pull those to make the bottom of your

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.049
jacket nice and tight. One of my favorite
features about the jacket too is the key ring

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.209
that you have here. So if you're shredding
around, or just riding around the streets,

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.540
yo, you can put your keys on there and you
won't lose them, that's for sure. Now on the

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.480
inside of the jacket there's a nice little
media pocket as well. So if you like to ride

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.650
with your headphones, I know I do, it's nice
and big. You could probably fit a pair of

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:11.279
goggles in there as well. But there is a headphone
liner system in here as well. So you can actually

00:03:11.279 --> 00:03:16.489
wire your headphones through the jacket so
they're not outside in the riding conditions

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.180
that you'll be riding around in. Of course
there's going to be a removable snow skirt.

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.260
Now the snow skirt is a nice interface with
the Burton snowboard pants. You can actually

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.519
attach the snow skirt to the snow pants. If
you don't have Burton snow pants don't worry

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.299
about it because you can still clip it like
this. It's going to keep all the snow and

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.549
keep all of the wind out, of course, when
you're riding around on the chair lifts. And

00:03:37.549 --> 00:03:41.719
of course there's going to be a hidden pass
pocket as well. So this is the Burton Access

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:48.479
jacket, part of the Slim Fit series with 10,000mm
of waterproof material and 5,000mm of breathable

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:54.900
material. I enjoy it, it has a nice chafe-free
chin collar, cool hood, and it looks like

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:59.760
leather. You could probably wear this picking
up girls if you want to. That's a good thing.

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:01.069
Good luck out there, men.
