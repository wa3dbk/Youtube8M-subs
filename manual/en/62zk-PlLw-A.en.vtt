00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.733
Jenny?
Just try to balance, okay?

00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:27.100
I am trying to,
but I can’t…

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:30.166
How’re you going to pass
the bike exam riding like that?

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.833
I will pass it!

00:00:32.833 --> 00:00:36.233
Uh, Look here, Jenny!
Watch me do it!

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:39.566
- Here it goes!
- Doug, you’re kidding me!

00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:41.866
No way you’re gonna
pass like that!

00:00:41.866 --> 00:00:43.633
Watch how it’s done!

00:00:43.633 --> 00:00:47.233
Yeah?
Well, look out! Ta da!

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:49.966
Wow! Not too bad!

00:00:49.966 --> 00:00:52.200
Check this out!

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.566
Hey! Where are you going?

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.900
- You all right?
- Yeah. Thanks a lot, Poli!

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.933
Practicing riding your bike?

00:01:12.933 --> 00:01:16.066
Yeah. But it’s hard to learn
to ride all by myself

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:18.066
because I keep on
falling down.

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:22.300
Oh No… I’ve got an idea.
I can help you learn how!

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.800
Yeah? Hooray, hooray!

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.733
I think I’m going to
fall down!

00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:34.833
Jenny, don’t look down
at the wheels.

00:01:34.833 --> 00:01:37.566
- Look ahead!
- Uh, I’ll try…

00:01:37.566 --> 00:01:40.533
That’s good.
And pedal a bit faster too!

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:43.200
- I’m scared…
- You can do it.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.733
If you pedal too slowly,
then you’ll fall down.

00:01:45.733 --> 00:01:49.100
- You can trust me!
- Here goes…

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:56.766
Wow! I’m doing it! Poli!
Are you holding on tight?

00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:59.866
No need! You’re doing
fine on your own!

00:01:59.866 --> 00:02:03.466
I AM? It’s working!

00:02:03.466 --> 00:02:05.300
I’m riding all by myself!

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.200
Be careful!

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:10.700
Are you ok?

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.633
I’m doing just fine!

00:02:12.633 --> 00:02:15.266
From now on, look ahead!

00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:19.933
You’ve become quite a rider,
Jenny!

00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:22.600
Well, if so, it’s all
because of your help!

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.866
Remember, Jenny, when you
ride your bike, rule number one!

00:02:25.866 --> 00:02:28.833
- safety first at all times!
- Right!

00:02:28.833 --> 00:02:32.066
You should make sure you’re
always looking ahead of you.

00:02:32.066 --> 00:02:34.166
Both hands should be
on the handlebars,

00:02:34.166 --> 00:02:36.033
ready to use the brakes.

00:02:36.033 --> 00:02:38.833
If you just use the front brake,
you may fall,

00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:41.733
so it’s always safer
to use both brakes.

00:02:41.733 --> 00:02:44.933
When you’re going downhill,
you can build up speed quickly,

00:02:44.933 --> 00:02:48.833
so it’s important to use your
brakes and stay in control.

00:02:48.833 --> 00:02:50.266
When you’re riding
on the road,

00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:52.666
it’s very important
to use hand signals

00:02:52.666 --> 00:02:54.000
to let others know
when you’re

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.333
turning, slowing down
or stopping.

00:02:56.333 --> 00:02:57.833
And when you
cross the street,

00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:01.666
you must get off
and walk your bicycle.

00:03:01.666 --> 00:03:05.366
- You’re doing great, Jenny!
- Thanks a lot, Poli!

00:03:06.666 --> 00:03:12.200
Attention! The bicycle safety
exam is about to begin!

00:03:16.666 --> 00:03:20.933
Points off! Points off!

00:03:20.933 --> 00:03:24.700
Points off! I’m sorry Doug,
but you failed the test!

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.966
Wow! That test was too hard!

00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:29.166
That’s too bad.
Watch and learn…

00:03:29.166 --> 00:03:32.366
I’ll show you how it’s done.
Oh yeah! Let’s do this!

00:03:32.366 --> 00:03:35.000
- Points off!
- Ya-hoo!

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.933
Too fast. Points off!

00:03:37.933 --> 00:03:40.033
Kevin, you failed!

00:03:40.033 --> 00:03:41.500
There’s no WAY
I could’ve failed!

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.200
Next entrant
please get ready!

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:48.100
- Excuse me…
- Jenny?

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:50.533
Hold on. You don’t
even know how to ride!

00:03:50.533 --> 00:03:53.733
You’re going to
look like a fool!

00:03:53.733 --> 00:03:56.733
Now, Here goes…

00:04:00.233 --> 00:04:02.266
Whoa!

00:04:02.266 --> 00:04:05.833
Alright. There!

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.733
A crosswalk means
I should walk with my bike….

00:04:26.133 --> 00:04:31.300
Congratulations! Entrant # 10,
Jenny, you passed the test!

00:04:44.966 --> 00:04:47.533
Hey! Don’t you remember
what I said?

00:04:47.533 --> 00:04:49.900
Get off and walk
when you cross the street!

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:50.433
Jenny!

00:04:50.433 --> 00:04:53.566
Rule number one:
safety first at all times!

00:04:53.566 --> 00:04:56.900
That’s right. You’re the ones
who failed the test, remember?

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.066
You two should be
extra careful!

00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:02.400
Alright… We’ve heard it
a million times before!

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.000
Listen! Did you check
your bicycles?

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.500
Kevin! Your seat looks like
it’s too high!

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.466
Stop! See you later!

00:05:10.466 --> 00:05:15.333
WAIT!! I’m not done teaching
you about bicycle safety!
