00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.800
Oh well, it's not going in

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.800
so this is a project to implement a basketball throw using MMD's physical engine

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.800
First, reconfigure the net using these hard frames, vertically and horizontally

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.800
Len kun's hand looks like this. I put a lot of effort in resembling a real hand's muscle structure using a lot of small cylinders. There is a small hole in the middle of the hand, otherwise it's quite complete

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.800
This is how the motion works

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.800
the rest is fine-tuning, and direction.. Let's see..

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.800
Humph

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.800
MMD's physical engine outputs something different every time based on the calculation speeds, so I thought a couple of trials may cut it, but it seems that the motion itself is flawed..

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.800
it skews a bit to the right, and it needs more forward impulse, so I moved the jumping frame a bit higher and to the left

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.800
Look at that! It's going a bit more straightforward

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.800
It seems to need more impulse, so let's jump forward

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.800
Home run! But the direction's set now

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.800
From this point on, hyper-fine tuning time!

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.800
Spot on!

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.800
Let's try once again with the same motion

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.800
Yup, it's not the same results every time

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.800
from a different angle..

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.800
I've shown the frames so that you can see how the physical engine works. The net seemed a bit too hard, so I softened it

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.800
Score!

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.800

Thank you every time, it's 1,048 yen!

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.800
Uh, Neru, you were here?

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.800
Hey, Len.. You were g.. great

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.800
Yeah? Thanks

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.800
It took me a lot of mistakes though

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.800
But Len kun.. You didn't give up until you scored, no?

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.800
I…

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.800
I've been giving up even before shooting

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.800
because I was scared of mistakes

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.800
didn't even have the courage to shoot for it

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.800
Huh?

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.800
But you know what?

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.800
I've made a resolution

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.800
watching you work hard on it

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.800
D.. Do you want to listen..?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.800
to my.. My resolution

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.800
Sure

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.800
Well,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.800
uh…

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.800
I, I… Len..

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.800
Weak!

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.800
Let me go

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.800
What's up with these reality-focused beings!

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.800
Neru!

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.800
Len kun!

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.800
Reality-focused beings like yourselves need to die!

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.800
Let Neru go!

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.800
if you don't let her go..

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.800
If I don't let her go.. What are you gonna do?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.800
You little punk?

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.800
How's that?

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.800
This is nothing compared to our hate towards reality-focused beings!

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.800
Len kun..

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.800
Neru, wait! I'm going to save you..

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:25.800
I likeeeeeeeeeeeee youuuuuuu------------!

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.800
Neru…!

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.800
Damn!

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.800
Stop the puppy play!

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:41.800
Uh?

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.800
Neru, are you okay?
0:04:46.000,0:04:39.800
D- damn!
0:04:48.000,0:04:47.800
reality-focused beings..

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.800
I hate you!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.800
Bwahahaha… OTL
