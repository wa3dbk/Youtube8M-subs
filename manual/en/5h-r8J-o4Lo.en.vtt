00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.800
So you have been skating for some time now, and you may have found out that the boot is not comfortable enough.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:11.860
What can you do about it?

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.360
Unfortunately, usually there is nothing you can do. However, there are some options.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.760
As for K2 skates – they have boot which can be after some time shaped.

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:31.400
That means, if you have K2 skates, they felt good at the store but then during ride they were not much comfortable, be patient.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.220
Skate and wait until the boot become loose a bit according to the shape of your feet.

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:43.240
It is possible that after several tens of kilometres the boot will be comfortable.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.620
If not, you have no other option than to buy another skates.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.600
Unfortunately, this is thing , and it applies to any other sport shoe, which you cannot find out when buying the skates.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:59.000
It is necessary to put a strain on it and then you find out whether it has adapted or not.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:05.840
Powerslide has heat-mouldable boots, which is quite unusual for fitness skates.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.380
You take out the boot out of the shell.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:23.280
These skates are from PS Vi series, you can recognize them by lacing Boa system with lacing string.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:39.200
You can take the boot easily out, put it into an oven (precise manual for this is available online), then you will put them on, tighten them properly and wait for some time.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.840
During this process the boot is adapted to the shape of the feet and it works really reliably.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.320
This is option for Powerslide skates only from Vi collection.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:54.580
In case you have any other skates which do not fit you comfortably, it depends on in what way they are uncomfortable.

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.660
If they are small, there is nothing you can do.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:02.220
But if, for example, is hard for you to maintain the balance, it is helpful to change the insoles.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.740
There are sometimes poor-quality insoles, especially in cheap skates.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:18.620
With orthopaedic or special sport insoles you can significantly improve skating attributes – controllability improves as well as feet setting.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:30.140
We offer standard sport insoles, or these mouldable ones, which are in my opinion top insoles.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:38.440
They can be used for ski boots, cross-country boots, and also skates.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.660
Insoles can be heated, put into skate and shaped.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.520
There is also some exercise for even better shaping.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.860
Disadvantage – definitely the price which is usually from 1 500 CZK to 2 000 CZK.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:06.460
But if you are fitness experienced skater who skates a lot and focuses on improving skating technique it is highly advisable to invest in new insoles.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:20.160
Another usual problem is, this applies especially for speed skates or any other hard skates, pressure sore in area of ankles and heels.

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:26.680
There is this special neoprene cover either 2mm or 3mm wide (maybe some other thickness).

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.760
You simply put these cover on the heel and then you put on the skate.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:39.960
It is very useful and helps to reduce the pressure on strained areas such as ankles and heels.

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:43.400
Racers and sport skaters use these covers very often.

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:50.480
Last option is the same as for these Powerslide skates (or rather its inner boot) – shaping with heat.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.180
These racing skates have often heat mouldable boot.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.700
What can be shaped is the skeleton of skate.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:09.740
Usually it applies for this carbon part which can be heated either whole in the oven or can be heated only partly, e.g. in the area of ankle or heel.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:18.200
The heating temperature differs according to producer so find out this information before heating.

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:32.000
I recommend trying this cover or new insoles first then if it does not help and feet are still hurt, try to mould the boot.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:54.740
Begin with partial moulding – only certain parts are heated so it is easier and it is also safer than putting whole boot in the oven– if you are not experience in this, the result can be that the boot is distorted and it is hard to shape it back and preserve its skating attributes.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.020
Partial moulding is done with common heat gun.

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:04.900
You just set the temperature and heat the part you want to shape.

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.780
We will have look at this in another video – what the boot can bear and not and how the shaping is done.

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:21.580
After you heat the boot well you can feel that it is softer (it is not like that is melting in your hands, with certain amount of pressure it feels that the material is softer).

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:33.280
Then take something with rounded end – for example this screwdriver and simply push against the material in problematic place.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.200
Very important is to mark precisely what place you want to shape.

00:05:38.840 --> 00:05:50.800
Shaping cannot be done endlessly – in some cases it can be done only once, sometimes couple of times as for high-quality skates, but no skates can be heated endlessly.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:56.340
Therefore choose wisely certain place you need to shape.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.540
So we have mentioned probably all possibilities how to make your skates more comfortable and improve setting of the feet.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.000
And of course, fine socks.

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:08.500
I take this as a natural thing.

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:11.580
High-quality sock makes a huge difference.

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:17.700
It is different whether you have think or thick sock, it is your choice.

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:28.040
In all cases, the sock must fit you; make sure it is not twisting somehow in the boot.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:31.220
Even little wrinkle can cause a lot of pain.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.240
Another thing is that the sock should be at least 2cm above the top of the skate.

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:44.900
The leg gets sweaty, although these materials are quite fine, but still, the leg is moving a bit during skating so you can scrape your leg on the top of the skate.

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:49.080
These parts have to be hard; otherwise the skate would not be stable.

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:52.060
So solve this problem with socks ending above the skate.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:07:00.840
And that is probably all about improving your skates, respectively comfort of feet.

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:11.480
We will have a look at moulding carbon boots in another video, in which we will demonstrate how to shape them.
