00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:12.540
Nokia 2730 Classic.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.630
The Nokia 2730 Classic is Nokia's cheapest
3G phone to date.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.440
Priced at around â‚¬80 before tax and subsidy,
it offers excellent value for money with surprisingly

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.570
few compromises along the way.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.509
It even manages to look good at the same time.

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.380
Nokia say that the 2730 is aimed at "emerging
markets", but this is a phone that is likely

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:37.739
to have wide market appeal due to the impressive
number of features it offers for a relatively

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.260
low outlay.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:48.270
The main features are dual-band UMTS support
(either 900/2100 or 850/1900 depending on

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:56.360
market), a 2" 240 x 320 pixel display, a 2
megapixel camera, microSD expandable memory

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:04.970
(up to 2GB), Bluetooth, a comprehensive multimedia
player, an FM radio and a 3.5mm audio socket.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:11.350
The standard sales package also includes a
1GB memory card and a stereo wired headset.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.360
The phone can be used as a tethered modem
through a USB or Bluetooth connection, and

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:21.390
the 2730 Classic comes with a web browser,
email client and a set of personal information

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.340
management tools.

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.579
Users can sign up for Ovi Mail on the phone,
and some markets also feature "Nokia Life

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:32.210
Tools" that we have looked at before.

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:38.329
Nokia say that the maximum talktime from the
1020 mAh battery is up to 3.3 hours on 3G

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:43.880
and 7.4 hours on GSM with around 17 days standby
time.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.610
The 2730 is very lightweight too, coming in
at just 88 grams.

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.999
We said that there are some compromises, but
they are few and far between.

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:58.609
The 2" display is a little on the small side,
the digital camera is rather basic and the

00:01:58.609 --> 00:02:01.359
expandable memory is not all that expandable.

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:07.039
There's no HSDPA support on the 2730 either,
so users are stuck with a maximum download

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:10.790
speed of 384 kbps.

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.470
There's no video calling camera, and the keypad
looks pretty but lacks proper moving keys.

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.590
But at this price, really who cares?

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:24.700
If you are looking for a high-performing phone
on a budget, then the Nokia 2730 Classic really

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.819
does look very impressive.

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:32.910
Even if you're not on a budget, do you really
need to spend more than this on a mobile phone?

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:39.540
Nokia say that the 2730 Classic should be
available during Q3 2009 in Black and Dark

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.260
Magenta colour combinations.
