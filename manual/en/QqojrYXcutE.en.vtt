00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:08.380
The colorful Baltimore oriole is a favorite
summer bird for many Kansans. The male is

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.169
bright orange marked with black, while the
female’s color is more subdued. Orioles

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.970
build the most intricate bird nests found
in America, and it’s not uncommon for their

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.310
woven baskets to hang for years before deteriorating.

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:30.199
A new nest is built each year. Sometimes,
an old oriole nest is stripped of fibers for

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.340
use in new construction. Otherwise, fibers
are pulled from the stalks of dead plants

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:43.360
or fibrous bark to provide strong threads.
String, horsehair, or fabric bits may also

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:50.960
be used. It takes about a week of continuous
work to complete the average oriole nest.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.280
Females do most of the work, but the male
also helps.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.040
Orioles build with purpose, though their stitching
is random. Even so, it’s clear they have

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:12.780
a process in mind. They usually select a hanging
limb about 25 feet high. The nest shown here,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.220
just six feet off the ground in a cottonwood,
provided a rare chance to watch construction

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.930
close up.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:27.070
Threads or grasses are at first wrapped around
sturdy twigs. Orioles don’t tie knots as

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.870
such, but instead push fibers through overlapping
wraps and then pull loose ends back through

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:40.330
with force. Repeated again and again, this
creates a tight weave. Crossing braces may

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:46.950
be woven in to help provide strength, especially
at points of nest attachment. The builder

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:53.140
works from above and below, and from side
to side. As the basket is formed, the bird

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.880
moulds its interior shape by pushing and stretching
with wings and breast. Fibers are poked through

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:06.020
the woven wall in a vigorous thrust-and-draw
movement like that of a sewing machine. The

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:13.870
end result has been called “an indescribable
chaos of looped and knotted fibers.”

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:19.150
Orioles choose dense pockets of foliage to
help hide the nest. It’s usually hard to

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.689
spot in summer leaves. But it makes a good
home for an average of four eggs, and for

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:31.280
a month or so, it’s headquarters for a new
family of Baltimore orioles. Common in Kansas,

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.239
it’s a yearly wonder of natural construction.
