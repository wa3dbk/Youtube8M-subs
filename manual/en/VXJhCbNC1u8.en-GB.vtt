00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.020
Hey hows it going guys, kris here, and today,
ill be giving you some pretty interesting

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.039
facts about the game, no mans sky.

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.109
Well to kick things off with a bang, a big
bang you could say, hello games have pretty

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.610
much played god, and created their own universe
full with procedurally generated planets and

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.780
life-forms, all inside a game. Now although
you have an entire universe to fly around

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.530
and discover, its not an infinite universe
and there's still a limit to how many planets

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.570
are in this universe, but don't worry, you
wont be running out of places to see, as the

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:43.289
games said to have over 18 quintillion planets
that you can visit. It might not be an infinite

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:48.550
universe, but it sure is a bloody massive
one.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.600
If youre one of them kinda guys or girls that
likes to see absolutely everything in a game,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.229
and simply wont put the controller down until
youve discovered it all, then you might be

00:00:56.229 --> 00:01:02.999
screwed with this one. No mans sky can't actually
be completed, not 100% anyway, even if you

00:01:02.999 --> 00:01:08.110
were to visit each planet for 1 second each,
it'd take you over 585 billion years to see

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.950
them all, so there's actually no way for any
one person to see everything the game has

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:21.210
to offer, and the sad thing is, its impossible
to even be able to see 0.0000001% of all the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.729
planets in the game, in a human lifetime.

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:31.180
Sooo, theres plenty of planets to see in the
universe of no mans sky, and each one is different,

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:34.640
but there are some factors that have been
implemented into the game to account for planetary

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.579
ecosystems and all that stuff, for example,
planets that are near to a sun are often barren

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.030
and, a lot of them dried out. This makes sense
for the effects that the sun would have on

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.950
them, whereas planets that are far away from
their sun are colder, and a lot of them frozen

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.450
over. planets in the middle will be more dense
with wildlife and plants. Though most of the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.929
planets in the game will be barren, theyll
still have a lot of valuable resources to

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.859
hunt for. Some planets will even be hazardous
and have properties that can kill you if you

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:07.299
dont upgrade your suit.
No mans sky may look like a crazily random

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:10.960
game, but that doesnt mean that real life
factors aren't taken into account when designing

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.220
the universe. Just like the good ole planet
earth, the planets in no mans sky also have

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:20.220
day and night cycles, not only will the planet
look a bit different in the night from the

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.840
day, but itl also mean that at night, other,
nocturnal, forms of wildlife might show up

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:28.860
that were sleeping through the day.

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:32.540
Hello games might possibly have one of the
most ambitious games ever, down to the fact

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:37.190
that they've literally created a virtual universe,
but considering the sheer size of the game,

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.210
the team behind it, only has 13 members from
the time of this video was made, and when

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:46.280
it was shown off at e3, it only had 4 members.
Now when you compare that to the big dogs

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.370
of the gaming world like ubisoft, ea and activision
who have, probably between about 7,000-12,000

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.790
employees each, it just goes to show you,
what a small indie team with a lot of ambition,

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.970
talent and imagination is capable of creating.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:07.310
On the 24th of December 2013, the small team
of 4 had an early christmas present from mother

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:12.660
nature in the form of a huge flood that drowned
the hello games offices. This wiped out tons

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.190
of equipment from computers, monitors and
work. It also impacted the production of no

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.130
mans sky massively, and to make matters worse,
the insurance they had, didnt cover flooding

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:27.200
damages. It turned out that a nearby river
overflowed and burst its banks due to a big

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.760
storm in the evening. Even though they lost
a lot of money, enough to probably fund a

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.511
small game, the developers still didnt let
this get in the way of no mans sky, and they

00:03:36.511 --> 00:03:39.981
even set up makeshift offices in their own
homes to continue to production of the game

00:03:39.981 --> 00:03:46.380
until they got somewhere else.
Now theres a hell of a lot of procedural generation

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.580
going on in no mans sky, all of the creatures
that you can find in the game are made up

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:55.030
from a huge selection of creature parts, its
kinda like a build-a-bear but for aliens.

00:03:55.030 --> 00:04:00.630
Not only are the animals procedurally generated,
but the sounds and calls, they make are too,

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.650
hello games have created a special software
that actually models creatures throats, letting

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.431
them define the sound made by a particular
creature due to its size and body shape, this

00:04:09.431 --> 00:04:12.960
means that not only will the animals all look
different from one another, but they'll also

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:16.870
sound different too.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:22.660
The soundtrack to the game is made by an instrumental
electric rock band called 65daysofstatic,

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:26.280
and this soundtrack is then used to generate
procedural music thats influenced by whatever

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.000
youre doing or whats happening in the game.
Although most of the music in the game will

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:38.010
be procedural, some full songs will play at
certain points too.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.420
