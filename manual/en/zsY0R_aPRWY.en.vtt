How to Stretch Natural Hair without Heat Using Coconut Oil

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.470
Now I'm going to show you how to do stretched hair. If you want
to just detangle your hair by stretching out

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:28.080
for a Bantu Knot, Braid Out, Twist out, blow
out or stretched style on 4c hair. My hair

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.290
looks like this when it is stretched, now I am going
to show you how I did it. I started with a previous

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.390
style then I took my hair out and I sectioned
it into some loose Bantu Knots and then I

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:49.470
am going to get started. I took coconut
oil and I smoothed it onto each section, I

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:59.180
added as much as I needed to each section
the coconut oil really helped with pulling

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:07.870
any lint, dirt, tangles knots. Then it
is time to twist once all the the tangles

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:22.890
are out I start twisting. And wrapping my
hair around itself into a Bantu Knot. Then

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.159
take the next section, this time in order
to get to the tangles alot easier. I put my

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:32.090
hair into 2 parts and detangle separately.
Once it is completed with detangling I do

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:44.900
my bantu knot and i just fast forward and
did the rest so all the Bantu Knots are in.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:51.659
My shed hair this is how much hair I lost
detangling today, I took alot of lint out

00:01:51.659 --> 00:02:05.470
of my hair. I left my hair in for 1 hour and
now I am going to take it out, gently. I really

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:20.040
love to do this before I wash my hair detangling
with coconut oil and it is prefect for that.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.659
It really helps with getting any knots out.
This is a great heat free, heat less way to

00:02:22.659 --> 00:03:01.840
stretch my hair. I was able to take out lint,
fibers, knots, tangles.... There you have

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:07.540
