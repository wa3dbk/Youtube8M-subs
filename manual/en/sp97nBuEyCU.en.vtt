00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:12.879
You asked for it, we're going to deliver it.

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:18.119
Inside this video, we're going to show you
how the video performs on a Nikon D7000.

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:24.070
So let's get straight into it.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.640
I've got here the Nikon D7000, really quite
nice camera.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.329
I actually borrowed this from my brother,
so thanks very much bro to lend it to me.

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.149
But the reason why we're taking this camera
for a spin is because one, you guys asked

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.280
to find out what a Nikon does and how does
it perform into videos.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.690
So this actual camera, the D7000, the Nikon
D7000 allows me to be able to record videos.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.450
1080 HD which is pretty good and in comparable
to say a Canon which you know guys, I'm a

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:53.450
Canon fan.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:57.129
That's the reason why I recommend Canon but
for you guys, I'm doing this especially for

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:00.289
you, it records a very, very good quality
video.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.390
Now what I want to show you right now is actually
how this particular camera works.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.810
So let's take a look at what happened.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.909
This camera has what they call the automatic
focusing.

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.990
It's an advantage because the fact is that
it allows it to automatically "computerly"

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.130
focus for you so you don't have to actually
use your ring but it's not fast enough to

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.160
be able to do.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:23.790
It actually has what they call automatic server
focusing so there's an object there, it'll

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:24.860
actually focus on that person.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.450
So I'm going to move it there, it'll focus
on that man, I'll move it there it'll focus

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.950
on that man - which is really neat but the
problem is when there's so many people, it

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.430
doesn't know where to focus on.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.810
And that's the disadvantage of something like
this.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.790
So I still have to switch it back over to
manual focus and get it to work.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.770
What I'm really jealous about Nikon is it
actually has 2/dual card slots.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:52.119
Now what I mean by that is you can actually
fit 2 SD cards in there and if one fills up

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.120
whether or not you're taking photos or videos,
in this case we're taking videos, it will

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.859
automatically switch over to the second one.

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:01.289
So therefore you don't have to get interrupted
while you're filming as well.

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.900
So that's a big, big advantage of having a
Nikon.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.789
But still, you know, I'll stick with the Canon.

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:13.320
If the Nikons didn't have external microphone
then it'll be considered crap camera but this

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.380
as usual has also external microphone which
you can see right there that allows you to

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.090
plug in a wireless mic.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.240
Now what I like to do is actually I'm going
to come up and take off your wireless mic.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.160
I've taken the wireless mic of my camera man,
you can see it's right here on top of it.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.959
Haha, you don't have yours anymore and I'm
going to be able to go around test this out.

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.519
So what I'm doing right now is recording directly
onto this camera.

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:41.799
I'm going to go walk around just test out
the volume and also the mic as well.

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.430
Though, I'm a bit surprised how harsh the
audio recording is from the Nikon and personally,

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.889
I would record the audio on a separate recorder.

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.180
Nevertheless, its external microphone is a
plus to have.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:55.420
The Nikon also comes with image stability.

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:00.110
Most DSLR cameras that come with them actually
is built-in to lens so same thing here, the

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:01.500
Nikon has a built-in.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.389
What I'm going to do is I'm going to test
it out right now.

00:03:03.389 --> 00:03:08.101
It's actually called VR on Nikon and I've
turned it actually off so we're going to go

00:03:08.101 --> 00:03:09.970
for a walk and to test out and see what it
feels like.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.329
I've got it also on automatic focus and while
walking as well, I'm trying to hold the camera

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:17.329
as steady as I can.

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:23.220
And it actually does pretty well without the
image stability on and it's picking out a

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.560
bit of vibrations but you know, it happens
when you don't have it on.

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.389
Now I'm going to stop this - and I'm going
to also switch on image stabilization back

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.140
on which is VR here.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.540
And we're going to go test it out as well.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.220
So let's test it out to see what image stabilization
is with it on.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:47.540
So image stabilization on is not too - too
much difference but I think once you actually

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.930
watch it out on the video or edit on the video,
you will actually see the difference.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:54.359
So this is with the image stabilization on
and we're walking around through the station

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.250
to check it out and it's going pretty well
right now.

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:04.549
So I think having image stabilization on is
a lot better that not on at all.

00:04:04.549 --> 00:04:09.049
Apart from Nikon's harsh sound recording from
the external microphone, there's actually

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.329
quite a lot to like about this camera.

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:15.769
It's got the automatic focusing function built-in
to the camera and it's great for video if

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.620
it's just one person being filmed.

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.870
Having a dual memory card slot is a plus as
well especially when recording video and we

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.610
know videos take up a lot of space.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:30.539
After taking the Nikon for a few tests, I'm
quite impressed for its video mode though

00:04:30.539 --> 00:04:32.689
I still find the Canon a lot more user-friendly.
