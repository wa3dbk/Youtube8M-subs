00:00:00.189 --> 00:00:03.522
(slow electronic music)

00:00:08.814 --> 00:00:11.089
- [Voiceover] Experience music
in your car like never before

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.605
with the JAD Amplifier Series from NVX.

00:00:14.605 --> 00:00:17.470
Guaranteed to perform at
or above their rated power,

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.342
these superior amps are
CEA-2006 certified for true

00:00:21.342 --> 00:00:25.065
and honest output in
real world situations.

00:00:25.065 --> 00:00:27.924
Underneath the clean,
sophisticated aluminum casing

00:00:27.924 --> 00:00:31.733
is one of the most advanced
amplifiers ever manufactured.

00:00:31.733 --> 00:00:34.791
The brand new IR Chip
enhances audio efficiency

00:00:34.791 --> 00:00:36.948
and assists the Class D Circuitry

00:00:36.948 --> 00:00:39.784
and S.M.P.S. Power Supply
circuitry in reducing

00:00:39.784 --> 00:00:43.018
the amp size and allow
for a smaller footprint

00:00:43.018 --> 00:00:45.480
that easily fits anywhere in your vehicle,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.313
including under seats.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.629
The JAD 1200.1 puts out 1200 watts RMS

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.481
to a single channel and
is stable down to one OHM,

00:00:54.481 --> 00:00:57.606
but can also be wired at two or four OHMs.

00:00:57.606 --> 00:00:59.938
There are two sets of speaker
outputs that make it easy

00:00:59.938 --> 00:01:03.905
to connect one subwoofer
or multiple subwoofers .

00:01:03.905 --> 00:01:06.619
The set screw terminals
securely attach the power ground

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.056
and remote turn-on cables to the amp.

00:01:09.056 --> 00:01:12.012
If your installation requires
a larger gauge of power wire,

00:01:12.012 --> 00:01:14.126
then use the included Gauge Adapter

00:01:14.126 --> 00:01:16.809
to ensure the proper gauge is used.

00:01:16.809 --> 00:01:17.642
For protection,

00:01:17.642 --> 00:01:20.459
three 40 amp are conveniently located next

00:01:20.459 --> 00:01:22.572
to the power terminals.

00:01:22.572 --> 00:01:24.113
On the other side of the amp,

00:01:24.113 --> 00:01:25.967
the RCA inputs on the side panel connect

00:01:25.967 --> 00:01:27.505
the amp to the stereo.

00:01:27.505 --> 00:01:29.648
And the output RCAs allow you to pass

00:01:29.648 --> 00:01:31.520
the input signal to another amp

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.839
without having to worry
about annoying Y adapters.

00:01:35.839 --> 00:01:37.680
Adjusting the input sensitivity to match

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.805
the output voltage of the source unit

00:01:39.805 --> 00:01:42.874
will ensure you get the
cleanest signal possible.

00:01:42.874 --> 00:01:45.687
The subsonic filter and
low-pass filter clearly define

00:01:45.687 --> 00:01:47.959
the frequencies being
sent to the subwoofer

00:01:47.959 --> 00:01:49.876
for more accurate bass.

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.109
Connect the included bass knob

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:55.844
to enable remote adjustment
of the subwoofer level.

00:01:55.844 --> 00:01:58.873
The JAD 1200.1 is one of the most advanced

00:01:58.873 --> 00:02:02.439
and best sounding amps
available on the market.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:04.259
Its wide frequency response range

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.969
and high damping factor
provide excellent control over

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:10.009
the subwoofer and all
the desired frequencies.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.819
The impressive signal to noise ratio

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:15.348
and extremely low THD provide
a clean, noise free signal

00:02:15.348 --> 00:02:17.681
for excellent sound quality.

00:02:18.659 --> 00:02:21.476
Internal soft-start
technology safely turns on

00:02:21.476 --> 00:02:23.107
the amplifier a few seconds after

00:02:23.107 --> 00:02:24.595
the car's electrical system

00:02:24.595 --> 00:02:26.812
to prevent potential speaker damage.

00:02:26.812 --> 00:02:28.561
And the three-way power
and protection circuit

00:02:28.561 --> 00:02:30.479
will protect the amp and inform the user

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:33.650
of the problem with indicator LEDs.

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.350
The black aluminum chassis helps

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.267
to effectively dissipate heat
and keep the amp running cool.

00:02:39.267 --> 00:02:41.565
To ensure these amps
meet their expectations,

00:02:41.565 --> 00:02:43.894
they have been tested in
extreme heat conditions,

00:02:43.894 --> 00:02:46.911
beyond any real life
application, for hours on end,

00:02:46.911 --> 00:02:49.957
and they have performed flawlessly.

00:02:49.957 --> 00:02:52.079
