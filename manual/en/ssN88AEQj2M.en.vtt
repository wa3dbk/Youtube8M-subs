00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:07.490
[Music]

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.810
Hi - I am Mark Gilchrist and I am going to
talk to you today about getting permission.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.500
About five or six years ago I only had one
place to go shooting which actually I own.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:16.689
So that doesn't really count.

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:20.610
So what I have done over the years is I have
picked up places where I can go shooting and

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.939
I now have about 45,000 acres to go shooting
on.

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:26.281
I have quadbikes, keys to the farms.

00:00:26.281 --> 00:00:28.720
I can go in have my fun do whatever I want.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.870
I get four days pheasant shooting a year as
a thank you for what I have done from the

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.050
farmers on the rabbits and the pigeons.

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.590
And what I am going to do is tell you guys
exactly how to do this yourselves.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:41.850
Well first things first.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.670
Picking up land isn't easy you have either
got to earn it or you have got to pay for

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.670
it.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.869
Personally I am skint so I like to earn it.

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:51.530
Don't believe the hipe.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:56.229
Crowman and I are out at the moment getting
small bags of pigeons so that we have got

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:58.290
permission to get the big bags in the summer.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.710
You see the big bags in the summer in the
magazines, but you don't see the small bags.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.280
Just because you don't see them doesn't mean
they don't happen.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.290
I promise you we are going and getting 10's
and 20's at the moment.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.640
If you are going to start approaching farmers
you must learn to take rejection.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.219
If the farmer says no take it like a man.

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:18.900
What I suggest you do is say thank you very
much, terribly sorry I disturbed you and much

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.340
like the days when chasing girls, here is
my number if anything changes please feel

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.490
free to give me a call.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:28.159
Don't wink at a farmer he will think it odd.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.890
Luckily for me I spent ten years chasing women
so I have had plenty of opportunity to get

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.030
really accustomed to rejection and u
nderstand what the word no means.

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.909
So stage two what is the farmer actually looking
for.

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.929
Well he wants you to be trustworthy, reliable
and polite.

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:49.399
Not an unreasonable ask.

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.649
The worst thing you can do is knock on the
door and say any chance of any shooting mate.

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.240
Firstly you don't sound very polite, you are
probably not trustworthy and you don't sound

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.950
very reliable because you are looking for
a one off chance.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:06.799
You are much better off to make the effort
to find out his name.

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:10.400
Preferably or almost certainly surname.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:16.890
Don't call him Tom or Tim or Harry call him
Mr Jones, Mr Reynolds.

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:22.030
Find out what the farmer wants shot.

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.110
You going in and shooting a 100 pigeons on
the rape stubble is not helping the farmer.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.930
People have got this very odd idea that pigeon
shooting is helping farmers.

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.900
Sometimes it is, a lot of the time it isn't.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.590
There are lots of people who want to go out
and shoot pigeons and there are lots of people

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.170
who want to go and shoot deer, but they shoot
in such a way that it suits them and not the

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.170
farmer.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:48.560
You need to be going out in the winter an
d making the small bags trying to keep them

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.270
off the rape and then you get the big bags
on the rape stubble.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.190
Conversely if you are deer stalking, some
of the farmers I shoot for they want me to

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.110
come in and shoot four or five a year.

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.240
Some of them want me to shoot as many as possible.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.340
Some of them want just the bucks shot.

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.320
Some of them want just the does shot.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:08.890
Find out what they want by asking them and
go and do it.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.290
Farms are multimillion pound installations.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.860
They are not going to give you the keys to
the farm until you really respect that.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.320
If you have got shooting somewhere else tell
the farmer you are introducing yourself to

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:21.880
because it shows that you are trustworthy.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:28.310
The other thing that you have to have at the
fore front of your mind is that their crop

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:29.310
is their pride.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.430
It is like a bricklayers wall if you kick
over their wall you are upsetting their pride

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:36.170
so bear that in mind all the time.

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.610
So tip number three don't lie.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.710
This is quite difficult for some people.

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:45.370
If you cause a problem on the farm say I am
terribly sorry I have caused a problem, I

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.360
left a gate open, I have done this.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.300
If he says don't shoot any hares and you accidently
shoot a hare, say I am terribly sorry I shot

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.340
a hare.

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.490
If he says don't drive across that field because
it will make a mess and you go and do it ring

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:03.740
him up and say specifically I am very sorry
I have done exactly what you told me not to

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:08.460
do, I have driven across that field and I
am terribly sorry.

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:13.420
Don't under any circumstances lie because
then you are not held in a position of trust,

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:17.639
eventually you will probably lose the shooting
on the farm you have got and you won't find

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.160
any new places to go.

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:21.770
You have to be trustworthy.

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.370
So chapter four making a good impression.

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.449
The first opportunity to go, say it is your
first night and say you are going rabbit shooting.

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:36.340
Make sure that rifle is zero, make sure your
mate who is going to help you is up for an

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.870
all nighter, when I say all night I mean until
the sun comes up.

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.830
You want to go round and round and round that
farm and you want to make sure you get as

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.069
many as you can.

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.060
Don't go home early and you want to be there
when the sun comes up.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:49.830
So make sure you have got nothing else on
on the other day.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:56.330
So when that farmer comes into work at 8 o'clock
that morning you are there gutting 100, 50,

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:01.430
70 or 200 rabbits and he will see a big pile
of them and he will look you straight in the

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.729
eye and know you are the real deal and you
are going to get on with it.

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:07.419
Make a good first impression.
