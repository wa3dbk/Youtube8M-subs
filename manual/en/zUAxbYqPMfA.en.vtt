Hi, I'm Mark Emiley on behalf of Expert Village.
In this next segment we are going to go over

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.990
the ingredients used in brewing. There are
four main ingredients in brewing. There's

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:15.330
malt, hops, yeast and water. Malt is usually
going to come in two different forms. You

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:20.890
have your malt extracts, you can get a dry
version which is a little more concentrated

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:25.449
than the liquid versions but a little more
expensive. Or, you can get the liquid extract

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:29.609
which is like a very, very thick syrup. The
other form of malts that you are going to

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.700
be adding to really kind of flesh out the
character of the beer that you are making

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.980
are specialty grains. These are grains that
have been roasted somewhat differently, maybe

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.550
steeped for a little while. And basically
they are going to add some of your more complex

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.440
flavors. When you get your specialty grains,
your local home brewing store will help you

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:59.590
mill them like this.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.260
This will open up the grain allowing extraction
of the sugar and the color. Next we have hops.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.350
And there are two major forms of hops that
are available. There is whole hops, which

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.260
you can see right here. This is actually just
the cone of the hop. And then there is also

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.940
pellet hops which is basically all of your
whole hops crushed up and then put into a

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:25.770
condensed form. The differences between the
two: whole hops tend to have a shorter shelf

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:30.479
life where pellet hops will last longer. You
will also get a slightly better extraction

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:36.520
out of pellet hops than you will out of whole
hops. However, for today's purposes in our

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.150
brewing session, we are going to be using
whole hops because they are a little easier

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.130
to get out of the wort. Hops can add three
things to your beer. First, they can add bitterness,

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.369
then they can also add flavor and finally,
they can add aroma. Hops, which are added

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:54.420
early into the boil for around a sixty minute
time frame will add primarily bitterness as

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.710
the flavor and aroma components are boiled
off. Hops that are added in at a twenty to

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.580
ten minute time frame will add flavor. They
also add a little bitterness, but mainly flavor.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:10.380
And finally, the aroma hops which are added
usually in the ten and under time frame down

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.760
to actually just steeping will add mainly
aroma characteristics.
