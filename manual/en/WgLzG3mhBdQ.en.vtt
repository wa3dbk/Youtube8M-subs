00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:21.980
Alright, this game is a sequel.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:22.980
Hence the colon.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.830
Not the organ, the punctuation.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.400
See, this Epic Adventures follows up La Jangada.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.970
And if you missed our review, I’ll just
go ahead and summarize—typical hidden object

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:36.820
gameplay, long cutscenes, French is stupid.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.370
On the plus side, this sequel addresses two
of those things.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:43.760
Unless it’s pronounced Cursed Onboard.

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:55.690
In which case...one.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.540
Just released to the App Store, Epic Adventures:
Cursed Onboard is yet another in a long line

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.390
of hidden object adventure games from G5 Entertainment.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.530
So long is that line, in fact, that its predecessor
was released less than two months ago.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.170
Talk about a quick turnaround.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:13.990
That’s incroyable.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:21.000
Of course, as with any line of anything that
consistent and multitudinous, there are obviously

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
ups and downs.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.360
Frankly, the last Epic Adventures was one
of their downs.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.920
Cursed Onboard is definitely a bit better,
but if you’re a fan of these games, you’ve

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:42.229
probably played ones that are better than
this one, too.

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:47.490
So the titular ship from the prior game has
been lost in the Amazon, and this game sends

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.170
you off to uncover the mysteries.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.920
One good thing is that the cutscenes are far
shorter than the last game...but it’s kind

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.909
of weird, because the tone is also markedly
different.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.080
I mean, you’re going from this kind of stale
murder mystery...

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.920
To freaking dead children..and toys.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.860
What the f*ck happened?

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.379
So there are 25 locations, eight chapters...there’s
a nice amount of gameplay here.

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:18.069
Obviously, that gameplay is a traditional
mixture of hidden object screens and some

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:19.609
sporadic minigames.

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:24.421
As is par for the course, you often find objects
in those hidden object screens that end up

00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:26.019
being useful in minigames.

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:31.299
A piece of the gate, some magical key, you
get the idea.

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:37.079
Hidden object games are an interesting genre
in that...their audience has a clear expectation,

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.510
and coupled with the inherent traits of its
game design, that can create a kind of complacency

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.950
or at the very least predictability.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.620
And although some games are trying to address
that, this one is perfectly fine with the

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:49.829
status quo.

00:02:49.829 --> 00:02:54.099
That doesn’t mean Epic Adventures: Cursed
Onboard is a bad game.

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.019
It goes for the expected and does it well.

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:09.739
Fans will dig it, but don’t expect to have
your mind blown.
