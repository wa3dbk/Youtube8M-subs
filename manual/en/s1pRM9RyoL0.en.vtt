00:00:00.232 --> 00:00:02.434
- Babies, they're googly-eyed, they drool,

00:00:02.434 --> 00:00:05.336
but are they actually
more clued-in than adults?

00:00:05.336 --> 00:00:08.167
(electronic music)

00:00:08.167 --> 00:00:09.000
For centuries,
(baby crying)

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.670
babies have been mistaken for

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:12.603
a misshapen lump of consciousness

00:00:12.603 --> 00:00:15.531
that we adults just
mold into our own image,

00:00:15.531 --> 00:00:18.772
but the last 20 years
has really ushered in

00:00:18.772 --> 00:00:21.747
new information by cognitive psychologists

00:00:21.747 --> 00:00:25.233
about how amazing babies'
brains really are.

00:00:25.233 --> 00:00:27.284
Cognitive psychologist Alison Gopnik

00:00:27.284 --> 00:00:30.106
says that babies are born into a buzzing,

00:00:30.106 --> 00:00:32.154
booming confusion of a world,

00:00:32.154 --> 00:00:34.992
I mean, think about it,
everything is new to them,

00:00:34.992 --> 00:00:36.485
and they can't just pinpoint

00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:38.425
one or two things they
wanna concentrate on,

00:00:38.425 --> 00:00:40.035
they take it all in,

00:00:40.035 --> 00:00:43.164
all of this information-rich
data around us.

00:00:43.164 --> 00:00:46.470
Now, this makes them differently
conscious than adults,

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:49.396
and it results in this
kind of lantern vision,

00:00:49.396 --> 00:00:53.243
in which a wide swath of the
world is illuminated for them.

00:00:53.243 --> 00:00:54.789
The reason is that babies' brains

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.678
are pretty much marinating
in neurotransmitters,

00:00:57.678 --> 00:00:59.334
this means that they are reacting

00:00:59.334 --> 00:01:02.248
to every little thing
in their environment,

00:01:02.248 --> 00:01:03.793
and this is starkly different from adults,

00:01:03.793 --> 00:01:06.918
whose neural connections have
been pruned away over time,

00:01:06.918 --> 00:01:10.099
that gives us the ability to
really focus in on things,

00:01:10.099 --> 00:01:13.311
and it gives us that flashlight view,

00:01:13.311 --> 00:01:15.829
as opposed to a lantern view of the world.

00:01:15.829 --> 00:01:18.577
We can illuminate the tiny
little corners of our world

00:01:18.577 --> 00:01:21.063
and really kinda dig in and concentrate.

00:01:21.063 --> 00:01:23.611
Think about it, we operate
under this illusion

00:01:23.611 --> 00:01:25.798
that we're always paying attention,

00:01:25.798 --> 00:01:27.270
but the truth of the matter is that

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.041
our brains are really sort of creating

00:01:29.041 --> 00:01:32.738
this 3D computational model for us,

00:01:32.738 --> 00:01:34.689
a kind of memory cheat sheet.

00:01:34.689 --> 00:01:37.421
So, think about commuting
to work, for instance,

00:01:37.421 --> 00:01:39.362
you pull your car into
your parking space at work,

00:01:39.362 --> 00:01:42.294
you feel like you paid
attention the entire time,

00:01:42.294 --> 00:01:43.604
but the fact of the matter is

00:01:43.604 --> 00:01:45.532
is that you could have
actually passed something

00:01:45.532 --> 00:01:49.083
like a yellow rhinoceros and
not even have noticed it,

00:01:49.083 --> 00:01:52.484
but it's very likely that our
flashlight-like consciousness

00:01:52.484 --> 00:01:55.550
was occupied by something else
and wouldn't have seen it,

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.775
but that baby in the back seat,

00:01:57.775 --> 00:02:00.411
well, she is absolutely awestruck

00:02:00.411 --> 00:02:02.895
by every single little raindrop

00:02:02.895 --> 00:02:04.336
glinting on the windshield.

00:02:04.336 --> 00:02:07.998
Every train whistle, every
honking horn of a car,

00:02:07.998 --> 00:02:10.032
she sees the yellow rhinoceros,

00:02:10.032 --> 00:02:11.989
and she has stared into it's eyes.

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.467
This is probably why she's
not driving, by the way,

00:02:14.467 --> 00:02:16.186
so what else can we learn from babies?

00:02:16.186 --> 00:02:18.230
That they're differently
conscious from us adults,

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.832
in fact, even more conscious,

00:02:19.832 --> 00:02:21.374
and that's just the tip of the iceberg,

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:22.906
because babies, when they are born,

00:02:22.906 --> 00:02:25.628
they are prepackaged
with an operating system

00:02:25.628 --> 00:02:27.129
with all sorts of abilities,

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:28.675
like the ability to count,

00:02:28.675 --> 00:02:31.090
and the ability to acquire new languages

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.865
at breakneck speeds,

00:02:32.865 --> 00:02:35.413
so what else might they be hiding from us?

00:02:35.413 --> 00:02:36.322
So what about you?

00:02:36.322 --> 00:02:38.527
Do you move through the
world taking everything in?

00:02:38.527 --> 00:02:42.634
Or do you rely more on a
3D computational model?
