00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.500
Preparation of Selective and Differential
media

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:19.090
A culture medium is a solid or liquid preparation
used to grow, transport, and store microorganisms.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:25.140
To be effective, the medium must contain all
the nutrients the microorganism requires for

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.790
growth. Specialized media are essential in
the isolation and identification of microorganisms,

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.840
the testing of antibiotic sensitivities, water
and food analysis, industrial microbiology,

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.839
and other activities. In addition to nutrients
necessary for the growth of all bacteria,

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:46.659
special-purpose media contain one or more
chemical compounds that are essential for

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:53.280
their functional specificity.These includes
Selective media, Differential media and Enriched

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.280
media

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.850
Selective media allow certain types of organisms
to grow, and inhibit the growth of other organisms.

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.640
selective inhibition of some types of microorganisms
can be achieved by adding dyes, antibiotics,

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.400
salts or specific inhibitors which affect
the metabolism or enzyme systems of the organisms.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:22.561
Examples are Eosine Methylene Blue (EMB) agar,
Mannitol salt agar, Hektoen enteric agar (HE),

00:01:22.561 --> 00:01:26.940
Phenylethyl alcohol agar
Differential media are used to differentiate

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:36.390
closely related organisms or groups of organismsEg;
MacConkey agar, Eosine Methylene Blue (EMB)

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.720
agar

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.040
Materials required:
Bacterial cultures

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.090
inoculating loop
differential and selective mediaâ€™s which

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.420
include
Mannitol salt agar

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.390
Macconkey agar
Eosine methylene blue agar

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.050
Hektoen enteric agar

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.780
Procedure:
Arrange all the cultures and media in the

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.930
laminar air flow
Flame the inoculating loop and Transfer a

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.090
loopful of culture from the tube labelled
Escherichia coli on to an EMB plate and perform

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:22.060
a continous streak.
Similarly to a second plate of EMB transfer

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:26.950
a loopful of culture of Enterobacter aerogenes
by continous streaking.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.370
Similar procedure was repeated in all selective
and differential media for differentiating

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:40.220
their growth characterestics of the organisms
used.

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.430
All the plates were incubated aerobically
at 370c for 24 hours .

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:53.930
Results:Mannitol salt agar is used for the
isolation of pathogenic Staphylococci from

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:57.709
mixed cultures.
Staphylococcus aureus was grown in one plate

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:05.780
of MSA and into a second plate Staphylococcus
epidermidis was grown. Staphylococcus aureus

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.160
ferments mannitol, thereby changing the colour
of the medium from red to yellow. Staphylococcus

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.959
epidermidis- produce colonies with red or
purple zones without mannitol fermentation.

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:23.090
Eosin methylene blue agar is both a selective
and differential medium used for the detection

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.170
and isolation of Gram-negative intestinal
pathogens.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.430
In Eosine methylene blue agar , Escherichia
coli- produce dark blue-black colonies with

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.670
metallic green sheen indicating vigorous fermentation
of lactose and acid production.

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:44.590
Enterobacter aerogenes- produce blue, dark-centered,
mucoid colonies indicating lactose fermentation

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.430
and acid production.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:50.890
Macconkey agar, is selective for Gram negative
bacteria and can differentiate those bacteria

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.140
that are able to ferment lactose .
Escherichia coli are Lactose fermenters and

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.610
thereby appear pink
while Pseudomonas aeruginosa are Non lactose

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.319
fermenters and appear colourless or Golden
colored.

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:07.890
Hektoen enteric agar: Hektoen Enteric (HE)
Agar is a moderatively selective medium used

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:14.450
for the isolation and cultivation of gram-negative
enteric microorganisms, especially Shigella

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:19.259
and Salmonella from a variety of clinical
and nonclinical specimens.

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:25.389
On HEA agar Shigella species develop into
green-colored colonies with darker blue-green

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:32.050
centers. Salmonella species appear as blue-green
colonies with or without black centers.
