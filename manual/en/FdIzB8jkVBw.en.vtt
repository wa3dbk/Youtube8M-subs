00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.310
Indie games can be credited with repopularising
pixel art, but when you think of the likes

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:24.390
of Fez or Shovel Knight they are not exactly
narrative rich games. One Dreamer continues

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.570
the pixel art renaissance yet as a psychological
thriller attempts to convey a deeper and more

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.420
moving story than we've typically seen in
this simplistic style. Playing as Frank the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:40.170
indie dev, One Dreamer gets you to play out
both his reality and his lucid dreams. This

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.920
dynamic offers a variety in gameplay, with
reality being composed of more rational problem

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.060
solving and dreaming featuring more skill-based
and reactionary platforming. It also feeds

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.810
the narrative, as the deeper Frank explores
his dreams the more he becomes disconnected

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.200
from society. Additionally, the player's choices
will determine Frank's path and the game's

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.000
final outcome. One Dreamer looks set to stretch
pixel art to new places.

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.370
Skyrider's universe has a clear wealth divide.
The elite live in a city in the sky called

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:31.280
Aircitadel, and everybody else resides on
the ground way down below. On the surface

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.819
the people toil in the mines to extract the
precious mineral that sustains Aircitadel

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:40.880
in exchange for a TV subscription. Appalled
by the injustice, Noki rebels against his

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.480
Aircitadel compatriots and is subsequently
thrown down to the ground level. He now must

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.340
climb back up to Aircitadel and set things
right.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.380
The platforming journey there is not the standard.
There are environmental ledges to jump onto,

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:58.010
but you can also create some with your drone.
Your drone pal is also able to conjure up

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.099
a shield and firee off projectiles for you.
For keyboard, WASD is used to move Noki and

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.220
the mouse for the drone. It's an intriguing
set up that should make Skyrider more than

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:10.000
a regular climb to the top.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.300
A Hole New World is an NES throwback that

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.840
feels like we've already played it. Perhaps
that's because the game only uses the original

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.579
48 colours of the NES plus 6 more. The 8-bit
graphics and chip tune music are on point

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:37.340
too. It's simply a retro recreation that is
being made with great dedication and attention

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:43.019
to detail like the best of NES revivals do;
think Shovel Knight. The modern twist as you

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.819
may call it is that you can walk upside down
where platforms permit. We're eager to see

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:51.000
A Hole New World take us back to another time.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.650
Devastated Dreams is a follow-up to last year's

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:16.989
Neverending Nightmares that acquired over
100 k when it was on Kickstarter. With its

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.219
water colour and ink wash hybrid art style,
Neverending Nightmares generated quite the

00:04:21.219 --> 00:04:25.969
buzz pre-release. Not to say that people didn't
enjoy the game, but the critical reception

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:30.020
was mixed post-release and this puts Devastated
Dreams in a tough position to reach an even

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.500
larger funding goal.
It would be a shame if Devastated Dreams will

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:38.710
fall short, as it ventures to territory rarely
explored by games; the fear of an expecting

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.140
parent. It's a rather extreme depiction of
this theme as you explore nightmares filled

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:46.000
with monsters and are stranded in the rural
Philippines.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:07.050
We don't, but you may remember 2010 XBLA title
Charm. The music puzzler was well received

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.250
and is now being sharpened up with this new
edition, Chime Sharp. The core gameplay will

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:16.719
be returning. It can be explained as a musical
Tetris. You place blocks to form quads which

00:05:16.719 --> 00:05:21.210
is the puzzle or tetris part and then there's
a beat line that runs along and reads and

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:25.639
plays your blocks as chimes. Each time you
play and assort the blocks differently a new

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.289
music sequence is made.
Chime Sharp aims to make numerous advancements

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:34.099
on the original. This includes a new look,
new music and an overhaul of the gameplay

00:05:34.099 --> 00:05:39.610
to deliver more balance and shorter games
among other things. Chime Sharp; it's a true

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.000
block party.
