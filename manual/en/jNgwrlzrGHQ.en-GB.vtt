Hi guys! It's Lumes, welcome back to my channel.
Today's tutorial is going to be all about

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:27.660
how I was able to get this shade, this extremely
bold shade of lip color onto my face. I searched

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.910
high and low on Youtube to try to find something
that was aimed at girls with my complexion

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.520
and I couldn't really find anything so I hope
that this will help some of you out there

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.570
who are thinking of experimenting with a darker
colour. So you can see what it looks like

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.700
on us, you know, chocolatey goodness girls.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.820
This is going to be focused just on the lips.
If you want to see the rest of my foundation

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:03.390
routine you can click right here. Can you
see it? Click right here.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.391
You can watch that video and see how I did
the rest of my face. I'd love to hear your

00:01:07.391 --> 00:01:10.790
comments below let me know what you think.
Do you think it suits? Do you think it doesn't

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:11.790
suit?

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.360
I'm going to list a whole bunch of brands
as well down in the description box of just

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.320
different shades. I used Kiko in this tutorial
but you can use absolutely anything that you

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.320
want to use.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.510
I'll see you guys in my next video! I hope
you like it and..uh...yeah!

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.930
So as ever I'm going to start by moisturising
my lips. Then next I'm going to go in with

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:37.040
my lip primer. The lip primer is is going
to keep the lipstick on my face for longer.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:51.310
It'll also stop the color from running and
slipping and sliding all over my face.

00:01:51.310 --> 00:02:00.189
I don't have a black lip pencil so I'm going
to use my Clinique eye pencil as a lip pencil

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:01.189
instead.

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:06.420
Now because the lipstick itself is actually
quite sheer, I'm going to try and colour in

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:14.760
as much of my lips as possible just to make
sure the colour comes out a lot darker and

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.370
a lot stronger.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:26.790
The lipstick I'm going to use today is the
#523 from Kiko (details in the description

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:27.790
box).

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:44.450
It's actually quite sheer so I have to layer
it on quite a bit.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:47.890
Don't worry too much if you end up colouring
outside the lines as you'll be able to clean

00:02:47.890 --> 00:03:00.900
it up again before you're done and I'll show
you how.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.680
Once you've achieved maximum coverage, you're
going to take your favourite concealer and

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.320
an angled brush (if you can get hold of one).
You're going to take a little bit of that

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.410
concealer and use it to clean the colour from
the edges of your lips. Focus on any spots

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:19.700
where the colour went beyond the line just
to get that lip really perfect.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:25.050
Really take your time and clean it up so you're
really happy with it because black is such

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:29.540
a bold colour. You want to make sure it's
as perfect as possible.

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:37.090
Next you're going to take whatever highlighter
you use and you're just going to use your

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.790
finger to apply it to your cupid's bow. This
is just to give your lips a bit of a plumping

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:49.910
effect and make them look all LUSCIOUS.

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.409
Once that's all done, I'm going to take my
pinkie and I'm going to use this motion to

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.900
get rid of any excess. This will stop any
of the lipstick from getting onto my teeth.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.280
So that's it guys! That's the whole look.
I hope you enjoyed it. Hope you liked it.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:24.719
Let me know what you think below. I will see
you next time!
