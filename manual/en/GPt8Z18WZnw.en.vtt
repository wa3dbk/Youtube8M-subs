Hi, I'm Ginger Walker, owner of Clean Junkies.
We're going to learn how to fold some clothes,

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:09.161
and give you a few different techniques, to
fold some of those clothes. First, we're going

00:00:09.161 --> 00:00:14.330
to start with a tie, if you are folding a
tie, rather than hanging the tie. We'll go

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:25.140
ahead and lay it flat. Make sure you've got
your creases out. Fold it in half. Fold it

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.970
in half again, and leave it just like that.
That way, you're not going to have any sudden

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:37.710
creases, anywhere in the tie. The next thing
we'll learn how to fold here, is a towel.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:50.690
Take both ends. Fold it in half again. How
I usually like to fold my towels, is to have

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.600
the decorative edge showing, so just flip
that over, and fold it into three's here,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:04.420
then you've got a nice looking towel, there.
Ok, then we're going to go into folding our

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:11.049
socks. You know lots of people just take both
tops, put them down like that, and that works.

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:18.619
There's also a way of folding your socks,
if you're trying to stuff a bunch of socks

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:28.619
in a drawer. You lay them out like this. You
fold the toe end halfway over, then you fold

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:35.950
the cuff end over. Put your thumb in the top
here, and your fingers in the back, and you

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:44.100
fold over the top of the cuff, spreading out
your fingers, as you pull them out there.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:53.979
It gives you a nice, flat sock, so you can
stuff a whole bunch in your drawer. I've got

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.350
some jeans here. When you take them out of
the dryer, they're probably going to be inside

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:04.070
out, because you wash them inside out, to
retain the color, so you'll turn those right

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:12.010
side in, or right side out. With jeans, because
you don't want to have the creases, you know

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.120
just one solid crease in your jean. The best
thing to do is take the bottom. Fold it three

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.319
quarters of the way. Take the top. Fold it
over that, and then you won't have a solid

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:26.840
crease anymore. Ok, now we're going to fold
our t-shirts. One of the ways that I fold

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.280
it, which turn out just as well as the next
process we're going to show you, just holding

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.790
up by the sleeves, right in the middle of
the sleeves, actually. Fold the one side in.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:46.629
Fold the other side in. Hold it against you,
and flip it over, and you've got a nicely

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:52.950
folded shirt there. Another way of folding
t-shirts, is called the Japanese way of folding

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:00.129
t-shirts. What you're going to do, is spread
out your t-shirt on a table, and you're going

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:05.060
to draw an imaginary line between the sleeve
and the neck of your shirt. You want to be

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:10.069
in the middle of that. Draw an imaginary line
down there. You're going to grab the middle

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.879
of your shirt here, the middle of the shirt
there. Then you're going to , with your left

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.349
hand, grab at the same line, the very bottom
of the shirt, so not the corner of the shirt,

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:26.650
but following that line, then you lift it
up, and rotate your hands out. Lay it down

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:31.749
on the counter. Fold it back over, and there
you have a nicely folded shirt, as well.
