00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.420
Today we're installing a Mustang heated seat

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.310
on this oh-nine Ultra.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:32.510
And we'll start by removing the passenger
hand strap.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.100
Then the rear mounting screw of the stock
seat.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.100
I'm just gonna set the screw back in place
for now.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:42.010
Reinstall this, this screw and tighten it.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:50.789
Most of the time we remove the strap.

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.859
Our heated standard touring seat

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:00.359
Comes with a wire harness underneath.

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:08.280
And it plugs in to Harley's accessory port
plug

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.980
that is sometimes hard to find.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.600
It's about a three-quarter inch

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.000
by half inch rectangular plug with a rubber
cap.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.460
Remove the rubber cap, line up our plug with
the receptacle,

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.850
push it in 'till it clicks, stick the wire
back down

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.690
in front of the battery, and install the seat.

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:42.000
Slide the nose bracket under the frame bracket.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.810
Reinstall the rear screw, which can be tricky.

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:57.100
Tighten it. And you're all set.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.720
Again, you could attach the strap,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:09.171
or we usually just remove it.

00:02:09.171 --> 00:02:14.340
To energize our seat, you turn the key on,

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.950
I'm gonna put it on "accessorate" for now,

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.520
and there's an accessory switch up here on
the dash.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.819
When you turn it on it energizes that port,

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:27.610
and our seat will be activated.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.570
This is for, obviously, the front seat heat.

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.430
This one's for the rear.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:39.610
This is our high setting.

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.070
That would be our low setting.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.120
And that's all there is to it.
