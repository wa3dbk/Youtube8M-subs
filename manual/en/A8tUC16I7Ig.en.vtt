Michael Raines on Expert Village. Now, as
you might have noticed, our containers are

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:09.310
almost together. In fact, they're going together
right now because I'm going to screw them

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:15.410
together. Yep, they just screw together like
a water filter, because they are water filters.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:23.869
And they seal up nice and tight. And then
I'm going to explain all our electrical hookups.

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:29.249
Because you know, it runs off twelve volts.
Yeah, the same twelve volts as in a car battery,

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:35.820
thus the car battery. So, we're all screwed
in together, oops. You know what, I almost

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:41.680
forgot. We've got to fill up our bubbler.
Our secondary safety device. Remember our

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:48.150
first safety device is the one-way valve.
Our secondary safety device is the bubbler.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:54.930
What's neat about the bubbler, you can see
the Hydrogen bubbling up through there. That's

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:02.250
really cool. So, put our cap back on. Remember
our cap doesn't stay tight. It's a safety

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.680
device. If there's an accidental backfire
through here, the cap will pop off. It won't

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.880
backfire through the water and it won't come
back into our container. So, with that said,

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.580
put away our water. Now we're getting ready
to get into the electrical. As you remember,

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:25.900
it's a twelve volt system. Direct current.
Alternating current will not work. So now,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:30.680
as you know we're a parallel system. We go
down to our gauges, our volt meter, our amp

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:38.160
meter and then from there we go to our battery.
Which is here. But our battery needs a charging

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.840
system. It's going to die if we just hook
it up. It's just going to drain the battery.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.270
Thirty amps is a lot of current to be pulling
on a battery for ten to fifteen or twenty

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:52.670
minutes. It's more than what you would use
to start the car. So, we're going to hook

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:59.030
up a charger. No ordinary charger mind you.
It's one of these bad boys. Now I've already

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.421
had the hookups on them. And we're just going
to put it parallel to our hookups that we

00:02:05.421 --> 00:02:13.620
have for our cylinders. Negative to negative,
positive to positive. Listen to that puppy

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:20.040
hum. It puts out ten to twenty amps. It'll
keep my battery charged and keep our system

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.170
going for a nice smooth experiment all the
way through. We won't kill our battery. Our

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:32.620
battery gives us our steady current, but the
charger keeps the battery charged. So, here

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:43.530
we go.
Okay. You can see our currents going here.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.620
Both cylinders are producing Hydrogen. And
look! Our bubbler is bubbling.
