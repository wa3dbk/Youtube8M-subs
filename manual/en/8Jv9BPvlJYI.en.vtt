00:00:08.083 --> 00:00:16.163
&nbsp;      I was born in Mexico City and now I live in the San Francisco Bay Area. I got polio when I was 18 months old.

00:00:16.163 --> 00:00:21.723
&nbsp;      Today I am 100% independent thanks to using assistive technologies.

00:00:21.723 --> 00:00:26.675
&nbsp;      Without them, my independence and mobility would be significantly reduced.

00:00:26.675 --> 00:00:32.930
&nbsp;      When I was a girl, I had the good fortune to study at a private bilingual school,

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.595
&nbsp;      where I learned English and Spanish at the same time, and thanks to English,

00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:42.043
&nbsp;      I’ve had important personal and professional opportunities in my life.

00:00:42.043 --> 00:00:49.490
&nbsp;      I grew up with the idea that in order to be successful and live independently, I had to get a college degree.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:55.778
&nbsp;      Unfortunately, when I finished high school, I didn’t get good career counseling.

00:00:55.778 --> 00:01:03.587
&nbsp;      I rejected the idea of law school, because everyone said that it was hard and that I’d have to read a lot.

00:01:03.587 --> 00:01:13.387
&nbsp;      Instead, I chose to major in advertising, because a friend said that it’d be easy and that I wouldn’t have to read much.

00:01:13.387 --> 00:01:17.210
&nbsp;      1993 was a year that changed my life.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.858
&nbsp;      I was very close to finishing college, but I was not at all satisfied with the major I had chosen.

00:01:22.858 --> 00:01:29.260
&nbsp;      When I told my father that I was going to quit college during the last semester, he said the following:

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:36.690
&nbsp;      “I have always supported your decisions, but I want you to finish. This is probably your only chance to get a degree.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.850
&nbsp;      Get it, and if you want to study something else, do so after getting your degree.”

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.717
&nbsp;      I followed his advice and decided that it was time for me to prove to myself

00:01:48.717 --> 00:01:52.475
&nbsp;      that I could find a job in my field of study.

00:01:52.475 --> 00:01:58.382
&nbsp;      Since I was 15 years old I had been in charge of my father’s lumber business.

00:01:58.382 --> 00:02:06.035
&nbsp;      On average, I supervised 15 employees, handled the accounting, paid our bills, etc.

00:02:06.035 --> 00:02:10.880
&nbsp;      It was not easy for me to tell my father that I would be leaving the business,

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:19.093
&nbsp;      but I did it when I got my bachelor’s degree at the age of 26. It took me many months to get a job,

00:02:19.093 --> 00:02:25.703
&nbsp;      and I think that I didn’t get some jobs because of my physical disability, but it’s hard to prove that.

00:02:25.703 --> 00:02:33.538
&nbsp;      The truth is that I didn’t have a lot of applicable experience for many of the jobs I applied for.

00:02:33.538 --> 00:02:40.455
&nbsp;      In 1993, I also participated in a leadership course for people with disabilities in the United States,

00:02:40.455 --> 00:02:44.955
&nbsp;      which opened the doors for me to enter the world of disability advocacy.

00:02:44.955 --> 00:02:49.635
&nbsp;      To attain financial independence, I took jobs that didn’t make me happy,

00:02:49.635 --> 00:02:53.378
&nbsp;      though they definitely gave me the chance to learn a lot.

00:02:53.378 --> 00:02:57.725
&nbsp;      I did telemarketing, coordinated delivery services,

00:02:57.725 --> 00:03:03.442
&nbsp;      was the assistant director of a disability organization, and taught marketing.

00:03:03.442 --> 00:03:09.528
&nbsp;      I also volunteered for 15 months at two non-profits in the United States.

00:03:09.528 --> 00:03:13.977
&nbsp;      When I was 31, I finally got my dream job,

00:03:13.977 --> 00:03:20.913
&nbsp;      in which I could effect change in my community as the disability coordinator for the city of San Luis Potosí.

00:03:20.913 --> 00:03:26.427
&nbsp;      I think that in the end, my education in advertising was a big help in getting this job,

00:03:26.427 --> 00:03:29.985
&nbsp;      knowing how to handle the media, and being successful.

00:03:29.985 --> 00:03:36.497
&nbsp;      And thanks to this job, I was invited to California in 2000 to work with disabled women from around the world,

00:03:36.497 --> 00:03:41.465
&nbsp;      a job that I enjoy tremendously and a mission that I am passionate about.
