00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.860
Salut c’est Géraldine.

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:06.180
Welcome to Comme une Française TV, live in
France, feel at home.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.209
Imagine this: it’s 3pm in France, you’ve
just finished a visit to Lyons and you want

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:12.209
to have lunch.

00:00:12.209 --> 00:00:17.720
So you go looking for a restaurant, only to
find they’re all closed until 7pm.

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:18.940
“Why?” you ask.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.700
“It’s a restaurant, they should be open
all day!

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:24.510
I can’t wait until 7pm!”

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:25.840
In France, food is sacred.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.840
You know that already.

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.720
We have lots of unwritten rules about food.

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.720
And snacking is almost a crime.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.600
When to eat in France?

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.240
That’s what we’ll look at today on Comme
une Française TV.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.300
Today, on Comme une Française TV, I’ll
demystify French meal times for you.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.140
It is very important to be aware of them as
restaurants only serve at lunch and dinner

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.740
times, but rarely in between.

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.879
Le petit-déjeuner is breakfast.

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:03.179
We shorten it to Petit déj or Ptit déj.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:14.060
We traditionally have un café et du pain
avec du beurre et de la confiture.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.140
We call that “une tartine”.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.040
Here’s a breakfast phrase for you: “Tu
as pris ton ptit déj ?”

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:35.380
“La pause de 10h” or “Le 10h” is the
time for a mid-morning coffee and snack.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:40.260
It is linked to the school break: “La récréation”.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:50.880
Here’s a 10h phrase: “J’ai amené des
croissants pour la pause de 10h.”

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.180
Le déjeuner is lunch time.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:03.520
If you’re talking about the time slot “lunch
time”, you can also say “le midi” or

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.840
“entre midi et deux”.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:15.960
We don’t always have an “entrée-plat-dessert”
lunch but we never eat alone.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.580
It would be strange to see people in an office
eating on their own.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.940
If the food can be shared, it IS shared.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.560
A “déjeuner de famille” can last for
more than 4 hours.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:42.800
A phrase for “déjeuner” “On déjeune
ensemble ce midi ? J’ai trouvé un petit resto super sympa près de Bastille.”

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.420
This is mainly for kids, but you can also
invite adults for “le goûter”.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:57.080
It’s also called “le 4h” : “tu as
pris ton 4h ?” (Have you had your 4’o clock snack?)

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:00.680
It refers to both the time AND the snack.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:08.880
A phrase for “le goûter” “J’ai fait
un gâteau au chocolat pour le goûter.”

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.780
L’apéritif is also called “l’apéro”.

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.100
It’s a pre-dinner drink with finger food.

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.560
You have it between 6 et 9h and it can be
a full dinner.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:29.200
If it’s a full dinner, it’s called “Un
apéro dînatoire”

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:35.220
An apéro phrase : “Tu viens pour l’apéro
?”

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.360
We start dinner between 7 and 9.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.020
It is a very important time of the day.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:49.580
The whole family sits together around the
table and we talk about our day over the meal.

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.160
An dîner phrase : “A table! Le dîner est prêt!”

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.460

practice what you’ve learnt on Comme une
