00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The Carbon Arc Lamp, the first form of electric light. 1800

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Ok, here we have my carbon arc lamp, that I am slowly restoring, this is Thomson

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:37.000
These lamps were used before incandescent lighting, they are just two carbon rods that touch together

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000
when you put current to them, a magnet would separate them, and it would form an arc between them, just like in a mercury vapor or metal halide lamp

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:53.000
in fact the light they put out is very similar to an MH or Mercury Vapor, its a very bright purplish-white light

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:05.000
They were used for street lighting, industrial, indoor lighting. And they were being made even when incandescent light was around.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.000
They still used them because incandescent lamps couldn't put out enough light, same as today, where streetlights use high pressure sodium

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:24.000
which puts out a lot more light than incandescent and it's an "arc" lightsource, the arc lights were the HPSs of the 1800s. They produced a lot of light

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:35.000
which an incandescent couldn't do and they used relatively little power to do it. The arc lamp was king up until the 1920s

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:46.000
in England they used them up until the 1960s and 70s so arc lamps were with us quite a while even though it was the first light source

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:57.000
These are some of the internal parts, this is the frame that goes down under here, and this is where your arc actually goes, your carbon rods

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:04.000
These are some of the windings from the coils inside, which are shot, I will have to redo them.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:12.000
and this is the ballast piece of insulation material here, and this is the ballast or choke coil

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.000
the wires are right down to bare copper so it's going to have to be rewound, basically it's an HID lightsource

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000
High Intensity Discharge, just that it does the arc through air instead of through a (enclosed) gas or metallic vapor 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
1800: Alessandro Volta invents the first battery

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:55.000
1802 Discovery of the carbon arc

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.000
1840s Mechanical feed device for the carbon rod

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
The first good power source

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:19.000
Power regulation, use of multiple lights on one AC power system and first commercial success

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Commercial explosion of electric light in the world

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Charles Brush improved all parts of the lamp system

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:45.000
Golden age of the arc lamp

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:52.000
The carbon arc lamp was replaced by the xenon arc lamp (1950s)
