00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.400
today I'm highlighting the results of a
few important studies that have helped to pave

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:05.589
the way for the sport of swimming

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:08.599
for the sake of time we won't look at all these
studies in depth,

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:12.730
but I went ahead and place a few
of the links in description for you

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.940
so once this video is over if you still have
questions and doubts

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:19.529
then go ahead and check on those research
links and then once you've done with those

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.240
you can head over to USRPT.com and we'll chat in the forums

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:40.440
The first study were gonna take a look
at followed two groups of swimmers over the

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.829
course of 25 weeks.

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:45.260
For the first 10 weeks and the last 10
weeks of study

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.339
both groups only trained once a day
during the middle of the study however

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.449
one of those groups switched two doubles

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.530
for five weeks and then they switched back to singles for the remaining the study

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.649
They monitored these swimmers over the course of the 25 weeks

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.040
and at no point did any of those groups

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.770
experience any advantage in aerobic capacity or

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.610
in performance which essentially means
that training twice a day was a waste

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.330
of time.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.020
A similar study compared two groups of swimmers again 
one group swam 10k a day

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:16.550
one group swam 5k a day

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.840
after four years of training here's
what they noticed

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.729
nothing. Both groups improved at the same
percentage

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.600
and neither group had a performance
advantage again not in the 100

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.990
200, mile, et cetera. You get the picture

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.750
You know the more studies we look at the
more it becomes clear that if you want to

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.420
swim faster then more yardage

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.240
is not the answer. To find the answer
to swimming faster

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.610
we need to look at another set of studies.
The study that I want to look at now

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.170
followed 100 meter swimmers and 200 meter swimmers over the course of forty

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:49.130
four weeks

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:54.140
during the forty four weeks each swimmer
was assigned a specific intensity

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.850
which was measured by blood lactate
concentration what they found out in

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.460
this study

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.820
was the same thing they found in a prior
study was that volume had no effect on

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.640
performance

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.869
but they also made a really important
discovery they discovered that at the

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:11.840
end of the season this swimmer's who made

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.040
the biggest improvements were those who
performed most of their training

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.090
at higher paces. At race paces. so now we're
getting to the good stuff

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.570
why would swimmers training at higher
speeds

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.310
perform significantly better than
swimmers training at lower speeds?

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.900
The answer is specificity. In the encyclopedia
of sports medicine chapter 13

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.980
addresses a topic called the training
adaptation of

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.359
the neuromuscular system and under a
subheading on specificity it says

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:47.670
the training exercises should stimulate
the sport task parameters as closely as

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:48.580
possible

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.790
to induce adaptations that could be
transferred

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.640
to the sport movement. And that's we're
really looking for here:

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.360
transfer. We want the transfer to come
from practice over to the

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.459
race and it's not realistic

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.989
to train at low speeds and expect that
transfer to come to your racing speeds because

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:08.720
your brain treats slow swimming

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.840
and fast swimming as two completely different activities

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:15.180
so if you really want the greatest
possible improvement

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.549
in a performance then you have to
properly train your brain

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:23.420
by simulating racing conditions. This is
what we call race-pace training.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.269
Now if you're following my train of thought
then you know

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:31.560
that's not exactly great news because
our bodies cannot sustain race pace for

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.739
a two-hour practice.

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.349
The fatigue alone would prevent you from
doing anything worthwhile

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:39.819
and this was a very real obstacle until
a group of Swedish researchers

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.340
tackled it. They discovered that by keeping
both the work

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:46.439
and the recovery intervals short. Athletes could maintain

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:50.750
very high intensity work. When they trained
with these short intervals

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.930
there was no lactate build-up and the
glycogen levels remained really high

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.050
so they essentially avoided fatigue.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.830
Any training that uses these intervals is
referred to as ultra-short training.

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:07.440
So what we're seeing is that there's no
evidence to suggest that more yardage is

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.209
better and research indicates that

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.989
it's at best waste of time. What you should
really be doing is training at race pace,

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:17.810
but in order to train at race-pace the only
way you can maintain that

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.019
is by using ultra-short race intervals

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.580
and i think it is really important for
people to realize that USRPT is not

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:25.729
just an excuse

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:30.150
to swim 25s and 50s all
the time. It's a response to the evidence

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.300
and the evidence clearly says that more
yardage

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.330
is not the answer, race-pace training is

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:41.070
the answer, evidence base coaching is the
answer. You can take my word for it or you

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.190
can go ahead and investigate evidence for
yourself, but once you understand the

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:47.620
evidence for USRPT it's time to take

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.330
the next step and start writing workouts. In
the next video

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.970
I will show you how to write your own USRPT workouts and if you want me to write

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:55.790
a workout for you

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.229
leave a comment or send me a tweet.
Thanks for watching!
