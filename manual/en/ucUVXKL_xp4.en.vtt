00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.250
Backside
Find a side hit that forces you to approach

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.740
on your toe edge or drop from the opposite
side at the bottom of the pipe.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.640
Do a straight air first and make sure to use
your legs to pop, getting at least a foot

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.949
from the ground.

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.610
Hike back up and do a backside 180 with the
same pop.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.779
Look for the blind landing to stop you from
over-rotating.

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.160
It's common to slide out here into a back
3.

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.460
With the backside 180, you don't need to do
much with your upper body, most of the rotation

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.690
comes from just being on your toe edge as
you jump.

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.600
When it comes to doing a 360, the main difference
is you'll add a bit of wind up and release

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.660
with your upper body, as you're jumping from
the side hit.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.710
This creates tension through your body like
a rubber band which helps to spin all the

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:54.710
way around.

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:01.309
Approach at the exact same speed, use the
same toe edge carve, add the same pop, the

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:05.600
only difference is to wind up a little just
before the jump and release that tension as

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:07.630
you pop off the lip.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.930
Don't wind up to early, closer to the jump
is better.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:14.670
The other difference is to continue looking
all the way around with your head rather then

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.260
spotting a blind landing.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.680
Don't try too hard.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.620
Focus on only spinning a tiny bit more then
your backside 180.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:26.430
You may only do a 270 on your first few tries
similar to when practicing while carving across

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.790
a run.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:29.890
This is safe as you'll end up facing downhill.

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.610
If you land with your toe edge it'll catch
in the snow so try to land slightly on your

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:35.930
heels.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.810
It's better to do smooth 270s at this stage
then sloppy 360s.

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.670
If you try to wind up and release too hard
into your spin, it'll get you off balance

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.300
and make things harder.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.660
Keep your edging smooth, adding pop off the
lip creating just a little bit more tension

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.520
then for a back 1 and look all the way around
for an open landing.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.570
You can use the exact same steps to learn
switch backside 3's.
