00:00:01.533 --> 00:00:09.000
(♪♪♪)

00:00:11.067 --> 00:00:14.667
Pebeo's Setaskrib Plus Markers
were developed to correspond

00:00:14.667 --> 00:00:17.933
and to be used with
Pebeo's Setacolor Transparent

00:00:17.933 --> 00:00:20.667
and Pebeo's
Opaque Fabric Paints.

00:00:20.667 --> 00:00:23.167
The range of colours for
the Setaskrib Markers

00:00:23.167 --> 00:00:26.133
includes 18 bright
and luminous colours.

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.933
There are 12 standard colours,

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:30.500
and there are six
florescent colours.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.233
We'll take a look at the tip.

00:00:32.233 --> 00:00:36.300
The tip is termed a brush tip,
but as you know it actually

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.833
has a nice point
for fine line application

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:42.267
as well as a broad side

00:00:42.267 --> 00:00:48.300
that allows for
colouring in large spaces.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:49.533
I'll point out that
the markers are

00:00:49.533 --> 00:00:51.400
intended to be
used on fabrics.

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.533
It's best to use a fabric
that is in fact

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:55.933
at least 50% natural fibres.

00:00:55.933 --> 00:00:58.833
The natural fibres will absorb
and hold the colours better

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:00.667
than something
that is synthetic.

00:01:00.667 --> 00:01:03.167
In addition you would want
to wash the fabric first

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:04.767
to remove any sizing,

00:01:04.767 --> 00:01:08.000
so again the fabric markers
will be durable

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.367
on the surface.

00:01:09.367 --> 00:01:13.267
I'm going to take my marker
and come in and simply add

00:01:13.267 --> 00:01:14.900
a little bit of embellishment

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:16.833
to a piece that has
already been printed

00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:19.633
with the
Setacolor Transparent paints

00:01:19.633 --> 00:01:22.167
using the 
sun printing technique.

00:01:22.167 --> 00:01:26.367
We can simply add some details
to our city scene here,

00:01:26.367 --> 00:01:27.567
and if we'd like,

00:01:27.567 --> 00:01:30.200
the markers are really
great for personalizing,

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.467
so if we want to add
the name here

00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:35.100
of the city.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:38.533
Markers are great for children
or for people who may not be

00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.933
comfortable using
a paintbrush.

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:43.333
This brush tip makes it
very very easy to

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:46.500
apply colour to your surface.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.833
In addition,
the markers can be blended.

00:01:49.833 --> 00:01:52.467
The best way to do this
is to go ahead

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:54.633
and moisten the fabric,

00:01:54.633 --> 00:01:58.000
maybe add a little bit
of water with a paintbrush,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.767
and then you can
come in with your colours.

00:02:00.767 --> 00:02:04.067
I'm using some yellow
and some red,

00:02:04.067 --> 00:02:13.833
and I'll show you that I am
able to blend the colours

00:02:13.833 --> 00:02:19.733
and come up with
a nice orange final colour.

00:02:19.733 --> 00:02:21.100
I'll come back in
with my brush

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.133
and mix the colours.

00:02:26.133 --> 00:02:28.067
Once we've completed
our painting,

00:02:28.067 --> 00:02:30.433
the markers
do need to be ironed.

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:33.067
We use the heat process
to set the colour.

00:02:33.067 --> 00:02:34.600
You simply turn the piece over

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.600
and you want to iron it
on the opposite side

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.833
on the setting that is
appropriate to the fabric

00:02:38.833 --> 00:02:41.667
that you're using,
iron it for about five minutes.

00:02:41.667 --> 00:02:44.100
Once it's been ironed
the piece is then washable

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.533
and dry cleanable.

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:48.200
With Pebeo's
Setaskrib Plus Markers,

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.167
you can embellish, decorate,

00:02:50.167 --> 00:02:53.800
and add fun details to
all kinds of fun pieces.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.067
We've got some canvas items,
we've got some wearable items,

00:02:57.067 --> 00:02:58.700
and some home dec pieces.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.267
The markers enable us to

00:03:00.267 --> 00:03:02.133
brighten up anything
in our home,

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:04.200
or something
that we might wear.

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.333
