Hi guys I’m Daniel Batatinha

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.580
I’m Marcelo

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:14.620
And I’m André

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:17.860

In this channel we will show you how to save money in your trip

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.820
And this trip could be in everywhere.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:42.520
Today, and this season we are here in New York. We’ll stay here for a while giving tips for you about the best places to you have fun and spend less money.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.560
Correct, we’ll talk about transportation, restaurants, exchange, and much more topics.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:01:03.040
Hey guys, we already got off the Grand Central Station, we are on 2nd avenue and 42nd street and we really want to drink a cheap beer tonight.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:09.320
Starting at point that every beer is good, cheaply is always good. There’s no bad beer. Bad is doesn’t drink.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.020
So we are going to a bar called by Calico Jack’s

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:26.920
It’s a Mexican bar and every Tuesday they have a happy hour and the greatest point is. The beer is just one dollar.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:34.020
So we are going there. Today is really cold, and we deserve a beer we are getting wet, so let’s go!

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.640
Let’s go, Let’s go.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.980
This is our friend Gello.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.180
He is a Saudi, almost Brazilian.

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.900
F*ckn Sh*t, F*ckn Cachaça!

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.780
We came here, inside. We have three dollars and we are going to start drinking.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.620
It’s not the best beer of the world, it’s just a bud light.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:06.420
But for one dollar is the best beer of the world.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.240
Two dollars. Two Beers.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.220
I need get drunk with ten dollars.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.320
Because I just have ten dollars here.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.260
This is the best beer of United States.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.940
At least the hangover is cheap.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.000
The hangover is for free, One dollar is three reais!

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.340
We are here in this table

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:39.920
We came here cause se music is really loud there.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.920
And we are going to talk a little bit about this bar here

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.400
The Calico Jacks

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:50.440
Actually I don’t Know exactly the name, is my the 5th or 6th time here

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.120
Maybe this is your 20th time here.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.640
This is my 5th time here, and I’ve been here just for three months.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:05.640
Actually is that, nobody call here as a Calico. We in our circle friends we call here as One Dollar Beer,

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.380
They prepare margaritas here, and it’s really cool too, really good, just for three Dollars.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:21.840
It’s a really good choice to come over here on Tuesdays, it’s a fun bar in general with cool people,  so it’s guaranteed fun with nice prices!

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.420
Until what time here?

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:24.540
Until they close.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:25.460
Until they close.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:34.960
Important tip. Do you want to drink cheap? Don’t come over here at noon. The happy hour just started at 6pm.

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:38.160
We were discussing here until what time he happy hour works.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.740
But the problem is we don’t remember what time this bar close.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:42.720
Never!

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.500
So come over here and drink until the bar close. And when someone throw you away, its over, is that.

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.660
So that is how it works, they need close the doors sometime.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:54.960
Because if they let, we can drink one dollar beer for months!

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.760
Come here F*ck!

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.180
The waiter told us that order a pitcher was a better deal than order a pint.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.140
So let’s take a proof.

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.120
One pitcher is eight dollars, one pint cost one dollar.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.300
So one pitcher must to fill up eight pints.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.900
Eight cups here and one pitcher.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.220
This big jar.

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.260
Let’s see!

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:27.960
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5 and half.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:30.360
I think the waiter lied to us.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.360
Following the “IBOPE’s Research” we could be f*cked up here.

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.740
But, we’ve already ordered. So let’s drink!

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:43.060
X our Thai friend is doing one for the guys. He’s paying beer for all friends here.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:53.740
X is a really good singer! He has a unique voice!

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:01.520
Daniel, How is the regular price of Bud Light pint here in New York?

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:11.680
Yeah. There is some point here. Nobody order Bud Light. So there’s no regular price for Bud Light here. You just drink one Bud Light in an off price!

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.680
This is our friend Tomonaga! Straight from Japan!

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.840
You see that is possible make the people happy with just one dollar!

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:48.820
Detail. He doesn’t drink.

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:56.140
I’m already drunk but we remembered that we had to try the Margarita.

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:02.460
It’s a nice drink if you don’t drink beer. 
So you don’t need come over here and just drink beer.

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:07.840
Margarita is Tequila, Cointreau and Lime here in U.S.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:09.420
Marcelo will try this Margarita.

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.580
Let me see if it's like a Margarita in Brazil.

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:19.080
It’s a little bit different in general the guys bring it in a special glass, with salt on the board and that stuff.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.720
But I think the quantity is the same. Let’s see the taste that is more important.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.180
It’s good. Actually very Good.

00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:57.160
Finishing one more night here at Well Known One Dollar Beer.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:08.120
We could to save some bucks here. And now we can spend in other places in New York. And is that. Sorry I’m drunk. This is the reason why of our channel so

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:23.480
And…

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:37.200
Margarita or marguerite?

00:07:37.380 --> 00:07:38.720
Marguerita is the pizza? Isn’t it?

00:07:38.940 --> 00:07:40.460
Marguerita is the pizza.

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:43.300
We always have this doubt.

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.620
I think is margarita, cause I’m reading there.

00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.200
Marcelo is cheating, he’s cheating!
