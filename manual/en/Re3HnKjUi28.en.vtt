00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:06.450
Well we're ready to start plating our dinner
that steaks are just gorgeous there completely

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:11.900
as perfect as can be. And I actually rather
than putting a big hunk of steak on the plate

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.941
like they do in Florence I actually like to
slice it thinly and then put it on the plate.

00:00:17.941 --> 00:00:23.030
Because that way I don't these days people
don't eat a pound and a half of meat, but

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:30.539
they will eat, they will eat a good amount
so this is just perfect it's medium rare,

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.750
more toward medium I think cause it's a hot
day I think it might of cooked more. But I

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.390
really wouldn't take it off the pan under
120 thats about it's lowest you want to go.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.730
That's really a nice color for the beef, okay
so when we put the meat on the plate, the

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.550
steak I just like to over lap it nicely and
I think I usually give people oh approximately

00:00:52.550 --> 00:01:02.880
6 oz if they want more they can have more.
Then the next big step is to finish it and

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:09.640
finishing is really with extra virgin olive
oil and some finishing salt. Finishing salt

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:16.360
is salt that really really fine salt now I
do use a French salt called fleue de sel it's

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.520
very course and I'm sprinkling it on here
just a little jolt of flavor. And then word

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:32.430
about extra virgin olive oil okay this olive
oil came from San Gimignano which is Tuscany

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.510
and in Italy. My husband and I went to the
vineyard where the olive where and this is

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:43.909
some of the finest olive oil that you can
bring home with you. It's really kind of nutty

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:50.930
and a little peppery oop but anyway in Julia
Child ooops but in case you don't know Julia

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.350
Childs a fabulous cook you just drizzle a
little bit on the steak and that adds to the

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.140
flavor. And then a little of pepper, don't
let people do there own, if they want more

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:06.090
later fine but you really need to finish just
like that isn't that gorgeous and then we'll

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:15.920
put on some of this delicious Parmesan palenta.
Which really gotten nice see, see the Parmesan

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.430
just make a nice little mount on the plate
like that and you can let people salt and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.090
pepper for themselves at this point and then
some nice vegetables. So I would just start

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:34.590
off by giving people one of everything maybe
2 of everything but this is really a nice

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:42.930
assortment and then just to add a little bit
of color for the plate. I just use a little

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:49.590
of fresh basil looks so so fresh and beautiful
and I just take the corner of a towel and

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:51.730
wipe off the plate it's ready to go.
