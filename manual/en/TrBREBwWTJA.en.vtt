00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.180
Today I want to give
you guys a very simple,

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:04.780
yet effective idea for how
you can monetize your Google+

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:06.170
Hangouts On Air.

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:07.250
That is coming up.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.590
Hey guys.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:13.770
My name is Tim Schmoyer.

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:16.186
And it's Wednesday, which means
it's time to give you guys

00:00:16.186 --> 00:00:18.610
some YouTube tips, tricks,
ideas, suggestions, advice,

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:19.574
all that kind of stuff.

00:00:19.574 --> 00:00:21.740
And today, let's talk about
Google+ Hangouts On Air.

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.740
My most recent one--
right here, as you

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:25.240
can go click and
go check it out-- I

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.030
did an interview
with Patrick Hanlon

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:28.400
the author of Primal Branding.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:30.940
And together, him and I
talked about the seven factors

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.520
that he's found in businesses
that really give people

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.914
a favorable, positive
feeling about your brand

00:00:36.914 --> 00:00:37.580
or your company.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.100
And we took those seven
factors and converted them

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.050
into YouTube language and how
we can build audiences here,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.720
and converting viewers
from just passive viewers

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.100
into a raving fan base
and to subscribers.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.910
I did something
different in this Hangout

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.660
that I haven't done
in any Hangout before.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.910
And that is, I actually
stopped for ad breaks.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.510
Now you may ask,
Tim, how do you stop

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.780
for ad breaks in a Hangout?

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.690
There's no way to insert ads
into your Google+ Hangout

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:00.190
on Air.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.400
And you are kind of
right, but not totally.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.750
So if you have a
YouTube channel that

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:08.815
has been invited to YouTube's
second tier of partnership--

00:01:08.815 --> 00:01:11.630
and that would mean that you
have video rentals enabled,

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.260
or you can insert, in this case,
midroll ads into your content--

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.560
well then you can do this.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.190
Because as we talked about
in last week's news video,

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.600
midroll ads have a
97 completion rate,

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.980
which is like the highest, most
effective, most best performing

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.250
video ad unit on the web.

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.270
So I thought, why not
take advantage of those?

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.012
And when I'm doing longer
form content on my channel,

00:01:35.012 --> 00:01:36.720
especially like Google+
Hangouts and Air,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.869
how about I just pause at
scheduled times and say,

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.160
those of you guys who are
watching a recording of this,

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:42.240
you're going to see
an ad right now.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:42.880
But hold tight.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.330
I'll be back right after this.

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.840
I stop for like a second or
two just to give me some space

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.040
to later go back
and insert a midroll

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.406
at that point in the video.

00:01:50.406 --> 00:01:53.030
And then I just keep going with
the interview or the discussion

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.682
as normal.

00:01:53.682 --> 00:01:55.890
For those of you guys who
are watching this recorded,

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.400
we are going to jump to one
last ad break right now.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.785
So we'll be back
right after this.

00:02:01.785 --> 00:02:03.410
All right, let's talk
about the leader.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.850
So the people who
are watching live

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.360
don't actually see the ad, which
might be confusing for them

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.500
at first, which is why I
say, "For those of you who

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.162
are watching this
recording later,"

00:02:11.162 --> 00:02:13.370
it kind of sets the context
so everyone kind of knows

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.000
which group they're in.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.620
Then later, I go back
and check the time code

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.830
of when I made those breaks.

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.050
And then I go into my
monetization settings

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.760
for that video on
YouTube, click the Midroll

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.540
Ad to enable that, and then just
type in the time code separated

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.584
by commas of when I went midroll
ads to display in that video.

00:02:28.584 --> 00:02:30.250
Now, a couple guidelines
for this-- one,

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:33.800
is that your video has to be
a minimum of 13 minutes long.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:36.810
You can not insert a midroll ad
on anything shorter than that.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.390
And two, your midroll
ads have to be

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.636
at least seven minutes apart.

00:02:39.636 --> 00:02:42.260
So you can't put them like every
two minutes, or three minutes.

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.801
Now I have also
found that they don't

00:02:43.801 --> 00:02:46.220
seem to work too well towards
the beginning of the video,

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.250
because often you will have
like the pre-roll ad showing

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.910
at that point.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:54.840
And so I've usually started
mine at around 25-30 minutes

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.430
in when I'll take
the first ad break.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.790
And then I'll go to
another 10-15 minutes

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.120
and take a second ad break.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.990
So typically for me,
for a one hour Hangout,

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:04.865
I will have the pre-roll
ad at the beginning,

00:03:04.865 --> 00:03:07.905
and then two midroll ads towards
the latter part of the Hangout.

00:03:07.905 --> 00:03:09.280
Now another thing
you should know

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.490
is that YouTube also won't show
ads back to back unless there's

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:13.960
been a certain
amount of time that

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:16.220
has elapsed between the
last time they saw the ad,

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.710
and when they are coming to
the midroll ad of your video.

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:21.010
So for example, if they
started watching your video,

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.462
they saw the
pre-roll ad, and then

00:03:22.462 --> 00:03:24.170
let's say this scrub
ahead in the video--

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.660
they scrub up to like
the 30 minute mark, which

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.390
happens to be where your
first midroll ad is--

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.060
that midroll ad won't
actually display there.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.150
YouTube will just skip it.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.740
It will just keep watching
right through because they just

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:35.880
saw the pre-roll ad.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.415
So that makes sense,
even though you miss out

00:03:37.415 --> 00:03:38.310
on a couple pennies there.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.490
But the user experience,
I know we would all agree,

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.414
is far more better and
more positive that way.

00:03:42.414 --> 00:03:43.830
It's also worth
noting that if you

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:46.450
are using YouTube's official
Live Streaming service-- not

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.570
Hangouts on Air, but
YouTube live-- there

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:53.172
you can actually insert ads
during the live broadcast--

00:03:53.172 --> 00:03:55.380
very easily, actually--
right into the live broadcast

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:56.671
while people are watching live.

00:03:56.671 --> 00:03:59.190
And then those ads
also do stay embedded

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.670
at that point in the video,
even in the recording when

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:02.550
it's available later.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.190
So this whole thing is
actually built into that

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:06.350
here on Hangouts and Air.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:08.350
You've just kind of got
to hack it a little bit.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.312
If you host regular
Google+ Hangouts On Air

00:04:10.312 --> 00:04:12.895
on your channel, I would love
to hear if this is something you

00:04:12.895 --> 00:04:14.000
would implement or not.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.745
And if so, why?

00:04:14.745 --> 00:04:15.977
And if not, why not?

00:04:15.977 --> 00:04:17.060
Leave your comments below.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.800
Share that with me.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.170
The rest of you guys,
always go check out

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:20.649
what the rest of the people
down there are saying.

00:04:20.649 --> 00:04:22.380
Because there are a lot
of really smart people

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:23.880
here on the Video
Creators channel.

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.710
And they always share
really good, helpful stuff.

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:26.920
I learn from you
guys all the time.

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:28.570
So thank you for all
your interaction,

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:29.450
your comments down there.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:30.580
And if this is your
first time here,

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.930
I'd love to have you subscribe.

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.388
Every Tuesday, we take a look
at online video news and talk

00:04:34.388 --> 00:04:36.590
about the implications it
has for us as creators.

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.060
On Wednesdays, we give you guys
some YouTube tips and ideas

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:40.290
and advice just like this.

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:41.510
And then tomorrow,
on Thursdays, we

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:43.580
do some YouTube Q&amp;A where
I answer the questions

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.650
that you guys have about
the content you're creating,

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:48.020
the audiences you're developing,
the channels you're building,

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.950
because I really believe
that a lot of you guys

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.855
have messages that could
really change the world

00:04:51.855 --> 00:04:53.896
and influence a lot of
people and make this world

00:04:53.896 --> 00:04:55.670
a better place, if
those people could just

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:56.910
hear what you have to say.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.500
So thank you for letting me be
a part of helping you guys grow

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.124
your channels and
spread your messages.

00:05:01.124 --> 00:05:01.680
Subscribe.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:03.500
And I will see guys
again tomorrow.

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.050
Bye.
