Hi everyone, it's Jerry.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.020
The Elephant Trap is a trap for black out
of the Queen's Gambit Declined.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:12.820
If white is not careful, just 5 or 6 moves
into the game, they can find themselves down

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.740
a minor piece and only have a pawn to show
for it.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:21.609
So here's how it works... d4, d5, c4, e6,
the Queen's Gambit Declined.

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:23.280
And just a quick summary of this trap.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.700
It really revolves around this d5 square.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.750
White is there to put pressure on it, black
is there to defend.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.210
Additional pressure on move 3, additional
defense.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.160
And even more pressure now on this d5 square,
only in this case indirectly since this knight

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.960
is now pinned to the queen.

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.230
And now after knight b to d7, this is where
white can simply go wrong thinking that they

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.750
could win a pawn on this d5 square.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.150
Now this move right here may very well be
steering into what's known as the Cambridge

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.960
Springs Defense.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.330
For example after e3, c6, knight f3, queen
a5 would denote the Cambridge Springs Defense.

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.140
Activating the queen, pinning the knight.

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.030
There might be some tricks along this 5th
rank.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.000
But we don't quite get there.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.860
As soon as knight b to d7 is played, this
is where white can go wrong in the following

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.860
way.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.800
On move 5, c takes d which is fine, e takes
d, but now on this 6th move if white takes

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.080
on d5, they've simply fallen for the Elephant
Trap.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.160
I'm not quite sure how it got its name, but
knight takes d5 is a serious blunder because

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:30.870
black can simply take the knight, give up
the queen but only temporarily since bishop

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.140
b4 check will win the white queen back in
short order.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.480
Queen d2 is an only move.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:37.480
The queen is pinned.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:42.311
You can take her right away, or simply recognize
she's going nowhere, pick up the bishop, and

00:01:42.311 --> 00:01:45.670
soon enough after the smoke clears...what
do we have?

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.420
Well black is simply up a minor piece, and
white only has a pawn to show for it.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:57.310
King to e2 is the only way to maintain defense
of the queen.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:05.790
But now comes the devastating pawn takes knight,
underpromoting to a knight, with check.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.490
This is all very important.
