Okay let her riaahhhh! Today we're going to
show you how a computer power supply work.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:21.189
Well it's the... what, power what? How does
a computer power supply work? It's quite complicated,

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.840
the power supply actually works by doing an
ac to a dc conversion to give you proper wattage

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:35.760
supply. Now look, it's not quite that easy
but it's not quite that complicated either.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.909
This octopus looking thing right here with
two fans on it and a plug on the back and

00:00:41.909 --> 00:00:48.199
usually a switch is the power supply. Inside
the computer are many different things that

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:55.030
require power. There's the mother board, there's
the processor. There are the drives. All of

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:01.410
these things have different power requirements.
That's where the confusion of cables come

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:09.070
from. Even though we plug that right into
our wall, which is ac, inside the power supply,

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:16.960
energy and power is converted to dc, from
alternating current to direct current, kind

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.430
of like a car battery system. Now the nice
thing about computers in the 21st century

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.270
is that it's almost impossible to plug your
power supply in incorrectly. They can only

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.680
fit one way. Here's the main power for the
motherboard. Now look and I'm going to do

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:40.370
it here. Ah, it clicks into place and as you'll
notice nothing else has a connector quite

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:47.300
like that. It takes alternating current, ac
current, it transforms it into dc current,

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:53.300
and then it sends it out to various different
wires to power different things inside your

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:00.590
computer. Like the fan, like the processor.
The nice thing is, read the flippin' manual,

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.420
it's going to tell you everything you need
to know.
