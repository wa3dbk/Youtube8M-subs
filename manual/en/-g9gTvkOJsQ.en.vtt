Hi, I'm Stuart Shepard.  This is Stoplight!

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.000
Okay, so mommy's birthday is coming up and
she likes practical gifts. 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.000
So I made you a list of things she could really use.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.300
And here's one hundred dollars for you to spend, okay.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.250
Now what do you think you'll buy?

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:28.900
Ahhh, I think I'll get a Stunt Quad-Copter and a Battle Droid.
Annnd maybe a Crusher BXM Bicycle.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.000
Okay now you realize that's all stuff that
you want but not anything that's on her list?

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.810
And you're way over budget.

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:41.160
True, but this is my money now. Hap-py Birthday!

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.850
I think we've all had that experience.
And I think it's also symbolic that the President

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.800
announced his latest budget proposal -- 
at an elementary school.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.800
You know the country has a long list of practical items
we could really use.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.800
 Lower taxes so the economy can get moving again.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.200
A clean break from Obamacare would be helpful.
How about an IRS that treats everybody the same?

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.200
But his election-year budget
looks a lot more like a shopping list

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.100
of all the voting blocks he'd like to buy:

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.300
Universal Preschool buys the teachers unions.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:16.100
"Green" Jobs buys the enviro-voters.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.900
And the list list goes on...

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.400
Meanwhile, he wants to raise taxes on people
who create private sector jobs.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.600
So basically, his budget would give money to people who
generally tend to vote for people who happen

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.800
to be in the same party. And he wants to raise
taxes on people who generally vote for people

00:01:32.829 --> 00:01:37.719
who happen to be in that other party.
And his budget is over budget.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:44.060
Now, to be perfectly fair, Democrats and Republicans
in Congress have been just as irresponsible

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.079
with how they spend our tax dollars --
they each have their own shopping lists.

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:53.039
But this is an election years, so it's a perfect
time for "us" to remind "them" whose money it is,

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:57.400
what that money is for, and why you can't
run up the credit card forever.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:03.000
And you might suggest that they can buy their own
birthday present this year.
