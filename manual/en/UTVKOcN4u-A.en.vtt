My name is James Grant and I’m from Glasgow
in Scotland. My username is SweetWaveAudio

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.490
and I’m a Media Maker for Pond5.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.200
I’m a drummer. I’ve always played
in bands since I was 12 years old

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.860
and I’ve always enjoyed
recording music but I don’t sing,

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:33.920
so I used to always record instrumental songs.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.800
And one of my friends, he gave me a bit of paper with the word Pond5 on the piece of paper and said

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.240
“check this website out, you can make money from this”

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.900
I had no idea what stock audio
or stock media even was. So I went home the

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.710
next day and I checked it out and I thought
I’ll give it a little try. Someone bought

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.859
a song and I felt like I’d won the lottery,
and then I thought this needs to be my job.

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:58.439
Luckily after 3 years of hard work I’ve
managed it, so I’m happy!

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:04.340
Because of stock footage and Pond5 I’ve managed to buy myself some nice musical toys.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:10.580
And also it’s a total novelty for a musician to be able to
go on holiday or go on a trip somewhere and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:15.659
your earning don’t just flatline and stop.
You can have Pond5 in the background making

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.059
you a bit of money, almost like holiday pay, which is
a total foreign concept to any musician I know,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.660
so I’m pretty lucky that way.
So thanks Pond5 for that!

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.440
If someone wanted to start making stock music I would say

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.700
the Number One thing is: play to your strengths.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.820
Realize what you’re best at and write music in that
style to start with,

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.200
maybe have one or two styles that you’re best at.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.160
And also don’t get too attached to a certain song.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.860
If you’ve put a song up that you love and no one buys
it, don’t get downhearted.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.060
Just put a song up and almost forget about it and move on to the next one.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:56.000
My attitude about it is that it’ll be okay.
I always think that and so far it has.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.020
As well as doing royalty free music for Pond5

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.520
I’m hoping to do royalty based music for film and TV, things like that.

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.800
And I’ve also been working on a… “device”
that brainwashes all the Pond5 customers

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.760
into only being able to search for my music.
So as soon as I’ve finished the prototype

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.940
I'm gonna put it on the internet and take over the world.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:28.920
Buy my songs!
