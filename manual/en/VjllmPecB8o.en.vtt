00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:12.389
bjbjqPqP Jan: All right.

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.930
We're about to make Tennessee Caviar, which
is a really fabulous bean dip, and to make

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:19.410
that I'm going to use a couple of jalapenos.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.119
A lot of people don't realize how to work
with jalapenos so that you have the flavor,

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.980
but don't knock yourself over from the heat.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.710
First thing you want to do is take his little
hat off.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.699
Man: Let's do this again.

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:39.980
Jan: Oh, would you like me to do something?

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:40.980
All right.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.980
We're working with jalapeno peppers today.

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.370
I'm going to make a couple of different things
that have jalapenos in them.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.190
A lot of people don't realize how to work
with chilies, fresh chilies to get the flavor,

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.090
but not necessarily that knock your head off
heat.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.970
Now jalapenos, in my opinion, are some of
the milder chilies.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.109
However, on occasion you get 1, because I
think I read somewhere 1 in 25 there's 1 that's

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:04.070
just going to take your head off.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:08.880
But to work with it, cut his little hat off,
so you've just got this.

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.250
Then come in here and cut him in half.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.210
Now, with all the fresh chilies, and it can
be an Anaheim, it can be a Jalapeno, it can

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.409
be a Serrano, this is the flavor of the distinct
chili, but the heat, the capsaicin is in the

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.409
seeds and the membrane.

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:32.450
Actually, I think it really is in the membrane,
but the seeds carry the heat with it.

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.939
So if you want the highest level of heat,
chop it up and leave the seeds and membrane

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:37.939
in there.

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:43.299
But if you want to capture the flavor and
get a rounder, more richness and depth of

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:44.680
flavor, get rid of those.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.680
Here's the easiest way to do it.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.750
Now, it will get on your hands, so don't go
doing this and then scratch your eye, because

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.590
I've done that and I really regretted it.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:01.140
But take a spoon and just pull it down through
where that rib is, and that is going to leave

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.469
you a little . . . see, it's all gone.

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:10.269
Now, because I have children and my dad loves
this stuff, but he doesn't like the heat,

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:19.120
I do like to mince it very finely so that
you don't get just a giant bite with lots

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.930
of heat in it.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.269
So to mince I just cut it into little strips
like that, and then I'm going to come in here

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.680
and make them as tiny as I can.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.970
This first recipe that I'm about to do next
is not going to be cooked.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.841
So I want to make sure that you get little
tiny hints of jalapeno in your bites, because

00:02:42.841 --> 00:02:46.459
it won't have a chance to cook and distribute.

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:47.459
See?

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.170
Isn't that pretty?

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.330
So that's how you work with jalapenos.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.330
Okay.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:59.110
So a little while ago I was showing you how
to mince up jalapenos.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.909
I was talking about how you don't want to
get it on your hands.

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:03.230
You may wear plastic gloves.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:07.769
Because if you get it on your hands, it can
burn, and then if you touch your face or your

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:11.569
eyes or your nose or your kid, it's going
to burn there too.

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:17.280
Well, sure enough, I have jalapeno, the capsaicin
from cutting those peppers, and it's gotten

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.950
under my nails, and it hurts.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:19.950
I don't like it.

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.070
You can wash your hands all you want to.

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:27.409
The problem is the capsaicin is water-soluble,
meaning that you're going to be washing your

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:29.159
hands and spreading the capsaicin.

00:03:29.159 --> 00:03:30.980
Now, here's the trick.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.739
Just like if you're eating spicy food and
you need to cool off and you want a dairy

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:42.540
product, sour cream, yogurt, milk, ice cream,
whatever, this is just whole milk.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.049
Now this will actually dissolve the capsaicin
and allow me to wash it away.

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:52.840
So if you find yourself, like I just did,
making that kind of mistake and it feels like

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:58.834
your fingernails are about to burst into flame,
this is all you have to do.
