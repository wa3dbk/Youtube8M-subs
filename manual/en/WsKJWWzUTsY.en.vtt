00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:01.200
Hi

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.060
Even the most boring shots,

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.120
 turn into interesting and captivating scenes,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.060
when you shoot them on a slider.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:11.760
 However, until now all sliders had a common problem

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.160
They were not portable,

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.780
and the long ones were usually difficult to carry around

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.580
and the portable ones gave limited camera slide.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.360
SliderPLUS is a breakthrough slider

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.360
 that solves this major problem.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.020
It's the only slider in the world that combines portable size

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.000
with long camera travel.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.700
It gives twice the amount of camera travel

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.440
compared to regular sliders at it's size.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.100
Thanks to it's compact design,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.320
you will always have your SliderPLUS with you

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.180
and since SliderPLUS is lighter and  smaller,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:45.920
you will work faster with it.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.180
and gather a wider variety of footage on your productions

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:50.440
 in the same amount of time.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.500
 It's going to leverage your productivity.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.100
SliderPLUS also gives you

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.880
longer dolly in/out range compared to regular sliders.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.760
With it's retracting rails,

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.840
you will get twice the amount of dolly in/out range.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.020
This extra range will give you more freedom

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.000
 while setting up your shots.

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.520
All parts are CNC machined aluminum.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.060
Most of it's parts are machined from mono blocks

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:19.920
and it delivers silky smooth results.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.860
SliderPLUS has 3/8 inch connections underneath and on top

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:26.740
to connect easily to tripods and camera heads.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:26.920
Alternatively, it can be operated directly on ground,
to connect easily to tripods and camera heads.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.920
Alternatively, it can be operated directly on ground,

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.920
without the need for a tripod.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.920
It has an instant locking button on it,

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.500
which makes the slider even safer.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.020
The screw on top folds in,

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.780
so it fits perfectly in it's carrying case.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.740
It has various sizes, and carrying capacities.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.720
It's compatible to all cameras,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.800
and can adapt to different conditions.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:52.320
SliderPLUS also has very exciting motion control add-ons,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.280
 that deliver never before seen results.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.280
