00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.535
Back in the day
Long distance was down the road

00:00:00.535 --> 00:00:05.585
Then technology improved
And we communicate around the globe

00:00:05.585 --> 00:00:08.555
Computers were ginormous
They were large as Transformers

00:00:08.555 --> 00:00:12.365
Listening to your music
On 8 track player-recorders

00:00:12.365 --> 00:00:15.955
Vinyls then Cassettes
Walkman CD players were high-tech

00:00:15.955 --> 00:00:20.285
And now we have mp3s
And Blue Ray DVDs

00:00:20.285 --> 00:00:23.905
And we have the power of the internet our
hands

00:00:23.905 --> 00:00:28.075
Doing things that no 80s technology can

00:00:28.075 --> 00:00:31.885
It's hard to believe
How much technology has changed

00:00:31.885 --> 00:00:35.095
According to Moore's Law
It gets better everyday

00:00:35.095 --> 00:00:39.385
It's the future
Have you ever used typewriters?

00:00:39.385 --> 00:00:43.325
It's the future
Now typewriters are expired

00:00:43.325 --> 00:00:47.304
It's hard to believe
How much technology has changed

00:00:47.304 --> 00:00:50.394
According to Moore's Law
It gets better everyday

00:00:50.394 --> 00:00:54.834
It's the future
Cell phones used to enormous

00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:58.825
It's the future
Some phones still are enormous!

00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:02.635
It's hard to believe
How much technology has changed

00:01:02.635 --> 00:01:05.775
According to Moore's Law
It gets better everyday

00:01:05.775 --> 00:01:09.895
It's the future
We wonder what you have in store

00:01:09.895 --> 00:01:13.595
It's the future
Science opens that door

00:01:13.595 --> 00:01:17.825
100 years from now
Computers will be smaller

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:22.055
Don't get it confused
Because computers will be baller

00:01:22.055 --> 00:01:25.245
Autopilot real
Cars with minds of their own

00:01:25.245 --> 00:01:32.705
Guided by the same GPS in your mobile phone
Nanotechnology will cure all of disease

00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:38.865
Sort of like Elysium healing machines
Internet in our eyes

00:01:38.865 --> 00:01:42.335
Contact lenses with circuit boards
It's no surprise

00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:44.784
We're still waiting on those hover boards
: /

00:01:44.784 --> 00:01:48.625
It's hard to believe
How much technology will change

00:01:48.625 --> 00:01:51.845
According to Moore's Law
It gets better everyday

00:01:51.845 --> 00:01:56.235
It's the future
Technology is so cray!

00:01:56.235 --> 00:01:59.695
It's the future
I never go outside and play

00:01:59.695 --> 00:02:04.055
I said it's hard to believe
How much technology will change

00:02:04.055 --> 00:02:07.534
According to Moore's Law
It gets better everyday

00:02:07.534 --> 00:02:11.444
It's the future
iPhone 100th generation

00:02:11.444 --> 00:02:15.064
It's the future
I travel space on vacation

00:02:15.064 --> 00:02:19.325
I said it's hard to believe
How much technology will change

00:02:19.325 --> 00:02:20.655
According to Moore's Law

00:02:20.655 --> 00:02:24.225
It gets better everyday
It's the future

00:02:24.225 --> 00:02:26.974
What else will we explore?

00:02:26.974 --> 00:02:30.295
It's the future
I really want that hoverboard :)

00:02:30.295 --> 00:02:33.955
Coma Niddy here and thanks for watching the
future song.

00:02:33.955 --> 00:02:35.284
What are your ideas about the future?

00:02:35.284 --> 00:02:37.495
What are some technologies that you're looking
forward to?

00:02:37.495 --> 00:02:38.495
I want to hear your ideas.

00:02:38.495 --> 00:02:40.375
So leave them in the comments below.

00:02:40.375 --> 00:02:44.454

00:02:50.345 --> 00:02:53.545
You hear it all the time, people tell you
all about their theories.

00:02:53.545 --> 00:02:55.535
But what they mean to say is that they have
hypothesis.

00:02:55.535 --> 00:02:58.375
It's a known fact that everybody poops.

00:02:58.375 --> 00:02:59.754
Animals poop.

00:02:59.754 --> 00:03:00.754
People poop.

00:03:00.754 --> 00:03:03.125
And the bacteria in your mouth, do the same
thing.

00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:05.745
A spaceship fight in space would sound like
[ silence ]
