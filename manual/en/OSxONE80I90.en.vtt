00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.067
hi guys so I missed you guys so much

00:00:02.067 --> 00:00:04.020
I thought to do this video this is

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.451
actually being requested a while back

00:00:05.451 --> 00:00:06.960
and I never really got to do it because

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.055
I have a confession to make

00:00:09.055 --> 00:00:11.849
I am a tiny little bit obsessed with

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:13.574
bags just just a little

00:00:13.574 --> 00:00:16.049
I picked a bag that I kind of use

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.490
probably the most often I guess out of

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.060
all the other bags and also that I think

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.910
you've seen already it's been featured

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.460
in my fall fashion and this is the

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.507
Rebecca Minkoff Cupid bag

00:00:28.507 --> 00:00:31.619
Cupid's bag I think and this is in the

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.414
black leather with the gold hardware it

00:00:33.414 --> 00:00:35.070
fits a lot of things it has a lot of

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.508
compartments where you can like

00:00:36.508 --> 00:00:38.560
separate things because I'm a very organized person

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.400
I like to have a specific compartment for a specific thing

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.300
let's get right into it

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:45.800
you guys are going to already know if you don't

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.925
there's basically a zip pocket in the front with

00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:53.190
a zip that I always leave unzipped and

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.426
then there's a back pocket here at the

00:00:55.426 --> 00:00:57.780
back of the front pocket and then I have

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.997
two side pockets so I'll go from the

00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:02.399
beginning there's the one I always have

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.830
my acne or blotting paper because I have

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.200
one in every bag because I cannot leave

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.731
the house better because I'm such a

00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:10.350
loyal slick I need to like absorb the

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.425
oil like from my face like right now I

00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:14.610
can feel it already so I'm just going to

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.364
use one alright okay these are the ones

00:01:17.364 --> 00:01:20.189
that basically I like because it doesn't

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:22.548
really move the makeup that much and

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:25.170
also it's it's easy for you to see where

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.187
your oil is because it doesn't it goes

00:01:27.187 --> 00:01:29.310
clear when it's really early whereas the

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.063
other ones like the butcher paper ones

00:01:31.063 --> 00:01:32.909
you can't really see whether it's oil or

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.320
just like it's wet and the other pocket

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.670
I have my headphones for my iPhone and

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:42.402
this little resist this is the babbino

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:47.009
basically it's like a wire like thing

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.704
that you can like kind of hook around so

00:01:48.704 --> 00:01:50.399
it doesn't get tangled but I find that I

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.906
when I untangle it it takes more time to

00:01:52.906 --> 00:01:55.350
like when I tangled it so this is where

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.101
basically what I do just tuck that in

00:01:57.101 --> 00:01:58.710
there and then okay so on the side

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:00.870
pockets I have my mirror which is this

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.030
is the Chanel one you could be seen my

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.783
my makeup bag it has one magnifying one

00:02:05.783 --> 00:02:06.630
and then one

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.235
so I have that in there because I never

00:02:09.235 --> 00:02:11.640
know what you need it for like it is

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.943
somebody spying on you and you're like

00:02:12.943 --> 00:02:14.280
run to the corner and then you can slip

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.960
out your naira and be like check that

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.730
person out from behind I watch too much

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.333
movies and I also have in here my lip

00:02:21.333 --> 00:02:25.130
balm which is the this is the hourglass

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.525
lip oil that I love and love love this

00:02:28.525 --> 00:02:31.920
is so amazing it's really hydrating it

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.640
can actually apply this over lipstick

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.220
can apply this before lipstick and

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.343
pleasant nighttime so you go to bed it's

00:02:37.343 --> 00:02:39.360
such a good overall if you're not into

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.053
the oily lip look then maybe you want to

00:02:41.053 --> 00:02:42.450
avoid this but if you have really

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.627
dehydrated dry lips this is this is a

00:02:44.627 --> 00:02:46.980
deep to go I also have mint this is this

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.026
the Starbucks after coffee mints and I

00:02:49.026 --> 00:02:50.910
have mint like with me all the time

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:56.060
these are like super like in your face

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.359
and on the other side I have apparently

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.480
more mints this is the Hello Kitty

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.833
cherry sour ones look how cute that's

00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:08.250
just a nerdy kitty like I saw this I'm

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.750
like I have to have it

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.030
okay now the main compartment obviously

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.910
I had my phone and then I have this is

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.790
the Chancellor fresh which is actually

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.686
my favorite Chanel fragrance it is like

00:03:19.686 --> 00:03:21.630
fresh and crisp and it's really good for

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.384
like it's great in summer but I like it

00:03:23.384 --> 00:03:25.049
all year round and this is the actual

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.263
head mist so it's not the actual perfume

00:03:27.263 --> 00:03:29.310
so I don't know if you guys have this

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.305
problem where you go to like a

00:03:30.305 --> 00:03:31.500
restaurant or if you go to somewhere

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.416
where stinks and then you come out and

00:03:33.416 --> 00:03:35.130
then your hair stinks of this like

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:38.137
either smoke or barbecue or like

00:03:38.137 --> 00:03:41.519
whatever stench it is well because I

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.356
know hair like hair absorbs a lot of

00:03:43.356 --> 00:03:45.090
like the odor so what this does it

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.204
actually helps to spray on your hair

00:03:47.204 --> 00:03:49.200
because it doesn't contain as much

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.797
alcohol as it would contain in an actual

00:03:51.797 --> 00:03:53.940
perfume and you're not wasting it

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.447
because it's you know hair for your hair

00:03:56.447 --> 00:03:58.829
and off your body and is that okay and

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:01.635
also carry my sunglasses with me this

00:04:01.635 --> 00:04:04.440
this is a product product pair that I

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.465
bought earlier this year I love this one

00:04:06.465 --> 00:04:08.489
because it actually the color it matches

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:10.103
my hair so I actually goes with

00:04:10.103 --> 00:04:12.030
everything and it's super comfortable

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.766
the morning when I have no makeup this

00:04:14.766 --> 00:04:17.430
is all I wear and I also keep in here

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.067
my makeup bag which you probably already

00:04:20.067 --> 00:04:22.440
seen if you haven't seen already can

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.470
watch it I also have in here my mom my

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.500
hand sanitizer this is the Hello Kitty

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.144
this is a Hello Kitty's hand sanitizer

00:04:33.144 --> 00:04:35.580
as I have my hand cream this is the

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.924
laksa time in the delicious hands know

00:04:39.924 --> 00:04:44.040
sort it's in the mandate with almond

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:46.231
milk this is the my favorite scent out

00:04:46.231 --> 00:04:48.479
of the whole l'occitane collection this

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:49.890
is actually probably the thing that

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.300
caught me with l'occitane the first

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.120
place they used to have this almond milk

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.940
body body lotion cream and it was smells

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.226
so good and it's like it's not it's not

00:05:00.226 --> 00:05:03.090
overpowering and it's not fresh or

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:05.794
fruity it's just purely like a nice sort

00:05:05.794 --> 00:05:08.430
of like clean and fresh feeling like so

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:09.785
after you go come in the shower and you

00:05:09.785 --> 00:05:11.070
apply this on your skin you just feel

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.193
really fresh and like like like you just

00:05:13.193 --> 00:05:15.210
had the most amazing bath of your life

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.387
this is this is this is actually a good

00:05:17.387 --> 00:05:19.620
journal that I got on eBay and it's just

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.194
a little rubber band that you know goes

00:05:22.194 --> 00:05:24.570
over the dodo pad if you can't see a

00:05:24.570 --> 00:05:26.544
public but actually has a smiley face on

00:05:26.544 --> 00:05:28.320
it and what I do with this I keep my

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:30.955
pass for my work and also my MetroCard

00:05:30.955 --> 00:05:33.660
at the back because I hate reaching for

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.886
my wallet for my metro pass all the time

00:05:35.886 --> 00:05:37.889
because you have to like open in and

00:05:37.889 --> 00:05:38.435
blah blah blah

00:05:38.435 --> 00:05:39.840
whereas I just whipped this out I go

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:42.432
peepee when I go to work yeah my wallet

00:05:42.432 --> 00:05:45.090
this is my wallet I've had this for like

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:46.818
so many years this is actually a

00:05:46.818 --> 00:05:48.870
birthday gift for my friend this was a

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.588
gift and it was from like like a year

00:05:50.588 --> 00:05:52.260
years ago and because I was obsessed

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.597
with purple which I still AM it was like

00:05:54.597 --> 00:05:56.700
a just like a seasonal piece this is

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.024
this isn't a Mademoiselle Locke version

00:05:59.024 --> 00:06:01.050
and it's the patent leather in the

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:03.415
quilted and it's a caballo so it's only

00:06:03.415 --> 00:06:05.840
like one flat hide on my card on top and

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.260
it has like two compartments and a zip

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:12.680
in the middle which for your coins and

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:16.076
it also has a little slack of the front

00:06:16.076 --> 00:06:19.560
and two flaps on the back so it actually

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.567
does have a lot of compartments for a

00:06:21.567 --> 00:06:23.520
vial which is actually pretty good I

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:27.911
like the smell of leather no this is me

00:06:27.911 --> 00:06:30.050
I also have in here

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:31.641
my lip products so usually I throw in

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.319
here whatever the product I'm using for

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:35.179
the day so today I'm using number one

00:06:35.179 --> 00:06:37.190
one set of Magnolia from Chanel which is

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:39.652
like this pink pink color and then I

00:06:39.652 --> 00:06:42.319
usually reapply throughout the day with

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:44.150
like a gloss and this is the one in

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.190
Lhasa love in fuchsia which I've showed

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.141
you before because it does this magic

00:06:50.141 --> 00:06:54.199
key and what else what else oh this is

00:06:54.199 --> 00:06:56.634
so important for all your iPhone users

00:06:56.634 --> 00:06:58.940
out there you guys do exactly what I mean

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:01.430
you would definitely need to use this at

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:03.797
least once throughout the day and this

00:07:03.797 --> 00:07:06.289
is the portable charger so I charge this

00:07:06.289 --> 00:07:08.075
at nighttime and then in the morning

00:07:08.075 --> 00:07:09.860
with halfway through the day with my

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:10.981
phone is about to die

00:07:10.981 --> 00:07:13.009
I actually just basically plug this in

00:07:13.009 --> 00:07:16.509
here and then use that to charge my

00:07:16.509 --> 00:07:20.210
phone like so like this and that will

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:22.505
give me like like a whole new recharge

00:07:22.505 --> 00:07:24.680
and this this will last me like more

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.525
than a day taking a lot of photos and

00:07:26.525 --> 00:07:28.370
videos and then your battery dies and

00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:29.980
this is what I made so this is really

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.460
handy and I don't think I can live

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:34.452
without this so I think that's all in my

00:07:34.452 --> 00:07:37.219
bag yes that's all and this is pretty

00:07:37.219 --> 00:07:39.726
much the same man things I carry in all

00:07:39.726 --> 00:07:42.169
of my bags and I keep them too minimal

00:07:42.169 --> 00:07:45.248
because I like to change bags a lot so

00:07:45.248 --> 00:07:48.409
this is my what's in my purse bag slash

00:07:48.409 --> 00:07:50.585
tag hope you guys enjoyed watching it

00:07:50.585 --> 00:07:52.819
because I know I'm very nosy I like to

00:07:52.819 --> 00:07:54.599
watch them because I like to see what

00:07:54.599 --> 00:07:56.330
other people have in their bags so I

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:58.604
thought why not do a video like this

00:07:58.604 --> 00:08:01.130
comment below let me know we think and I

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:04.840
will see my next video bye
