00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.057
[MUSIC]

00:00:04.057 --> 00:00:06.228
I am God.

00:00:06.228 --> 00:00:08.016
&gt;&gt; Pew pew.

00:00:08.016 --> 00:00:08.940
&gt;&gt; What's this one?

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.268
&gt;&gt; That's me.

00:00:10.268 --> 00:00:12.609
&gt;&gt; That doesn't look anything like you.

00:00:12.609 --> 00:00:14.073
&gt;&gt; I think it does.

00:00:14.073 --> 00:00:15.631
&gt;&gt; No it looks like garbage.

00:00:15.631 --> 00:00:17.755
That's not even a subjective thing.

00:00:17.755 --> 00:00:21.814
&gt;&gt; I should really get
an action figure of myself.

00:00:21.814 --> 00:00:31.944
[MUSIC]

00:00:31.944 --> 00:00:34.283
So, I really want an action
figure of myself and

00:00:34.283 --> 00:00:36.450
I heard that maybe you
can help me with that.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.330
&gt;&gt; We can definitely do that for you.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:39.350
&gt;&gt; So, where are we?

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.910
&gt;&gt; You're at the DOOB's
store in front of Soho.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.070
&gt;&gt; What do you actually make here?

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.070
Do you make action figures?

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.510
Did you make Iron Man?

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.620
&gt;&gt; We, we could me you a iron man.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.491
Basically we have a 3D
scanner here behind us so.

00:00:52.491 --> 00:00:57.046
&gt;&gt; You've step into it takes a split
second we scan you, 54 images from all

00:00:57.046 --> 00:01:02.000
around we crosses out the data there
out to 3D file and we 3D print.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.676
This action figure of you.

00:01:03.676 --> 00:01:08.610
People that are coming here, they're,
theyre not find this as a novelty.

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.975
You know its not really printing for
the sake of 3D printing.

00:01:10.975 --> 00:01:12.350
You has seen this in the past,

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.930
some of the market 3D printing
hasn't been high 3D resolution.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:18.620
It's hard for the people to
really know what is the signal,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.230
what does it mean to me.

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:23.240
People are coming in here because
these things are so realistic, and

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.280
they're, they're, they're coming in with
their children, or they're coming in with

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.740
their pets, or they're coming
in with their significant other.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:31.411
Or with a an instrument or

00:01:31.411 --> 00:01:35.552
something that they're they
are really passionate about and

00:01:35.552 --> 00:01:41.139
they're trying to preserve those things
that they really love for in 3D forever.

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:42.431
&gt;&gt; This sounds fun.

00:01:42.431 --> 00:01:43.561
Should I get in the scanner?

00:01:43.561 --> 00:01:44.614
Yeah.
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:01:44.614 --> 00:01:45.609
&gt;&gt; Let's make me superhero.

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:48.921
&gt;&gt; All right.
&gt;&gt; So step on in.

00:01:48.921 --> 00:01:52.256
So basically, we have 54 cameras,
in all angles and

00:01:52.256 --> 00:01:57.090
you're just gonna position yourself
in the center of this circle.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.208
&gt;&gt; Cool.
All right, let's do this.

00:02:00.208 --> 00:02:04.058
[SOUND] Three, two, one.

00:02:04.058 --> 00:02:09.495
[SOUND]
&gt;&gt; In the process called photogrammetry,

00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:14.002
we take the 54 images, process it through
a proprietary software which turns

00:02:14.002 --> 00:02:16.550
it into a 3D file,
&gt;&gt; Speaker 2: It was in a tall production

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.320
center in Brooklyn where
we do the 3D printing.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.140
That process actually can
take up to about a day.

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.460
It's layers of thousands of layers of
powder that are laid down one by one,

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.160
built up, glued together and

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.350
then at the end of sort of
reaching into this printer and

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:37.480
sort of excavating out of this big white
pile of powder these individual figures.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.630
&gt;From there we clean them off, do some post
processing just make sure that the look,

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.500
they're clean and look good.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.670
The color is included, so
it's actually from a printer,

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.958
that's the only 3D printer that does
the full CMYK range of colors right now.

00:02:51.958 --> 00:02:53.036
[MUSIC]

00:02:53.036 --> 00:02:55.300
&gt;&gt; That's not even a.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:57.644
[SOUND] Woah.

00:02:57.644 --> 00:02:58.493
That's so cool.

00:02:58.493 --> 00:03:01.009
&gt;&gt; It's my super action figure thing.

00:03:01.009 --> 00:03:02.502
&gt;&gt; Wow, what are your powers?

00:03:02.502 --> 00:03:06.314
&gt;&gt; I mostly just like things on Instagram,
cuz I have a little computer.

00:03:06.314 --> 00:03:07.482
And I can drink coffee.

00:03:07.482 --> 00:03:08.456
&gt;&gt; That's so cool.

00:03:08.456 --> 00:03:09.334
&gt;&gt; Right?

00:03:14.301 --> 00:03:17.394
&gt;&gt; I feel like the version
of me isn't as good anymore.

00:03:17.394 --> 00:03:17.894
&gt;&gt; [LAUGH]
