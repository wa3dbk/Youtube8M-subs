00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.880
Welcome by VoetbalomgevingTV!

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:08.720
Today we make another start with the item 'Game Tactics'.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.380
This time we analyse the game system 1-4-4-2.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.900
The system 1-4-4-2.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.980
On the board you can see the formation 1-4-4-2. With the midfielders playing in the shape of a bowl.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.320
The positions 6, 7, 8 &amp; 11 are the midfielders who don't play on a line, but in the shape of a bowl.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.340
The strikers 9 &amp; 10 play right next to each other.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:36.480
As a variation on 1-4-4-2 with a bowl on the midfield, you can also play with more depth.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.960
Or you can choose to play 1-4-4-2 with a diamond shape on the midfield.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.640
The positions 6 &amp; 8 don't play next to each other but in front of each other.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.100
The positions 7 &amp; 11 can play on the side or play from the inside.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:01:02.720
What you sometimes see is that when you are behind, you can play with two midfielders on the outside and two wing defenders up high.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.660
Where you actually are going to play two blocks of five players.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.500
The positions 3, 4 &amp; 6 are taking the control and defensive balance of the team.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.520
The wing defenders are going to get in attack mode.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.320
Position 7 &amp; 11 are keeping the field wide.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.320
Two strikers in front of the goal to score the cross ball from the wing.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:21.000
One player just outside the keepers territory to pick up the loose ball (second ball opportunity).

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.640
Now I'm gonna explain the pros and cons of this system.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:40.040
I have chosen for this formation, with the midfield playing in the shape of a bowl. And the two strikers playing just underneath each other.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.600
From my point of view this is very simular to the system 1-4-3-3.

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.860
Instead of putting the wing attackers 20 meters higher to play like real wing attackers.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.020
You now play with two deep center attackers and room for creativity in de corners of the field.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.880
Benefit #1: the advantage of this system is that the organisation is always good in a defensive way.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:09.960
Defensively you have beneath the 4 defenders and a goalkeeper also the disposal of four midfielders who can pinch and make the field much smaller.

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:12.480
Is the ball on this side of the field.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.960
Then the midfielders van pinch their way in a good spot to support their defense.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.540
The disadvantages of playing 1-4-4-2.

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:33.520
Because the midfielders have a 'defense first' mindset, it can be possible that the attackers can get isolated on to an island.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.660
Because of the large space between the offensive line and the midfield players.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:42.080
An other disadvantage can be the quality of the players 7 &amp; 11.

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:51.860
When your team is on the attack, you want them to players with a good 1 on 1 action.

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.400
But when the team has lost possession of the ball you want them to be strengten the midfielders.

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.760
The demands of playing 1-4-4-2.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:15.140
The goalkeeper and central defenders, don't do anything  different from the system 1-4-4-3.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.180
Position 2 &amp; 5 (wing defenders) do have another task.

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.860
Because the space on the wings are not filled up but is being released.

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.400
Would it be nice if the positions 2 &amp; 5 not only have the ability to stretch the flanks. But also are able to come up with a decend cross on the attackers.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:45.840
The midfielders 6 &amp; 8 need to be able to play in control on the midfield. But also need to connect with the offensive line.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:55.380
Positions 7 &amp; 11 in possession of the ball need to have the ability to play a defender 1 on 1 and ensuring danger for the goal of the opponent.

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:59.360
In the counter attack (defensively) they are the third and fourth midfielder.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:09.380
On the offensive line you can choose for a deep striker whom can play with the back towards the goal of the opponent and can protect the ball.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.600
The position 10 could be a second striker.  Normally called a 'shadow' striker.

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:21.560
This needs to be a player who uses the space the other striker (position 9) is creating for him.

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:33.160
Another option is to play with a more creative kind of player. Who is strong with the ball and is playing from the combination of off the dribble.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.440
