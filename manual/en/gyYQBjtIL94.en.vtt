Hi everyone and welcome to ICON.

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.500
It's Kaushal and today I'm going to be showing
you how to create this beautiful summer wedding

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.500
make up look.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.400
I really like this look because it's using
some really beautiful pinks and earthy coral

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.429
tones and I feel like you can wear it for
any wedding, any time of the year.

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:22.609
So, if you'd like to see how to get this make
up look then let's get started!

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:31.189
So I'm going to first start off with my base
and the foundation that I'm going to be using

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.560
is this L'Oréal Lumi Magique one because
it gives you the slightest bit of glow, but

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:38.800
it's also really good coverage as well.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.410
The concealer I'm going to be using is the
Naked Skin Concealer by Urban Decay.

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.699
Now I really like doing this because it looks
amazing in photography as well.

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:49.720
And we know we're going to be taking lots
of selfies and lots of pictures during the

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.720
wedding season.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:57.249
And I like to make a triangle shape underneath
my eyes like this and then I fill the gap

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:58.249
in.

00:00:58.249 --> 00:01:02.850
And do the same on the other eye.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.940
Now I'm going to also add this on my forehead.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.860
I'm going to draw three lines here.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.130
And then drag it down the center and bridge
of our nose.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.390
And then whatever is left on the wand we're
going to pop some onto our chin and also our

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.560
Cupid's bow.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.670
So all these places will look higher up than
the rest.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.990
Now I'm just going to blend all this away
with this Zoeva brush.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.119
And what you don't want to do is you don't
want to move the product around all over your

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:29.119
face.

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:35.460
You want to make sure that it's kind of in
that area.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:39.930
So now we're going to set all of those areas
using this Kick Ass Powder by Soap and Glory.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.909
And this has got a slight yellow kind of tint
to it so it will help with the highlighting

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:44.909
effect as well.

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:51.630
Tap off any excess, and then just press it
in to the areas that we have concealed and

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:52.630
highlighted.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.189
And this will also help the product not to
budge and it will also help it not to crease

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:58.189
as well.

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.040
So now I'm going to move on to my eyes and
the first thing that I'm going to do is I'm

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.340
going to fill in my brows.

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:07.259
The product that I'm going to be using is
Anatsasia Dipbrow Pomade.

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:15.150
So, what I like to do is I like to start off
at the bottom of my brow first and then carve

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.150
out the top.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.300
And then simply start filling in the lines.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.630
So now we're going to move on to the eye shadow
base and the base that I'm going to be using

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:33.020
is this Too Faced Shadow Insurance in Lemon
Drop.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.860
And what I like to do is I like to a little
bit on my finger and then apply it at the

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.610
same time, like this!

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:48.970
And this will basically help the eye shadow
last all day and all night without creasing.

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.220
So I'm going to be using this Nude Dude Palette
by The Balm Cosmetics and I'm going to take

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:58.230
this shade called Fabulous here to highlight
my brow bone.

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:05.990
Do the same on the other eye.

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:09.190
Now I'm going to go in with the Flawless which
is this gorgeous matte shade and I'm going

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.260
to add it to my crease as a really nice transition
colour.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:20.120
I love using a transition colour because it
helps all of the colours in your eyes blend

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.120
in together.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.560
And you want to make sure you're using a fluffy
brush for this.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:29.860
I wanted to go for a bit of a rose-gold kind
of eye for this look so I'm going to take

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:32.720
this Nyx Jumbo Eye Pencil in the shade Yoghurt.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.950
And I'm going to put that all over my eyelid.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:41.930
And this is a really creamy shade.

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:49.560
And it's really beautiful for weddings and
the summer time.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.730
You want to make sure you don't go too high
up into your crease colour either.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.600
Now to intensify that shade slightly I'm going
to add a little bit of Flirty straight on

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.600
top.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:02.650
And this is a really nice pinky-purply colour.

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:09.870
And you want to pack the colour on so you
want to almost press it on to your eyes rather

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:11.170
than dragging it.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.560
This will also help with any kind of fall
out.

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.570
Now we're going to move on to a winged eye.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.979
And I'm going to be using this Maybelline
Master Precise Liquid Eyeliner in a Brown

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:21.979
shade.

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:24.599
I find that using browns gives it a really
subtle effect.

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:33.020
So I'm making the wing quite thick and you
kind of want to aim towards your temples.

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:37.479
And then you want to drag that colour into
the eyes.

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:44.240
Now I took so many years to perfect this so
if you don't get this in one take just keep

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:50.009
practicing.

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:53.960
At the end I always like to try make sure
that both eyes are looking the same.

00:04:53.960 --> 00:05:02.990
And the mascara that I'm going to use is the
Lash Sensational Mascara by Maybelline.

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:05.979
And I'm going to add about two layers of this
on.

00:05:05.979 --> 00:05:13.040
Now I'm going to add a little bit of this
Dark Brown shade here called Fine.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:16.599
I'm going to use a pencil brush to smoke that
out underneath.

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:24.610
And it kind of balances the top and the bottom
of your eyes out.

00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:31.590
For tight-lining my upper and lower line I'm
going to use the Urban Decay Zero Eye Liner

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.650
for that.

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:36.659
And I really like this one because it's super,
super creamy and it doesn't really hurt my

00:05:36.659 --> 00:05:46.300
eyes when I use it.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:53.580
The final step on the eyes is to add a little
bit of mascara to the bottom lashes.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.639
For contouring and highlighting I'm going
to be using this Charlotte Tilbury Sculpt

00:05:58.639 --> 00:05:59.639
and Highlight Palette.

00:05:59.639 --> 00:06:05.060
So I'm going to go in with the 'Sculpt' shade
first and we're going to carve out our cheekbones

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:17.259
and give ourselves a little bit of a contour.

00:06:17.259 --> 00:06:21.879
And I'm also going to add this all around
my hairline just to give the face a little

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:24.060
bit more warmth.

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:28.999
Then I'm going to use the same Palette for
the 'Highlight' on the tops of my cheeks,

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:36.862
on my forehead, down the bridge of my nose,
my chin and Cupid's Bow.

00:06:36.862 --> 00:06:39.909
And this just adds light to the center of
your face.

00:06:39.909 --> 00:06:44.310
For blusher I'm going to use a NARS blusher
in it's in the shade Liberté which is a really

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:45.539
lovely corally shade.

00:06:45.539 --> 00:06:52.400
Just going to add a little bit of it on our
cheeks.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.590
And then I'm just going to take a clean fluffy
brush and just blend that all away so that

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.520
there are no harsh lines.

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:10.300
Now onto lips and I'm going to first line
them using Charlotte Tilbury's Pillow Talk.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:15.509
Then I'm also going to fill them in as well
and this will just help the lipstick last

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:18.389
a lot longer.

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:22.300
And now I'm going to top that up with this
Charlotte Tilbury lipstick in the shade Sexy

00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.930
Sienna, which is a really nice coral shade.

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:33.610
Now for the final step and what we want to
make sure is that all of this hard work that

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:36.960
we've done for our make up is not going to
budge all day and night so we're going to

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:42.050
be using this Urban Decay All Nighter Makeup
Setting Spray all over our face and give that

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:48.380
a good spray so that none of it's going to
move and it's going to be looking great.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:50.729
And that is the final make up look.

00:07:50.729 --> 00:07:52.400
I really hope you enjoyed it.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.539
It's definitely a make up look that can take
you from day to night as well.

00:07:56.539 --> 00:08:00.270
