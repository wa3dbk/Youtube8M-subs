00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.549
U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA HAS BEEN SEEKING
SUPPORT FROM CONGRESS FOR MILITARY ACTION

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.399
AGAINST THE SYRIAN GOVERNMENT...

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:12.810
IN THE WAKE OF WHAT THE U.S. SAYS IT HAS PROOF
WAS A CHEMICAL WEAPONS ATTACK ON CIVILIANS

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.840
IN THE SYRIAN CAPITAL.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.070
AND WE'RE JOINED NOW BY VOA NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT
JIM MALONE.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.280
JIM, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.410
WE'VE SEEN A LOT OF PARTISAN BICKERING DURING
THE OBAMA PRESIDENCY.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.040
HOW LIKELY IS IT THAT CONGRESS WILL APPROVE
A STRIKE, AND WHAT DO YOU THINK WILL HAPPEN

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.140
IF THE LAWMAKERS SAY NO?

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.579
WELL THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT SORT OF TASK
FOR THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION, TO GET CONGRESSIONAL

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:37.579
APPROVAL.

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.140
IT SURPRISED SOME MEMBERS OF CONGRESS THAT
HE EVEN WENT THIS WAY.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:45.979
HE'S SAID HE'S ALREADY DECIDED HE WANTS TO
TAKE ACTION, BUT AT THE LAST MINUTE HE DECIDED

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.600
TO GO THROUGH CONGRESS.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.640
IF THEY SAY NO, AND WE REALLY DON'T KNOW WHICH
WAY THIS IS GOING TO GO AT THE CURRENT TIME,

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.209
THE PRESIDENT'S ALREADY INDICATED HE BELIEVES
HE DOES NOT NEED CONGRESS' SAY-SO TO PROCEED.

00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:04.229
BUT OBVIOUSLY HE WANTS IT, SO THEY'RE RESERVING
IT SEEMS TO ME THE OPTION OF GOING AHEAD EVEN

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:05.939
IF CONGRESS DOES SAY NO.

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.700
AND JIM YOU TALK ABOUT IT BEING A SURPRISE
THAT THE PRESIDENT WOULD SEEK CONGRESSIONAL

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.180
APPROVAL FOR THIS.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.300
RECENT U.S. PRESIDENTS, GOING BACK TO 1950
TYPICALLY HAVE NOT ASKED FOR CONGRESSIONAL

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.969
APPROVAL FOR THIS TYPE OF ACTION.

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:18.360
WHAT'S DIFFERENT IN THIS CASE?

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.320
YOU'RE RIGHT, WE HAVEN'T ACTUALLY DECLARED
WAR AS A COUNTRY SINCE THE 1940S, AND SO THIS

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:29.600
PARTICULAR CASE I THINK SPEAKS TO THE FACT
THAT THE PRESIDENT IS WELL AWARE OF PUBLIC

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.539
OPINION POLLS, AND THE FACT THAT IN THE UNITED
STATES RIGHT NOW THERE'S JUST NO INTEREST

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:38.579
IN GETTING THE MILITARY INVOLVED IN ANOTHER
COUNTRY IN THE MIDDLE EAST.

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:44.109
THE COUNTRY IS WAR-WEARY AFTER AFGHANISTAN
AND IRAQ, AND BELIEVES THAT EVEN THE PROMISE

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:49.899
OF LIMITED AIRSTRIKES OR CRUISE MISSILE STRIKES
STILL SOMEHOW MIGHT SUCK THE UNITED STATES

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:51.439
INTO ANOTHER CONFLICT.

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.180
SO HE'S GOT A BIG JOB HERE TO SELL, BUT ONE
OF THE REASONS HE MAY WANT TO DO THIS IS LOOKING

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.460
AT THE EXAMPLE IN BRITAIN, WHERE PARLIAMENT
SAID NO TO PRIME MINISTER CAMERON, HE BELIEVES

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.719
MAYBE IT'S IN HIS BEST INTEREST TO TRY TO
GET THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS ON BOARD, AND

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:10.800
WITH THE CONGRESS HOPEFULLY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE
AS WELL.

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.270
BUT WHAT IS GOING ON WITHIN THE CONGRESS?

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.270
WHAT'S SORT OF THE BACK AND FORTH?

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:18.300
HERE'S SOME FASCINATING CROSS CURRENTS RIGHT
NOW FOR BOTH PARTIES.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.440
THERE ARE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS WHO REMEMBER THE
IRAQ WAR BUILDUP, THEY WERE DISMAYED AND FELT

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.850
BETRAYED WHEN THE SO-CALLED WEAPONS OF MASS
DESTRUCTION NEVER MATERIALIZED.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:32.060
SO THEY'RE SKEPTICAL OF SUPPORTING THE PRESIDENT
ON THIS.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.270
ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE, AN INTERESTING DEVELOPMENT
IS SORT OF A NON-INTERVENTIONIST LIBERTARIAN

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:43.520
WING OF THE PARTY LED BY PEOPLE LIKE RAND
PAUL, AND TED CRUZ FROM TEXAS IS DEVELOPING,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.900
SO THERE'S A SPLIT IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY,
WHICH TRADITIONALLY IS MORE OPEN TO MILITARY

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.900
ACTION.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.390
AND ALL OF THIS IS HAPPENING WITHOUT U.N.
BACKING.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.500
WHAT DO YOU THINK THE ROLE OF OTHER COUNTRIES
ARE?

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:59.250
WELL RIGHT NOW A LOT OF THE MEMBERS OF CONGRESS
AS THEY WEIGH THIS ARE NOTICING THAT THE U.N.

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.460
SEEMS TO BE SHYING AWAY FROM A LEAD ROLE ON
THIS, THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE ACTION.

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.920
FRANCE SEEMS TO BE INTERESTED IN GOING AHEAD
WITH THE UNITED STATES, BUT BRITAIN HAS HAD

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.210
TO BACK OFF, BECAUSE OF DOMESTIC POLITICAL
ISSUES THERE RELATED IN FACT TO THE IRAQ WAR,

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:18.800
SO RIGHT NOW, THE PRESIDENT REALIZES IT'S
KIND OF THE U.S. GOING IT ALONE, AND HE'S

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.750
GOT TO MAKE THE CASE NOT ONLY TO THE AMERICAN
PEOPLE, BUT TO THE REST OF THE WORLD.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.060
AND SOME ANALYSTS EVEN SAY THAT A LIMITED
MILITARY STRIKE LIKE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:30.700
HERE WON'T EVEN BE EFFECTIVE.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.530
WHAT'S SORT OF THE WHITE HOUSE LINE ON THAT?

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:38.070
RIGHT, AND WE'RE SEEING ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS
GRILLED ON THAT VERY SUBJECT IN HEARINGS BEFORE

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:39.210
CONGRESS.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.290
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO DO IF IT'S LIMITED
IN NATURE?

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.230
THEY'RE PROMISING NO AMERICAN BOOTS ON THE
GROUND, BECAUSE THEY WANT TO GET THAT CONGRESSIONAL

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.390
APPROVAL, BUT I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S
RESPONSE IS, WHAT DO WE DO WHEN WE BELIEVED

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:53.150
CHEMICAL WEAPONS HAVE BEEN USED?

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.690
CAN THE UNITED STATES REMAIN SILENT, CAN WE
DO NOTHING?

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:59.351
THEY'RE TRYING TO POSE THAT QUESTION IN RESPONSE.

00:03:59.351 --> 00:04:01.370
VOA NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT JIM MALONE, THANK
YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US.

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.500
THANK YOU.
