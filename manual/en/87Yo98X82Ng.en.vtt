00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:10.080
You know, Lenovo is known for 
making the highest quality notebooks,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.490
for business professionals, 
on the market,

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.520
and they're certainly not 
disappointing with the T61 Series.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.000
This one has every feature that 
a business power-user wants,

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.990
and it's all there and it 
will never disappoint you.

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:30.930
It's got a Core 2 Duo T9300 Processor,
that's a 2.5GHz processor.

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.470
It's got 1GB of DDR2 RAM, 
of course that can be expandable,

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.540
by you, the user, and that's 
something you may want to do.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.850
It's got a 100GB hard-drive. It does 
have a DVD RW Drive on board as well.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:52.490
Big, 15.4 inch screen, running at 1680x1050,
with a great anti-glare coating on it,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.490
so it can be used in any lighting situation,
and you don't have to worry about glare.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:03.630
It's got the NVIDIA Quadro 
NVS 140M Graphics Chipset,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.340
which is great for people that are
doing Power Point presentations,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:14.210
and other graphically intensive, but not
necessarily 3D, business applications.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.880
It's great for running all that stuff.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.360
It's got a fingerprint reader, it's 
got all of the wireless connectivity

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.790
that you can imagine, wireless g, 
wireless b, it's got bluetooth,

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:29.030
and it's got a very long life on the battery.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.900
It has some built-in technology, that is
going to allow you to extend  battery life

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:40.140
to up to 5.9 hours, so this thing's great
for taking with you , out on the road.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.060
So, let me go ahead and show you around this,

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.580
large ThinkPad Lenovo Notebook, alright?

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.350
This is our 15.4" screen, 
located right up here.

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.720
Because this is a business notebook, 
you're probably, you're gonna find,

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.960
that there's no webcam on this, 
there are actually a lot of businesses,

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:02.160
and a lot of government organizations, 
that will not allow webcams

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.880
on any of their devices, so this is
perfect for people who are shopping

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.070
for notebooks in that situation.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:14.010
You've got stereo speakers down here, you've
got media controls up here along the top,

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.660
as well as your power button, 
full-size keyboard, and of course,

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.080
that lovely ThinkPad Nub right there, 
a pointing device, that to this day,

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.370
is still, one of my favorites for 
using with a laptop computer.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:35.100
People that have been using these
little nubs for years and years,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.610
they don't wanna let go, and
that's why they're still here,

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.640
and I'm one of those 
people, I'll admit it.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.040
We got all of your mouse buttons, 
for the nub, located right there,

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.650
and then, of course, your track-pad,
and your track-pad mouse buttons

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.560
located below that. You got your
fingerprint reader right over here.

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:53.430
Very big security feature, 
that will make sure

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.960
that is somebody gets a hold of this, 
without also stealing your hand,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.600
they won't be able to 
get into the computer,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.140
and all your documents, 
of course, are going to be safe.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.310
Along the front edge of this notebook,
you're going to find your memory card reader,

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.770
located right up there, as well as, 
a hard switch for your wireless,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.860
to help conserve battery, and 
right next to that is a firewire port,

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:20.790
so that you can hook 
up your digital camera,

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.070
or any other firewire device, 
that you so desire.

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.910
Now, over here, is where you're 
going to find your expansion ports.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:32.470
You've got USB, you've got 
headphone and microphone.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.310
Modem, LAN, both right here, 
and an external VGA port.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.570
And over on the other side, we're
gonna find your DVD RW drive,

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.580
as well as, a couple more 
USB ports for hooking up

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.990
some of your external devices.

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.290
And then of course, round the back is, 
we're gonna find that giant battery.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:57.930
This Lenove's got some "junk in 
the trunk", as you can see,

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:04.930
that's what allows this computer to 
get nearly 5.9 hours of extended use.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.340
Of course, right there, that big 
yellow plug that you see there,

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:11.240
is where you're gonna plug 
in your included charger,

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:13.850
to make sure, of course, that 
you can get those 5.9 hours,

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.920
when you're out on the road.

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:21.190
This is a solid business notebook. It's got
great business graphics, built in to it.

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:26.160
It's got a nice big hard-drive, tons of
battery life, and it's very expandable,

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.860
and it's going to be 
a great friend to you

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:32.260
when you're out on the road,
trying to get work done.

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:34.440
And, of course, that's
what Lenovo's known for,

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.240
making some of the best business
notebooks on the market,

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.670
and this one is certainly not an exception.
It's the Lenovo ThinkPad T61U.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.710
To get more info on the 
Lenovo ThinkPad T61U,

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.220
go to any of the retailers you
see up on the screen here,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:53.670
and type in T70-154112.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:55.900
