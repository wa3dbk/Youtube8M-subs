00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.400
Welcome to the Summer Games.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.480
In this series, two teams of YouTubers battle each other.

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:26.700
After 10 episodes we will found out who will be the grand winner.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.109
This is what happened in the previous episode:

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.120
Team Blue won and turned the score into 3 - 4.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:43.340
Welcome back to me, the guy who talks a lot, Defano Holwijn.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.500
I can see we're going to be surfing  today...

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.560
But I'm sure it's not JUST going to be about surfing. There's always a catch with these guys.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.940
I can surf and snowboard pretty well...

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.640
On girls or boards?

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.820
BYE

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.460
I'm going to control this thing. Brace yourselves.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.220
When the Blue Team goes I'll put it at 8, and if we're going I'll put it at 1.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:08.780
No I won't.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.780
I'm not sure if I'll be able to do this, I just saw Kelvin on there and it goes really fast...

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.800
I couldn't even jump the Aqua Sweeper, how will I do this? I guess we'll see.

00:01:20.808 --> 00:01:22.808
Time for the Surf Simulator.

00:01:22.808 --> 00:01:25.540
Everyone has to stay on the surfboard for as long as possible.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.880
...While the other team gets to make them wet.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.580
The team that, together, stays on the board the longest, wins the game.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.460
But before anyone's surfing, we're going to get dressed up.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:38.360
I wanted that, dude.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.140
Too bad.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:41.400
You probably have the, uh...

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.360
This is totally me. Exotic...

00:01:59.192 --> 00:02:01.192
I'm a little thief.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.120
Well ladies and gents, we're all dressing up. I'm Elvis. This is gonna be a great episode.

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:25.660
IT'S SO COLD.

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.900
How long? How long did it take?

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.600
7. 7 seconds. Good job.

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.780
No hand-holding!

00:02:58.368 --> 00:03:00.368
Come on Defano, focus.

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.620
Are you enjoying it, Defano?

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.540
Thanks, I'm doing this for you.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.360
Come on Stephan!

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.640
Come on Rico!

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:50.980
I couldn't see anything!

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:55.420
So short!

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:58.479
5?

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.180
5 seconds.

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:26.660
What are you doing?

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.560
I don't know, I just couldn't do it. You all practiced, I didn't...

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:43.020
How many, 8?

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.800
7. The're not winning this.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.540
Ah, man..

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.520
This was so much fun.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.160
One left, we're doing this. We're winning. Only Tara is left.

00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:10.300
You know, 20 seconds. I'm the world record holder. Here, 12 seconds...

00:05:25.111 --> 00:05:27.111
That one hurt.

00:05:28.469 --> 00:05:30.089
RIGHT IN THE KISSER.

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:34.980
That's not fair. A beautiful lady like her...

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.640
It hurt so much, it felt like a shot in the neck.

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:40.560
Red Team is DIRTY. Harassing women with balloons...

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.700
With just a few extra seconds, the winner is...

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:47.753
Team Red.

00:05:54.780 --> 00:06:00.380
We're back. I told you we'd be back. And now we're going for a massive win. 6 - 4.

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:05.400
Ladies and gentlemen, the Red Team won, turning the score into 4 - 4.
