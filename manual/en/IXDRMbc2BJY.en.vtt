00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.720
Today I am going to show you how to
locate your Windows product key

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.000
through your registry using a program that
is freeware

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.580
this program is not dangerous and
basically it looks for Windows product keys

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:15.920
if you purchased the paid for version then it looks for

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.359
other programs product keys and the reason
I'm doing this video is because recently I

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:25.580
purchased a second computer which is a Lenovo and it's a manufactured computer

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.810
same as a Dell or Gateway

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.900
and other computers that are manufactured

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.149
what they have done now with Windows
8 is that Microsoft has decided in it's infinite

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:37.860
wisdom

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.000
that they were going to hide the product key

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.079
because they thought that'd reduce

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.450
counterfeiting or people misusing the
product key

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.469
and now the only thing that indicates that
your system is genuine Windows

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.399
is a tiny sticker that says Windows 8 on
there and will either be purple

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:01.879
and then it will if you uh move the tower

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:05.010
or the sticker it'll change the color of the sticker to

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.229
blue and they have a different color
of sticker for each

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.310
edition of Windows whether it be pro, standard

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.380
or RT they have hidden the key

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.880
in the BIOS for most manufactured
systems so

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.080
when you stick in a recovery disk from Lenovo
or Dell

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.320
it will automatically pick up the key
from the BIOS

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.740
and then install Windows and allow
you to activate it

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.100
but there is a program out there that is
freeware that will show you the key and I

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.079
will show you how to use it now

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.820
so as you can see I already have the webpage
open to the program

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.460
and it's called Magical Jelly Bean
Keyfinder

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.350
and as you can see there are two
versions

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.060
this comparison chart to show the
difference between the two products

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.060
on the left here we have free version

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:59.540
and on the right we have the paid for version

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.439
and as you can see the paid for version
has more check marks which means it can detect

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.489
more keys and also do a 
little bit more for you

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:11.830
but the free version is good enough
for what I wanted to do and here it

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.980
shows that it'll find Windows operating system

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.590
and it will also work with a 64-bit systems

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:23.709
and it will also do Office 2010

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.720
and Windows 7 and 8 here they
offer Adobe products

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.760
but of course we are using the free version
so you would just go here and download it

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:36.769
and as you can see the price says free
I've already downloaded it and started the

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:38.430
installation process

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:41.780
so you just click Next next

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.220
and then if you want a desktop 
icon

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.290
you would click Next I don't really
ever use a

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:52.120
Quick Launch icons so I of course left that un-checked and

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:57.099
here where it asks how you want to install
express or custom installation

00:02:57.099 --> 00:03:00.930
choose custom installation where my mouse
is right now

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:04.050
and un-check install search protect

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.569
to set my homepage and default search to
conduit search

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:13.000
that to me is spyware and it was detected as
spyware

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.900
in another program that it came with
that I use

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.540
so I removed that from installing

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.720
that's why I chose the custom installation
and then click Next

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.140
basically it just tells you what it's going to do

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:32.690
and then click Install and then as you
can see

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.580
box launch keyfinder is checked and
already it has brought up

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.599
my keys for Windows 8

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:43.950
point one pro Microsoft office small
business

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.870
and then Winamp 5

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:51.069
which it didn't really mention on the website
that it does bring up that key but

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.280
that isn't bad and Windows information

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.019
so as you can see I've pixelated out the key

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:02.189
of course all the other information
that shouldn't be

00:04:02.189 --> 00:04:07.200
showing but yeah it does show you your
cd-key the twenty-five character key

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:10.689
that would allow you to activate and install
Windows

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:14.150
if you wanna save the information you can
just go to File

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:17.370
then save as and it'll save it as

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.979
text to wherever you feel like

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:24.780
and once you've saved it you would
just go exit and

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.080
it'll ask if you wanna try the paid for program

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:32.650
and you could just put don't show this
dialogue again and then click Close

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:37.180
and you're done now that you're finished you
can always go to programs and

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.370
features and remove it from your system

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.840
you will also want to check out the appdata
folder

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.370
on your computer to remove

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.490
the any files or folders that it has 
left in there

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.970
this can come in handy if you ever want to
wipe out

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:59.620
all the Lenovo or manufacturer software
like Dell's software support software

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.810
or Lenovo's support software you can
just get a copy of

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.720
whatever version of Windows you have or
edition and

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:11.250
for example I'm using Windows standard on
the Lenovo so

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.009
or Windows home and then I'd get
a copy of

00:05:15.009 --> 00:05:19.660
just regular Windows 8 and then install it
and then I

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:23.370
would have the key and I would activate it
and away you go and that would eliminate

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:27.820
the Lenovo support software
or if you bought a Dell or some other brand

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.380
their support software and all the partitions
they create in order to do recovery
