00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.289
Ultimately people self build for a
number of different reasons, and build

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.630
their own homes in a number of different
ways, for what unites them is a desire to

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.419
create a home that's individually
designed, and specified specifically with

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:31.269
them in mind.

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.929
Of course the word self build in itself is
something of a misnomer and many people

00:00:34.929 --> 00:00:38.579
refer to it as custom home building or
individual homebuilding, and what it really

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.449
means is the eventual owner of the house
specifying the design and construction

00:00:42.449 --> 00:00:44.740
of that home.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:48.400
Indeed something like only one in ten of
people who call themselves self builders

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.640
actually build their own homes using
their own labour.

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.880
The vast majority employ either a
builder or package company, or directly

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.510
employ sub-contractors to get the
actual house built for them.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.240
Around fourteen thousand self builders
build their own home each year,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.860
which accounts for around one in ten
of all new UK homes,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.529
but in Australia, the United States and much
of Europe,

00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:13.480
the proportion of self build is much higher.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.010
So why do they do it? Well in the first instance self builders feel that they're not really

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:20.560
getting what they want off the open
market in terms of housing so feel that

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.620
they need to actually create what they
want individually, that might be down to

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:28.540
individual design tastes, the requirement
for energy saving features, or they might have a

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:31.619
specific interest in an architectural style or
look of a house

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.970
that they simply don't see that's currently available.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.980
Self builders are actually renowned for
creating some of the best individual

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:42.240
houses in the UK and pioneering many
individual architectural and

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.080
construction techniques,

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.310
from very contemporary houses,

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.120
through recreating traditional period
styles in a new build setting

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.849
which obviously combines the best of architectural design

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:59.320
with the best of modern energy-efficient
construction.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.350
They might also self build to meet a specific
need whether it be extra space for a growing

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.210
family in an area with small family homes,

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.429
a long-held desire for a games room or
home office, or in simpler terms they want

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.409
room sizes bigger than those they find on the
regular market.

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.879
They might also self build to meet a desire for a better quality time,

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.909
one that includes features such as underfloor heating or smart home controls,

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:28.839
or one that's so energy-efficient it doesn't
even require a central heating system.

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:32.629
What unites all self builders is the process - 
you'll need to find a building plot in

00:02:32.629 --> 00:02:34.169
the area you want to build,

00:02:34.169 --> 00:02:37.349
you then go about commissioning an
individual design for your new home,

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:38.279
and finally

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:42.989
you'll have a range of options about how to get the house built.

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.089
These range from finding a local builder to take on the project for you,

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:48.939
to taking on the role of builder yourself,

00:02:48.939 --> 00:02:52.609
which means managing individual sub-contractors and organising the site.

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:56.249
These two routes account for the majority of
self build projects, but there are other

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:59.709
options including engaging with a
package company who'll design and build the

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:00.889
house for you,

00:03:00.889 --> 00:03:02.709
through to the DIY approach,

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:06.180
where you'll literally build the house
yourself.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.299
You'll find by exploring the web site

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:11.410
that build costs for individual homes vary
enormously,

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.420
the building industry works on a cost per
square meter basis, and typical costs

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:19.359
range from eight hundred up to one thousand eight hundred pounds a square metre.

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.999
That means, depending on the size of
your new home,

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:24.819
you'll be looking to spend anywhere from
a hundred thousand, up to over three

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.460
hundred thousand. Typically however

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:30.089
it's possible to build a large four
bedroom home

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:35.059
for between one hundred and fifty and two hundred thousand pounds.

00:03:35.059 --> 00:03:37.950
You can get an idea of the cost of
building plots in your area

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:39.719
by visiting plotfinder.net

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:42.099
Costs follow the local housing market,

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.629
but you should always ensure that any plot you're thinking about buying has full, current

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:48.499
planning permission.

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:51.699
There are of course many more things you'll
need to find out about before getting started

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:53.389
on your self build project.

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:56.669
Your next step should be to get a flavour
of the type and size of home you might

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:00.399
want to build, by looking at some of the
hundreds of examples of homes we have on the

00:04:00.399 --> 00:04:02.729
site, as well as checking out our beginner's guides.
