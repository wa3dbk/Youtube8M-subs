00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.466
It’s scary to think like what type of long term damage its doing to all of us and especially everyone who never leaves the city

00:00:25.817 --> 00:00:29.529
The state of Utah is one of the most beautiful places arguably in the whole planet.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:40.248
Salt Lake City in particular is a worldwide destination for snowboarding and skiing because within twenty minutes of the city are some of the best mountains in the world. Brighton, Park City, Snowbird it’s all here.

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:45.796
Alan Matheson
Utah is just a remarkable place for outdoor recreation, great lifestyle.

00:00:45.796 --> 00:00:53.302
Ralph Becker
We live in these spectacular mountains; we're in a valley, where the valley floor is 7000 feet below our high peaks.

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:56.264
Tim
So yo we just spent basically an insane day shredding here at park city ,

00:00:56.265 --> 00:01:02.019
literally almost not a cloud in the sky ,  spring conditions , i mean seriously a picture perfect beautiful day .

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:11.238
Its crazy to me to think that 20  minutes down the road when we head back to Salt Lake there's like toxic cloud hovering over the city.

00:01:11.405 --> 00:01:19.204
Aaron Biittner
That's the most overwhelming part about it , is you're coming down from the mountains into just like a sea of smog

00:01:19.204 --> 00:01:29.881
Tim-
Every winter something really crazy happens called Inversion. That due to environmental and pollution factors puts a gnarly haze on top of the whole city that makes it actually a pretty scary place to be.

00:01:29.882 --> 00:01:43.352
Ralph Becker-
Air becomes trapped in our valley and the cold air gets trapped under the  warm air and so it creates this condition where all of our air it all gets trapped in here.

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:57.658
Alan Matheson
The bruise on the prize we feel in Utah is this inversion season , something that's been around forever and will once these high pressure systems come in and put a cap over our mountain valleys.  Trap the pollution inside.

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.871
Ralph Becker
This goes back I mean there are stories and pictures , from the early 1900s

00:02:01.872 --> 00:02:05.625
when everybody was burning coal but now, you know we face a different world.

00:02:05.626 --> 00:02:10.796
where we've got increasing population , obviously vehicular use like we've never had.

00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:16.594
Aaron Biitner
Unless there was actually a real incentive or consequence for driving then

00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:19.555
I don't really think people are going to change too much.

00:02:19.556 --> 00:02:21.641
Ralph Becker
Our asthma  rates have gone way up .

00:02:21.642 --> 00:02:25.229
Um people with respiratory conditions feel it on days like this

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:29.690
Aaron Biitner
On certain days they've really urge you not to exercise in the city like don't go out running.

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:34.070
Don't go walking , I’m sure there's a lot of people  in the city that don't even know to

00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:38.699
leave the city to get out of it they just think they're in bad weather all the time.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.455
Alan Matheson
We can't control the weather patterns , and so there will be inversions and there have been since forever.

00:02:44.456 --> 00:02:49.293
But we can control what goes into the air during those inversions.

00:02:49.294 --> 00:02:53.047
Ralph Becker
It comes from 3 primary sources, its industries. So the smoke stacks that we get.

00:02:53.048 --> 00:02:57.051
it’s our vehicles which is our largest contributors to our air quality problems .

00:02:57.052 --> 00:03:01.389
And its what's called area sources, its everything to heating your home

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:05.685
to bbq's , su cycle engines . You can go through a  variety of things

00:03:05.686 --> 00:03:09.188
Alan Matheson
The state is taking unprecedented actions right now

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:12.650
Ralph Becker
We're developing a whole new set of standards

00:03:12.651 --> 00:03:19.907
Alan Matheson
We've imposed strict new regulations, on industry that are going to reduce their emissions by thousands of tons a year.

00:03:19.908 --> 00:03:22.785
Ralph Becker
And then we've got to look at how we reduce vehicular emissions

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:27.123
and that comes from giving people good alternatives, we've got an incredible rail system here, we've got to

00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:30.293
flush that out with a better bus system.

00:03:30.294 --> 00:03:32.545
Alan Matheson
Beyond that the governors proposed

00:03:32.546 --> 00:03:36.966
a an unprecedented amount of investment in the state budget toward air quality.

00:03:36.967 --> 00:03:39.802
The low hanging fruit has been picked.

00:03:39.803 --> 00:03:50.313
Now we're looking for at those changes that are small. And it’s going to take hundreds of thousands of small little changes and victories to get us where we need to go.

00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:57.153
Aaron Bittner
The best thing you can do I think , personally as an individual is to get out of the city and get into the mountains and go enjoy yourself ,

00:03:57.154 --> 00:04:03.784
you can't dwell on it to hard cause it’s just piss you off and  not much we can do to it or do about it .

00:04:03.785 --> 00:04:15.839
Unless we get together and like really make a conscious effort.
