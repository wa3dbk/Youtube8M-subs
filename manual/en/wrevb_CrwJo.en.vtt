00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.200
the Texas Department of Transportation
begin converting more than

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.370
eighty miles of paved roads to gravel

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.019
on Monday and they had to reduce the
speed limit on the new gravel roads

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:16.460
to thirty miles per hour which of course
will slow down many people who want to

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.270
take those roads used to be higher than
that

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.810
quotes is paving roads is too expensive
and there is not enough funding to

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:23.880
repave them

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.320
or only other option to make them safer
it's a tournament a gravel roads

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.450
that's going to smoke spin David Glasser
he said that to the Texas Tribune

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.570
now Texas has

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.710
actually approved a certain amount of
money

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.110
for road repair but that amount was not
enough

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.610
and the upkeep for that is even more
expensive and its continuous on a

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:52.120
a year by year basis but here's the part
of the story

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.129
that gets me know I already think it's
rather ridiculous that in the United

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:57.219
States of America

00:00:57.219 --> 00:01:01.129
we can muster up tax dollars whether it
be at a local level a state-level

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.280
level or a federal level to pave the
fucking road right

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.689
but okay are you know maybe they're can
be some justification for

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:13.820
in some places in the United States
specifically if it's very raw and maybe

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.040
the people vote on it in a referendum in
say

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.040
we would like to not have paved roads
listen to this year's where I get angry

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.950
quote the or your n gas boom

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.450
in Texas has produced in unintended
affect

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.909
the oversized vehicles and overweight
load used by energy companies

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.600
has had a devastating impact on many
roads

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.470
so you understand what that means the
roads

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.090
have been destroyed by private industry

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.180
and then it's not even an issue

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.820
like it's not even brought up by the
politicians that are in power

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.610
it's not brought up by the people in the
private businesses

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.899
that destroyed the roads they don't
think like a woman

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.979
maybe we should fondness and fix it
because we fuckin messed up

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:07.909
no that's not even brought up and it's
not even

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.900
seriously entertained the idea I love
you know let's dip into our rainy day

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.090
fund in let's find a way to raise
revenue

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.950
to continue to make them paved roads so

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.680
the private businesses that screw up off
the hook

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.489
they get a row on the road all day long
well but

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:30.010
when because I'm to fix them they're
gone they're nowhere to be found

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.220
but the taxpayers themselves also they
shouldn't have to foot the bill but

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.450
but they don't have the money anyway
even if they dip into the Rainy Day Fund

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.040
so I mean look at the system we've
created

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.470
and the reason I wanted to discuss this
is because i think is actually but is

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.700
a perfect example %uh a bigger problem
we have in the united states it's a

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.170
perfect encapsulation

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.430
it's a microcosm up a bigger issue and
that issue

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.060
is that private corporations can make
millions

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.099
if not billion this up

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.700
of love using or private in first your
public infrastructure excuse me

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:12.150
and using our land only cause time for
them to get back

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.170
they don't come back at all we're going
in another example

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.800
so but did you know in the United States
whatever they open up

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.989
land for more oil drilling for natural
gas drilling

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.599
the government just gives them the land
just gives the private corporations the

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:27.000
land

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.269
now understand in other countries when
that happens

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.420
the people of the country since it is

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.080
public land so it's a barrel and they
get a check

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.099
overall company you know in a different
place

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.209
all we want to use this land okay will
cause actual money you have to pay

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.870
every single citizen that amount of
money now funny of the one place where

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.080
they actually do then you

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.879
the US was at the state level in alaska
we're not Sarah Palin actually got the

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:53.170
idea from the oil companies

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.330
the most socialistic thing you can do
ironic but she got the oil companies to

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:58.780
pay the citizens of alaska

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.299
a couple hundred bucks a couple thousand
bucks on a yearly basis to get the oil

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:03.799
aloe dare lead

00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:08.349
cuz it bear oil when the rest in the US
the federal government looks at Exxon

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:10.000
Mobil BP and Chevron egos

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.620
yeah go ahead take it we don't care bill
payers anything don't give a check to

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.349
the american people fuck 'em just take
it

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:18.540
all that's incredible man

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.630
that shows you how much

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.070
private industry in big business has
bought our government

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.280
apparently not only at the federal level
but also as Texas shows

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.560
on the state level where they can take
your oil take your natural gas

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:37.169
screw up your role in this and then they
will have to pay for it

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:42.080
and I get to look to the point where
living in the United States of America

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.870
we have to regress and make the roads

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:48.960
gravel roads

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.560
ridiculous
