00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:01.680
See this?

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.549
And this and this and this?

00:00:03.549 --> 00:00:04.549
These are awesome.

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:06.959
For a lot of reasons, but mainly they are
the simplest way that you can start making

00:00:06.959 --> 00:00:08.880
a difference in the climate movement.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.390
(Sips water) Mmm delicious.

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.470
The average american buys 160 of these every
year.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.950
Which means on average Americans spend $11.8
billion dollars on plastic water bottles ever

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:20.950
year.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.570
Out of pocket for the individual consumer,
if you assume that the average cost of a plastic

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:29.730
water bottle is $1.45 thats $230 unnecessary
dollars you're spending a year.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.949
You know how much this cost me?

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.059
Well actually, this one was free, oh so was
this one, crap this one was free too, thanks

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.059
youtube.

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:40.199
Oh okay, for this one, I paid 15$.

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:42.420
The cost of one of these nasty things doesn't
end at your pocket.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.809
Even if you're one of the folks that does
recycles their bottle.

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.010
That's the minority, only about 23% of plastic
water bottles get recycled.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.929
You're still looking at an overall cost of
about 17 million barrels of oil annually.

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.980
That's enough to fuel 1.3 million cars for
a year.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.089
And that doesn't even count the transportation
of getting that water to the bottling factory

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:00.789
and then from the bottling factory into your
hand.

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.269
And get this, if you're a health fanatic bottled
water actually has less strict regulation

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:05.269
than tap water.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.070
In the U.S., public water is regulated by
the Environmental Protection Agency or EPA,

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:12.780
which requires multiple daily testing for
bacteria and makes all those results available

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.780
to the public.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.030
The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates
bottled water, requires weekly testing and

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.119
does not make those results available to the
public.

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:22.840
If money, health and the climate dont convince
you.

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:23.840
Think about the cute animals.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.641
Think about all the tiny cuties who die every
year from choking on bottle caps or those

00:01:27.641 --> 00:01:32.380
little circle things, not to mention the incredible
habitat destruction caused by climate change.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:36.570
Now I understand that in a lot of parts of
the world and during extreme natural circumstances

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.770
when the water supply is contaminated we gotta
drink from bottled water.

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.880
However most of these instances of purchases
are just habit.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.499
Plus once you start carrying one of these
guys around, you might as well start carrying

00:01:47.499 --> 00:01:48.499
around a set of silver ware too.

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.119
Then you don't have to use plastic utensils.

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:55.049
You can even get a pop-up container.

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.819
Sure all the street food venders will look
at you like you've just climbed off a spaceship

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:59.700
-- but its totally worth it.

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.689
Plus I think they actually end up giving you
more food.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:04.590
Now there is like three falafel carts in the
city that I can go to and they know exactly

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.740
what I want when I show up with one of these
guys.

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.000
Moral of the story, these good, that bad.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.680
Hi guys!

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:17.560

Leave a comment telling me if you're emotionally
invested in one of your water bottles, cause

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:33.490
I definitely am.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.020
Thanks again for watching! bYE!!!
