00:00:27.425 --> 00:00:29.632
I'm Alejandro González,
a photographer. 

00:00:29.667 --> 00:00:36.497
I won the Havana Club scholarship to carry out my project 
"Cuba, año cero" ["Cuba, Year Zero"]. 

00:00:36.532 --> 00:00:42.417
It's a photographic series 
basically made up of portraits of teenagers. 

00:00:42.452 --> 00:00:48.120
I want to make a series about Cuban teenagers 
born after 1990. 

00:00:48.155 --> 00:00:51.672
Right after the disappearance of the Socialist Block. 

00:00:51.707 --> 00:00:55.664
It's a generation that grew up in very particular circumstances, 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:58.432
where official discourse contradicts reality. 

00:00:58.467 --> 00:01:04.336
This generation lived during the Special Period,

00:01:04.371 --> 00:01:09.135
and they don't have any knowledge or memories

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:16.895
of the sweeter period of the Cuban Revolution,
the 1980s. 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.560
You could say that it is an autobiography of my adolescence,
displaced in time. 

00:01:23.595 --> 00:01:27.872
I lived that precise moment when [the golden age]
was coming to an end. 

00:01:27.907 --> 00:01:35.873
But I had somewhat of an experience
of the more fruitful period. 

00:01:35.908 --> 00:01:43.416
When Havana Club preselected me, 

00:01:43.451 --> 00:01:45.679
I was already very pleased. 

00:01:45.714 --> 00:01:48.409
So when they told me I had gotten the scholarship, 

00:01:48.444 --> 00:01:49.216
great. 

00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:52.248
When they gave the first part of the budget, 

00:01:52.283 --> 00:01:54.585
I began right away with my project. 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:01.991
I was traveling for a month throughout the country

00:02:02.026 --> 00:02:06.216
and then I decided to stop for a moment to see what I had done. 

00:02:06.251 --> 00:02:09.096
To take a break and distance myself from the work. 

00:02:09.131 --> 00:02:12.480
And I'm going to begin the second phase, 

00:02:12.515 --> 00:02:14.799
which would be Occidente and la Isla. 

00:02:14.834 --> 00:02:20.833
When I submitted my proposal,
it was practically all about urban subcultures. 

00:02:20.868 --> 00:02:23.279
But then I wanted it to be more balanced,

00:02:23.314 --> 00:02:28.408
to have rural images of a different type of teenagers

00:02:28.443 --> 00:02:31.544
that wasn't centered only in Havana. 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:36.390
And I think I have that covered. 

00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:41.601
I now feel as if I should go back 
to cities like Santa Clara and Cienfuegos. 

00:02:41.636 --> 00:02:46.030
They have a sort of urban pulse, 

00:02:46.065 --> 00:02:50.450
to try to find a balance with Havana.
