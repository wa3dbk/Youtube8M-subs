Hi, I'm Deborah Kane.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:14.940
Farm to School programs are taking place all
across the country.

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.250
Schools are bringing local products into the
cafeteria and teaching children where their

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.710
food comes from.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.170
At USDA, we're transforming school food and
creating a healthier next generation.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.840
We're really pleased to support Farm to School
programs because we know they grow jobs and

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.380
healthy kids.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:42.230
When we started our planning process for our
Farm to School program, we were literally

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:43.230
starting from scratch.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:49.120
So the first things we did were to identify
experts in different areas that could be external

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.550
support for us and then also internally identify
activities that were already support Farm

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:55.550
to School.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.850
Fruits and vegetables is what I thought it
was about, but it's a lot more than that.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.940
It's about school gardens, community providing
jobs for people in the community.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.760
So it was really a whole lot more than what
I expected.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:13.020
We really reached out into the community and
identified who wanted to see Farm to School

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.970
happen in Oxford.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.340
We also looked in the school district to collect
information from the teachers and the school

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.869
food service staff, the school food service
director and the superintendent to identify

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.990
what their priorities were with doing a Farm
to School program to really mold what we wanted

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.110
to start doing in the school district.

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.000
The first thing we did when we started our
Farm to School program was to assemble a committee

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.110
of people from the community who had a vested
interest in it.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:45.250
We got the Food Service Director at the Choctaw
Tribal Schools, the local county agents, two

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.170
nutritionists, some parents, and a couple
of farmers.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.740
It was really important for us to find out
-- How could I make it important to the principals

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.560
and to the teachers because those are the
leaders of the school district?

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.840
And if I can make it important to them and
get their buy-in, then they make it important

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.850
to the students.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.579
It's definitely a community effort, so we've
been very available to everyone, letting them

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:12.980
know that if you're interested in getting
involved or have any ideas, reach out to us.

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.900
And we've made sure with every presentation
– school board, admin meetings, PTA meetings,

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.630
and faculty meetings – anything, just reach
out any time.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.950
I would recommend to schools that are first
getting started that you identify the areas

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.940
where you can have the most impact.

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.480
Farm to School has so many layers and prongs
to it that if you try to cover everything,

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.230
you're going to be overwhelmed.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.790
The first thing I would recommend they do
is contact their local county extension office.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.819
There is usually an agricultural agent there
who knows all the farmers in the area and

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:49.990
what they produce.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:55.320
There is quite often a nutritionist assigned
to the office who can help.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.560
And there is a link to the Land Grant Universities
in your state which have expertise which can

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.310
be very helpful for your Farm to School program.

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.489
Find the parents that really want to see this
happen because those are going to be your

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:10.659
best volunteers and your best advocates for
making this change.

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:16.540
Find people within the school district, whether
they're teachers or cafeteria staff or janitors.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:21.660
Identify with your Food Service Director and
start to get he or she really excited about

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.569
starting to bring in local foods.

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:28.879
And then work with your superintendent as
well to see what his or her priorities are

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:33.970
for the school district and try to align your
Farm to School program with what he or she

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.380
wants to see with the district as well.

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:41.700
We work with farmers in 14 counties.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:49.069
It is more than gratifying to see them see
their produce go into the school system and

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:56.810
to see them actually become viable business
persons, and to also see the students taking

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:02.909
joy in what their eating and understanding
how it really, really is helping their bodies.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:07.700
We've got the teachers excited about it, and
then they got the students excited about it.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.120
And so now we have not just students and not
just teachers, but both of them asking us,

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.010
"What's coming up next month, and what's coming
up the month after that?"

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:20.660
We had a parent phone in to us and say, "My
kid came home from school so excited I had

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.720
to go out, take the recipe, and go buy everything
to make a blueberry spinach smoothie at home

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.720
last night.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.330
I want to thank you for your help."

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:30.900
At USDA, we're committed to creating a healthier
next generation.

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:34.840
We've got seven regional offices all across
the country ready to help.

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:38.440

your school, visit our website and check out
