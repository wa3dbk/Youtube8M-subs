Hi guys, its Cindy Lietz, your Polymer Clay
Tutor, and today's studio tip, is how not

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.050
to store your Liquid Polymer Clay.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:18.320
Now this is some advice that I should have
taken for myself, but I didn't, I made a mistake.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.680
Normally when you store anything Polymer Clay,
you need to make sure… if you're gonna store

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:30.080
it into something plastic, you need to make
sure that it is Polymer Clay compatible.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:36.090
And here's an example of what’s not Polymer
Clay compatible, I have these little… these

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:39.820
little containers that you can get from Costco,
you're… they’re for putting like salad

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.760
dressing or whatever into, and I had used
them before for putting in some glazes and

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.760
things.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.250
So I have a little bit of glaze left over
from a project, and I put it into here.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.620
I wasn't thinking and I just put some Liquid
Polymer Clay…

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:58.620
I’d made…

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.461
I don't know if you ever do those cupcakes
and things with the frosting, so when you

00:01:04.461 --> 00:01:12.140
take some Liquid Polymer Clay like TLS or
Sculpey Bake &amp; Bond, and mix it with a little

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.859
bit of solid color clay, you can make it look
like frosting.

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:22.100
Anyways, I'd made up a batch of frosting,
and put it in one of these little containers,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:28.409
and I went to go get it out of the drawer
the other day, and this is what happened.

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:36.689
The whole bottom got eaten right out by the…
whatever's in the Polymer Clay that reacted

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:42.240
with the plastic in this container, so I scraped
it out of the bottom of my drawer and put

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.990
it up on here to show you what it's like.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.280
This is what happens, it just… it breaks
apart and it's sticky and its…it just does

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.820
this weird funky thing.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:58.659
So the only way to really be sure that it’s
gonna be Polymer Clay safe or Liquid Polymer

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:05.689
Clay safe, is to test it, glass is no problem,
but any of the plastics, you'll wanna test.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:11.660
Put a little bit… a little dab onto the
plastic somewhere, and watch it over the next

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.700
day or two and see if it does anything weird
to the plastic.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.700
One thing that does work is these little paint
pots, you know that… you can buy them in

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:25.170
an empty strip, I think I got these at Michaels
or somewhere, and you just…

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.890
I've got some Liquid Polymer Clay stored in
there, and I've dyed these ones with a little

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.550
bit of alcohol Ink, and so I had a bunch of
colors of it, and so I stored it in one of

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.080
these paint pots.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:41.590
So I just thought I'd share that with you
so that you aren't making strange errors when

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.620
you're storing your Polymer Clay.

If you have any questions or you have a product
you’d like me to test for you or any other

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.650
kind of issue, make sure to leave a comment

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.990
So I will see you next time, and bye for now.
