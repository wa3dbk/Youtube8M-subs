Electric-car drivers have suffered with lengthy
recharge times — but no more. Auto company

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.849
Tesla Motors unveiled a new battery-swapping
system Thursday that can charge an electric

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.789
car in the time it takes to reheat dinner.
 Tesla founder Elon Musk demonstrated the

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.920
new Fast Pack system by timing it alongside
an average fill-up for a 20-gallon Audi. While

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.769
the gas-guzzler took over four minutes to
fill up, Tesla managed to swap out its 1,000-pound

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:29.439
battery in just 93 seconds. (Via&nbsp;Tesla Motors)

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.380
The battery switch stations, which will cost
$500,000 to install, are essentially holes

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.970
in the ground equipped with robotic arms.
When a Tesla Model S electric car parks over

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.440
the hole, the arms can unscrew the old battery
and pop in a new one. (Via&nbsp;YouTube / sbknapps)

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.590
Musk offered Model S owners a choice between
"fast or free" — a free battery recharge

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.090
that takes 30 minutes, or the 90-second swap
that is estimated to cost anywhere from $60-$85

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.520
dollars. He told attendees:&nbsp;"There are people
that take a lot of convincing. ... Hopefully,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.620
this is what will finally convince people
that electric cars are the future."&nbsp;(Via&nbsp;Businessweek)

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:06.600
But battery-swap technology isn't an entirely
new innovation. It's been tried once before

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.680
— with disastrous results.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.300
Israeli startup Better Place first introduced
the technology for its Renault electric cars

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.050
in 2007. The concept never caught on, and
Better Place filed for bankruptcy this year

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.720
after burning through $800 million in venture
capital. (Via&nbsp;Singularity Hub)

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.490
So it's understandable that not everyone is
sold on Musk's vision of the future. A writer

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.920
for&nbsp;GigaOM&nbsp;says although the new cars are
a symbol of luxury, Tesla will need to expand

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:34.150
its infrastructure if it wants to see wider
adoption of the car.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.140
"It's like if Apple launched the iPhone in
the very early days of cell phones — it

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:41.780
would have to build out some of the cellular
networks, too, to get the iPhone experience

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.049
to work the way they wanted it to in such
a nascent environment."

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.461
And it's not clear how Tesla's system might
work with cars from other manufacturers. A

00:01:49.461 --> 00:01:54.140
writer for&nbsp;CNET&nbsp;thinks Tesla's innovation
might shut out competitors, leading to proprietary

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.729
refueling standards for each electric car
maker. &nbsp;

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.080
"Watching Tesla's video, it gave me chills
— the bad kind — when Musk said Model

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.000
S owners could pull into a 'Tesla station.'
Will the landscape be populated with Nissan

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.149
Leaf stations, Honda Fit EV stations, Ford
Focus Electric stations?"

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.480
The first Fast Pack stations are slated to
appear in California later this year.
