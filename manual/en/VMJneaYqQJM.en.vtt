00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.009
Alright now we are going to do a second position
stretch. You are going to try and open your

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.080
legs as much as you can. Try to point your
toes keep it all the way straight. Flex it

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.610
up, yes, and you are going to stretch it,
right? So that's one way to keep your body

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.420
straight. If you can keep your heels out of
the floor that will help you a lot. You bring

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.260
your heels out of the floor alright? So bring
them forward and bring them back. That will

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:30.630
help you a little bit more. If you go to the
side now bring your heels all the way up,

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.730
bring your body up don't close your body O.K.
and be careful when lifting your leg, keep

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:43.490
your leg on the floor. So all the way up stretch
and down. Same thing be careful with covering

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:48.760
your body, go all the way forward, stretch
a little bit more forward O.K.? Flex it up

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.780
point your toes bring them down one more time
bring your nose all the way down. And we go

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.970
to the other side same thing O.K. So flex
it up bring it up point your toes bring it

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:09.710
down and one more bring it up and all the
way down. And one more bring it up and all

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:16.590
the way down. Remember don't push your body,
don't tense your body, relax let it breath

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.270
very straight. The same thing now we are going
to go forward try to keep your body up, yes,

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.680
don't drop it keep it up and keep reaching
a little bit more forward, flex your legs

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.189
and keep it up right there. Now from there
try to bring one of your arms all the way

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:40.670
across point your toes, breathe and relax.
Same thing to the other side keep it all the

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:48.549
way in, stretch it, good job. If you do it
four or five times in repetition even if you

00:01:48.549 --> 00:01:53.770
want to stay there for a little bit you can
stay for five, six, seven eight counts whatever

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.689
you feel like and every day you can increase
you can do it for more for ten minutes, for

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.439
twelve minutes. Alright so that is stretching
in second position and now we're going to

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.749
go with contractions.
