00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.310
next in video comes in calcite she talks
about how her school has now launched

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:09.190
this new campaign to be branded self and
she's really understand why it's

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:12.550
important to students let's watch so i
was wondering what you guys to think

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.750
about uh...

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.460
branding campaigns and my suggestion is
currently um... on the path to a new one

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.429
and they announce a few months ago ever
brand dugout which includes take

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:25.509
statements about hot summer school is
word associations

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.710
and a color palette among if you know
these things

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.149
and a lot of students i've talked to
about it are frustrated because they

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:36.140
spent eighty to eighty five thousand
dollars is a lot of us were kind of like

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.690
howell does help us they want increased
the reputation and i guess that's a good

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.660
thing

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.590
uh... but it really doesn't show the
long-term effects like is essential in

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.070
the lead to more funding and if so how

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:52.010
acts not really explained well and maybe
that's the problem but i was wondering

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.760
what you guys thought on this issue

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.400
was interesting because if you know
people will make the argument that

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.970
eighty five thousand is it really that
much money relatively speaking but at

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.360
the same time eighty-five thousand can
pay the salary the professor per year

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.080
you know

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.940
uh... laura at least help a few students
with some sort of scholarships so they

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:11.159
can afford it station

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.399
so you gotta keep in mind with the
priorities are for the university is

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:17.380
rebranding really something that's
important for the university i'm not

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.520
sure maybe they think of rebranding inc
uh... using new colors is something will

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.280
attract which seems to enroll

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.430
it's el nino make more money i don't
know i don't know what their reasoning

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.100
is behind it but i understand your
concerns and to be quite honest i would

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.580
be annoyed but that's you medicine
another new tend to like make the

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:37.760
students

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.679
excited about their schooling feel
school pride i have no idea but

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:45.439
when you think about all the different
ways all the schools are suffering it

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:48.100
makes you kind of shake your head when
you see that they're spending eighty

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.400
five grand on something is irrelevant
and school colors

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.430
uh... as i say real quick l_c_i_
believes she's from the university of

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.590
tennessee knoxville minnesota chancellor
university so

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.920
where i'm coming from is i would think i
mean to you both big universities were

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.420
big names and the

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:10.739
easily identifiable colors you know you
see the husky c longhorns you know

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.609
you know what that school is so

00:02:12.609 --> 00:02:14.659
i haven't really had to deal with that

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:19.579
but for a small university that doesn't
have a reputation

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.249
the first off it could be a greater
amount of money for them than it is for

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:25.040
beginners to maybe eighty five thousand
dollars for a very small universe is a

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.950
lot of money

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:29.709
but we should also bear in mind that one
reason they might want to do this

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.930
regretting it lasted more students to
enroll but it could also bring in more

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.219
money from

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.819
alumni or just people in the community
like at the university seems more

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:41.229
professional or more modern or something
like that maybe they can raise more

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:42.369
money after that

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:45.160
so i don't think the basic spect
students to really care

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.120
miller may be able to read some more
storms for private part of this that

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.820
kind of

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.350
puzzles me wire the ni qing at such a
big deal and advertising into the

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.409
students you see them saying like

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.199
we had created a new department within
the university of than actually benefit

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:03.549
the students that i can understand them
for you to their attention and also

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.599
johnnie do make a good point about

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:09.700
you know maybe this'll encourage alumni
to donate money to the university of

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.829
that sucks about when you think about

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.760
uh... but at the same time like if
school colors blinkers you donate money

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.019
to the university that you graduated
from i don't know how you have some

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.559
issues ok at this stage i mean i don't
think that

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:25.780
i really like to read

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.169
the democratic party

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:29.389
and it's a powerful it

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:35.120
no i have read wanted season's coming so
um... as really likes to think that

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.929
color schemes uh... patrick i set up a
plaid pattern to somebody

00:03:39.929 --> 00:03:42.119
red black and uh...

00:03:42.119 --> 00:03:46.089
either white or gray at siemens it was
my highschool calls can really

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:47.840
it's just such a beautiful and

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.129
it's aesthetically pleasing

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.159
like sit hour on the school side

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:56.759
regrads hariri madhavan threatens our
eighty five thousand inspections by the

00:03:56.759 --> 00:04:01.019
millions of antithetical colors that
don't make any sense that

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.519
battle a angie and i wish joke around
about how women will never call a collar

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:10.719
uh... the color that are really is so
frances if you look at cosmetics right

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:14.179
cosmetics never have colored names that
make sense with the lipstick i'm wearing

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:15.070
right now

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.499
it's not keen or read it's called break

00:04:18.499 --> 00:04:20.419
how

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:24.509
elisa break like i didn't know that
brave was the color of interactive feel

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:27.989
that i feel a little break i i do feel
more confident when and where

00:04:27.989 --> 00:04:31.509
my my blanchett speaks woman

00:04:31.509 --> 00:04:33.610
uh... but

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.150
so i will not allow about the way

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.310
women take a color it made me with
something completely different some

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:40.760
that's parade

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:43.380
and brave amendments um... alright so
