Hi I'm Mat from eSpares.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.500
In this video I'll be showing how to change
the drain hose on this Zanussi washing machine.

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:20.400
If you drain hose has become split or damaged 
and is leaking it is necessary to replace it.

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:24.720
Safety first: Always unplug an appliance
before carrying out any work.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:30.060
The next thing I need to do is remove the top of the
appliance by undoing these two screws at the back.

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:53.380
With the top out the way my next need to remove the
grommet the holds the drain hose into position.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.400
I do that by undoing the screw underneath.

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.980
With grommet unscrewed I can simply push down to release the hose

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.300
and I also need to push down and released the hose clip

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.420
that free's the hose from the top.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.440
The next thing I need to do is to lower
the machine onto the floor.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.840
Now we have carpet on the floor here, 
if you have a hard floor in your kitchen

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.430
or wherever you are doing this fix make sure
you put the machine down gently on a mat or towel.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.040
With the machine on its side i have follow'd 
the hose down at the back of the machine.

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.100
And I can see there's another hose clamp which can be released.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.000
Following the hose up to the drain pump
you can see there is a metal clamp holding into place.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.780
I'm just going to release that 
so that I can remove the hose from the pump.

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:12.860
With hose clamp removed I can now
carefully maneuver the hose

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.700
underneath the shock absorber and pull
it through the machine.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.280
Do be careful as there is often water inside the hose.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:37.070
With the old hose out I next need to
transfer the grommet from the old hose

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.959
to the new hose two clips one of the top and one at the bottom

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.199
that separate the two halves of the grommet

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.800
I can then feed the hose through the
clips and reattach it to the drain pump.

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.620
With hose clamps all attached you can then feed 

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.640
the hose back through the hole and reattach the grommet.

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.600
With the machine upright and the hose firmly
in place

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:55.230
I can now we screw the top on.

00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.480
There we have it, one brand new drain hose
fitted to this Zanussi washing machine.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:10.140
Drain hoses and other spares for washing
machines and other appliances

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.480
can be found on the espares.co.uk website.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.360
Thanks for watching.
