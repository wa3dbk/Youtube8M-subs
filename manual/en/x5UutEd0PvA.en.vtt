00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.870
People keep asking scientists, when are we
going to clone a mammoth?

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.870
Look.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:05.870
We'll get there when we get there.

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:08.810
It's not the easiest thing in the world!

00:00:08.810 --> 00:00:17.060
Hello to all you living beings out there,
I'm Trace and you're watching DNews -- Extinction

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.060
happens.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.830
But it can really suck when an entire species
just dies out.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.230
Then again, so can bringing back extinct things
ah-la, Jurassic Park...

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.689
If you haven't seen Jurassic Park // WHAT?

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:28.689
Go watch it!

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:29.689
It's a CLASSIC.

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:32.439
// cloning is used to bring dinosaurs back
from the dead.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.760
Now, 20 years later, the technology is catching
up to the science fiction.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.059
We can CLONE EXTINCT THINGS!

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:43.719
And in the Internet Age, the Woolly Mammoth
seems to be the popular choice...

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.649
The mammoth became extinct 4,000 years ago,
but a 20-to-60-thousand-year-old tusk was

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:51.850
found in a construction pit in Seattle on
Valentine's Day!

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:58.109
Due to its similarity to elephants, some scientists
think we can use DNA from found parts to bring

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.120
these bad boys back to life.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.069
Though they sequenced the genome of the woolly
mammoth back in 2008.

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:05.500
but do you see any wandering around?

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.500
Nope.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.000
Because knowing the DNA structure isn't enough.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.509
Repairing a damaged mammoth DNA strand using
elephant DNA would be excruciatingly slow

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.100
and it's pretty near impossible to tuck all
six feet of it into a microscopic cell nucleus.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.590
Last year, a preserved mammoth carcass was
discovered in Siberia -- frozen in the ice.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.659
While digging it out, a mis-aimed ice pick
nicked its skin and blood flowed out!

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:38.899
So now scientists are looking for an in-tact
DNA-packed nucleus of one of those red blood

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:39.899
cells.

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:42.189
If they get one then BINGO.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.560
MAMMOTH DNA.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.009
Then could use the same method used to clone
Dolly the sheep -- called somatic cell nuclear

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:49.009
transfer.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.060
Basically, they replace the nucleus in an
egg cell of a related animal with the nucleus

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.570
of the animal to be cloned.

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.259
If it takes, scientists implant the mammoth
embry into a surrogate mother -- likely an

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:01.259
African Elephant.

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.219
Next stop de-extinction!

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:06.549
Though it all sounds relatively easy, it ain't.

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.260
There are a handful of teams working on cloning
extinct species, including mammoths, but so

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.299
far there's no luck.

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.830
Nature has a tough time preserving DNA and
nuclei for science.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:57.530
Until we find one, we'll just have to keep
watching Jurassic Park.
