Hi this is Yolanda Vanveen and in this segment
we are going to learn all about how to grow

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:13.820
Browallia, it's a beautiful plant from South
America. Now Browallia or the bush violet

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:20.020
is native to the tropical parts of South America.
So the southern part of South America is pretty

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.429
cold. So they don't grow very well to the
southern part of then continent but in the

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:30.820
warmer areas they do really well. So there's
six different species of these bushy annuals

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.920
and they have evergreen perennials as well.
And they are densely foliage with a compact

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.250
habit soft stems and simple strongly veined
deep green leaves. The flowers are really

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:48.769
bright blue purple and white and they are
actually related to nicotianna and that's

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:54.270
always amazing me. So they have a nice fragrance
as well. So there are different types of Browallia,

00:00:54.270 --> 00:01:00.480
there's annuals and then there is a perennial.
So the annual variety is called Browallia

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.159
Americana. And it makes a bushy plant of up
to twenty four inches tall in the summer through

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:11.670
the early autumn it bares really beautiful
wide flowers. And their colors range from

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.479
intense blue through violet and white. It
makes a good garden plant or basket plant

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.120
and it grows really well outdoors. And there
is two different varieties, there's Vanya

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.229
which is a deep blue flowers with wide eyes
and white bells. So they are only good from

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:32.630
zones nine to eleven. So you have to reseed
them every year if you live in a colder climate.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:37.430
And even if you live in a warmer climate on
the American you need to start them very year

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.930
as a seed. But then there's a speciosa which
is a Browallia which is a perennial and it

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:51.259
gets up to thirty inches tall and it is comes
in purples and whites and all different colors

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:55.680
but it's only zoned nine to eleven. So you'd
have to bring it inside in the winter as the

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.549
rooted inside in the winter if you live in
a colder climate and just put it outside again

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:05.590
in the fall. But Browallia is a beautiful
annual like a bedding plant the gorgeous,

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.679
gorgeous flowers. It's a beautiful addition
to your garden.
