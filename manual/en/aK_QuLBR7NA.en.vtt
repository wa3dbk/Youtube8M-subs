00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:03.760
Story time dich-s.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:08.940
Now, who did Caillou do today?

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.880
Today's story is called 'Caillou Drives Off a Cliff.'

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.700
[Caillou sounds...]

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.100
[Riveting.]

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.500
Have you seen Caillou anywhere?

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.280
I think he's in the garden, driving his caac.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:29.400
Beep, beep.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:40.860
Now, you probably know that Caillou loves anything to do with sus and trucks.

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.800
[Damn, I can't stand that kid.]

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:52.700
[Best cat]

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.360
AH, there you are.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:57.240
Daddy!

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.660
Did you forget?

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.640
You said you wanted to help me wash the car.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:16.880
[Future editor's note: why the hell did I let this drag on for 17 seconds???]

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.600
Caillou imagined he was driving the most fantastic car you ever saw.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.480
Hello, Mr. Nyan!

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:41.200
Hello, Mr. LION!

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.900
Your business is appreciated.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.440
It's a giraffe!

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.880
Wow! I'm really going fast!

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.880
This is fun!

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.020
Oh, no.

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:26.300
Hey, Caillou. Look what you made me do.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.620
Oops.

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.960
Caillou had no idea that he was the one who made his daddy spray himself with...

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.520
...pee.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:38.660
Look mommy! (x6)

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.800
It's all clean and shiny! yniiny.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.300
Well, what are we waiting for? Let's go for a picnic at the beach.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.500
Hello, Mr. N(L)y(i)a(o)n.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.040
Can I drive the car, daddy?

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.280
Of course, Caillou! Of course!

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.920
[Door]

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:14.500
Beep, beep!

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.320
Caillou's in his car!

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:34.680
Hehehe. (x10)
