Hello, I'm Matt Guf for The House Snowboard
Shop. This is the Flow NXT FSE snowboard binding.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:17.190
This is a custom design for Flow, it is one
of their top-end freestyle bindings. It has

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:24.039
great color ways and a couple of features
that most the Flow bindings do not have. The

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.880
full bodies can be broken apart into a couple
of different sections, four actually -- the

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.150
base plate, power strap, power triangle and
of course, the reclining highback. The reclining

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.970
highback folds completely back so you can
get in with ease and get out with ease. All

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:44.290
you have to do is kick, lock and drop to have
a lot of fun with this one. It has full wrap,

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:50.140
EVA on the highback, and it's a 3-piece modular
style that can be adjusted to fit your riding

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:55.240
needs. If you need to adjust the highback
to get parallel with your heel side edge you

00:00:55.240 --> 00:01:00.540
can definitely do that. There's a tool for
lean adjustment right on the highback as well.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:06.331
The power triangle is great because it provides
a lot of stability on your heel side edge,

00:01:06.331 --> 00:01:12.880
and it pretty much just brings up the whole
structural integrity of this binding. The

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.990
high-tension steel cable runs from the middle
of the baseplate to the highback. Most traditional

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.540
bindings are an L-shape so when you lean on
your heel side edge there's gonna be a little

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.560
bit of give in the highback, no matter how
stiff it is. With the power triangle and highback

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.560
combination that Flow has, when you lean on
your heel side edge your binding and board

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:42.450
are gonna move like a snap! The 3D PowerStrap
is another great thing about these bindings.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.139
They're cored out so that saves a lot of weight,
but because the piece is fairly large it actually

00:01:49.139 --> 00:01:54.109
equally distributes pressure on the top of
your foot providing you with better circulation.

00:01:54.109 --> 00:02:00.450
There are four contact points on the PowerStrap.
On the outside of the binding there are ratchets

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:09.530
that you can lock in and custom-adjust your
fit. And on the inside of the binding there's

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.730
a toolless screwing adjustment as well. You
can set it and forget about it, and you won't

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.230
have to worry about anything else. The aluminum
alloy baseplate is great because it's rockered,

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:23.920
meaning it's naturally shaped the way your
board is when you ride and flex your board.

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:33.239
They've reduced a lot of the weight by reducing
the amount of material; and the KushPads on

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:37.530
the toe and heel cup are fully adjustable
as well, so if you need to move them out because

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.700
you have bigger feet you can do that, or bring
them in if you don't. This binding has a flex

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.209
rating of about 4.5, so it's a pretty stiff
binding. It's a great freestyle binding. It's

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.590
the Flow NXT FSE!
