Hi everyone,

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.460
today we are going to make Freddy from Five
Nights at Freddy.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:21.500
Five Nights at Freddy is a horror video game
where these cute animatronics are trying to

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:22.500
eat you alive.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.500
You basically have nothing but two doors to
protect you from these cuddly animatronics

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:24.500
trying to eat you.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.580
I enjoyed watching other Youtubers trying
to play this game and I wanted to create a

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:33.690
parody video on the game, but I'm going to
need some toys.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.890
So I'm going to turn these LPS characters
we opened recently into those game characters.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.600
Tundra Marchand will become Freddy, Bunny
ross will turn into bonnie, and Roxy will

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.040
turn into foxy.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.700
I haven't found an LPS that can be used for
Chica, but I'll try to find one suitable for

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.700
chica.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.079
In today's video, I'm going to turn Tundra
Marchand into Freddy.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:07.789
First, I need to convert the blue coating
into brown coating, so I'm going to paint

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:11.080
Tundra with Burnt Sienna.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:18.509
But I soon discovered that the paint doesn't
really stick to the LPS surface, so we are

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.480
going to need to prime the surface.

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.679
To prime the surface, I used Acrylic gesso.

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:30.500
You can find this gesso in any arts and craft
store for very cheap price.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:36.920
I got this tub at Walmart craft section and
it doesn't seem to run out.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.369
Gesso basically creates a bit of tooth to
the surface so paint has some texture to stick

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:44.369
to.

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:50.380
I gave a nice thin coating and then gave it
a second coating once it's dried.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.030
and here is Tundra with nice coating of gesso
. Now the paint will stick to him a little

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:57.690
better than last time.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:06.370
I used burnt sienna. and gave a nice thin
coating all over him.

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:11.300
and then once he's dried, gave him a second
coating

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.349
After about third coating, he looked like
this.

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:19.030
It's time to cover up his eyes with white
paint.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:27.620
It's time to give him a thick black mascara
around his eyes, because he has dark sunken

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:29.200
look to his eyes.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.500
so I'm going to cover up about half of his
eyes with black paint and then give a nice

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.920
black outline around his eyes.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.900
Now I'm going to color his iris blue, but
I think this blue is a little dark, so I'm

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:51.200
going to brighten it up with lighter blue.
and then color in the pupil with black paint

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:58.189
and then add white dots for the reflections
and the eyes are done.

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:06.459
Let's color in his tummy with yellow ochre.
and then add a black ribbon and his body is

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:07.530
done.

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:16.670
Next, I molded his mouth with clay to look
a little bigger, because Tundra's mouth is

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.560
too small and thin.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.640
I'm going to color his mouth yellow ochre.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:29.220
After the paint is dried, I draw in a big
black nose and then little dots for the whiskers.

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:32.489
and then the upper mouth is done.

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:39.830
It still looks too cute rather than menacing,
I'm going to draw in his teeth.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.590
After all, he needs his teeth if he's going
to gobble you up.

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:52.530
So I'm going to paint his lower mouth with
white paint and then draw in his teeth with

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.410
a sharpie marker.

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:58.870
While his teeth is being dried, let's color
in his eyebrows.

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.659
His eye brows thick and short.

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:08.219
I also colored in his ears with yellow ochre.

00:04:08.219 --> 00:04:11.469
Here is Freddy with his teeth drawn in.

00:04:11.469 --> 00:04:20.760
His paws seem a little empty, so let's color
in his paws with red dots.

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:29.500
Now only thing that's left is molding a teeny
weeny black hat and attaching it on his head.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.090
And we are done.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:39.840
Here is Freddy from Five Nights at Freddy
looking all cuddly and innocent, but at night,

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.250
he wwill come to life and he will eat you
alive.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:47.240
So what do you think?

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.360
Does he look cute and scary at the same time?

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.870
So we'll try to make the rest of his friends
soon so watch out for those videos.

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:10.319
I hope you enjoyed watching and see 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:11.430
you next time.
