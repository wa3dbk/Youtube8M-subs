00:00:01.602 --> 00:00:09.576
(♪♪♪)

00:00:11.378 --> 00:00:14.147
MAN:
Artograph manufactures
a large variety of light boxes,

00:00:14.147 --> 00:00:15.682
and today we're going to try
to help you choose

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:18.185
which light box
is right for you.

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:20.420
Light boxes are a great tool
to help with drawing

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.622
and tracing,

00:00:21.622 --> 00:00:23.056
lettering and calligraphy.

00:00:23.056 --> 00:00:25.025
They can be used for
paper embossing

00:00:25.025 --> 00:00:27.828
and other
art and craft projects.

00:00:27.828 --> 00:00:29.363
When you're
trying to consider

00:00:29.363 --> 00:00:31.198
which light box
is right for you,

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:32.933
you'll want to
think about your budget.

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:34.268
You'll want to think about
whether you'll need

00:00:34.268 --> 00:00:35.836
a portable light box;

00:00:35.836 --> 00:00:38.472
the size of the projects
that you commonly work with,

00:00:38.472 --> 00:00:40.707
and then the colour accuracy
that you get from

00:00:40.707 --> 00:00:43.477
the light box itself.

00:00:43.477 --> 00:00:45.279
Now the Artograph Light Tracer
light box

00:00:45.279 --> 00:00:46.914
is our economy light box.

00:00:46.914 --> 00:00:49.783
It's manufactured from
a durable ABS plastic,

00:00:49.783 --> 00:00:52.352
but it incorporates
an angled work surface

00:00:52.352 --> 00:00:55.122
and a convenient
tool tray at the top.

00:00:55.122 --> 00:00:58.392
Now the light tracer has
a 10x12 inch work surface,

00:00:58.392 --> 00:01:01.495
incorporates an 8 watt
fluorescent lamp,

00:01:01.495 --> 00:01:04.131
and a parabolic reflector to
help diffuse the light

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:06.566
across the area of
the work surface.

00:01:06.566 --> 00:01:07.968
The Light Tracer
has a big brother

00:01:07.968 --> 00:01:09.703
we call the Light Tracer II.

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:12.205
It's got a 12x18 inch
work area,

00:01:12.205 --> 00:01:14.274
and a 15 watt
fluorescent bulb,

00:01:14.274 --> 00:01:17.778
and is similar in design.

00:01:17.778 --> 00:01:20.280
Next we have
the Light Tracer Elite series.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.517
The Light Tracer Elite series
is also an economy light box

00:01:23.517 --> 00:01:25.552
that's manufactured
out of aluminum.

00:01:25.552 --> 00:01:28.655
It gives you durability
but is also very light weight,

00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:30.757
so it can be very portable.

00:01:30.757 --> 00:01:33.126
The Light Tracer Elite
has a flat work surface,

00:01:33.126 --> 00:01:35.896
a 10x12 inch work area,

00:01:35.896 --> 00:01:39.099
and incorporates an 8 watt
fluorescent daylight lamp.

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:41.368
The flat work area is
great for direct viewing,

00:01:41.368 --> 00:01:43.437
and allows you to
use a T square.

00:01:43.437 --> 00:01:46.673
It too has a big brother,
the Light Tracer Elite II,

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:48.508
which is 12x18 inches,

00:01:48.508 --> 00:01:52.980
and incorporates a 15 watt
daylight fluorescent lamp.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.382
For the professional artist
we have the Pro Series.

00:01:55.382 --> 00:01:56.350
Now the Pro Series

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.352
is manufactured out of
stainless steel,

00:01:58.352 --> 00:01:59.720
so you're going to
get a very durable,

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.021
strong Light Box,

00:02:01.021 --> 00:02:02.456
not as portable
as the others

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:05.425
because it's slightly
heavier in weight.

00:02:05.425 --> 00:02:06.994
But what really distinguishes
the Pro Series

00:02:06.994 --> 00:02:09.029
is the quality of
the light itself.

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:11.965
It incorporate a 5,000
Kelvin colour correct

00:02:11.965 --> 00:02:13.600
fluorescent lamp.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.168
It's available in four sizes,

00:02:15.168 --> 00:02:16.737
and the design of
the light box

00:02:16.737 --> 00:02:18.772
is slightly angled
to help with

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:20.374
a more comfortable
work surface,

00:02:20.374 --> 00:02:22.709
and it incorporates
a convenient tool tray

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.646
in the front of the light box.

00:02:25.646 --> 00:02:28.015
When you're considering which
light box is right for you

00:02:28.015 --> 00:02:29.483
you'll want to
consider your budget,

00:02:29.483 --> 00:02:32.419
portability,
the size of your project,

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:34.388
and colour accuracy,

00:02:34.388 --> 00:02:35.989
and I'm sure you'll find
an Artograph light box

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:37.924
that's just right for you.

00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:46.066
