Austan Goolsbee:
Hi, I'm Austan Goolsbee from the
Council of Economic Advisers.

00:00:11.461 --> 00:00:14.027
And today I wanted to talk
a little bit about a major

00:00:14.027 --> 00:00:17.294
milestone hit by General Motors.

00:00:17.294 --> 00:00:20.528
For some of you the last you
heard about General Motors,

00:00:20.528 --> 00:00:23.261
they were supposed to have been
on their last legs and about to

00:00:23.261 --> 00:00:26.428
die, but that's not
quite how it worked out.

00:00:26.428 --> 00:00:29.628
The story really goes
back more than ten years.

00:00:29.628 --> 00:00:33.761
GM had become a manufacturing
dinosaur that wasn't

00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:35.528
competitive internationally.

00:00:35.528 --> 00:00:38.661
They were bloated with debt,
they had higher costs than other

00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:42.061
manufacturers, they were making
models plagued with quality

00:00:42.061 --> 00:00:44.695
problems that people
weren't willing to buy.

00:00:44.695 --> 00:00:48.594
And what I plotted here is the
market value of General Motors,

00:00:48.594 --> 00:00:54.127
going from 1999 up through
the past several years.

00:00:54.127 --> 00:00:57.227
And what you see is that
it was trending downward.

00:00:57.227 --> 00:01:01.061
They were losing market share,
they were losing customers,

00:01:01.061 --> 00:01:03.528
and they were
definitely losing money.

00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:06.695
In the four years up to their
bankruptcy General Motors lost

00:01:06.695 --> 00:01:09.194
more than $80 billion.

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:14.127
They lost more than $30
billion just in the year 2008.

00:01:14.127 --> 00:01:17.261
And so when the
deep recession hit,

00:01:17.261 --> 00:01:19.861
they were really on
their last breath.

00:01:19.861 --> 00:01:24.094
So the president comes in to
office in January of 2009.

00:01:24.094 --> 00:01:27.628
The economy is in free-fall,
General Motors is about to

00:01:27.628 --> 00:01:31.494
collapse and the president has
a series of very tough decisions

00:01:31.494 --> 00:01:33.061
that he has to make.

00:01:33.061 --> 00:01:37.561
The president decides over the
voices of many of the critics

00:01:37.561 --> 00:01:41.728
not to just let them liquidate
in an uncontrolled manner,

00:01:41.728 --> 00:01:46.094
but instead to make a $49
billion investment in the

00:01:46.094 --> 00:01:49.695
company and to force
them to restructure to

00:01:49.695 --> 00:01:51.695
make themselves competitive.

00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:54.761
Now critics said that
they couldn't do it,

00:01:54.761 --> 00:01:57.194
they were going to die anyway
and we would never get a dime

00:01:57.194 --> 00:01:58.227
out of that.

00:01:58.227 --> 00:02:00.494
But we learned from
Ford and from others,

00:02:00.494 --> 00:02:03.161
that big American
manufacturing companies,

00:02:03.161 --> 00:02:05.027
when they make
themselves competitive,

00:02:05.027 --> 00:02:06.928
they can be successful.

00:02:06.928 --> 00:02:10.394
And so the president launched
them on a massive restructuring

00:02:10.394 --> 00:02:13.461
effort and that involved
very tough conditions,

00:02:13.461 --> 00:02:17.695
firing the CEO, replacing
a third of the management.

00:02:17.695 --> 00:02:20.194
It had to be a shared sacrifice.

00:02:20.194 --> 00:02:23.127
Workers had to sacrifice
dealers, suppliers,

00:02:23.127 --> 00:02:24.895
management, everybody.

00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:27.928
It was the only way to make that
company competitive so that they

00:02:27.928 --> 00:02:30.227
could grow out of their problems.

00:02:30.227 --> 00:02:33.428
But they did it. And it did work.

00:02:33.428 --> 00:02:35.194
They got their costs down.

00:02:35.194 --> 00:02:38.461
People around the country
started buying their cars again.

00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:42.494
And for the first time in
years, General Motors actually

00:02:42.494 --> 00:02:44.194
turned a profit.

00:02:44.194 --> 00:02:47.061
And now General Motors
begins selling shares

00:02:47.061 --> 00:02:48.861
again to the public.

00:02:48.861 --> 00:02:51.994
They had an initial public
offering that was one of

00:02:51.994 --> 00:02:54.294
the biggest in history.

00:02:54.294 --> 00:03:00.895
The value of the company is
now more than $50 billion and

00:03:00.895 --> 00:03:07.461
investors gave them a
major vote of confidence.

00:03:07.461 --> 00:03:10.828
And that vote of confidence
means we can now start getting

00:03:10.828 --> 00:03:14.594
out of the business of owning
the shares of General Motors

00:03:14.594 --> 00:03:17.961
and paying back the
American taxpayer.

00:03:17.961 --> 00:03:21.061
But in truth, it was never
really about the stock market,

00:03:21.061 --> 00:03:24.127
it was about saving
American jobs.

00:03:30.261 --> 00:03:32.928
And if you ask what
did it mean for jobs,

00:03:32.928 --> 00:03:36.628
you first have to remember
that the alternative was the

00:03:36.628 --> 00:03:39.127
liquidation of General Motors.

00:03:39.127 --> 00:03:42.061
Rather than hundreds of
thousands of people around

00:03:42.061 --> 00:03:45.394
the country going out
looking for new work,

00:03:45.394 --> 00:03:49.761
they have gone back to work
at GM plants, at dealerships,

00:03:49.761 --> 00:03:53.227
at auto suppliers all
around the nation.

00:03:53.227 --> 00:03:56.528
And in a number of cases,
there have actually been plant

00:03:56.528 --> 00:04:00.561
expansions where they have
added shifts and extra work.

00:04:00.561 --> 00:04:05.928
So if you take Lordstown,
Ohio, in Eastern Ohio,

00:04:05.928 --> 00:04:08.795
outside of Youngstown.

00:04:08.795 --> 00:04:13.728
They introduce a higher mileage
vehicle, the Chevy Cruze.

00:04:13.728 --> 00:04:15.695
It's being made right there.

00:04:15.695 --> 00:04:18.394
There are more than
4,000 people with jobs.

00:04:18.394 --> 00:04:22.061
They are operating three
shifts to make those cars.

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:25.828
Or if you take the
Hamtramck Detroit plant,

00:04:25.828 --> 00:04:28.127
they are making
the Chevy Volt there.

00:04:28.127 --> 00:04:31.361
It's a new electric vehicle,
just got named motor trend

00:04:31.361 --> 00:04:33.061
car of the year.

00:04:33.061 --> 00:04:36.928
Overall, for the first
time in a decade, the U.S.

00:04:36.928 --> 00:04:41.094
auto industry's employment
is actually expanding.

00:04:41.094 --> 00:04:43.895
The critics said this
would never work.

00:04:43.895 --> 00:04:46.027
But the critics were wrong.

00:04:46.027 --> 00:04:48.928
Rather than a collapsing
auto industry dealing

00:04:48.928 --> 00:04:52.461
another crushing blow
on the American economy,

00:04:52.461 --> 00:04:56.294
the American automotive
sector is now one of our

00:04:56.294 --> 00:04:58.328
engines of growth.
