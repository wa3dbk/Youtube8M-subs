Hi, Youtube. This is the Amputee OT and I'm really happy to show you today's video because I got my first prosthetic.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:12.600
What's really cool about this video

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:18.149
is that it's the first time I've put my unfoot into a prosthetic ever in my entire life

00:00:18.149 --> 00:00:22.560
and you guys get to see exactly what it's like. I think I did pretty good.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.680
*Machinery and welding noises*

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:31.380
[Doc]: Okay, let's slide into one.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.759
I already shrank I can see all kinds of space in there

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.840
*clank from the walker*

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.520
*clank from the walker*

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.300
[Tisha]: How does it feel? [Christina]: Weird.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.900
*clank from the walker*

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.460
[Tisha]: Yeah, cause your ankle doesn't move.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.820
So this is my opportunity did not be pigeon-toed in that foot. It was always in that foot, too.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:45.500
[Tisha]: Pigeon-toed... [Christina]: Pigeon-toed, my feet turned in. [Tisha]: Oh!

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:48.460
Did you ever watch me walk? I walk like Tommy Pickles.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.340
It feels right to have prosthetic. I'm like of course I have a foot down there. Yay!

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.260
Can you see my whole-- my body? [Tisha]: Yes. I'm recording

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.740
[Chuckle]

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.620
[Tisha]: What are you trying to do? [Christina]: Trying to balance on-- on my prosthetic.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.860
[Tisha]: Nice butt shot.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.980
[Christina]: Oh, yeah?

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:01.230
[Doc]: Starting to get sore?

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:06.800
[Christina]: The back of my knee I guess is a little sore but they're starting to get a little...

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.840
[Tisha]: Oh so you wanna put that back down?

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.100
Oh. I'm-- I'm-- I-- I messed up.

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.960
[Doc]: Ah, okay why don't we...

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.900
I did that with my-- I did that when I had two legs

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.460
[Doc]: I need you to turn your toe out some more.

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.540
[Tisha]: I wanna-- I wanna see the stump.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:16.060
[Doc]: Okay, turn your toe out just a little bit.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.940
Yeah they're both...

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:55.280
[Tisha]: No runnin'. [Christina]: No? [Tisha]: No swimmin'. [Christina]: No swimmin'?

00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.960
[Doc]: Okay, let me get your socks together while you're walking. [Tisha]: Go home and try some stairs.

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.860
[Christina]: Eventually

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.240
[Tisha]: Stop that! Stop it!

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.540
You're gonna hurt yourself. [Christina]: No I won't.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.260
[Tisha]: "I will not hurt myself." You're gonna hurt yourself.

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:35.620
Yeah? But I just got it. Oh, I can-- I can see it in the mirror. *Giggles*

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.000
So he wrapped it with fiberglass

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:41.860
So it doesn't crack. Cause this is not as strong. He made stronger

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:47.549
