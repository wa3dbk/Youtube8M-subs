00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:10.710
Today on this 2005 Pontiac Montana, we will
be installing Hidden Hitch part number 87410.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.019
This installation will also apply to Draw-Tite
hitch part number 75278.

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:23.280
We are underneath the vehicle looking at the
passenger side, you can see we have an exhaust

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.350
bracket that is held into place here with
two bolts.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:50.440
We are going to be removing those bolts and
using the weld nuts in the frame as two attaching

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.360
points for the trailer hitch.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:01:06.929
With this being a short, wheel base model,
we actually have a third weld nut here, just

00:01:06.929 --> 00:01:33.500
forward of the two that were holding the exhaust
in place.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:44.159
Except we are going to use that as our forward
most attaching point :36

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:56.530
Moving over to the driver side, you can see
we have the same three weld nuts here, we

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:18.879
are going to be using the two here for the
attaching points for the hitch.

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:58.379
On the passenger and driver side of the vehicle
we 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:43.540
will be drilling 1/2 inch holes at the rear
side of the frame, using the hitch as a template.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:04:01.670
It is a good idea on any vehicle that has
seen at least one winter to thoroughly to

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:13.629
clean the weld nuts before we attempt to put
the hitch up into place.

00:04:13.629 --> 00:04:57.430
To accomplish this, we are going to be using
a spray lubricant, like a WD-40, then take

00:04:57.430 --> 00:06:06.440
a wire brush and run it inside the weld nut
a few times, that should help loosen up that

00:06:06.440 --> 00:07:16.550
road grime and debris that gets stuck up in
there.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:25.289
