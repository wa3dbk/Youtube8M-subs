Hi I'm Chris with the Nestlé Kitchens.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.760
Today I am going to be talking about ice
cream sandwiches, specifically

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.380
an Ice Cream Sandwich Terrine.
Now a terrine is kind of a

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.990
fancy word, but really it's a sweet or
savory dish that's packed into

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.619
a rectangular container and then sliced.
But, today I'm gonna show you

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.130
frozen desert in a terrine. I am going to layer soft chocolate cookies in between layers

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:38.130
of coffee ice cream.
Okay, let's get started!

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.660
 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.050
Stir this up.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.300
Now that it's nice and smooth,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:16.300
I'm adding it to the prepared baking sheet.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.650
Add a little bit of ice cream.

00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:47.680
Look how pretty it is!

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.650
Okay, final layer of ice cream.

00:01:54.650 --> 00:01:58.479
Fold up the edges.

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.259
Now that this is ready I'm going to
put it in the freezer and let it freeze

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:08.259
overnight. Fortunately for today
I have one already prepared.

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:23.409
Ooh look at this. Isn't it beautiful?

This slice is for me.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.500
This is fantastic!
