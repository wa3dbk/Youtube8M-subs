00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.540
Hey guys, welcome to the Monday show, where
we're going to go over some of the best stories

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.910
from the weekend.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.010
This week, we've got news from the 14th century,
we've got entirely predictable online drugs

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.599
news, we've got President Obama taking a break
from criticising tyranny in the Middle East

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:20.279
and we've got World Cup deaths. There's also,
obviously, your comments and if you want to

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.320
skip backwards and forwards between any of
the stories go to the annotations in the top

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.320
corners.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.060
First up, the closure of the Silk Road website
has had absolutely no effect on the sale of

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:40.519
drugs online. Which is, obviously a massive
surprise (sarcasm alert).

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.409
For those of you who don't know, Silk Road
was essentially an online marketplace on the

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:49.679
dark web where you could trade pretty much
anything you wanted for BitCoin and it turns

00:00:49.679 --> 00:00:51.800
out a lot of people wanted drugs.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:58.309
It was shut down after an FBI operation and
law enforcement celebrated their success wildly.

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.479
But almost immediately, who'd have thought
it, a bunch of new websites were set up.

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:06.810
And, according to ABC News in Australia, in
the six months after the closure of the Silk

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.420
Road, the number of Australians selling drugs
online doubled.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:19.860
Well done.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.020
Next up and the black death has always been
thought of as a bubonic plague. We were always

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.960
taught at school that it was spread by the
fleas on rats.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.380
But new evidence suggests that that's not
actually correct.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.770
The black death killed six out of every ten
people living in London within a matter of

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.770
months.

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:44.270
But last year, 25 skeletons were discovered
in Clerkenwell in London and scientists extracted

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.369
DNA of the disease bacterium that had killed
them from their teeth.

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.579
It turns out the black death was almost identical
to an outbreak of bubonic plague, which happened

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.100
in Madagascar recently, which killed only
60 people.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:02.290
So if the Black Death had the same level of
virulence as the plague in Madagascar, how

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.810
is it possible that it killed so many people
in such a short amount of time?

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.209
Well, the scientists believe the only way
it could possibly have spread so fast in the

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:17.379
14th century is if it was an airborne contagion,
which would make it a pneumonic plague, not

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:23.640
a bubonic one.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.860
Now it's time for your comments and on last
week's Monday show, Zaeed Massani said this:

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:34.769
How can you sentence over 500 people to be
put to death? This is a state sponsored massacreï»¿.

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.540
And that's something that we would totally
agree with Zaeed, the whole that you can have

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:45.330
justice in a mass trial of 529 people is absolutely
ridiculous.

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:50.750
Then on the video about the far-right elements
in Ukraine's new government, jedgarsuink said:

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.430
Not exactly a new pattern, the US backing
extreme rightists/fascists. Remember Iran

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:02.200
in 1953? Guatemala in 1954? Chile in 1973?

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.180
For anyone who hasn't read How The World Works
by Noam Chomsky that's a really good starting

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.689
point for more information on propping up
far-right governments.

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:19.260
And on a similar vein, US President Barack
Obama has just been on a brief visit to Saudi

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.840
Arabia, to reassure the monarchy in Riyadh
that there's no need to worry about the nuclear

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.180
talks with Iran.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.159
In the 2013 Freedom House report Saudi Arabia
was one of seven countries given the lowest

00:03:31.159 --> 00:03:34.250
possible rating from political and civil rights.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:39.950
And the thing is, whilst the UK and US believe
it's definitely not OK to be a dictator if

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.939
you're not doing what the we want, there are
ways to get away with it.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:48.510
And our reliance on Saudi oil and billions
of dollars of arms deals suggest that the

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.670
House of Saud will be just fine to carry on
repressing their people.

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.810
After the meeting, the US and Saudi Arabia
reconfirmed that they are very much aligned

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.180
despite policy differences over Iran and Syria.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.120
Which is marvelous.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.580
And finally this week, the World Cup in Brazil
is fast approaching.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:13.379
On Sunday the death of a fifth construction
worker on the stadia for the tournament was

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:14.379
confirmed.

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.510
Fabio Hamilton de Cruz was killed during when
he fell 25 feet at the Sao Paulo stadium.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.010
Two other people died at the same stadium
when a crane collapsed, one died in Manaus

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.220
after being hit by a crane and another died
in 2012 in Brasilia's stadium.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:33.110
There are genuine concerns that many of the
stadia won't actually be ready in time for

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.660
the tournament and out on the streets there
are near constant protests about the level

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.640
of spending that's gone into the event.

00:04:39.640 --> 00:04:43.890
For months and months now people have been
demonstrating against the millions and millions

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.060
of dollars being spent on the competition,
saying it would be better to use the money

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:52.000
on public services like education, health,
transport and housing.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.820
They have also become a wider movement, protesting
against alleged government corruption and

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:00.330
the violent tactics used by police to try
and silence them.
