00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.790
"Preventing Ulcerative Colitis with Diet"

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:09.380
What has driven the dramatic increase

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.459
in prevalence of the inflammatory bowel disease,

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:14.730
Crohn's disease, in societies that are rapidly

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.760
westernized - a disease practically

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.529
unknown just a century ago?

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.160
What has truly changed in our

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.859
internal and external environment

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.150
that has led to the appearance

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.560
of this horrible disease?

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.460
Well, Japan suffered one of

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.929
the most dramatic increases,

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:34.120
and of all the changing dietary components,

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.160
animal protein appeared to be the strongest factor,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.360
an exponential increase in

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.899
newly diagnosed Crohn's patients

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.840
and daily animal protein intake.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.120
Whereas the more vegetable protein,

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.430
the fewer the cases of Crohn's,

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:49.840
which is consistent with data showing

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.289
a more plant-based diet may be successful

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.829
in both preventing Crohn's disease

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.600
and in treating Crohn's disease.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.199
But what about inflammatory

00:00:57.199 --> 00:00:59.769
bowel diseases in general?

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:01.570
The largest study of its kind,

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.110
60,000 people followed for over a decade

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.930
found that high total protein intake,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.140
specifically animal protein, was associated

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:11.630
with a significantly increased risk of the
other

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:13.360
big inflammatory bowel disease

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.740
as well, called ulcerative colitis.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.159
Not just protein in general;

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.640
the association between high protein intake

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:21.430
and inflammatory bowel disease risk

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.140
was restricted to animal protein intake.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.280
And since World War II,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.840
animal protein intake has increased

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.280
not only in Japan but also

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.049
in all developed countries.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.909
This increase in animal protein consumption

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.549
may explain some of the increased incidence

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.920
of Inflammatory Bowel Disease

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.549
in the second half of the 20th century.

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.829
And it's not just this study;

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:43.110
it's about what most other

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.630
studies found as well, but why?

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.200
What's the difference between

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.250
animal protein and plant protein?

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.979
Well, animal proteins tend to have more

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.969
sulfur containing amino acids like methionine,

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:59.090
which bacteria in our gut can turn into

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.130
the toxic rotten egg smell gas, hydrogen sulfide.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.890
Emerging evidence suggests that sulfur compounds

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.070
may play a role in the development of ulcerative colitis,

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:12.400
this chronic inflammatory bowel disease

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.590
of the colon and rectum

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.950
characterized by bloody diarrhea.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.569
The first hint as to the importance

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.050
of our gut flora in general was in the 1970s

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.590
when analysis of stools showed

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.640
that their bulk was made up of mostly

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.860
bacteria, not undigested material.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.590
Most of our stool by weight is pure bacteria.

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.680
We're pushing out trillions of bacteria a
day.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.590
They just keep multiplying and multiplying.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.190
And they do wonderful things for us

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.819
like create the protective compound butyrate

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.090
from the fiber we eat.

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.940
But it depends on what we feed them.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.930
Bacteria may also elaborate toxic products

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.260
from food residues such as hydrogen sulfide

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.280
in response to a high-meat diet.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.409
Hydrogen sulfide is a bacterially derived
cell poison

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:03.790
that has been implicated in ulcerative colitis.

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:07.000
We had always assumed that sulfide generation

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.890
in the colon is driven by dietary components

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.769
such as sulfur-containing amino acids,

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.200
but we didn't know for sure, until this study.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.319
They had folks eat five different diets

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:19.540
each with escalating meat contents

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.519
from vegetarian all the way up to like a steak a day.

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:25.370
And the more meat, the more sulfide;

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.040
10 times more meat meant 10 times more sulfide.

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.379
They conclude that dietary protein from meat

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:33.730
is an important substrate for sulfide generation

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:36.799
by bacteria in the human large intestine.

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:40.209
Hydrogen sulfide can then act as a free radical

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.810
and damage our DNA at concentrations way below

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:47.110
what our poor colon lining is exposed

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.909
to on a routine basis, which may help

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:53.530
explain why diets higher in meat and lower
in fiber

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.879
may produce so-called "fecal water"

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:58.909
that causes about twice as much DNA damage.

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:00.530
Fecal water is like when researchers

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.349
make a tea from someone's stool.

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.090
The biology of sulfur in the human gut

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.599
has escaped serious attention until recently.

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:12.860
Previously it was just thought of as the rotten egg smell

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:15.390
in malodorous intestinal gas.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.900
But the increase in sulfur compounds in response

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.769
to a supplement of animal protein

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:23.140
is not only of interest in the field of flatology,

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.820
which is the formal study of farts,

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.690
but may also be of importance

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.410
in the development of ulcerative colitis.
