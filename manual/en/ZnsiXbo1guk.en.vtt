Hello everyone I’m Ryoya.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:22.500
The theme of this month is Bread, first video is how to make Namadane.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:27.640
and the second video was petit bread. How were they? Have you tried?

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:38.460
If you try my recipe, it would be nice you leave a comment on Youtube.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.320
some people on Facebook post on my facebook page with their photos of what they made.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:51.920
so if you like to leave a comment, well, you cannot leave a comment with photos on youtube anyway.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:57.560
It’s going to be nice if we can comment with photos. Anyway, leave a comment if you like.

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.880
so what was I talking about? Oh, the third video.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.920
I’m going to make raisin walnut campagne.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.640
in contrast to last week’s petit bread, process is a bit different.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:18.880
most of campagne recipe don’t contain any oil, so I’m not going to use oil this time.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.060
and baking temperature is going to be high, so that the surface of the bread would be crispy.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.000
raisin walnut campagne with soft texture is not so tasty.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:40.760
Baking temperature is going to be around 480℉
Okay, let’s get started.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.560
then let it ferment second time.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:14.040
it takes 3 – 6 hours at room temperature.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:25.860
when you dust flour on bread proofing basket, you should dust only a little so that you can have nice line patterns of basket.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:34.260
If you dust too much, you can’t see any line patterns at all, and the bread would be covered with flour all the surface, so it’s not beautiful.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:38.820
I think you don’t need too much flour for dusting.

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.300
bread proofing basket is kind of expensive.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.400
If you don’t have or can’t afford it, use bowl like this.

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:51.540
dust flour on the dough and put it in a bowl, then ferment.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:05:00.620
and some people use mesh bowl. But it’s really easy to dry out.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:10.680
you need to cover with something like this.

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:19.400
this is the fresh baked bread. Coupe didn’t open enough this time.

00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:27.140
Namadane I used today was made 2 weeks ago, so it was kind of weak.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.720
and the tips of opening coupe is…

00:06:30.020 --> 00:06:39.320
preheat the bowl as well in the oven, cover the dough with the bowl, then bake for 10 minutes.

00:06:39.460 --> 00:06:45.580
then take the bowl out, reduce the　temperature to 440℉ / 230℃.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:48.260
And bake another 20 minutes.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:53.400
I think this is the easiest way to open coupe widely.

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.240
I’m going to make bagel next week.

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.220
Do you know that bagle is needed to be boiled before baking.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:07.460
so, I’m going to make bagel with Hoshino yeast.

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.315
See you next week!
