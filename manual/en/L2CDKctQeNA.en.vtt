00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:10.120
PAUL SWEET: The Ornithology
Department of the American

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.190
Museum houses the
largest collection

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.780
of bird specimens in the world.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.149
Most of them
taxonomically diverse.

00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.140
We have virtually all species
of currently living and recently

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.670
extinct birds represented
here at the AMNH.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:24.634
The specimens have now
become much more useful

00:00:24.634 --> 00:00:26.800
than they were in the past
because of new techniques

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.440
that have been
discovered, particularly

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:31.600
the use of genetics from
the DNA samples which

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.000
we take from the specimens.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.524
All these trays
I've opened of birds

00:00:35.524 --> 00:00:36.940
here are called
rainbow lorikeets.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.190
They're all theoretically
the same species,

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.560
but as you can see,
if you compare birds

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:43.197
from different
drawers, they're all

00:00:43.197 --> 00:00:44.530
quite different from each other.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.530
Another important collection
that we have in here

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.610
is the type collection.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:56.560
The types are specimens,
which researchers

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.980
used to describe species.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.070
When they describe a species,
they designate a specimen

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.230
to represent that species.

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:10.460
And so these are a very, very
important collection of birds.

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.820
We have specimens here at AMNH
that are around 200 years old.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.340
Each bird, aside from
having the data from where

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.260
it was collected,
when it was collected,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.120
has what we call
a catalog number.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:28.090
We have right now in the skins
over 830,000 catalog numbers.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.490
Most of that information
now has been transcribed

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.390
from the labels via
handwritten ledgers

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.830
into a computer database.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.750
And that's one of
our big achievements

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:39.370
over the last decade
in ornithology.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.210
We've made our data freely
available to the world

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.560
of ornithology and the public.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.070
Aside from what you see out
in the public galleries,

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.350
one of the most important
roles in the American Museum

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.802
is research into all aspects
of biology of-- of birds.

00:01:54.802 --> 00:01:56.630
We study evolution.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.120
We study conservation.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.080
We study biogeography.

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.360
These collections
are-- they're kind of

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.710
like a library of specimens
that can be consulted and used

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:07.640
by scientists.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.340
And have been consulted
and used by scientists

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.110
for over 100 years.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.660
Many, many really important
discoveries about evolution

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.070
have been made
using our specimens.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.520
