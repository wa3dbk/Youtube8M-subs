00:00:05.029 --> 00:00:10.860
Kyokushin generally refers to a choke of some
sort and we will generally hear this term

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:17.810
in reference to an attack that we are experiencing
so if my partner were to attack in Shirp Kyokushin,

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.050
the Shiro is behind.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.770
Kyokushin is the choke.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.439
In this particular instance, it's going to
be the Nagay, or the person doing the technique

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:27.870
that's going to be executing the choke.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.770
Now this is not something that you're going
to experience in every dojo, certainly not

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:36.550
in the beginning, but the more time I train
in Ikito, the more I begin to appreciate the

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:37.550
chokes.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.260
So if we were to start with a very basic Yako
honmi, a good position to start in is the

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.579
way we would start Aringinate.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:52.710
So anyway that I can get behind my partner,
continue to move, Aringinate we would lift

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.010
and project.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:01.699
If we're interested in finishing withKyokushin,
behind my partner and around, lift and continue

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.800
to wrap all of this up and down.

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.420
So this is typically considered to be a rear
naked choke.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.130
You'll see this in everything from judo wrestling
to jujitsu but we use it quite often here

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:15.710
in Ikoto as well.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:16.710
Around, lift.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.259
I'm going to take my own bicep, go left hand
around and put the pressure against the back

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:24.259
of my partner's head.

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.439
I'm going to think about dropping my elbows
together and take a deep breath so your chest

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:33.890
expands behind your partner's head.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.450
Get's tight.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:42.369
Some of the other forms that we can see in
Kyokushin, you can start ikill.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.820
I can take the ghee from the other side of
my partner's throat, up and under.

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:58.649
Insert my knee real tight and take the ghee
from this side, push my partner all the way

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:10.160
through show here, Shomenochi, directly up
underneath.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:11.760
Hands together, pull.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.540
All right?

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:20.599
So these are just some of the variations that
you'll see most commonly so from Shomenochi,

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:26.480
you'll see the more rear naked type of choke.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:38.050
We'll see a ghee-oriented chokes.

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.640
Another ghee that we can use.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.760
All right?

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.250
So there's lots of variations of chokes.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.940
You'll see them in many different martial
arts.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:55.050
We will typically use the ghee or just the
hands in any variation that we use.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.310
Very effective at any rate.

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.010
So Kyokushin, chokes.
