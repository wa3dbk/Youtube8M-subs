it rumbles and explodes and explodes, and to me it matters, matters

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.000
The calmness doesn ́t drain, nor it asks for a fee, it is strong, you can see, it overflows

thats how it is, thats how it will be, this is how the plan goes

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
By themselves, just like the waves, the base drum and the snare drum, together have a ball

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
the bass and the piano, the discs and the zone, they play just for you

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.500
How many times can you count, walking only probing without having the tools?

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.500
it will not only work, just think about it

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
That is not the way, it just drops

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.500
With its scar, it is not an apprentice

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.500

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.000
For you , for who? for me?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.500
resulting, discovering with claps

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.000
Lets go for a lot more than a piece, with a a lot more joy we comeback

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
i did not loose one, we did not win

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
We are all one, from the same hands

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
From a universe, where we all reside

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Even if we are all scattered, we are hearing love and claims

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.000
we should not turn around, we should look at eachother

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Its funny how things change, with a true embrace

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
