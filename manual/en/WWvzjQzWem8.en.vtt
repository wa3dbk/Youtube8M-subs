00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:04.960
My name's Camille

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:09.139
and I'd like to share my favorite verse, verses I guess

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.719
of The Book of Mormon with you. My favorites verses from The Book of Mormon

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.980
actually are found in the Bible as well, so if
any of you followers here

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.060
are familiar with the Bible, these verses won't be new to you.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.590
In the Bible they're found in Isaiah 53,
in The Book of Mormon

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:27.740
we find them in Mosiah chapter 14.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.230
And my favorite verses in chapter 14 are

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.460
verses 4 and 5 and we're talking about

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.239
Christ here: "Surely he hath borne our griefs
and carried our sorrows

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:44.420
yet we did esteem him stricken, smitten of God and afflicted

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.449
but he was wounded for our
transgressions, he was bruised for our

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:49.399
iniquities

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:52.729
the chastisement of our peace was upon Him

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:56.100
and with his stripes we are healed.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:59.579
The moment that I knew that Christ was real

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:02.809
and that he knew me and that his atonement was personal,

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.110
and it was for me, was the day

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.760
that I read these verses in the Bible.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.930
I felt Christ so close to me and

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.520
I just felt heartbroken that He had done
those things -

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.250
but so grateful that He had.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.010
And the day that I knew that The Book of Mormon was the word of God

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.420
was the day that I realized that the Book of
Mormon has the same message

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.250
I read this in the Book of Mormon and just
like I had read it in the Bible I felt

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.930
that Spirit of Christ so close to me

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.310
and I knew that the message of The Book of Mormon was the same

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.780
as the message of the Bible - that Christ is "The Christ"

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.200
that He's the Messiah, He's our Savior, He's there for us and He lives.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.220
And...that's the moment that I knew that

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.570
The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.020
was speaking the truth, and that

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.810
it was my path to Christ, was through this church.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.990
and I just wanna share my testimony of this

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:15.960
that Christ is real, Christ knows us, and his atonement is for us, personally

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.060
and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is just that,

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.420
The Church of Jesus Christ

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.790
and I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.
