00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The DB2/4 (often called a DB2/4 Mk1) is a grand tourer

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000
sold by Aston Martin from 1953 through 1957.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It was based on the DB2 it replaced,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
available as a Drophead coupe (DHC) and 2+2 hatchback well ahead of the times.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Other changes included a wraparound windscreen, larger bumpers,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and repositioned headlights.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:14.000
A year after the introduction of the DB2/4,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Stanley Harold Arnolt ordered several bare chassis for Bertone bodywork.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Among a few different designs, he had three of these Spiders made.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Two of these were prepared with minimal interiors as if they were prepared for racing.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
LML/505 differs with it's more opulent interior and grill-fitted bumpers.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Franco Scaglione was responsible for the design at Carrozzeria Bertone.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:54.000
He used the flowing lines and added a sharpness by using a crease along

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
the extremity of the the fenders.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
The result was distinctly Italian but didn't lose the Aston Martin 'look'.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Later the successful design was used on Harold Arnolt's Bristol-Bolide.
