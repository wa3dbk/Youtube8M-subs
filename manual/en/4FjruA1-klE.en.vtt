00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:07.599
 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:15.230
 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:23.609
 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.150
 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.890
Bojour, today I will prepare for you

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:33.770
the blanquette de veau, famous french dish
so here's what we need

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.160
we need some veal, so shoudler for exemple

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.730
then we'll need little bit of clove, a little bit of salt

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.300
some carrots onions and

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.620
in the end some alcohol vinegar and
then we will

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:51.250
serve this with some rice it's a
pretty simple recipe

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.489
if I can do it you can. So here is what
we do

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.670
we cut the onions, so we see we cut them in large chunks like this,

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.160
all rights I started cutting the carrots
and we just do

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.270
this one as well quite fast big chunks

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.100
it's a country side dish. We take

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.990
the meat, we have roughly two liters of
water boiling water

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.810
and we put the pieces of meat

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:23.140
all rights we then add

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.700
carrots, onions right

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.560
so here I use three cloves we don't

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.780
put too many otherwise it's too strong to take a big pinch of salt

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.330
and, very important we take

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.200
little bit less than 100 millilitres of vinegar.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.410
Now that this is done

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.860
we close it for one hour and we let it
simmer

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.049
medium temperature to not boil during this
time you can go have a

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.450
cafe a maybe baguette

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.720
in the middtime we'll boil the water
because we'll make some rice

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:07.720
you can put the rice. We'll just let
this do for a moment

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.269
 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.140
okay we need a little bit of peper.
Now we'll prepare the white sauce

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.470
the White Sauce in french, white is said

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.939
blanc. And this is what gave the name "blanquette".

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:25.510
Beacause it's white. So, very easy,

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:31.560
we take some butter.Roughly a hundred grams of butter.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.520
we let's the butter melt slowly

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.840
not too hard.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:41.860
okay now we have to act a little bit faster
but some flower in

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:48.709
slowly and mix

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:54.019
See it's very easy

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.299
you put roughly

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:01.680
one part butter, one part flower

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.840
We take some broth

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.849
 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:08.290
okay

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.620
And now you energetically avoid 
the lumps

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.240
 

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.100
 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.020
 

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:22.970
We need to carry on

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:28.490
The sauce need to be rather liquid, I will show you the end results

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.110
 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.120
You see? It's getting liquid. Now we are talking about the sauce

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.200
Symbourden have a lot of sauces, This is

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.380
the part of the interest of the dish is to have sauce.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.980
Now that this is ready, we pour the sauce

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:48.040
inside and we will let it cook

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.520
for 2-3 more minutes so that it can mix

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:55.260
properly. And voilà, C'est prêt

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:59.620
It's good and we can serve. Little bit of rice

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.670
little bit of blanquette

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:06.950
be generous and some sauce

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:12.190
Let's taste

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.910
Very good, Bon appétit!

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.000
 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000
