00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:07.100
Now I'm going to show you the other method
of transferring your pattern design onto your

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:12.540
glass. You can cut your pattern out if you
don't have a light table. You can either use

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:21.019
an art blade, or you can use a pair of scissors.
And I'm going to go ahead and cut out, you

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:25.019
notice you have two copies. I've got this
copy that I'm cutting from and I've got another

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.249
copy down here that I'm laying my pattern
out on that I'll be assembling on. So make

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:33.680
sure you always have two copies. So I'm just
going to finish cutting this piece out. I'm

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:46.280
going to be cutting it in the center of the
line if I can. Again, be careful not to cut

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.960
your other pieces wrong, because all these
are going to fit together pretty nice and

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:58.000
close. Foiling is a lot closer piecing than
lead. There's a little bit more allowance

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.269
in lead, but there's also a different method
for cutting it out of your pattern, I'll explain

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:26.240
that at another time. So there, I've got that
piece of my butterfly wing cut out, and what

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:34.420
I want to do is, I'm going to choose which
type or color of glass I want to use for the

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:44.480
insides and outsides of my wing. And I think
since the green is in the center, I want to

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:51.570
use, probably, the purples, because it's going
to allow for more light to come through. So

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.590
I'm going to choose a purple for the inside,
and the yellows or the oranges for the outside

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:04.890
of the butterfly wings. I'm going to grab
my purple glass. Since it doesn't have a pattern

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.750
in the glass, there's no particular place
that I really need to pick for that part of

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:19.790
the butterfly wing. And you would have some
adhesive, and just apply your piece of pattern

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.590
to your glass. And what I would do in this
instance, and what I'm going to do, is I'm

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.510
going to cut out each one of these pieces,
place them on here to make sure I'm actually

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.010
able to get every single one of these pieces
out of my glass and I don't run short.
