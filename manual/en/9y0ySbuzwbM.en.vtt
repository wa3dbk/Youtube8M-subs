&gt;&gt; Russ Faulk: Hi, I'm Russ Faulk,
grill master for Kalamazoo Outdoor Gourmet.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.200
And today we're going to sear tuna on the
grill.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.270
We've got some great yellow fin tuna here.

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:15.129
This is sashimi grade tuna.

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.039
We're going to put a little bit of blackening
spices on it,

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.030
we're going to sear it very quickly over an
intensely hot grill.

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:22.530
Our tuna steaks have been rinsed and dried.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:28.610
And now we want to coat the outside with your
favorite cajun blackening spice mix.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:29.610
Rub it in.

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.030
We don't want a ton on here,
we don't want to dominate that wonderful tuna

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.030
flavor and texture.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.480
But we do want to give it a little something
on the outside

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.260
And it's time to throw on the tuna.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.660
One of the keys is to make sure we cook it
an even amount from both sides.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.760
So you want the red middle to be centered
in there,

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.480
and with the cut edge here we can see how
it is doing as it goes.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.290
You can go anywhere from rare to medium,
I don't like to go past medium.

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.670
So anywhere from red to pink is okay.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.000
It's already time to turn.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:15.700
We just want to keep an eye on this edge here,
and make sure we stay in contact there.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.270
I'm going to grab the cutting board.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.040
[pause]

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:28.939
And that is going to do it for rare right
there.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:34.200
So pull them off the grill and we'll get ready
to slice them up.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.869
We've seared our tuna on both sides and now
it's time to thinly slice it for serving.

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:41.340
You want to look for the grain direction,
they have sort of a radial grain.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.310
And we're going to slice across that into
thin nice slices.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.860
The end ones are going to be just a touch
more done.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.860
Now like I said, you can go all the way to
medium on this.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.829
It's just about how much pink there are versus
red.

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:00.140
Because this is sashimi grade tuna I like
to go with the full on rare.

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.619
If you're using just searing grade tuna you're
going to want the brown from both sides to

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.280
go a little further in.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.550
So we've got a few slices off here, let's
get these onto a plate.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:18.450
And we've got a nice little sauce we made
out of white miso,

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:24.389
ginger, and mustard seed with a little mirin,
which a nice sweet rice wine vinegar.

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.620
You just want a nice little drizzle across
there

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.010
and we've got a wonderful appetizer for your
barbeque.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:35.080
So that's our guide to searing of great yellow
fin tuna on a Kalamazoo Grill.
