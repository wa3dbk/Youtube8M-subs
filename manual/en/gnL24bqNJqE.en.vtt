Hi my name is Jim DeYoung. I'm here with Fat
Cats Family Bowling Center in Salt Lake City,

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:13.000
Utah. You can see us on the web, FatCatsFun.com.
I'm here on behalf of ExpertVillage.com. Right

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.500
now we are going to go over some stretches
and some exercises to get you ready and warmed

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.830
up for bowling. The first thing I would like
to do is I like to get my shoulders loose.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.520
So sometimes if you hold anything sometimes
a bowling ball, the ball that you're going

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.440
to use. You can just swing it back and forward
warm up your arm a little bit. What this will

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.670
do is it will get your shoulder going so you
don't wind up tearing anything or ripping

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:45.230
anything. So, after a little bit of this I'll
switch off and I'll go to a full circle with

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:53.440
my bowling ball.
Basically this a good exercise for your rotator

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:06.540
cuff and for your joint. Alright and after
that I like to switch over to a good arm stretch.

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:14.040
Grab your hands behind your back. Stretch
down and pull up. What that will do is stretch

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.530
your biceps a little bit. Add a little more
tension to your arms so it will stretch out

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:26.180
those muscles so you don't tear anything or
rip anything. Alright and after I do that

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:31.380
I just like to get used to the approach really
quick with my bowling shoes. I'm wearing a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.310
pair of Dexter SST5's. So what I will do is
I'll just line up anywhere and then I will

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:50.030
test the approach. That gives me a good idea
on how slick the approaches are. If I need

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:58.360
to change pads on the bottom of my shoe or
if I need to grab a brush and take off some

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:09.420
of the top surface on the pads. So I am going
to do it again just to get used to it.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.860
So basically now you're ready to practice
and throw a ball.
