00:00:09.895 --> 00:00:10.395
-Hi.

00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:12.105
We're Brooke and
Bailey, and today, we

00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:15.110
are going to be doing a fall
to winter fashion video.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.150
And we have been really
excited for fall and winter.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.122
Down here in Texas,
it's still not cold,

00:00:21.122 --> 00:00:23.330
but we're busting out the
sweaters and coats anyways,

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.960
because we're getting in
that fally, wintry mood,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.620
and we just want to
wear the clothes for it.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:30.120
-Yeah.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.540
So we have picked out a couple
of our favorite fall and winter

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.815
clothing items, and we are
going to show you guys how

00:00:35.815 --> 00:00:39.240
to transition from fall
outfits to winter outfits.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.350
-This outfit is definitely my
most favorite fall outfit ever.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.420
To start off, I have
my vivid red boots

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.880
that I bought from
Old Navy, and I also

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.010
have these red striped
tights that it also

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.360
bought from Old Navy.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.470
Matching vivid tights
and boots together

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:55.385
is very in for the fall.

00:00:55.385 --> 00:00:57.530
Next, I have my
black tanktop dress

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.410
that I bought from Old Navy.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.360
And then I just pulled
over this jean jacket

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:05.360
that I got a little while
ago from Forever 21.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.450
And then I have this black
and white polka dot scarf

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.590
that I also bought
from Old Navy, just

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.020
to keep me warm in the winter.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.010
My bracelets is from Forever 21.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.430
It's just a red
rosette bracelet.

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:23.494
And this just pulls in
the boots and the tights

00:01:23.494 --> 00:01:25.035
and brings the whole
outfit together.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.130
-Starting at the very
bottom with my shoes,

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.330
I got these at
Uptown Cheapskate.

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:55.040
That's actually a thrift
store here in Texas.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.310
And I showed you guys these
shoes in my other thrift shop

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.180
fashion video.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.700
My jeans are also from
Uptown Cheapskate.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.310
They are just a dark
wash skinny jeans.

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:16.020
My blue long sleeved
undershirt is from Target.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.860
And I'll either wear this
under for an undershirt or just

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.070
for layers for warmth.

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:27.340
And my auburn vest with the gold
buttons is from American Eagle.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.200
And I just chose to scarf
from Dressing Your Truth

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.510
to go with it, because I
thought it went really well.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.870
During the
wintertime, just throw

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.835
on a jacket and
some gloves and you

00:02:43.835 --> 00:02:46.730
will be nice and warm
for the cold weather.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.040
-This is my next fall
to winter outfit.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.080
To stand off, I have these super
duper ooper cute ankle boots.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.470
I'm loving the
ankle boots lately.

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:21.640
And I just got these gray
ones from Aeropostle.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.670
Next, I have my
tribal print pants.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:28.800
Holy cow, let me just say,
tribal print is adorable.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.295
So I found these Aeropostle
and fell in love,

00:03:31.295 --> 00:03:32.753
and the boots just
match perfectly.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.820
In case you get cold
in the wintertime,

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.680
I usually just pull over
a black leather jacket.

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.370
I got this one from Forever 21.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.210
I love the V at the bottom.

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:48.710
And it just keeps me warm in
the winter and cold weather.

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:58.740
For my jewelry, I have my
silver watch from Fossil,

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:01.270
and my earrings
are from Claire's.

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:04.150
That store is the best for any
kind of jewelry that you want,

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:05.370
winter or fall.

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.460
For my hair, I've just
done a simple pancake

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.089
dutch braid into a braid.

00:04:16.089 --> 00:04:18.050
If you want to see
more of our tutorials,

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:21.530
go to Cute Girls Hairstyles.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:22.520
-Boo!

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:24.200
Hello, people.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.040
This is my second outfit, and
I absolutely love this outfit.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.200
It is one of my favorites.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.700
My shoes are just
black Doc Martins,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:35.830
and I got them from Aeropostle.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:38.210
And I was so excited when
we decided to buy these,

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.030
because I've been wanting
a pair for a long time.

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.140
I bought my pants
at American Eagle,

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:50.850
and they were pre-ripped.

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:54.190
So I just absolutely love
wearing them to give myself

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.100
kind of a more rugged look.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.150
Vests are really
in right now, so we

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.000
went and bought this
black leather vest

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.760
with these adorable zip
up pockets on the sides.

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:07.820
I absolutely love them.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:10.620
And it is from
Aeropostle, and the shirt

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:13.090
underneath with the
awesome sunglasses

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.050
is also from Aeropostle.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.560
Look at me with my sunglasses.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.340
This cute black cross
ring is from Forever 21.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.540
I got a little wild, though,
but I really like it.

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.387
My salmon knit beanie
is from Aeropostle,

00:05:34.387 --> 00:05:35.970
and I really like
it with this outfit,

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.520
because it just gave the whole
thing a little pop of color.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.850
If you get cold in
this outfit, you

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:46.960
can just switch your
black leather vest

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:48.610
for a long sleeved
jacket and you'll

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:50.193
be nice and toasty
for the wintertime.

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.710
-Thank you guys so
much for watching

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.060

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:45.740
-Oh there she goes.

00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:49.630
They're actually
doing remarkably well.

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:51.960
A few days ago, they
couldn't even hardly sit up,

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:54.130
and now they're
just sitting up like

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:58.590
crazy except for a few
tumbles once in a while.

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:02.870
They like to steal
each other's toys.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.460
Brooklyn.

00:07:04.460 --> 00:07:06.600
Hi.

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.510
Hi, sweetie.

00:07:08.510 --> 00:07:09.700
Bailey.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:11.750
Hey.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:13.830
Hi.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:16.310
Are you Mommy's girls?
