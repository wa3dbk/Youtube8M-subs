00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.790
In this video we will look at the various Di-O-Matic buttons,

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:08.686
present in all of Di-O-Matic plug-ins inside of 3ds max.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.082
For this example,

00:00:11.082 --> 00:00:15.977
 I will select a facial studio head to showcase the various Di-O-Matic buttons.

00:00:16.943 --> 00:00:20.018
The first button to notice is the authorize button. 

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:25.932
By clicking on this button the authorization status of this particular plug-in will be displayed.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.029
This will tell you which machine is holding the license and if it is authorized or not.

00:00:32.553 --> 00:00:36.674
The support button will automatically open our support web page, 

00:00:36.674 --> 00:00:42.976
you can contact us, submit a support ticket, and we generally answer within a couple of hours,

00:00:42.976 --> 00:00:49.839
you can also request a new license, check for updates, access our video tutorials, etc...

00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:56.515
The third button is visit Di-O-Matic.com that will simply open our website in your browser.

00:00:58.345 --> 00:01:00.385
Then there is the button with a question mark,

00:01:00.385 --> 00:01:03.560
which will actually open the help file of the plug-in.

00:01:05.122 --> 00:01:09.620
And lastly the button with the I is the info button of the plug-in

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:16.303
where you can find all of the information on a specific plug-in so its version, date of release, etc.

00:01:18.382 --> 00:01:24.241
So that was inside of facial studio, if we now look at Hercules our muscle primitive, 

00:01:24.478 --> 00:01:29.684
we can see that we have the exact same icons and that they do the exact same thing.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.233
If we click on authorizes here, 

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:38.946
we can see that this license is temporary and will expire in 121 days.

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.798
So if you have a temporary license like a trial or an educational license, 

00:01:43.798 --> 00:01:47.077
you can go there to see how much time you have left.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:53.601
If we go in Voice-O-Matic, again we have the exact same icons. 

00:01:53.563 --> 00:01:58.366
So we could click the help button and read the help file directly on our computer.

00:01:59.342 --> 00:02:02.087
And again if I select this object here, 

00:02:02.087 --> 00:02:05.448
we can see all of the same icons but in Morph-O-Matic,

00:02:05.662 --> 00:02:10.206
where you could again look for information or help for your copy of Morph-O-Matic.

00:02:12.096 --> 00:02:14.864
Thank you for watching this video on the five main buttons

00:02:14.864 --> 00:02:18.360
