00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:08.130
I'm Bill Elzey with Showplace Lawns. I want
to talk about buying a leaf blower. There's

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:14.539
three different types of leaf blowers. There's
the backpack blower, such as this one, there's

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:34.890
a hand held gas model, like this, or an electric
hand held model. Backpack blower

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:42.770
fits over your back, like such, got your handle,
your throttle controls are right here besides

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:49.440
you, and your off switch when you need it.
Ideally what you would want to do, is start

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.880
it before you put it on. It has a lot more
horse power, a lot more wind power coming

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:04.570
out of this tunnel of this shoot, than these
other two models. This is great for a large

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:11.240
property, for a lot of leaves, for a lot of
debris that needs to be moved. This is a lot

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.100
less fatiguing to use this, it's not very
heavy, it's light weight as far as that's

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.260
concerned. And it's good especially from a
commercial stand point, but it's also good

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:32.310
around the house. Again, you can move a lot
more material easily with this backpack blower.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:40.190
The hand held model is good for smaller areas,
like patios, decks, small sidewalks or driveways.

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:49.860
A lot more hand action involved, but it gets
the job done. The throttle control is up here,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:59.920
you're on and off switch on the side. It's
very good for, as I said, smaller projects.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.729
The electric hand held is even better for
people because it's lighter. The big draw

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:14.200
back however, is the electrical cord plugs
in here, and you drag it with you wherever

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.590
you go, and can try to keep it out of your
way. It's also good around the house, for

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:30.380
cleaning out the garage, driveways, and smaller
jobs. Three different size of blowers. One

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:35.720
important thing to remember when running a
blower, or any equipment for that matter,

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:46.550
are earplugs. A set like these will do you
just fine, as they plug directly into the

00:02:46.550 --> 00:03:00.780
ears, like so. An even better kind are these
earmuffs.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.560
Definitely want to protect your hearing, because
there's a lot more better things to hear than

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.690
the roar of these blowers. Again, two hand
held models, an electric, a gas, and a gas

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:20.040
backpack. Depending on what you want them
for, the larger jobs, the backpack, the smaller,

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.819
the hand held.
