00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.270
Hey there! Im Cruzan and this video is dedicated
to helping you troubleshoot your planes in

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.780
KSP. Ill cover the major issues associated
with taking off, so, lets jump right in to

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:14.709
it.

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:19.690
Sometimes the most aggravating thing in
this game can be just getting off the ground.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.380
There are a couple of major problems that
you might encounter while trying to takeoff.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.330
The first problem is veering left or right
off of the runway. There are potential causes

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.349
for this and the most likely one is what is
called wheelbarrowing.

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.870
Wheelbarrowing is when the majority of
your planes weight is placed on to the nose

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.120
gear of your plane. This is mostly an issue
with tricycle designs that have a single wheel

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.340
in front. Now a plane can takeoff this way,
provided that everything goes right and there

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:38.690
isnt any user input other than pitch controls.
Most of the time however, this is going to

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.940
result in your plane moving to one side of
the runway or the other, usually too soon

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.360
for you to takeoff.
How do you fix this? There are a few things

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.960
you can do. The first and simplest solution
is to simply try pitching up from the beginning

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.590
of your takeoff. Hold down S and kick on your
engines and hope for the best. This will make

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.130
your plane attempt to keep the weight on the
rear wheels. If this fails however youll need

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.920
to move on to actually redesigning your plane.
 The first design change youll likely need

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.659
to make is to place your front gear lower
than your rear gear. This will make your plane

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.830
start out nosed up slightly on the runway.
5 degrees is a good starting point. You can

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.110
either lower the mounting point of your nose
gear, or raise it for your rear gears. Keep

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.890
in mind that raising your rear gears increases
your chances of tail-striking, so watch out

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.100
for this and use your own discretion.
The other option you have is to tilt your

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.030
wings upwards. A 5-10 degree pitch will be
sufficient to give your plane some inherent

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:30.990
lift on takeoff. Remember, Shift plus the
WASD controls let you adjust your part placements

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.720
in 5 degree increments.
 After youve done this head back out to

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.400
the runway and see if your veering problems
are gone!

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:43.140
If youre still veering, then the problem
could lie with your gear placement, namely

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.080
Toeing of your gears. Toe is when your wheels
are angled inwards or outwards slightly. Cars

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.510
use this principle, but in KSP this is usually
a death sentence!

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:55.340
The best way to check for this is just
to eyeball it unfortunately. This usually

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.570
happened when you mount a gear to a wing,
and then later go back and change the wings

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:03.030
orientation using the Shift key. This also
changes the landing gear, so you just have

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.960
to be careful when youre designing your plane
to watch out for this. If this is indeed your

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:12.420
problem, go ahead and grab the landing gear
and delete and place a new one, or press shift

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.609
+ spacebar and it will revert any changes
youve made to that landing gear back to default

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:22.200
orientation! Alright go try testing it again!
 Is your plane still veering? Well the first

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.700
question Id have to ask is, how fast were
you going by the time you started veering?

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.029
If youre having problems in the 0-120 m/s
range, then your issue probably lies with

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:35.480
one of the above mentioned things. If, however
your plane is moving at 120-200m/s on the

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.069
runway and you start to veer, it very well
could just be a lack of lifting capabilities

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:42.680
which Ill cover next!

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.969
Hopefully that has solved your veering
issue and you are soaring dead straight down

00:02:45.969 --> 00:02:51.650
the runway now. The next major problem with
taking of is...well taking off! If your plane

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.349
is using the entire runway and isnt a super
jumbojet design, then you have some problems

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.939
to work out.
 There are three components to taking off

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:03.379
in KSP. They are Lift, Power and Angle of
Attack. Without these your plane wont want

00:03:03.379 --> 00:03:05.019
to stop hugging the ground.
Cant Liftoff

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.959
Lacking the first two components, lift
and power are easy fixes, as you simply go

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.849
back and add more power or wings. Although,
the "MOAR BOOSTERS" philosophy isnt something

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:18.059
I recommend when designing planes haha.
 For getting more lift you can add more

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:23.540
wings, usually behind and above the CoM. Adding
a tail with horizontal stabilizers is a good

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.090
option, or adding a second wing like a bi-plane
works as well. Its up to you to figure out

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:34.749
what will work with your specific design.
 Another option is to add a VTOL engine.

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:38.559
Ill be covering that very soon though so I
wont get in to it now.

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:43.150
As for the power issue, there are two
things you can do. The first one and the one

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.599
I recommend is to reduce the weight of your
aircraft! Dont get sucked in to adding more

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:52.579
and more fuel and engines to your planes as
this can lead you down a dark road. Less weight

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:56.120
means that the engines youre using now are
being more effective. Less weight also leads

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:58.120
to needing less fuel. So just keep this in
mind.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.769
If you do need to add more engines however,
then just try to find a good place to throw

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:07.659
them in. Using the structural fuselages is
a good way to mount them for beginners. Ill

00:04:07.659 --> 00:04:10.139
cover more advanced design techniques in a
future video.

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:14.639
Head back to the runway and see if youve
got enough lift or power to take off. If not,

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.480
then your problem probably lies with a lack
of angle of attack.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.740
Sometimes the simplest way to solve this
is to just add canards in front of your CoM!

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.379
Even the tiniest bit of lift in the front
of the plane is enough to get you airborne.

00:04:26.379 --> 00:04:30.530
Id recommend to use the small control surfaces
for smaller aircraft, and move up to full

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:35.009
winglets or canards for larger designs. See
if this works as Id say over half of the time

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:38.120
this does it.
 If that didnt work, or you dont want to

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:42.330
use canards, which I understand because sometimes
they dont fit the look youre going for, then

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.479
we need to adjust the built in angle of attack
of your plane. We can do this by adjusting

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:49.979
the gear placement, like we did earlier to
get rid of the veering problem. Some viewers

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:51.080
might have jumped right to this point so Ill
go over it again, but you should try to have

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.220
the nose of your plane be pitched up at least
5 degrees while sitting still on the runway.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.690
You can achieve this by mounting your front
gear lower or your rear gears higher up. Be

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:54.960
wary of tail-striking if you raise your rear
gears though.

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:55.560
The other way to get built in AoA is to
give your wings a slight tilt. You can do

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.810
this by using the shift + WASD controls to
pitch your main wings upwards 5-10 degrees.

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.460
Go out and give it a shot now. If youve
done all of these things then your plane should

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.440
be in the air!
 One problem that a lot of people say causes

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:06.240
problems with taking off is that the rear
gears are mounted too far away from the CoM.

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.990
I dont agree with this though as if youve
got the three ingredients I mentioned before,

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:13.930
lift, power and angle of attack, then you
can mount your rear gears wayyyy behind your

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:18.740
CoM and it wont matter, youll still take off!
 That being said, mounting your rear gears

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:22.560
closer to your CoM could enable you to takeoff
with less angle of attack as your plane will

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.800
naturally pitch up easier, but you might be
vulnerable to tail-striking again, so be careful!

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:30.310
And that will cover it for this episode.
Hopefully if you were having issues taking

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.259
off this was able to help. If not leave me
a comment or visit the forum thread and we

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.970
can try to figure out whats wrong! If you
