00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:10.260
I will be reading from The
Dirt, by Motley Crue.

00:00:12.935 --> 00:00:15.350
Uh, this section was written
by Tommy Lee.

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:20.440
"Hi," I said.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.525
"Hi," she replied.

00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:25.020
'It's nice to meet you."

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.034
"Well, bye."

00:00:27.034 --> 00:00:30.380
"Bye."

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.080
"The was it, dude.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.050
That's all we fucking said.

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.230
It was brief.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:36.430
It was awkward.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:40.660
And it fucking changed
my life.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:43.930
The chick was Heather Locklear,
and the guy who

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.060
introduced us was my accountant,
Chuck Shapiro.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.710
He knew Heather because his
brother was her dentist.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.100
Uh, I thought about her again
a week later, when I was

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.910
flipping through the TV, and saw
an episode of Dynasty with

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:03.920
Heather in it.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.520
Uh, he called his dentist
brother and hooked me up like

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.770
a true friend.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.950
The next afternoon, I took a
deep breath, kicked my feet up

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.720
on the couch, and called her.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.940
My TV was on mute in the
background, but, as we made

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.900
uncomfortable small talk, I
saw her face appear on the

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.076
screen in The Fall Guy.

00:01:25.076 --> 00:01:29.590
Uh, I took it as a sign that
we were meant to be.

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.780
"Hey, turn on your
TV," I told her.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.780
You're on channel four.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.020
Uh, she flipped on her set.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.710
"Uh," she informed me,
"that's actually

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.030
Heather Thomas." [LAUGHTER]

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.020
I wanted to hang up right then,
grab a gun, and shoot

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.532
myself in the fucking head.

00:01:48.532 --> 00:01:52.290
Uh, she took pity on me and
suggested we meet anyway that

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.600
Friday night.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.930
She wasn't the kind of chick
that I could take back to the

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.670
van, like Bullwinkle, or have
group sex with in a jacuzzi,

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:00.803
like Honey.

00:02:00.803 --> 00:02:01.690
No.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.580
She was a real woman, a good
girl, and more famous than me,

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.509
uh, three things that I'd never

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:12.220
experienced on a date before.

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.690
Ugh.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.530
I was nervous as shit
beforehand.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.850
I primped myself in the mirror
for hours, popping zits,

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.030
combing my hair, fussing with
my shirt collar, dabbing

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.210
cologne strategically around my
body, and making sure that

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:30.935
all my tattoos were covered.

00:02:30.935 --> 00:02:33.100
Uh, I buzzed the doorbell.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.910
At the top of the staircase,
I saw a white dress.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:38.980
And she descended slowly,
without a word, like in Gone

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:40.230
with the Wind.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:45.760
We went to some lame stand up
comedy, because I thought it

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.120
was something that normal
people did on dates.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.610
That night we talked
about everything.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:56.030
She had gone out with a lot of
uptight rich guys and cheesy

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.675
actor types, like Scott Baio.

00:02:57.675 --> 00:03:03.800
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.486
But she'd never been
with a rocker.

00:03:07.486 --> 00:03:10.530
Uh, I could tell this was a
point in my favor, after she

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.235
asked to see my tattoos.

00:03:12.235 --> 00:03:15.990
Uh, she was a good girl who
fantasized about a bad boy,

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:18.532
and I knew that even my starched
collar and Drakkar

00:03:18.532 --> 00:03:22.650
Noir cologne couldn't cover up
the fact that I was a bad boy.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.310
But I was too scared
to make a move.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.170
We slowly started hanging
out more, going to

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:34.290
dinner, movies, parties.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.228
But she would not
put out, dude.

00:03:36.228 --> 00:03:39.100
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.040
I'd get her drunk and try to
mack on her every way I could

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:45.170
for weeks, but she wouldn't
go all the way.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.660
Yeah.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.380
After a month and a half, I
was so worked up that I

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.160
couldn't take it anymore.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:51.530
We finally fucked.

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.660
And she had made me wait so
long that I savored every

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.370
second because, believe me, it
only lasted for seconds.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:05.050
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:08.560
We did it again and again that
night, until we were sure that

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.801
we were in love.

00:04:09.801 --> 00:04:14.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.680
Because when you're with
somebody that you don't love,

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:17.930
once is usually enough.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:23.880
After we fucked, the
relationship flew

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.440
to a whole new level.

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.150
We were slowly realizing that we
wanted to be together for a

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.730
long, long time, maybe
even forever.

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:34.800
When the tour ended, we married
in a courtyard in

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.060
Santa Barbara.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.980
Rudy, one of our tech guys,
gave us a toast.

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:40.370
"To Tommy and Heather,"
he said,

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.090
raising a champagne glass.

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.740
"May all your ups and downs be
in bed." Uh, then he took the

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.100
champagne glass and smashed
it over his head.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.060
I glanced at the table where,
uh, Heather's family was

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.810
sitting, and they all looked
like they were

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:58.150
having second thoughts.

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.400
Tommy Lee.
