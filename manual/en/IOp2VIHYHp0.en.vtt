JACOB SOBOROFF: Hey, it's Jacob.

00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:03.015
Every day we bring you guys
the best videos around.

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:06.550
Today we've got whale riding,
cosplay for Comic-Con,

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:11.256
and the first trailer for
"Fifty Shades of Grey."

JACOB SOBOROFF: This
is just gorgeous.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.230
Two kayakers out on the open
water, when suddenly they

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.540
come across a small pod
of southern right whales.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.290
And what started off
as whale watching off

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.320
the coast of Puerto
Madryn, Argentina,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.850
quickly turned
into whale riding.

JACOB SOBOROFF: This
was posted on Sunday,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:41.951
and it already has
over two million views.

00:00:41.951 --> 00:00:43.200
I love their laugh at the end.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.190
Is it just me, though,
or do these two

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:46.275
seem surprisingly calm?

LIZZIE: To celebrate the brand
new trailer for "Assassin's

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.380
Creed Unity," devinsupertramp's
team of free runners

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.680
took over the roofs of Paris.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.780
That's not the
only place they're

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:06.196
going to be fighting
off Templars.

00:01:06.196 --> 00:01:08.660
They're also going to be
taking over Comic-Con today!

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.360
There will be a
massive obstacle course

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.420
where you can test your skills
and show off your costume.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.660
But if you're more inclined
to dress in a black cat suit,

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:15.300
you're in luck.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.789
Nerdist just posted
this interview

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:18.580
with professional
cosplayer Eve Beauregard.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.070
-I think because nerd culture
and comic book culture

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.670
is becoming so much
more mainstream.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.394
It's sort of more acceptable
for women to read comic books.

00:01:26.394 --> 00:01:28.800
Then maybe there'll be
more female characters

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.974
that reflect the appearance
that female readers want to see.

00:01:31.974 --> 00:01:34.140

how to cosplay like a boss,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.920

how-to episode for you

down in the description.

JACOB SOBOROFF:
If you're looking

00:01:39.128 --> 00:01:40.922
for the most exclusive
party in New York,

00:01:40.922 --> 00:01:42.880
you are not going to find
it at the Soho House,

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.282
nor will you find it at Le Bain.

00:01:44.282 --> 00:01:46.240
You have to go off the
beaten path-- literally.

an urban explorer

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.850

His latest soiree celebrating
the release of his new birch

a hidden river cave.

[LAUGHS]

00:01:56.636 --> 00:01:57.980
-The cave is at capacity.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.011
It's a great atmosphere,
like a dream come true.

00:02:00.011 --> 00:02:01.510
Because people are
just comfortable.

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:03.176
Everyone's here.

00:02:03.176 --> 00:02:05.050
This cave that I don't
think most people know

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:07.720
existed is really full of a lot
of life and great energy right

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.220
now.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.178
My only responsibility
now is just to make sure

00:02:10.178 --> 00:02:11.390
that no one dies.

ton of great videos about arts

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.288

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.930
So you love theme
park attractions.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:19.860
Cool story, bro.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.200

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.590
Not for me.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.006
It's called the Sky Tower, and
it's a free fall attraction

00:02:27.006 --> 00:02:28.250
at a theme park in Denmark.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:29.810
There is no safety cable.

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:34.020
Just a simple thin net to catch
your 55-mile-per-hour body.

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.202
-Geronimo!

00:02:36.202 --> 00:02:37.250
Oh!

-Holy god!

-Whoa!

00:02:43.714 --> 00:02:44.380
ALEX: Be honest.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:45.700
Would you really try this?

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:46.770
Like, really try this?

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.660

but after Beyonce put
this teaser on Instagram

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:00.470
over the weekend, the
internet's been buzzing.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.230

everywhere, all week,

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:03.820

the first trailer.

It dropped today, and
we got it for you.

00:03:07.116 --> 00:03:08.490
-To what do you
owe your success?

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:11.046
-I exercise control in
all things, Miss Steele.

JACOB SOBOROFF: The
book set the record

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.224
as the fastest-selling
paperback in history,

00:03:21.224 --> 00:03:23.306
and the trilogy sold more
than 100 million copies.

00:03:23.306 --> 00:03:25.130
The movie's coming out
on Valentine's Day.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:26.080
Is it going to live
up to the hype?

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.970

NIRVAN MULLICK:
"Caine's Arcade" is

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.630
a short film I made about
this nine-year-old boy.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.420
I pulled into this used
auto parts store in East LA,

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.850
and I met this boy named Caine.

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:39.370
And he had spent
the entire summer

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.260
building this really
elaborate arcade

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.960
using these cardboard boxes.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.344
Caine asked me to
play his games,

00:03:44.344 --> 00:03:45.760
and that's when I
learned I'd been

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.320
his first and only customer.

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.100
And that really
broke my heart, so we

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:52.990
decided to make a flash mob to
surprise Caine with customers.

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.911
-All these people came
here to play your arcade.

00:03:55.911 --> 00:03:57.160
Did you know they were coming?

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.350
-No.

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.220
-Are you ready to
run your arcade?

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.720
-Yeah.

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.380
-All right.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:02.810
What'd you guys come here to do?

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.660
-We came to play!

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:05.160
-Go ahead.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.620
Welcome to Caine's Arcade, man.

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.411
NIRVAN MULLICK: I've
always been interested

00:04:08.411 --> 00:04:10.675
in the intersection between
stories and social impact.

00:04:10.675 --> 00:04:12.050
It was just like,
what can we do?

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.720
How can we turn this response
into a bigger movement?

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.930
And so we started the
Imagination Foundation.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.720
After the night
of the flash mob,

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.589
Caine was going
home with his dad.

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:22.422
And his dad told me
that Caine turned to him

00:04:22.422 --> 00:04:24.295
and said that was the best
day of his whole life.

00:04:24.295 --> 00:04:24.930
Which was awesome.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.050
JACOB SOBOROFF: Thanks, Nirvan.

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.130

on just one topic.

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.291
This Saturday, it is all about
