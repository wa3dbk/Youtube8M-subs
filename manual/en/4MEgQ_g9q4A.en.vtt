00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.100
Hello Jacqueline!

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.880
How are you?

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.160
I feel fabulous!

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.340
I see you've created something with Pablo’s shirts

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.780
Oh yes! A lot of things !

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.000
But I told you to sew something for me!

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.000
Oh my God! Jacqueline, didn't you sleep well?

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.620
Or did you run out of concealer?

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:01.600
No! I have fallen off my high heels..

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:03.700
You're the only one whom I can tell it:

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.220
Yersterday, I met a really hot guy in the Fashion Café

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.640
But I didn't know he was practising SM!

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:10.360
A glass of water?

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.360
Hello! What can I do for you?

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:14.860
Hello, I’m looking for a cool bag

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.100
How about an "Every-Mood" Bag?

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:22.540
Look, you can change the pictures inside of the tags according to your taste or mood and the bag has two different sides

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.600
Ok, can you show me that one, please?

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.580
Sure

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.620
Cool idea!

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.700
I like it, I'll take it

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:37.420
With pleasure!

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.200
That'll be 70 euros, please

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:48.380
Here you go

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.300
Thanks!

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.340
Thank you so much! Goodbye, have a nice day!

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.380
Thanks, you too! See you soon!

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.880
I wanted to buy a "Every-Mood" Bag for Pablo as well!

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.480
And those fabulous pants, too!

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.940
Oh, I can't stand anymore! Show me what you’ve sewn for me !

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.560
Oh, I can't breath!

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.720
Oh, c’est génial!

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.440
Oh, oh!

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.580
Exactly what I wanted... Ahh!

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:18.980
What's that?

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.120
To us, the customer is King!

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.460
You mean, Princess!
