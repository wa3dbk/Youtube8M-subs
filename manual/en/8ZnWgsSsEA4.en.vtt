00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:05.900
Since ancient times
in India, Pakistan,

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.133
and many other nations,

00:00:07.133 --> 00:00:08.600
an important
part of a wedding,

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.000
or special celebration,

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.033
has been the adorning
of hands and feet

00:00:12.033 --> 00:00:14.400
with intricate
henna designs.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.333
Learning about
the tradition of Mehndi

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:19.400
is a great way to
introduce students

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.033
to Eastern
art and culture.

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:23.700
Plus it provides an
excellent lesson

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.133
in the design principles
of pattern, rhythm,

00:00:26.133 --> 00:00:27.433
and unity.

00:00:27.433 --> 00:00:29.867
Now here's a method that
allows students to practice

00:00:29.867 --> 00:00:33.600
Mehndi on their own hands,
without staining the skin.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.333
I've placed a latex glove
on my non-dominant hand,

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:40.700
and opened up a set of
permanent fine tipped markers.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.033
Traditional Mehndi
is done with henna,

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:45.300
so you could just draw
with the brown tones,

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.200
or you could do something
more colourful by using

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.167
a broad range of markers.

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:53.600
Depending on the region
the Mehndi artist is from,

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.233
designs may be
geometric, paisley,

00:00:56.233 --> 00:00:58.667
or represent natural forms.

00:00:58.667 --> 00:01:02.367
It's a little intimidating to
look at the intricacy

00:01:02.367 --> 00:01:03.900
and know where to begin,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.300
so here's a simple way
to approach it.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.300
Start with one small design,
and build it up in layers.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.733
Make eight or nine
small points

00:01:13.733 --> 00:01:16.433
on the front and back
sides of the glove.

00:01:16.433 --> 00:01:21.900
Choose one,
and create a radial design.

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:27.400
Repeat on the other side
of the glove.

00:01:31.533 --> 00:01:35.633
Move to the next point,
and make a different design.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.233
Now, from each of these,
extend the radial design,

00:01:42.233 --> 00:01:44.567
building around each point

00:01:44.567 --> 00:01:49.533
until the designs touch
each other and overlap.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.367
Make sure the ink
is completely dry,

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:54.900
and remove
the glove by rolling.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.400
It's fun to wear,
and it can be displayed

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.800
by stuffing with
polyester batting,

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.800
and then stretching
the wrist opening

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.767
over a repurposed lid
for a base.

00:02:08.767 --> 00:02:12.300
Black gloves are especially
stunning with opaque markers,

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.700
and if the glove is stuffed
prior to applying

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.033
the Mehndi designs,

00:02:16.033 --> 00:02:18.800
poster or paint markers
can be used.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.800
