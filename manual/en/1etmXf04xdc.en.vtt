Hi! I’m Nili Nathan with Expert Village.
Today I’m going to be showing you how to

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:11.110
make a basic fruit smoothie. It’s a good
smoothie to drink in the morning when most

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:18.100
of us want a little fruit. For your basic
fruit smoothie I’m going to use apples,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:25.140
because that’s something that most of you
can find across the country, apples. With

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:31.990
the vita mix blender, you don’t have to
remove the seeds. I just removed the stem

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.200
off the apples, but you keep the seeds because
there are nutrients in the seeds and I keep

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:46.130
the peel, I don’t peel it. Then what you
do is you just cut it in quarters like that.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:56.420
This is one whole apple. The strawberries,
you just remove the green part just like that.

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:06.650
These have been washed and rinsed of course.
I use organic food and vegetables. Next what

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:13.530
I’ve done is I’ve frozen bananas, you
peel the of course, and I just wrapped it

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.350
in some wax paper and put it in my freezer.
Now I have nice frozen bananas. This is a

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:28.970
real treat because it makes you feel like
you’re maybe having ice cream in your breakfast

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:37.369
smoothie. Then I cut it up like this. The
first thing you want to do is get your base,

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:43.140
whatever you decide. If you want to milk,
rice milk, juice, water. I’m going to use

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:49.520
unsweetened vanilla soy milk. I think the
vanilla would go with the bananas and the

00:01:49.520 --> 00:02:04.720
strawberries. I will measure about 2 cups.
This blender has the measurements in it already.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:18.120
Then I’ll put in my bananas and my apples.
I’m not going to use the whole apple now

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.499
that I see it in there. And some strawberries,
and if you want an extra boost of protein

00:02:24.499 --> 00:02:30.079
the morning, that’s always a good idea,
you can scoop out your protein powder or you

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:36.260
can use yogurt. I’m going to do a combination.
I like to use plain yogurt because the fruit

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:47.891
ones are high in sugar, so I’ll put 1, 2
little scoops of plain vanilla. I like to

00:02:47.891 --> 00:02:53.290
use the Greek style; it’s a little thicker
and richer, and makes everything taste good.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:03:02.400
I’m going to scoop out just a little protein
powder. This has 21 different vitamins and

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:09.069
minerals; it’s low fat and it’s low in
sodium. By the way, strawberries are low in

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:15.629
calories and very high in vitamin C. Bananas
have potassium and apples are a good source

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:24.019
of fiber. You put that in there. You know
if you want, you can put in your other supplements

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:32.719
like flax seeds or wheat germ, but I’m just
basically showing you a basic simple one for

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:43.989
people that just want something simple. Make
sure you put this top on. We always start

00:03:43.989 --> 00:04:01.939
on low and then work up with the dial. This
is from 1 to 10, so we work it up. Then work

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:16.879
it back down and that’s it. Now, let’s
sample this. Bananas and apples are pretty

00:04:16.879 --> 00:04:26.520
sweet so I don’t know if I want to add any
sweetener to it. For me, this is perfect just

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.699
the way it is, but if you want you can add
a little of the agave nectar that I talked

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:37.711
about before. This has half the calories of
sugar and half the carbohydrate; it’s natural,

00:04:37.711 --> 00:04:42.180
it comes from a cactus and it tastes a little
bit like maple syrup. You could put a teaspoon

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:48.990
in there or you can use the Sunrider stevia,
which is stevia natural comes from a plant

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:53.789
and it has zero calories and zero carbohydrates.
This is very good for diabetics. People with

00:04:53.789 --> 00:05:00.569
hypoglycemia may want to consider looking
into that. So there you have it. This delicious

00:05:00.569 --> 00:05:01.620
and I’m happy.
