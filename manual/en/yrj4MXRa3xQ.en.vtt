00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.120
Spiders are very important in sort of the
whole web of life. They are predators, so

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.820
they do eat other insects, other arthropods
that you perhaps would dislike more than spiders.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.640
It's thought that probably the spiders on
one acre of woodland could eat about 80 pounds

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:29.640
of insects in a year.

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:38.599
A spider is quite different from an insect.
Spiders have eight legs. They have two main

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.070
body parts, unlike an insect that has 
three body parts.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.560
This is the cephalothorax, which is a head
and thorax in one. And she has an abdomen

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:49.540
attached to that.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.490
And at the front, the things that also look
a bit like legs, but they're shorter - they

00:01:54.490 --> 00:02:02.290
are pedipalps. They're actually used for helping
her to hold onto her food. They also have

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.560
chemoreceptors on them so that she has a kind
of sense like smell and taste when she's exploring

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.640
her world.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.980
No. They're not out to attack you. A lot of
people are nervous of spiders, but the vast

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.970
majority of spiders are not dangerous to humans.
And most spiders want to get away from you.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:36.000
Out of more than 45,000 known species of spiders,
probably only about 200 species have venom

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.410
that could actually cause any problem to humans.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.340
The exhibit is called Spiders Alive!, basically
because we're going to have a lot of different

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.140
live spiders on exhibit for people to see.
We're going to have a demonstration area where

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:53.060
we're going to have several live spiders available
so that people can actually engage more with

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.890
the spiders and also get a chance to also
ask questions.

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:02.530
This is a Chilean Rose Hair Tarantula. We're
using the Chilean Rose Hairs for the demonstration

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:08.030
area because they are one of the most docile
species. This species of spider doesn't tend

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.810
to bite.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.069
Not all spiders make webs. All spiders have
the capacity to make silk. Even though the

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:24.800
tarantula is a hunter, they don't use a web
to catch prey. They do make silk and they

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.780
do use it to lay down silk lines as trails
and also to line their burrow.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.230
There are many species of spiders that do
use their webs. They build large webs to catch

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:40.790
their prey. Relatively few species make the
traditional Charlotte's Web shape of web.

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:46.379
A lot of webs are sort of three dimensional.
There are funnel web spiders, there are sheet

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.999
web spiders that just build their webs 
amongst the grass.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.920
So, they can look a lot of different shapes.
