00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:17.180
My husband and I were on vacation on the beach
in the Southwest part of Oahu.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.289
We were watching the TV news at 9 o’clock
at night and happened to see that there was

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.930
a tsunami – an earthquake and tsunami – in
Japan.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.660
They were saying it was about 6 hours until
the tsunami would hit Hawaii.

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.820
We looked up and down the beach there and
realized those other cabins were all kind

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:37.280
of dark and it was getting to be pretty late
and we realized they may not know what’s

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.530
going on.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.160
So we went down and started going knocking
on doors, my husband and I, and letting the

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.821
other people know what happened and they started
asking us immediately, ‘what do we do?’

00:00:47.821 --> 00:00:54.410
‘where do we go?’ and that’s when I
gave them a real quick disaster explanation

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:58.010
of what to do after a disaster like that,
what they needed to take with them and what

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.450
they needed to prepare.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:06.420
After a disaster happens, a lot of people
are not familiar with what to do and are not

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.320
as comfortable with what steps to take.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:20.120
When the storm was over, about 7 AM, at first
light in Houston, I got up, put on sturdy

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:25.100
shoes and a hard hat and I wanted to at least
see the damage around our house and knock

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.159
on the doors of a couple of our neighbors
to make sure they were okay, and it was great

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.619
to see that people who you really didn’t
have any feel for prior to this event, working

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:34.990
and acting as a community.

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:41.090
A pair of ladies that lived two doors down
the street from us, and they had an oak tree

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:42.909
that came straight through their living room.

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:46.770
They had water coming into the house because
of the rain that had occurred after and I

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.900
asked Terry to go back to the house because
we had three heavy duty blue tarps available.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.060
I said can you go grab two of the tarps, let’s
just give them to them and they can throw

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.270
on their roof because we knew we didn’t
have any roof damage.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.170
Sometimes it takes teams of people, teams
of neighbors, to do things that you and the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.170
people in your household can’t accomplish
on your own.
