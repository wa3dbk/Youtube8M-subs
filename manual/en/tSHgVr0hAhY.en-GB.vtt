00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.969
In this video we're going to look at how to
set up some basic sounds using just your guitar

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.280
and your amplifier. They're simple sounds
so it doesn't matter what your set up is,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.280
you should be able to get close to these sounds.
We'll start with a clean sound. &lt;Music&gt;

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.890
So for a tone like that we've set our gain to
mid way on a clean channel. Obviously it's

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.570
got to be a clean channel, it's a clean sound.
The gain you can alter anywhere between sort of

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.040
lowish, you know, sort of two or three, up
to sort of three quarters. Basically you don't

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.000
want to engage too much crunch for this so
we'll keep it roughly mid way. That's perfect

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.830
for us. The volume you can do to taste. The
volume shouldn't have too much effect on the

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.530
sound so if you turn it up it's just to affect
the, the volume &lt;music&gt; and not to affect

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:03.170
the actual tone. &lt;Music&gt; Should sound the
same however you adjust it. Now the EQ here

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.760
we've set, it's actually a very very simple
set up, all just around slightly

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.219
above mid way really. So bass, mid and treble,
just slightly above mid way. It's a really

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:21.219
simple sound. Really just letting the sound
of the guitar come through. &lt;Music&gt;

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:29.509
Now you can adjust that to get a jazzier sound. So
all you'd need to do would be to adjust the

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:35.640
treble control. Sort of down to a really really
low level will give you a warm sound.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:40.140
You may want to tweak the mid range a little if
you like and even perhaps raise the bass but

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:45.159
most important is just to go down to the treble
sound. Now most important for a jazz sound

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:52.159
is that you engage the neck pick up on your
guitar. And let's have a listen &lt;music&gt;.

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:59.939
Much warmer sound ideally suited to jazz. To set
up a British style blues rock sound you're

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:04.749
going to need to use an overdrive channel
on your amp. Now this amp has a channel switch

00:02:04.749 --> 00:02:07.749
just here to do the job. Here's how it sounds
&lt;music&gt;.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:22.890
So in terms of the settings we've got the gain set fairly low. So we're just stood around number two, two or three on there,

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.459
you may need to adjust this depending on how
your amp sounds. You may need to go a little

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.680
higher or even a little lower. But the main
thing with this sound is that the gain is

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:37.370
actually surprisingly low. So err on the side
of low gain rather than high. Use less than you think.

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.989
The volume we've just set purely
for volume purposes. It's not having very much

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.450
effect on the tone, so we're really just using
that to get it as loud or as soft as we want.

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:52.390
In terms of the EQ, reasonably straight forward.
We actually haven't gone too far away from

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.000
the middle position settings, so the bass
we've set right in the middle. You may find

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.870
if you haven't got quite such a big meaty
speaker cabinet as we're using, you might

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:06.670
want to use a little bit more bass to get
a similar tone. And in terms of middle and

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.959
treble we've just set those a little way past
the middle, a little bit of extra boost there

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:18.360
and that'll help you cut through and give
you a slightly more cutting sound. Use your

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.569
own ears to decide that, you know you may
find you'll be ok around the mid way position,

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.290
you may need a little less, it'll depend on
how your amp sounds. Same with the treble,

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:30.939
you know, if you're not quite cutting through,
you know, you may find a little bit of extra

00:03:30.939 --> 00:03:35.459
treble helps. But don't worry you know, just
have a listen to your own amp. It'll inevitably

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:42.090
sound different from this amp. So tweak it
using your own ears. Another set up you can

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:48.129
use is a, is a high gain sound. Several amps
will have a specific channel for that and

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:59.000
this one, this one's shown with the red light.
So here's an example of how it sounds first of all &lt;music&gt;.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.000
So it's quite a, as you can
hear, high gain sound suitable for, for heavy

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.840
metal and shred sounds really. We've set up
what's known as a scooped sound. So this,

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.250
this refers to the mid range setting of the
EQ. And you'll notice that it's quite a lot

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:19.220
lower than the bass and treble. The idea is
that starting with those as your reference

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:24.430
position, starting mid way, moving it right
down low is called scooping out the mid range

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:31.430
and that gives your classic sort of thrash
era distortion sound. Gain wise, notice the

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:36.690
gain isn't actually that high, we're only
at sort of four or five, barely mid way, but

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.290
the reason for that is we're on a distortion
channel on the amplifier so the amp's already

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.830
doing a lot of work as you may even be able
to hear a little bit of hiss coming through.

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:51.830
That's because the amp's just, this channel's
basically running very hot already.

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:59.310
So back to the EQ then, we've got the middle set quite
low for the classic scooped. Bass and treble

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.480
are traditionally quite high on a scooped
sound. But this amp is so well suited to heavy

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:10.070
metal tones and shred sounds that we actually
haven't had to boost the bass very much or

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:16.400
the treble. You may find that your amp needs
more gain, more bass, more treble, so you

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:21.410
could save, you could try to save this setting,
you could try a bit more gain, a bit more

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:27.280
bass, a bit more treble and a bit more, a
bit less rather, on the middle setting.

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:32.650
We don't really need that on this amp, it's perfectly
suited to metal sounds. So we can get away

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:39.650
with a lower gain and a slightly more easy
setting on the bass, treble and middle.

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:43.350
But do experiment with your own amplifier to find
the optimum settings.
