00:00:00.187 --> 00:00:02.102
- Hello, hi, what's up?

00:00:02.102 --> 00:00:03.983
Here's the truth, I have been craving,

00:00:03.983 --> 00:00:05.887
craving, craving

00:00:05.887 --> 00:00:07.849
to blog or vlog or whatever
you want to call it.

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:09.904
You know what makes me
upset, really upset,

00:00:09.904 --> 00:00:11.646
frustrated beyond belief?

00:00:11.646 --> 00:00:13.200
It's not even that big of a deal really,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.168
when you think about it.

00:00:14.168 --> 00:00:16.489
When people are like, "I'm
going to blog or vlog,

00:00:16.489 --> 00:00:18.729
"and I'm just going to talk and record."

00:00:18.729 --> 00:00:20.227
But that's what I'm doing right now,

00:00:20.227 --> 00:00:21.097
that's what I'm doing.

00:00:21.097 --> 00:00:22.653
So if you just are not wanting to watch,

00:00:22.653 --> 00:00:24.871
Git, git, git along, git.

00:00:24.871 --> 00:00:26.751
I haven't made a video in a long time,

00:00:26.751 --> 00:00:27.889
and I guess part of me is like,

00:00:27.889 --> 00:00:29.337
don't make a half-assed
video if you don't have

00:00:29.337 --> 00:00:30.637
anything to talk about, you know?

00:00:30.637 --> 00:00:31.692
But I just want to make a video.

00:00:31.707 --> 00:00:34.031
Like I'm sick of being,
like I don't feel up-to-par.

00:00:34.031 --> 00:00:35.528
'Cause I kind of don't feel up-to-par,

00:00:35.528 --> 00:00:37.270
but I want to make a
video and I'm just like,

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.872
you know, this isn't
good enough for people.

00:00:38.872 --> 00:00:40.067
But I don't think that's how it should be,

00:00:40.067 --> 00:00:40.842
so I'm going to make a video.

00:00:40.842 --> 00:00:42.088
I'm going to make a video.

00:00:42.119 --> 00:00:43.141
I'm makin' a video.

00:00:43.141 --> 00:00:45.791
I hope nobody comes knockin'
because I'm makin' a video.

00:00:45.791 --> 00:00:48.809
So it is Spring semester and
I am taking more classes,

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:49.840
I'm just living it up.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:50.962
Check that out.

00:00:50.962 --> 00:00:52.466
♫ And all I know is

00:00:52.466 --> 00:00:55.494
♫ Everything's gonna be alright ♫

00:00:55.494 --> 00:00:57.876
American Idol starts tonight, so you know,

00:00:57.876 --> 00:00:58.991
the world's so fine.

00:00:58.991 --> 00:01:01.173
Top 10 things that are good
about living on the first floor:

00:01:01.173 --> 00:01:04.214
I can see all the cuties
with booties walkin' on by.

00:01:04.214 --> 00:01:06.872
Shoot girl, shoot.

00:01:07.788 --> 00:01:08.708
Anyway,

00:01:08.708 --> 00:01:11.587
look at these lines on
my forehead, oh my god!

00:01:11.587 --> 00:01:14.378
Did you notice my new
glasses, these are new.

00:01:14.378 --> 00:01:15.871
Yeah, yuck (gag)

00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:17.508
That's what I look like without glasses?

00:01:17.508 --> 00:01:18.524
It's not a pretty look,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.764
I'm just going to tell you right now.

00:01:19.764 --> 00:01:20.625
It's not, it's not good.

00:01:20.625 --> 00:01:23.664
♫ Everything's gonna be alright ♫

00:01:23.664 --> 00:01:26.412
See, this is why I don't
blog or vlog or whatever.

00:01:26.412 --> 00:01:28.234
See, now I'm just one
of them, I'm one of them

00:01:28.234 --> 00:01:29.261
and I don't know what to call it.

00:01:29.261 --> 00:01:31.126
This is why I don't sit
in front of my computer

00:01:31.126 --> 00:01:32.774
and record, but I think I'm
going to do it more often

00:01:32.774 --> 00:01:35.233
because it's fun and it's stress free,

00:01:35.233 --> 00:01:35.933
and you know what?

00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:37.195
That's what I need in my life.

00:01:37.195 --> 00:01:38.716
So I'm starting classes
for Spring semester

00:01:38.716 --> 00:01:39.795
and one of my teacher was like,

00:01:39.795 --> 00:01:41.911
"So if you guys catch
anyone cheating during class

00:01:41.911 --> 00:01:43.188
"feel free to shoot them in the face.

00:01:43.188 --> 00:01:45.429
"I'll supply weapons at
the beginning of the test."

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:46.775
I was like.

00:01:46.775 --> 00:01:50.490
I got some dark-washed jeans,
they're so hot right now,

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.650
so hot, just on fire.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:53.927
I'm just so into them.

00:01:53.927 --> 00:01:56.962
So I decided to take the
Greyhound 13 hours up north

00:01:56.962 --> 00:01:59.766
for New Year's, which by
the way, is not a good idea.

00:01:59.766 --> 00:02:01.450
I am this positive that I saw somebody

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:02.425
getting a hand job.

00:02:02.425 --> 00:02:03.969
Could be wrong, they could have just

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:05.548
been applying a moisturizer of some sort,

00:02:05.548 --> 00:02:07.191
I'm not quite sure, but I digress.

00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:08.386
What am I vlogging about?

00:02:08.386 --> 00:02:10.035
I think I just hate the term vlogging,

00:02:10.035 --> 00:02:11.963
can I just talk without it being vlogging?

00:02:11.963 --> 00:02:14.226
Can I just talk into a
camera and have it be

00:02:14.226 --> 00:02:16.233
a little bit normal.

00:02:16.328 --> 00:02:19.228
Like is that not normal?

00:02:19.784 --> 00:02:21.045
(sighs)
