[BRUCE NAUMAN: TEACHERS &amp; ARTISTS]

00:00:20.783 --> 00:00:23.371
I’d worked with people around here with horses,

00:00:23.371 --> 00:00:27.139
but they didn’t really understand how to explain things very well.

00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:29.804
So the first person I worked with

00:00:29.804 --> 00:00:33.770
that changed my whole understanding of working with horses

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.571
was a man named Ray Hunt.

00:00:37.106 --> 00:00:38.655
He is just an old cowboy,

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:41.443
and so cowboys trust him.

00:00:41.693 --> 00:00:45.143
But he can outride them all and do it in such a wonderful way.

00:00:45.324 --> 00:00:47.495
He taught me to pay attention to the horses

00:00:47.495 --> 00:00:50.236
and gave me some tools, of course, to do that.

00:00:50.402 --> 00:00:53.264
He was a teacher that really didn’t tell you how to do much,

00:00:53.264 --> 00:00:55.265
he just made you pay attention.

00:00:55.465 --> 00:00:58.065
And when you met him,

00:00:58.065 --> 00:01:00.341
you knew you couldn’t fool him.

00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:01.263
[LAUGHS]

00:01:01.263 --> 00:01:02.762
He knew what you knew.

00:01:08.692 --> 00:01:10.428
In riding horses, for instance,

00:01:10.428 --> 00:01:13.122
you can get around bad spots all the time,

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:15.134
and the horse will put up with it.

00:01:15.134 --> 00:01:16.833
And then sometimes they won’t

00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:18.693
and then you end up in the dirt.

00:01:18.693 --> 00:01:20.739
But Ray could always go right to the spot

00:01:20.739 --> 00:01:23.575
that you didn’t even want to have to hear about.

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.200
And a good teacher can always do that.

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.414
And if you want to learn it, that’s what you have to do.

00:01:36.802 --> 00:01:41.436
A good teacher is like a good artist.

00:01:41.669 --> 00:01:45.434
They go right to the most difficult part of whatever's going on--

00:01:45.434 --> 00:01:47.170
the painting or the sculpture--

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.000
and goes right to that spot.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.200
["Model" (1998)]

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.801
I knew how to do that in my work, or hoped I did,

00:01:53.801 --> 00:01:56.065
and I didn’t know how to do that with horses.

00:01:56.065 --> 00:01:57.634
I didn’t see the connection.

00:01:59.831 --> 00:02:04.002
When I was in school, Wayne Thiebaud was teaching and I was his teaching assistant--

00:02:04.002 --> 00:02:05.433
and that’s what Wayne did,

00:02:05.433 --> 00:02:07.927
he taught people how to pay attention.

00:02:08.027 --> 00:02:10.002
That's what I saw in him,

00:02:10.002 --> 00:02:14.540
was that he showed you how to pay attention to what you were doing--

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.895
what was out there.

00:02:15.895 --> 00:02:20.771
And that's...I think it’s a rare, rare thing, you know.
