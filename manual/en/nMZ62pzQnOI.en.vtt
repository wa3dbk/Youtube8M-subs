00:00:02.794 --> 00:00:04.370
The Testimony of the Qur'an

00:00:04.728 --> 00:00:06.574
Several passages of the Qur'an,

00:00:06.785 --> 00:00:08.629
would not make sense,

00:00:08.736 --> 00:00:13.604
if it was a corruption of the text itself:

00:00:13.838 --> 00:00:15.122
For example,

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:18.250
"Oh People of the Book!" we are told in Surat ul Mayedah,

00:00:18.344 --> 00:00:19.565
aya 68,

00:00:19.639 --> 00:00:20.723
"O People of the Book!

00:00:20.793 --> 00:00:22.432
ye have no ground to stand upon ,

00:00:22.576 --> 00:00:24.468
unless ye stand fast by the Law,

00:00:24.604 --> 00:00:25.395
the Gospel,

00:00:25.508 --> 00:00:29.154
and all the revelation that has come to you from our Lord."

00:00:29.962 --> 00:00:31.956
This would not make sense,

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:33.426
if there had been,

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.870
tahrif bil lafz,

00:00:35.978 --> 00:00:37.340
the corruption of the text.

00:00:37.428 --> 00:00:40.854
in Ayat 47 of Suratul Mayedah we read

00:00:40.932 --> 00:00:43.405
"let the people of the Gospels judge

00:00:43.483 --> 00:00:47.116
by what God has revealed therein."

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:48.898
This exhortation ,

00:00:49.004 --> 00:00:50.518
would not be possible,

00:00:50.677 --> 00:00:53.405
if the text was corrupted,

00:00:53.515 --> 00:00:55.574
...we read in Surat Yunus,

00:00:55.635 --> 00:00:57.444
ayat 94,

00:00:57.543 --> 00:00:58.382
"if thou,

00:00:58.446 --> 00:00:59.820
[Muhammad that is],

00:00:59.884 --> 00:01:03.893
were in doubt as to what we have revealed unto thee,

00:01:04.058 --> 00:01:08.379
then ask those who have been reading the Book from before you,

00:01:08.458 --> 00:01:09.820
the People of the Book."

00:01:09.901 --> 00:01:10.595
If,

00:01:10.676 --> 00:01:14.268
the people of the Book had in their hand a text

00:01:14.338 --> 00:01:17.600
that was corrupted and not reliable at all,

00:01:17.724 --> 00:01:18.817
this exhortation ,

00:01:18.928 --> 00:01:21.240
would not make sense,

00:01:21.344 --> 00:01:22.382
whatsoever.

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:25.372
The Qurâ€™an itself attests that,

00:01:25.513 --> 00:01:28.061
though people can twist the meaning,

00:01:28.146 --> 00:01:30.926
they cannot actually alter it,

00:01:30.984 --> 00:01:33.935
and cause it to be lost..

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:37.088
It says in Surat Yunus, ayah 64,

00:01:37.145 --> 00:01:41.846
"there is no changing of the Words of Allah,

00:01:41.971 --> 00:01:44.888
that is the Supreme Triumph"

00:01:44.996 --> 00:01:46.319
La tabdilah,

00:01:46.428 --> 00:01:48.210
la Kalimat-hi Allahi thalikah

00:01:48.403 --> 00:01:51.876
huwa al-faouzi al azeemu,

00:01:51.973 --> 00:01:54.701
That is a very strong text,

00:01:54.806 --> 00:01:55.585
telling us,

00:01:55.699 --> 00:01:57.399
that there is no changing,

00:01:57.504 --> 00:01:58.987
no possibility ,

00:01:59.081 --> 00:02:01.670
of changing the Words of Allah.

00:02:01.766 --> 00:02:03.906
since the original ,

00:02:03.994 --> 00:02:05.234
Taurat ,

00:02:05.325 --> 00:02:06.418
and Zabur ,

00:02:06.495 --> 00:02:07.919
and Injil ,

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.930
are said ,

00:02:09.026 --> 00:02:12.840
in the Qur'an that they are the word of God,

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.036
then like the Qur'an they must be preserved and remain eternally,

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:20.285
for they have both the same status.

00:02:20.376 --> 00:02:21.705
Notice that what it says,

00:02:21.811 --> 00:02:23.622
and this is very very important,

00:02:23.713 --> 00:02:24.969
my friends.,

00:02:25.091 --> 00:02:30.852
it says that "this is the supreme triumph of Allah".

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:32.356
It tells us very clearly,

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:35.339
"Huwa Al faouzu al Azeemu",

00:02:35.444 --> 00:02:36.459
which means,

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.709
the most exellent,

00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:40.737
the most majestic triumph,

00:02:40.842 --> 00:02:42.487
victory of Allah,

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:44.386
is that he is capable,

00:02:44.493 --> 00:02:48.132
of preserving his Word.
