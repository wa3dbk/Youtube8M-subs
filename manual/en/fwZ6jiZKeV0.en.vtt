00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.233
This is the completely new Global Map.

00:00:07.333 --> 00:00:15.633
This is the huge play area where clans fight hard for global domination and gold, all this in a turn-based strategy mode.

00:00:15.867 --> 00:00:19.900
There are now more provinces, and it is easier to land on the map.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.567
Earn influence, purchase Divisions, capture new territories, and move on to victory.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.167
The Global Map has undergone serious transformations.

00:00:33.267 --> 00:00:38.767
Help messages will tell players everything about all the interface elements and nuances of the game.

00:00:38.867 --> 00:00:43.467
Now it isn’t just clans with high-tier vehicles that can fight on the Global Map.

00:00:43.567 --> 00:00:47.533
There are Fronts for Tier VI, VIII and X battles.

00:00:47.633 --> 00:00:51.567
Fronts are groups of provinces with the same economic settings.

00:00:51.733 --> 00:00:57.233
They correspond to Medium, Champion, and Absolute Divisions in Stronghold Skirmishes.

00:01:00.067 --> 00:01:04.200
In Global Map mode, a new currency has been introduced: influence.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:10.800
You can earn it in two ways: destroying enemy forces on the map and participating in Stronghold Skirmishes.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.833
You can’t earn influence in Battles for Strongholds.

00:01:13.933 --> 00:01:20.033
You can accumulate an unlimited amount of influence, and plan long-term operations using it.

00:01:20.533 --> 00:01:24.000
The changes have also affected the ways to land on the Global Map.

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.867
Now, besides the usual landing, you can participate in auctions and land in any province you choose.

00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:36.133
To do this, a clan must participate in a landing auction. The winner is determined by whoever has the highest bid.

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:41.000
Everyone that loses the auction gets their bid back, and the winner can land on the province.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.933
If this province was attacked by land, then the auction winner fights according to the tournament rules along with other challengers.

00:01:49.567 --> 00:01:54.900
In place of the usual chips, which were tied to the number of players in the clan, there are now Divisions.

00:01:55.033 --> 00:02:01.867
They are fully equipped battle units which are not affected by the number of clan members, and they are used for capturing provinces.

00:02:01.967 --> 00:02:08.167
They can’t be stored and are linked to a province. There can only be one Division on each province.

00:02:08.267 --> 00:02:10.867
And you can only move it once per turn.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:16.133
Depending on the actions you choose for the Division, its status is displayed on the map.

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.400
In addition, for each Division there are up to three boosters of two types: strategic and combat.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.867
The strategic boosters are: “Aerial Reconnaissance Squadron” which increases the Division’s view range,

00:02:28.967 --> 00:02:33.033
and “Chemical Defense Battalion”, protecting you from the enemy reconnaissance.

00:02:33.133 --> 00:02:39.233
The combat boosters are: “Bomber Squadron” which allows you to use Airstrike with parameters suitable for the Front;

00:02:39.333 --> 00:02:43.767
and “Artillery Battalion” which allows you to use an Artillery Strike.

00:02:44.567 --> 00:02:48.000
We plan to improve the boosters and make more in the future.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:51.933
To purchase a Division, you need to establish the Headquarters in a province.

00:02:52.033 --> 00:02:57.900
After that, the province starts to generate income, which is affected by the clan’s ELO rating.

00:02:58.167 --> 00:03:01.600
The more battles the clan members win, the higher the income.

00:03:01.867 --> 00:03:04.700
Therefore, the clan can raise the province’s income.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.133
It’s easy.

00:03:06.367 --> 00:03:11.833
And finally, there will be regular seasons, with time restrictions and different conditions.

00:03:12.033 --> 00:03:16.300
During a season, various game events will take place in separate Fronts.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.533
Players will get various awards from winning events.

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:22.667
This is an intense and interesting game mode.

00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:27.467
Win or lose? It’s up to you. Challenge the World!

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.200

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.600
