ALAN MARK LIGHTNER: Hi. I'm Alan Lightner
with Expert Village, and we're talking about

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:11.650
playing steelpans and fitting in to various
musical situations or various musical ensembles.

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.699
We've talked about playing with a steel band
in a traditional setup. We've talked about

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:22.859
playing possibly with even an orchestra in
a very non-traditional setup. Another non-traditional

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:31.689
but more and more common ensemble that steeldrummers
find themselves involved with is a--could

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:38.800
be a jazz combo or, depending upon the music
you're listening to, jazz or rock or folk.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:47.140
It could be anything. Any kind of small bands
that you, as a steelpan player, maybe the

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:53.641
leader of. You may lead an ensemble with a
bass and a guitar and a drum set player for

00:00:53.641 --> 00:01:01.859
instance or a keyboard player, kind of a more
"traditionally" jazz or rock setup. But how

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.729
do you fit in as a steelpan player? If you
are leading that kind of ensemble, first of

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.560
all you're going to be the one playing most
of the melodies. Your range of your instrument,

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.560
this instrument right here, the double seconds,
has a range from low E, this particular instrument

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:28.200
from low E on up to notes that I hardly ever
played to the high E flat. I rarely play those

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:35.100
notes, 'cause just because they don't sing
that much. I'll play on up to--well, you'll

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:46.450
never where I may end up, but it got about
3-1/2 octaves. So knowing that range, what

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:55.030
you will find out is playing in a traditional
setup--traditionally jazz or a pop setup,

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:02.850
your notes in this range down here will often
get covered up by the guitar player or the

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:10.270
pianist. These, the lower notes that sound
so good, those lower notes that sound so good

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:17.900
often get covered up. You're going to want
to concentrate on some of those higher notes

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:30.870
that may cut through the band that may be
able to be heard.

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.340
Unless the band is very quiet, you're not
going to hear those notes way down there.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:39.110
Those note are going to be too low to be heard.
So these are the little things that you should

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.940
be aware of when you're trying to play and
compete with the guitar player and the pianist

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.569
as opposed to people that are used to playing
just with the steelpan.
