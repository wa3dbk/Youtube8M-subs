00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:12.129
Religion and identity intertwine in the eyes
of many Thedosians, whether their own practice

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:19.129
or the practices of others. Some values dissociate
with the everyday livelihoods of its followers,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:25.289
while others' constantly interject. Whether
life is managed by deity or unknown force,

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:30.060
Thedosians attach themselves to finding out
what they don't know or allow others to tell

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.250
them how to live.
Elves were first to populate Thedas. It is

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:42.379
unknown how long civilization spanned before
the Quickening, but for years they believed

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:49.379
in a pantheon of gods. The world was created
by Mythal, the All-Mother god of justice,

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.920
and Elgar'nan, the All-Father god of vengeance.
Other gods embody different values and roles,

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:05.600
like Dirthamen: the God of Knowledge. Fen'Harel,
the Dread-Wolf and trickster god. According

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:11.180
to the Dalish, before the fall of the Elven
city Arlathan, the pantheon fell victim in

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:17.840
a fight against another set of gods called
the Forgotten Ones. In an attempt to rob both

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:24.840
sides of Arlathan, Fen'Harel locked all other
gods away and left the Elves to their fate.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:31.780
The Quickening happened shortly after, ridding
the Elves of their immortality. Whether true

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.250
or simply a story, the only remains of the
pantheon exist in old statues and lingering

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.250
Dalish stories. If these gods exist, they
have been silent for centuries. However, the

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:48.199
Dalish continue to revere them even today.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.159
Humankind first believed in seven dragon deities

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.770
called the Old Gods. Before Tevinter was a
formal nation, mages called Dreamers were

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:09.539
capable of accessing the Fade at will. The
Old God Dumat began speaking directly and

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.080
teaching blood magic to the Dreamers. In response,
temples everywhere raised up to worship the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:23.319
Old Gods. Later, Dumat reportedly promised
the Dreamers the Golden City, a City of light

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:29.560
that extends beyond the Fade. Those magisters
in turn enacted a blood ritual on a massive

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.810
scale to physically enter the Fade, the first
successful attempt known, and reached the

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:42.550
City. But Dumat betrayed them, turning the
magisters into the first Darkspawn. Afterwards,

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.850
worship of the Old Gods diminished.

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.680
The Chantry tells us. The Chantry decrees.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:59.110
The Chantry speaks many things and, as the
largest faith in Thedas, is now the central

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.110
power known to civilization. It follows the
lessons of Andraste, a woman who rose up against

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:13.540
the corruption of magic. Mankind's pride,
or rather the pride of mages, caused the Darkspawn

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:19.980
threat. If the world bands together in the
name of peace, the Maker will supposedly return

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.269
to the world and craft it into a paradise.
Or so the Chantry says, as its martyr Andraste

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:32.330
fueled the belief that the Maker was the one
true god. Since the time of Andraste, the

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:39.189
Chantry has extended its reach. Becoming the
most powerful organization in Thedas, it offers

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:47.009
humanitarian aid for the poor and sick, teaches
and manages mages, and engages its own magic-policing

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:54.010
military. The Andrastian Chantry is the most
widely known and influential religion.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:04.829
Instead of revering gods, Dwarves trust in
the might of their own hand, the accomplishments

00:04:04.829 --> 00:04:11.450
of Dwarves that came before them, and the
Stone. The earth, rich of minerals, gems,

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:18.450
and lyrium, is the Stone and any actions Dwarves
take will affect her. If a person acts for

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:25.500
good of civilization, the Stone strengthens.
Paragons, ancestors and the living who have

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:32.500
advanced civilization through their craft,
are the best examples. If a Dwarf shames themselves,

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.360
the Stone weakens. Dwarves believe that at
death, all Dwarves who have lived for the

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.440
Stone will return to it.

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.200
Everyone has a place and duty. The Qun is

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:52.750
a religion focused on order, started by philosopher
Koslun, who emphasized mastery and balance

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.750
are the true principles of life. In giving
up freedoms, one will find peace in order.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:07.220
Qunari of Par Vollen follow devotedly, participating
in society that is separated by three heads

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:14.220
called the Triumvirate. The Arigena leads
everyday affairs in mercantile and production.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:22.860
The Ariqun manages Qunari roles in society.
The Arishok leads the military, safeguarding

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:29.840
all Qunari. With recent events like the Kirkwall
occupation showing the danger of the Qun,

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.720
Thedosians will soon have to face a very real
threat.

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:40.810
In present day, Thedosians are at a standstill.
With the rise of an unknown entity named the

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:47.160
Elder One, more citizens lose their identity
in faith. While difficult for those who have

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.870
followed their respective religion for so
many years, it may be time to find truth to

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:58.730
the realities of Thedas's past. But that-
is a story for another dayâ€¦
