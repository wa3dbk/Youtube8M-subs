00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:06.020
Part of our sport requires that a rider know
how to go in select the correct cow bring

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.530
it out and get it singled all by itself. Our
rider happens to have an easy right there

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.679
we have decided that we are going to get the
number three cow with the horn's. All she

00:00:15.679 --> 00:00:20.430
needs to know is what we had learned in our
previous segment about how to put pressure

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.160
on the cow and ask it to come on out. By maneuvering
our horse in between the cow and the heard

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.910
and continuing to push on it. We will have
her turn around now and go in and try and

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.400
get one that's just a little bit more difficult.
She will select a cow that makes her go into

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.400
the heard in what we call you want to kind
of slice it right down the middle. Deciding

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:45.240
which way do I want to send that cow. I am
going to try to hold the heard with just one

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.800
person that might be a little bit difficult
but my job is to keep that heard form wanting

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.720
to go bust or getting out of the, of the boundaries
we have set. Cows want to return to where

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:01.149
they came from so as she goes into get her
cow she's trying to keep just the pressure

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:06.930
on the one cow that she's after. So if she
was going after the black cow and she was

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.620
able to successfully get it out. We just didn't
hold the heard as well as we would like to.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.460
All of those skills about working a cow are
what make this part just as successful as

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.520
learning to track and control it. We will
go ahead and get one more cow and see if we

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.150
can bring that one out. When we go into get
the cow we are thinking about the cow and

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:33.680
you put pressure on your good cow. Pressure
is almost magical to me. It means that the

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:43.330
rider is just keep her eyes, her horse on
one particular cow as the rest of them stay

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.500
back in with the heard. So we got that cow
out pretty successfully just losing one in

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:55.190
the process. Most of the time we might have
two or three what we call turn backs or heard

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.810
settlers. That make this just a little bit
easier and organized.
