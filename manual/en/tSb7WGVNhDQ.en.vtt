Hi! I'm Karl James owner of Creolesoul catering
in Round Rock, Texas on behalf of Expert Village

00:00:07.769 --> 00:00:14.129
I'm here to show you craw fish etouffee. Okay
we have added our vegetables in here our holly

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:20.050
trinity, plus the garlic we have got that
to kind of soften up or sweat a little bit.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.090
So now we are going to add our tomatoes and
also if you notice with the tomatoes I have

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.760
added the chop Serrano peppers that is going
to give us some heat. So I just dump those

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:36.710
tomatoes in there mix it around gently because
you don't want the tomatoes to just break

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.989
up. Get the tomatoes in. Now we are going
to add 2 cups we are going to use chicken

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:52.800
stock here but if you really want to if you
can find live craw fish if you save the tail

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:01.850
and the head you can actually make your craw
fish stock out of that or the same thing with

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.860
any seafood. Like when you buy shrimp if you
want to clean your shrimp and keep the shells

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:14.820
and stuff and you put that with a few herbs
and spices and bring it to a boil and simmer

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.750
for a while you can make your own shrimp stock.
The same thing with fish bones making them

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.890
fish stock but right we are using chicken
broth that you can use and we would get that

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:38.830
mixed up in there and I'm going to use a whisk
here to make sure I got that roux and liquid

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:47.960
all mixed together. So there you have we are
going to let this simmer for a while. We are

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:57.440
going to add in a couple of bay leaves, a
little seasoning and then we would mix that

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:12.170
around get that all mixed in and you would
bring this up to a small boil and then cover,

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:19.030
turn the heat down and then let it simmer
for about oh 10-15 minutes and we would check

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:26.040
on it and you should see that with the roux
and stuff it should start to thicken. If it

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:34.349
is to thick you can add a little more stock
or a little more water. If it is to thin what

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:41.170
you do then is take a couple of teaspoon of
flour and dissolve in some water and then

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:49.010
slowly add to the mixture. Once it comes to
a boil it would start to heat up and thicken

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:57.510
your sauce. So right now we are just going
to let this come to a medium boil, cover it

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.709
and let it simmer for about 15 minutes and
we would move on from there.
