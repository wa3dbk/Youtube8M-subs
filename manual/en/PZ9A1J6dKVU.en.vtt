00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.260
Now we're going to hang our puppet theater
curtain. You want to choose a coordinating

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:13.369
fabric, and you want to cut a make a curtain
that's almost exactly the same size as the

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:21.690
window, but a half inch longer than the window
in the puppet theater. Now I'm using a jersey-type

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.180
material that when you cut it, it doesn't
fray, so that's a good choice. You can also

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.041
you can make a curtain if you sew, you can
trim it nicely also, but if you're not a sewer

00:00:34.041 --> 00:00:41.470
you can just find a fabric that that works
with cutting and without trimming it, and

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:49.480
the jersey tends to work good. A weave will
fray. So once you have your curtain cut, we're

00:00:49.480 --> 00:01:02.110
going to cut it in half. So we can fold that
in half, like that, and then we'll cut it

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:15.760
right down the fold, so that we have two curtain
panels. Now you want to turn your puppet theater

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:30.120
over, like this, and we're going to staple
the curtain in place so check to make sure

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.010
that you have your curtain, you're going to
see the back side of it now, and just lay

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:45.490
it on that inside frame right there. And we
will staple it in place, you can glue that

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:56.210
in place.
You can put 3 to 4 staples in here to hold

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:11.920
the curtain.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.360
And then put the other panel and staple that
in place in the same way.
