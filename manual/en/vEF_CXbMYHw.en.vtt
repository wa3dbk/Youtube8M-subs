00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.000
Aura of food products.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:15.000
Can you talk a little about auras of different products that we eat, for example flour, fried food -- have you seen something like that?

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Usually I do not, but when I focus, I can sense, not see aura with eyes since I do not need it, but I can feel.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
In general, it looks like this.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
When you are in a forest and fruits / plants are there,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:47.000
they have luminous-yellow-golden-silver-blue colors around them

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.000
-- if we translate it to aura, I am now translating my feelings to aura, how it looks for them.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.000
When you take them and eat, then this colorful light spreads on you,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.000
more in case of fruits, less when you eat plants.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.000
There more processed is the plant/fruit then its life --

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:16.000
because what we see as aura is manifestation of life in this fruit or plant --

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.000
there more this thing is processed, the less life light is visible.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.000
Let's say we take a pear,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:28.000
it is lovely, beautiful, perfectly fitted to your body, 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.000
it has beautiful aura and is full of energy, it's almost burning your hand.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.000
When you throw it in boiling water, later take out the cooked pear -- look at it ... dead.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
When we take grains of crops or of grass, because crops are genetically modified grass.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
When we take grains of grass that we consume, 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
when they fall to ground, we pick up them,
look, they are full of pulsing life.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.000
But when you grind them, you can notice there is less life in them.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:10.000
Next when you bake bread -- it's completely dead nature.
It's more dead than sand or a stone.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
I have noticed that the more processed is something, there more dead it becomes.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:22.000
Thus the most dead and harmful food are those baked in high temperature,

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:28.000
that is French fries, chips, pizza, doughnuts etc.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
On the other hand, the fullest of life are fruits directly taken from trees, when they are mellow,

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000
or pick up from ground when the've fallen from trees.
