00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.529
Lenovo builds a projector into the Yoga Tablet
2 Pro

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.210
Lenovo has made some minor updates to its
8-inch and 10-inch Yoga 2 tablets , changing

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.389
the kickstand design and adding a Windows
8 version, but it's another new Yoga tablet

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.939
product that really stands out as different.

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:25.070
The new Yoga Tablet 2 Pro is a 13-inch Android
tablet with the same cylindrical edge/kickstand

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.589
design, but inside that bulging hinge is a
built-in pico projector.

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:36.180
It's a surprising addition that makes this
a unique product. The projector is activated

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.500
by a physical button on the side of the chassis,
or by a software button on the main interface

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:48.329
screen. It projects a 16:9 image that Lenovo
says will work up to 50 inches diagonally.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.079
A small focus slider is built into the rounded
edge for adjusting the picture.

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.489
The speakers are a step above what we normally
see in tablets, with 8 watts of output and

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:06.050
a small built-in JBL-branded subwoofer. The
tablet's 13-inch screen has a better-than-HD

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:13.050
resolution of 2,560x1,440 pixels, but the
projector throws its image at a lower resolution.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.850
As an Android tablet, the 13-inch Yoga Tablet
Pro 2 is bigger than most, and the big, rounded

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.680
edge makes it less portable than many other
tablets it'll take up more room in your

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.360
bag than a simple, fully flat tablet. That
said, the rounded edge gives you something

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.640
to grip when holding the tablet in your hand,
and the kickstand makes it easy to set up

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.650
as a display. Like the smaller Yoga 2 tablets,
this version has a cutout in the kickstand

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.520
that can be used to hang the entire device
from a hook.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:53.590
Lenovo says the battery life should be about
3 hours if you're using the projector, or

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.560
up to 15 hours without. The Yoga Tablet 2
Pro will go on sale around the end of October

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:06.560
in the US and Europe, starting at $499 and
€499, and £449 in the UK. In Australia,

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:18.170
it'll be on sale from mid-October in JB Hi-Fi
and Harvey Norman for AU$799.
