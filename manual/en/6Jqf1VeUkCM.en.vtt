Hi! I'm Kelly for Expert Village and I would
like to show you 15 quick and easy non-alcoholic

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.750
beverages that you and your family will be
able to enjoy this holiday season. The next

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.430
drink I have for you guys is the holiday chocolate
milk whip. What you're going to need is a

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.470
3 ounce cup of whipped cream, 4 ounces of
chocolate milk. It can be regular milk, regular

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.609
milk, chocolate fat free milk, or what we
have today, the chocolate soy milk made with

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:34.910
organic soy beans for you lactose intolerants
like myself, and 2 ounces of cold coffee.

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:40.329
After you brew your pot of coffee, set it
aside in the refrigerator about 1-3 hours.

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.570
If you're just going to put it outside to
chill, then you have to let it sit there for

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.770
about 3-5 hours. You're going to need a tall
glass filled to the top with ice and some

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.359
chocolate shaving topping. That's about it.
Now I'm going to show you how it's done. You're

00:00:56.359 --> 00:01:07.380
going to pour 2 ounces of cold coffee into
your measuring cup

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:20.280
and 4 ounces of your chocolate milk like so.
You're going to get your tall glass filled

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:31.259
to the top with ice and pour first the chocolate
milk 4 ounces, and the 2 ounces of cold coffee.

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:51.329
Now you're going to add your whipped topping.
Let's add a little more just because I have

00:01:51.329 --> 00:02:10.570
a sweet tooth. Garnish with shaved chocolate.
Beautiful. A little extra candy cane and there

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.700
you go, the chocolate milk whip. Simple enough,
right? Enjoy.
