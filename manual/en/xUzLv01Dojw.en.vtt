00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:12.020
There's a reason why we at AppSpy recently
reviewed Kris Pixton's latest release in the

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:17.100
Pathpix series - it was to act as a refresher
or reminder of the developer's particular

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:18.820
puzzling style.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:24.120
Ultimately it acts as a perfect introduction
to an entirely new (relatively speaking) puzzling

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:30.090
experience in the form of PrismaPix, and while
it may feature the same core goals of PathPix,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.570
the gameplay itself is fresh and utterly engrossing.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.579
Mixing elements of games such as Minesweeper,
Fill-a-Pix, and Picross, the player is tasked

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.600
with solving noncontiguous 'layers' of color
that, when completed, come together and reveal

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.010
a pixelated version of a high-resolution image.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.170
The true magic of the game comes in the way
it nudges the player forward, keeping in mind

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:56.479
the most casual of puzzle fans, while providing
difficulty scaling that will test logic-hardened

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:57.760
veterans.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.629
Much like Minesweeper, numbers on the grid
represent a number of 'correct' pixels in

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:03.629
its direct proximity.

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.320
By using the information available to you
(pixels flagged as 'impossible', correctly

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.430
filled pixels, and other numbers) it's possible
to work out what your next step should be.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.330
If you're stuck, you could get some help from
the 'Tute' or 'Hint' buttons (one aims to

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.910
teach the logic behind the choices, the other
simply points out the next 'step'), but Kris

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.150
Pixton goes even further than that in making
the game a smooth experience.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.660
'Autoscrolling' may feel awkward at first,
but the player is purposefully directed to

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.290
an area of the puzzle where the player may
complete a step of it.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:37.290
Layers without any current solvable solutions
are also locked off, preventing the player

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.130
from taking wild-swipes at the puzzle until
they learn some of the basic logic patterns.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.160
Once comfortable with the easy mode, players
can advance to 'Tricky' or 'Expert', where

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.280
the task becomes much harder thanks to missing
'impossible' squares that need to be filled

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.640
in by the player.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.980
Pairs adjacent to each other (or further apart
in the case of 'Expert') can be used to fill

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:59.740
in the pixels, with the rest of the puzzle
filling in automatically if you can solve

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:01.560
its miniature challenge.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.700
Those looking for a real hardcore experience
can turn off all of the help features and

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.590
go completely manual, flagging every pixel
in an attempt to solve the puzzle.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.030
While not as casually focused as PathPix,
PrismaPix is still an amazingly addictive

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.140
title and provides challenges ranging from
zen-like to nail-biting in their complexity.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.620
Young or old, casual or hardcore - this is
another puzzle title that will keep you happily

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:33.840
busy for hours on end.
