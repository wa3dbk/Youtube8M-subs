00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:12.360
August 29, 2005. 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:16.530
After passing over the Caribbean, Hurricane Katrina made landfall

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.710
along the Gulf of Mexico. By the time the skies cleared,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.880
Katrina had killed more than 1800 people, caused

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.050
roughly $125 billion in damages, 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.160
and went down as one of the strongest storms to hit the U.S. in a century. 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.190
Five years later, NASA revisits Katrina

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.210
as captured by NASA satellites. 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.390
While these images can't tell the whole story of the hurricane 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:49.570
and its impacts, they remind us of the power and destructive nature

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.750
of tropical cyclones. 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.930
In the weeks leading up to Katrina, NASA's Aqua satellite

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.100
captures sea surfaces temperatures with the AMSR-E instrument. 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.280
Warm ocean temperatures, indicated in red, 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.450
provide energy to fuel the growing storm. 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.630
As Katrina moves, it leaves a trail of cooler water in its wake, stirred up from below. 

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:19.160
Two days before landfall... 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.250
NASA's MISR instrument on the Terra satellite witnesses growing cloud tops

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.420
as the storm gathers strength. 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.610
Just before landfall... the TRMM satellite at

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.790
"hot towers" - powerful thunderstorms that help propel Katrina

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.960
to category 5 strength. 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:44.120
The same satellite reveals heavy rains. 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.140
Green means at least a half inch of rain is falling per hour. Yellow, an inch. 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.280
Red, over two inches per hour. 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:58.450
As the hurricane sweeps through, 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.620
TRMM's multi-satellite analysis reveals where the hurricane delivered the heaviest rain,

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.800
shown here in yellows and reds. 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.920
Finally, Landsat satellite imagery

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.980
shows the extent of flooding in New Orleans. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.070
First, the city before the storm, with Lake Pontchartrain to the north. 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:23.110
Two days after the storm made landfall, much of the city is 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:27.290
flooded by the catastrophic levee failures. 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.470
Today, Landsat sees a city still rebuilding from the storm. 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.650

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:39.820
NASA satellites continue to provide detailed observations of tropical cyclones

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.000
around the world - to better understand how they work, and so we can

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:48.170
prepare for those yet to come.
