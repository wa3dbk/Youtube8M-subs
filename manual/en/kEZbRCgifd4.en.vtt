00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:07.960
I'm having a sandwich. It's got turkey, bacon,
cheese, and the chipotle mayo. It's classic stuff.

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:17.600
I had a salad for dinner.

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:20.000
..the oriental blend, cantaloupe..

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.550
I'm having and Italian sub.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.000
Pork, potatoes, green beans...

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
I love pork, and potatoes, and green beens
seemed healthy.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.500
The chicken broccoli bake is definitely a
classic family dish.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.700
Ugo's pizza is pretty good, and I really like
the sandwiches from Beanster's as well

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.000
I like the fish, the cod

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Chicken tenders and chicken nuggets, and
fried chicken patties on a bun.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.110
I would say carrot cake is a very good dessert.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.810
Um...

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.960
Dinner to me means a break

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.970
just a couple seconds to collect
myself

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.670
Yea, all the guys in my hall usually go
together to eat.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.670
Just hanging out during the week can be stressful,
or like you feel like you have to do homework

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.670
But if you're eating with them, you need
to eat, so..

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.890
We talk about whatever's going on, 
basketball now.

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.370
Coming to the dining hall really helps because you get
to meet everyone over here. For example, I haven't

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:41.000
seen these two for over two weeks now. And, we still 
meet at the dining hall.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I need to wash all of the plates in home cooking,
so, here I don't need to.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.000
I love food. I don't know if I'd call myself
a food expert.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
But I am a big fan of food, I eat all the time.
So there's that.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.400
But I mean, I definitely need it to stay alive.
That's important, too.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:08.700
Back in Hong Kong it's one cuisine, it's generally Indian,
but over here you have a different variety.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.400
I definitely miss some home food, like Chinese
food and stuff.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.400
Yea, I do kind of miss it, but the cafe kind of helps.
So it's not all fast food.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.400
Oh, yea definitely. When I go home, one of the things
besides seeing everyone, is definitely looking forward to 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.400
my mom's cooking.

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:29.000
Yea I miss my family's cooking, a lot.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Like, the food here is okay, but my
mom's cooking is great.
