00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:06.040
Today on this 1994 GMC full size van, we are
going to be installing Draw-Tite hitch part

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.710
number 75121.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.210
Before we get starting installing our trailer
hitch we are going to go ahead and give you

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.220
a couple of final install dimensions that
will help make choosing your hitch accessories

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.540
a little bit easier.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.540
From the top of the receiver tube opening
to the ground is going to measure 12-1/2 inches.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.760
And from the center of the pin hole, to clear
the rear edge of the bumper is going to be

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.760
approximately 2-1/2 inches.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.860
We are going to start off underneath the vehicle
here with our installation.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.290
And we are actually looking at the driver
side frame rail.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.040
We are going to point out the mounting locations
for this trailer hitch.

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.980
Attached to the bottom of the frame, as well
as the bumper, is the bumper bracket.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.140
And there is a bolt holding it into the bumper
and two into the frame.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.700
We will actually be removing the bumper bracket
from not only the driver side but from the

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:44.789
passenger side as well.

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.789
And the hitch will actually be replacing it.

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.210
0:46
Once we do remove the bumper bracket, we will

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:52.280
actually be reusing the existing hardware
on the vehicle.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.949
And, if you continue forward on the frame,
just forward on the angle of support, there

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.859
is an existing hole here and that is going
to provide our forward most attaching point

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:02.289
for the frame.

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.260
Into that existing hole, we are actually going
to be fishing the carriage bolt and block

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.150
assembly that is provided with the installation
kit.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.030
And we are actually going to go ahead and
do that first.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.410
We are going to go ahead and take the provided
bolt leader and we want to take the threaded

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:14.410
end here.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:19.030
Insert it in the bottom of the frame, through
the existing hole and back out this large

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.320
hole in the frame.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.830
We will next take our block and go ahead and
slide it on to the bolt leader.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.930
And then we will take the carriage bolt and
we will wrap the threads of the bolt leader

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.140
around the threads of the carriage bolt.

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:34.130
So from there, we just want to take the other
end of the bolt leader and go ahead and pull

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.740
the block and carriage bolt down into place.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.000
Alright, and then we will just go ahead now
and move on to removing the bumper bracket.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.670
Depending on the age of your vehicle, the
bolts that are attaching the bumper bracket

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.640
to the bumper could have a considerable amount
of rust or road grime built up on the nuts.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.280
So it is a good idea to thoroughly soak and
clean those with a spray lubricant, like a

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:46.239
WD-30, before attempting to remove 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:03:11.159
a nut. 2:07
