00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.840
I’m often tired in the morning when I have trained hard.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:06.549
For an extended period of time.

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:08.549
I can feel it as soon as I wake up.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.931
My legs are heavy today.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:14.180
I then think that I need to compete more.

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.040
If I train this hard, then..

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.900
If i should be worth it.

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.680
Then I should probably compete more too.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:25.680
The best thing with multisport is when you cross the finish line.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.560
The struggle of moving forward as a unit, a team, together for several days

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.380
That feeling is simply unbeatable. As simple as it sounds.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.160
I’m just like anybody else.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.840
Except that I squeeze in as much training as possible when I see an opportunity,

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.700
that’s probably what separates me from other people. I see myself as quite an energetic person.

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:59.260
My motivation is really to become as good as possible, based on the conditions that I have.

00:00:59.778 --> 00:01:02.838
And I think that it is the feeling of being fit.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.700
the feeling that I can push myself for long periods of time and that it comes relatively easy to me

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.940
As a family father with a wife and two children and dogs and so on,

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.380
I have to find ways to make time for training in my everyday life.

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.060
To and from work, with the children to daycare and so on.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.460
Squeeze in a training session at lunch time when possible

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.980
And train on my way home from work.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.880
And then my wife has to exercise too.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.300
Training sessions are not always long in duration but all training is good.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.872
A little bit of training is better than no training at all.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.880
And if I have time to run for 45 minutes on a lighted track, that’s great.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.860
We heat our house by burning firewood.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:46.860
And I cut down a lot of trees and chop a lot of firewood.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.380
And that  should be considered training.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.840
It’s great exercise!

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:58.440
And on weekends I train in the morning when the children have gotten out of bed to watch TV.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.940
And then at night when they have gone to bed.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:04.700
In the daytime. I want to spend time with my family. That’s the way it is,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.360
I have to train almost every day with a day of rest here and there.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.920
There are no shortcuts to the top, it’s hard work.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.920
Two or three times a week I teach a children’s gymnastic class for kids from my village.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.760
I also have classes for adults, a tougher kind of exercise class

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.300
I do strength training two or three times a week, sometimes more.

00:02:34.843 --> 00:02:37.963
But that can be done right here in my own back yard, by the wood shed.

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.100
I have good team mates too. We all live here, quite close to each other.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.060
If I can do a training session with them.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.220
And spar with Björn and Matte and assert myself.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.700
Then I know that I’m in good shape.

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:55.020
That’s how it is. At least in Sweden.

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.340
I never use a watch when I train. I don’t use a heart rate monitor or a GPS.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:11.860
I do what I feel like. In the back of my head, I guess I have a plan that I can’t just do intervals and so on.

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:20.820
I don’t think about it very much, I do what I feel like. I know my body quite well and I know what’s needed.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.680
I know my body quite well and I know what’s needed.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.280
Well, I eat what I can get my hands on and having a beer with dinner on Friday night is common.

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.500
You have to enjoy life too.

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.860
I  have always been physically active.

00:03:46.115 --> 00:03:49.475
I have never been good at anything,

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:55.980
it’s been a lot of chopping wood, hard physical labor and I have realized that that’s my thing.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.640
That’s how I found out about multisport too.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:03.920
I was mediocre regarding most things, no real weaknesses but . .

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.320
not good enough in any one discipline either.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.400
I had never tried kayaking.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.920
But then I found a mould for a kayak in my chicken coup, up in the rafters.

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.480
So I built my first kayak.

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.180
Then I built five more.

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:21.320
And that’s how I got into kayaking.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.180
I can use my strength.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.540
And I became good at it.

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:31.320
But I don’t like the gadget craze,

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:37.420
it’s a lot about materials and it has to be the latest and the greatest,

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.940
I don’t really care about that.

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:46.680
I prefer heavier things that will last. I’m a bit reckless and I also just like to get in there and do my thing.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.610
My wife Lina supports me completely in this.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:58.160
When it comes to my training, we try to work together and she helps me a lot to make it easier for me.

00:04:59.277 --> 00:05:04.297
It’s a constant juggling to make it work.

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:13.470
You have to look at the possibilities, all the time

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:17.320
It doesn’t work if I try to do it on my own.

00:05:17.511 --> 00:05:21.671
It has to work for the family too. I can’t neglect them.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.440
Then it all goes to hell.

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:33.260
When the children are awake and I’m home, then I want to spend my time with them and my wife. I

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.600
I watch very little TV but that doesn’t bother me.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.960
I don’t have more time for training than anybody else.

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.840
There are two options; you either see difficulties or opportunities.

00:05:52.380 --> 00:05:54.380
I have chosen to see the opportunities.
