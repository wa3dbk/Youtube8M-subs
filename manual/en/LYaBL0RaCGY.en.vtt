00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.930
Douwe Egberts setup a face recognition coffee
maker that dispenses a cup of coffee when

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.089
it detects a person yawning.

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:11.870
And Celest-jewel-ale is a new beer from Dog
Fish Head Brewery that is steeped with lunar

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.440
meteorites - received from a company that
makes NASA spacesuits and once it's gone - it's

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.660
gone forever!

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.660
Vsauce!

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:20.710
Kevin here.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.270
This is Mind Blow.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:30.580
Researchers now say that the hemispheres of
Albert Einstein's brain were unusually well-connected

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.050
and that could have contributed to his brilliance.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.390
After his death in 1955 Einstein's son allowed
the nobel-prize-winning physicist's brain

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.220
to be studied and while last year it was noted
that he had a dramatically expanded prefrontal

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.180
cortex - a new technique to study the corpus
callosum - developed by Weiwei Men of East

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.910
China Normal University's Department of Physics
found Einstein had more extensive connections

00:00:53.910 --> 00:01:00.420
between certain parts of his cerebral hemispheres
compared samples of 15 elderly men and 52

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.380
men Einstein's age in 1905.

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.460
Arc Nova is an inflatable concert hall.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.670
Created by architect Arata Isozaki and sculptor
Anish Kapoor - the structure takes about two

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.179
hours to inflate and holds around 500 people.

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.889
The arc was made to tour the areas of Tohoku
that were devastated by the earthquake and

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:24.359
tsunami in 2011 and they're looking to bring
back hope and encouragement to the cities

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:26.439
via music, design, and culture.&nbsp;

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:32.420
Blizzident is a 3D-printed toothbrush that
thoroughly cleans your teeth as you grind

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.389
and bite down on it -- in just 6 seconds.

00:01:36.389 --> 00:01:39.880
Hana Yakiniku wants your smartphone to smell
like food.

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.109
By attaching the device you can pick the food
you want and then smell it while eating something

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.200
plain like white rice or lettuce.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.859
It's supposed to work well for people on budgets
or on a diet, and comes in many different

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:55.069
scents like coffee, coconut, curry, and cinnamon
roll.

00:01:55.069 --> 00:02:00.380
Hawkes Ocean Technologies has created The
Deepflight Super Falcon a kind of underwater

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.380
plane.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.840
It has the ability to do barrel rolls and
jump out of the water because of its wings

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.329
making it more like an underwater plane that
a typical submarine.

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:13.270
Their commitment to using electric energy
makes it safe to operate around humans and

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.120
marine life, and they're taking orders for
them right now.

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.220
Mollusks have teeth made of magnetite which
is the hardest material made by a living organism,

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.220
ever.

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.220
So Yeah.

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.090
Yaskawa electric is making a device to help
people that have suffered from a stroke to

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.950
be able to walk with more ease.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.219
It's similar to the boot that stroke victims
currently use but it's now motorized to help

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:39.280
lift and move the user's leg forward giving
them a longer and more confident stride.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.810
A sensor inside the boot detects when the
user is walking and starts to automatically

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.590
assist, allowing them to take bigger steps
and they're shooting for commercial availability

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:50.150
by 2015.

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:55.870
The PicoBrew Zymatic is the world's first
all grain in home beer brewing system.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.580
It's essentially an espresso maker for beer.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:02.750
All you have to do is load up your hops and
barley, choose the kind of beer you want,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.659
press go and let it do its thing.

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.849
Within a couple of hours the beer is made
and all of the data is sent to your computer

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.909
so you can save your favorite recipes.

00:03:10.909 --> 00:03:16.170
Meanwhile, Monsieur is a robotic bartender
that learns its user's tastes and customizes

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.580
the drinks depending on each person.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:21.950
Using a touch screen you can browse through
the cocktails and once you pick a drink you

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.349
choose its strength whether you want normal,
lightweight, or boss.

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.709
It even emails a grocery list to your local
liquor store to schedule a delivery when you're

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.620
running low on ingredients.

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:34.800
The Pinocchio lizard is BACK!

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.579
Thought to be extinct for the last 50 years....it
was recently observed by Tropical Herping

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:41.019
in Ecuador.

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.900
Engineering students at Rice made this robotic
arm for a teenager named Dee who suffers from

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.560
a brittle bone disease.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.920
The project lasted two years and resulted
in this cool robotic arm that gives Dee the

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:57.459
ability to safely pick things up and become
more independent just in time for him to start

00:03:57.459 --> 00:03:58.459
college.

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.909
Split are the worlds first stand alone audio
player with no cables and doesn't require

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:03.909
bluetooth.

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:08.269
It's completely hands free and you can adjust
the volume and change tracks by using bite

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:12.480
clicks - but you can lock them so you can
bite without altering the music.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.040
Finally here is Kaleidolapse from mylapse,
a beautiful video of different time lapse

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.050
shots with a kaleidoscopic effect.&nbsp;

00:04:21.050 --> 00:05:35.210
I'm going to leave you with self assembling
robot cubes and as always - thanks for watching.
