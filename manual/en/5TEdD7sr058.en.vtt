00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.160
Take a look at this cute and handy little
tray I made.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.760
You'll never believe what I made it from.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:17.330
Let me show you.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.520
Isn't it fun to make something interesting
out of the most surprising things?

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.480
For instance, what I wanna show you is how
you can take an ordinary picture frame, which

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.210
you can often find at a secondhand store,
and turn it into a really stylish tray.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.570
Now what you wanna do is you just wanna start
with a simple picture frame like this.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.769
What I've done is I've predrilled a couple
holes for handles, and I'll get that in just

00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:41.769
a moment.

00:00:41.769 --> 00:00:45.059
But for the field of the tray itself, this
is where you can get really stylish.

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.030
You see, what I'm going to do is use this
little print of gingham.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.300
This is the piece of cardboard that goes at
the back of the picture that you would typically

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.300
put in here.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:59.160
What I'm gonna do is start by placing the
glass, after I've cleaned it, into the frame

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.880
itself like this.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.080
There you go.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:13.490
Next, I simply take the fabric that I want
to use and I cut a piece where I have just

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.180
enough hanging off the edge, oh, about 3/4
of an inch or so.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:24.860
And then just fold it back such that it fits
tightly against the edge or the outline of

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.860
the field.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:35.490
And what I'm gonna do is just use a little
hot glue and place it along like this and

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.439
fold it over.

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:39.740
Now, the other side.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.740
You have to move quickly because you don't
want the hot glue to dry.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.140
Ouch that's hot!

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:45.860
Just kidding.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.380
At this point, you wanna make sure, just check
and make sure, that it's being drawn tightly,

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.829
and it is.

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:53.310
It's nice and taught.

00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:04.020
And now I have just two more sides to do,
and I'll carry on the same way.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.350
Now for the corners.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.110
What I'm gonna do is I'm just gonna do a little
quarter fold or 90 degree angle, you can see

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.010
here, off the corner.

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.760
Just to pin that down with the glue here.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.280
There we go.

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.300
Likewise here.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:29.570
Now with the corners in place and it all dried,
you can see that I have a nice field of fabric.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:34.960
I'm simply going to lay this field of fabric
in the picture frame just as I would if this

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:35.960
were a photograph.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:42.740
You see, it rests comfortably and snuggly
in there.

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:49.090
And now I'm just gonna take these little tabs
and push them down all the way around so that

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.420
it's pressed tightly against the glass.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.360
Alright, there we go.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.360
Pretty swell looking.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.750
We're not quite finished.

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.750
Now for the handles.

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.531
Now I mentioned earlier that I had predrilled
the holes, and I used a drill bit that's just

00:03:02.531 --> 00:03:04.490
slightly smaller than the screw.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.710
And this is important because you don't want
to split the frame.

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.420
And once you have the screw lined up with
the hole, you wanna make sure that you apply

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.480
this with a hand screwdriver.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:18.310
You don't wanna draw this down too tightly
because you might actually split the wood

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.310
of the frame.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:26.260
Once I have this handle in place, it's just
a matter of attaching the other one, and I

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:27.610
have a marvelous little tray.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.560
You see, you can create these using any size
frame you like or any sort finish or fabric.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.150
Just choose elements that help you express
your own creative style.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.320
