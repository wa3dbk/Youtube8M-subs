00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:10.300
Greetings, my students! I am executor Smartanis.
I was send by the Conclave to teach you how

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:22.100
to successfully forge expand! We start pretty
normal - throwing a pylon at 9 supply.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:34.500
The pylon should be placed in front of your natural.
We won't be using it as a wall.

00:00:37.159 --> 00:00:45.900
Send the probe to scout, but be careful! You don't want to
lose it too fast! Then we continue with the

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:53.109
probe production. Chronoboost the nexus until
you have sixteen workers.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:06.429
When the sixteenth finishes and the seventeenth is on the way
(or slightly before that), take a probe and

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:13.469
build a Nexus at your natural

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:24.500
After you have done this, collect enough minerals for a forge but DO NOT build more workers!

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.500
Build the forge!

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:39.200
Now collect enough minerals for a gateway. I repeat - DO NOT build more workers.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:50.200
After you have started the gateway, throw
a pylon and an assimilator at your main. As soon as the assimilator is ready,

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.300
put three probes in it.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:05.500
Now, continue with the probe production - build 2 workers and meanwhile throw a canon between the pylon and the gateway.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.300
Make 1 more worker.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:30.000
As soon as the gateway finishes, build a cybernetics core. Keep the probe building it outside for scouting or proxy purposes.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:41.900
By that time your nexus should be ready. Resume the worker production and send five probes from the main to the natural.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.000
By that time you should have seen what is your opponent's build.If you suspect him to rush, throw a second canon.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.900
In this case, this is not necessary.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.200
You have successfully forge expanded!
