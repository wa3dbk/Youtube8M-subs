00:00:17.649 --> 00:00:20.759
Controlling fleas on your dog can be a challenge

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.309
This is due in part to the fact that fleas can multiply at an alarming rate

00:00:25.309 --> 00:00:29.230
This is further complicated because these nasty little buggers start to infest

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.290
your dogs environment, in other words, your home

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.380
There are many products on the market today which can help you with flea

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.980
control for your pet

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.440
Unfortunately, some of these items contain chemicals that are less than

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.470
healthy for your dog

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.900
there are however some natural
alternatives

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.860
to help you decide which ones might be
best for you and your dog

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:55.970
we have highlighted what we consider to be, the top 3 choices for a natural flea 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.050
dip for your dog

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.300
First there is Rosemary flea dip

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.989
this treatment is especially good on
those hot summer days

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.700
Start by steeping 2 cups of rosemary in boiling water

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.460
Strain out the leaves and add the liquid to enough fresh water to create a gallon

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:15.710
in total of the dip

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:21.030
Once it cools, but while it's still warm, pour it over your dog and allow him to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.670
dry naturally

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.010
This dip is also very helpful for ticks

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:28.900
Second, try a lemon flea dip

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:31.969
you can start creating that by boiling
water

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:35.920
Then add lemon slices and allow it to steep overnight

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:40.640
The next day, remove the lemon and pour the liquid into a spray bottle

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.840
Spray this liquid all over your dog especially behind the ears, near the tail

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.700
and on his belly and legs

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.570
Be careful not to get it into his eyes

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.590
This mixture will kill and repel fleas and as an added bonus, it can help to

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.150
treat irritated skin

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.130
Last but not least, try lavender oil

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.810
Before you apply the lavender oil, you should wash and dry your dog

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.090
once you're done

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.979
apply 5-10 drops of the lavender oil to your dog around the tail and neck area

00:02:13.979 --> 00:02:16.489
Massage this oil into their skin

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.180
The oil will help to treat irritated skin as well as repel the fleas. You should 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.689
repeat this treatment at least every two
weeks

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:29.269
Treating your dog is the first step in irradiating a flea infestation

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:31.879
but you must also clean their
environment

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:33.829
as an added preventative

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:35.829
wash your dog's bedding

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:41.029
vacuum daily and occasionally sprinkle salt on your carpets

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:43.469
when you do let it sit over night

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:47.949
then vacuum it up. This will help eliminate the fleas from your home

00:02:47.949 --> 00:02:53.029
