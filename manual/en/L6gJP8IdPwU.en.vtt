00:00:13.594 --> 00:00:15.396
-If I was in charge
of Christmas,

00:00:15.396 --> 00:00:18.033
there would be a monkey
on top of the tree.

00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:20.264
-I drew Santa with a blue beard.

00:00:20.264 --> 00:00:23.495
-I'd decorate the stairs,
the floor.

00:00:23.495 --> 00:00:26.000
-I would put doughnuts
on the Christmas tree

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.429
and red bananas.

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:29.627
-I would let the elves
have a day off

00:00:29.627 --> 00:00:31.363
and let them spend time
with their babies

00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:32.594
and play in the snow.

00:00:32.594 --> 00:00:34.660
-I've never been in the snow,
but I'd love to.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.561
-I would decorate
with snowflakes.

00:00:37.561 --> 00:00:40.066
-Spend quality time
with your family.

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:43.528
We can decorate our tree
the way we like it, pink,

00:00:43.528 --> 00:00:46.693
lights, purple, like, ornaments.

00:00:46.693 --> 00:00:48.165
-This is a reindeer

00:00:48.165 --> 00:00:49.759
with ornaments
hanging from its head.

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:51.396
This is a menorah.

00:00:51.396 --> 00:00:53.066
-When I was really little,

00:00:53.066 --> 00:00:56.594
we had a choo-choo train
under the Christmas tree.

00:00:56.594 --> 00:01:00.396
-I imagine Santa Claus photo
bombing my photos every year.

00:01:00.396 --> 00:01:02.627
-And a rainbow
with cotton candy around it.

00:01:02.627 --> 00:01:04.330
Who doesn't love candy?

00:01:50.066 --> 00:01:51.759
-If I was in charge
of the Christmas,

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.726
there would be a monkey
on top of the tree.

00:01:54.726 --> 00:01:57.495
-I drew Santa with a blue beard.

00:02:05.033 --> 00:02:06.264
-This is a reindeer

00:02:06.264 --> 00:02:08.066
with ornaments
hanging from its head.

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:10.033
This is a menorah.

00:02:16.528 --> 00:02:19.033
-I would put doughnuts
on the Christmas tree

00:02:19.033 --> 00:02:22.396
and red bananas.

00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:26.066
-I'd imagine Santa Claus photo
bombing my photos every year.

00:02:26.066 --> 00:02:29.066
-We can decorate our tree
the way we like it, pink,

00:02:29.066 --> 00:02:32.132
lights, purple like ornaments.

00:02:32.132 --> 00:02:34.528
And a rainbow
with cotton candy around it.

00:02:34.528 --> 00:02:36.297
Who doesn't love candy?

00:02:53.627 --> 00:02:56.627
-I've never been in the snow
but I'd love to.
