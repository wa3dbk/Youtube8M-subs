00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:13.220
In the face of declining oil fields and at a time 
when recovering hydrocarbons is becoming more difficult,

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:19.040
effective techniques are key to extract 
more oil from mature fields.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.320
Shell is one of the leaders in this area.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.130
With capabilities across the full suite of 
Enhanced Oil Recovery technologies,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:37.130
our objective is to develop the best technical 
and most economic solutions for an individual reservoir.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.070
One of our focus areas is enhanced water-flooding.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:51.100
This includes Alkaline Surfactant Polymer technology 
– a part of the Chemical enhanced oil recovery family.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.100
A specially tailored cocktail of Alkaline 
and Surfactant mobilises the oil.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.170
Then the Polymer effectively drives it out of the reservoir.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:28.130
Seeking to boost hydrocarbon production, Shell is applying 
enhanced oil recovery technologies around the world.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.280
As the oil price has risen, there is an upsurge in 
this promising field and yet more innovation.

00:01:55.110 --> 00:02:00.800
Our deep experience in enhanced oil recovery 
and our large project portfolio

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:08.130
offer huge potential to maximise oil recovery for us 
and our partners across the world.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:15.740
Shell’s global efforts are backed by a sustained 
high overall R&amp;D spend

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:22.090
- $1 billion in 2010, keeping Shell at 
the forefront of all the IOCs.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.070
Responding to the world’s need for energy,

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:36.460
Shell is committed to taking oil recovery to the next level 
– with innovative technologies being the platform to success.
