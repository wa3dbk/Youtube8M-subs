00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.940
((horn))
((gears grinding))

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.422
[Race Announcer]
Great group of racers here today.

00:00:07.422 --> 00:00:08.422
Let's cheer them all on.

00:00:08.422 --> 00:00:09.422
[Suzanne cheering]
Go, go, go , go, go!

00:00:09.422 --> 00:00:10.422
[Fred]
Frankly, I've never really analyzed why I

00:00:10.422 --> 00:00:13.379
do it, it's just a challenge to do and I like
winning obviously.

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:16.190
But I like riding and I like riding in competition.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:17.660
((heavy breathing))

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.660
[Narration]
Fred began biking in his sixties with his

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.320
wife, Suzanne.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.810
[Suzanne Schmid]
It helps us both stay active.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.810
((bike tires))

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.180
[Narrator]
Now pushing 80, Fred has competed in a number

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:30.180
of competitions.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.690
[Suzanne looking at album]
When people ask why you race, you can always

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.090
say it's for the podium girls.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:36.090
((laughs))

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.620
[Fred]
I've been world champion twice, national champion

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:39.620
numerous times.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.620
It's been fun.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.600
[Narrator]
Though the Schmids travel the country for

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.460
biking events, they feel fortunate for the
wealth of bike trails in Texas from Cameron

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.010
Park in Waco, just thirty feet from their
driveway, to dozens of state parks offering

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.510
bike trails as varied as the geography.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:56.510
((bird chirping))

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.190
[Narrator]
Cedar Hill State Park offers bikers an escape

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.010
in the middle of the Metroplex.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.600
San Antonio has Government Canyon.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.280
Near Houston is Brazos Bend.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.750
Or if you'd like to bike as far from a city
as possible, you might prefer a place like

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.530
Big Bend Ranch State Park.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:15.350
[Fred]
I just love the feeling of isolation that

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.350
you get out there.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.350
If you want to be remote, that's the place
to be.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:18.350
((turkey))

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.350
[Fred]
My goodness, look at that.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.350
There's a turkey right by out back door!

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.350
[Narrator]
For this event, the Schmids are camping at

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.350
Palo Duro Canyon State Park in the Texas Panhandle.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.109
[Suzanne]
Bird watching, geology, you name it, the bicycle

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:28.670
is a great way to see a lot of area.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:31.159
[Race Announcer]
The pros are coming in...

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.659
((crowd cheering))

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:35.649
[Race Announcer]
Frederick Schmid.

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:37.149
Third place.

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.399
[Suzanne]
Alright Freddy!

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.389
Way to go boy!]

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:43.389
((kiss))

00:01:43.389 --> 00:01:46.369
[Narrator]
And Fred Schmid has finished another race

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:47.840
in another pretty place.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.090
[Fred]
I like the fact that people look at me and

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.101
say 'well, maybe I can continue to be athletic
and in reasonably good health for a long time.

00:01:56.101 --> 00:01:57.101
On to the next one.

00:01:57.101 --> 00:01:59.599
[Narrator]
For Texas Parks and Wildlife, this is Abe

00:01:59.599 --> 00:01:59.999
Moore.
