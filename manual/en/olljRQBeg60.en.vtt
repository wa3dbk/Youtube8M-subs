Hi! This is Karen for Expert Village. Now
we are going to talk about toppings. Maple

00:00:05.470 --> 00:00:11.040
syrup is what most people think of when serving
pancakes and waffles but if you want to turn

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:18.170
your breakfast into a special event, try some
of these other toppings. For the Belgium waffles,

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:27.380
let's put on a little whip cream and strawberries.
There you go. now the strawberries you can

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:32.879
buy frozen strawberries or you can do fresh
strawberries and just sprinkle them with a

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:38.579
little sugar and let them sit for an hour
or so and you will have a beautiful delicious

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:46.370
sauce to put over your whip cream. Now for
our health pancakes, let's put on a little

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:55.829
yogurt,
some fresh fruit whatever is in season will

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:08.960
do and sprinkle it with a little nuts. For
our apple cinnamon pancakes, let's give that

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:17.780
a little cream also and we will sprinkle it
with a little bit of nutmeg and maybe just

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:32.079
drizzle a tiny bit of syrup on that. For our
regular waffles, I heated up some all fruit

00:01:32.079 --> 00:01:40.149
preserves in the microwave and added a little
bit of liqueur. It makes a delicious sauce.

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:49.700
This one is cherry with a cherry liqueur and
for our blueberry pancakes good old fashioned

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:58.129
maple syrup.
This is truly a special breakfast.
