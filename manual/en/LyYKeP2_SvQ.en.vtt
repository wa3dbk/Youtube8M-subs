00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.060
You said “groove”!

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.820
Lesson 2,
Get into the “Grove” of Kanji.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.020
You did a great job learning the first lesson’s kanji.

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.550
It’s time to expand on that and turn your
one tree into a growth.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.680
Memorize the basic principle of joining one tree and you’ve got this kanji down.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.220
Now let’s try today’s kanji.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.500
Here is one tree and the other tree

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.860
The meaning for this kanji is "a grove of trees".
Now we are going to have a trick for memorizing

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.550
this kanji in just a minute but let’s first
look at the readings.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.740
Remember there are two readings in Japanese
kanji? One is the On reading and the other one is the Kun reading.

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.520
Long story short, the On readings come from Chinese and the Kun readings come from Japanese.

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:36.200
The On reading for this kanji is リン (rin),

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:45.160
And the Kun reading for this kanji is はやし (hayashi)

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:49.900
And remember the trick that I was telling
you about? Let’s look at that now.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.580
Here you can you say tree #1 and tree #2.
In ancient times, trees were thought to be the life givers.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:12.780
Considering that, one tree
gave life to another tree. Then you have a
grove of trees.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.980
Now let’s look at how to draw this kanji.
Pay attention to the stroke order.

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:32.540
Tree 1. 
1, 2, 3, 4. You have to stop here. 5, 6, 7, 8.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:47.020
Let’s try one more time. Tree 1. 1, 2, 3, 4. 
Tree 2. 5, 6, 7, and 8.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.300
Now let’s look at some sample words and phrases.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.700
The On reading for this kanji is りん(rin).

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.180
Here we have さん林 (sanrin) which means "mountain woods".

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:11.040
Next we have the Kun reading. The Kun reading for this kanji is はやし(hayashi).

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:18.560
Here we have 林さん (Hayashi-san) Mr. Hayashi
or Mrs. Hayashi. Since the Hayashi also represents

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:23.189
prosperity, it would be beyond to be used
as a common surname among the lords.
