00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.110
I'm going to be showing you guys and teaching
you guys the horse stance drill.

00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:10.360
First, let's start from the beginning.

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.082
We're going to be doing a chariot.

00:00:12.082 --> 00:00:15.380
A chariot means feet together and hands together
like this.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.950
Now we're going to practice choonbi.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:17.950
Choonbi means 'ready'.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:26.970
So we're going to go one, open your left leg,
shoulders apart, two, and three.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.190
One more time.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.279
One, two, three and we're going to kiyap,
this way.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.230
Now we're going to go to our horse stance
drill.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.950
I like to put my hands X, spread your legs
a little more apart, bend your knees, keep

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.190
your back straight, head up, fist on side.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.210
Now we're going to start with the left punch.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:49.330
I'm going to show you a mirror image, so I
am going to punch with my right hand, but

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:50.330
to you, it will be your left hand.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.899
So I'm going to punch with the left hand now.

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:58.800
Now we could do two punch.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.869
I like to do a last one kiyap, so it's going
to go like this.

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.610
Three punches, and the last one kiyap.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:12.909
Now every school has a different basic horse
stance form.

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:14.170
I'd like to show you mine.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.010
So I'm going to put my arms up and we're going
to first do a down block technique.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.250
One.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.420
Now I like to put my arms up to the other
side, two.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.900
The next technique is called an inside block.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.049
Three, four.

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.690
Now I'm going to show you a face block.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.690
Five, six.

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:41.470
Now, seven, we're going to punch, eight, we're
going to punch, and only eight steps.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.760
One more time, a little faster.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.040
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.659
Paro, Paro means 'come back'.

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.340
Then, chariot.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.310
And kyong ne means 'bow'.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.500
Kyong ne.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.780
And that's how we do our basic horse stance
drill technique in Taekwondo.
