00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.160
This is a life project for us.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.540
There’s nothing better than knowing where your food comes from 

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:20.660
and learning about how to be a producer rather than a consumer and how to build a community around that.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.300
(Meleana Judd-Cox, Owner, Waihuena Farm) Waihuena Farm is a twenty acre parcel where we primarily run our community-supported agriculture or CSA program. 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:49.160
We also do workshops and events, fitness, yoga, children’s programs, and live on farm internship programs.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.500
The North Shore is a magical place, and whether you’re a tourist or you’re a local, or you’re hosting a large surf contest, you’ve got to think about your impact. 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.000
This is the third year we’ve worked with Volcom as their compost site for the Volcom Pipe Pro.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.600
It's been great to be their composting site and help them divert waste and turn it into food for our community.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:19.520
I grew up in a family where my parents started a solar business back in the seventies, 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.160
so my awareness of environmental issues and the destructive nature of fossil fuels were heightened at a really young age. 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:38.740
When I went away to college on the mainland, I became aware of how destructive the mainstream industrial
agricultural model really is.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:48.160
And I was looking for alternatives to that. We found this property eight years ago and here we are making steps toward our dream 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:56.760
of having a place where people can connect with nature through organic agriculture as a foundation and all of the other fun things that go with it.
