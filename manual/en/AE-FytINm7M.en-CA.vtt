00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:05.420
The Waterloo student portal project is a partnership

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.850
between the Student Success Office and IST.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.910
We are collaborating with partners across
campus

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:15.710
and consulting regularly with students.

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.279
A portal is an application that brings together

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.250
information from diverse sources in a uniform
way.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.500
Our goal is to create a dynamic portal that
acts

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.730
as a gateway for just-enough, just-in-time
information

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:32.700
for current Waterloo students. It will be
a single-sign-on,

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.750
customizable site that will direct students
to on-campus resources,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:44.990
tools and information to help them be successful
both in and out of the classroom.

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:47.680
Students operate in digital spaces and have
an expectation

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.120
that Waterloo will offer this kind of tool,
as many other universities

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.510
have portals. We know students are overwhelmed
with information,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.280
and they want a common place to find the information

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.770
they need to make their time at Waterloo easier.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.580
The portal will pull content from existing
systems, such as Quest,

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.760
as well as university databases and serve
it up into

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.810
each student's customizable portal. It will
not replicate the functions

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.720
of any academic or operational database nor
will it replace university websites.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.920
The portal will help turn website content
into data, so this information

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.440
can easily be pulled into the portal. The
portal will house

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.970
various widgets which can bring together different
data sources

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.830
to provide meaningful and relevant information.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:36.690
A widget is an interface that displays information
and allows a user

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.590
to interact with a larger system. The portal
also has responsive design,

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.930
meaning it scales to the device you are using:
desktop, mobile or tablet.

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:50.510
Initially, the portal functionality will depend
on data availability

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:55.659
and data integrity, as well as resources.
It will be an iterative process

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.470
and over time will become a robust tool that
can provide a pathway

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.229
through critical events in the student lifecycle.
Eventually, the goal

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.970
is for interested students to be able to create
useful widgets for their peers using open

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.080
data.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.329
To date, we have hosted 4 student focus groups
and have spent time in high-traffic areas

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:20.150
engaging both undergraduate and graduate students
in conversations

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.010
to better understand their needs, gather ideas
for features and get feedback

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.959
on what's been created so far. Feature suggestions
are vast and cover everything

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.980
from personalized records to academic notifications
to real-time Tim Horton's line-up data to

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.340
volunteer opportunities.

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:40.790
We are currently prioritizing the proposed
features and will continue to

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.230
consult with students as the project moves
forward.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.219
As of August, we are meeting with campus partners
while working on widget development,

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:54.189
ensuring data integrity and conducting privacy
impact assessments.

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:59.629
Our plan is to conduct beta tests during the
fall term and optimistically have a version

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:03.819
to roll out sometime in Winter 2014. We are
currently focused on a portal

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:07.419
for current students but there is lots of
opportunity for other audiences

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:14.709
in the future including faculty/staff, prospective
students and alumni.

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:17.449
You can visit collaborate.uwaterloo.ca/student-portal.

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:24.510
Any faculty/staff or student can access this
with their WatIAm and you can

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.580
review the widgets in progress, as well as
read and make comments.

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:35.459
You can also get updates on the IST blog at
collaborate.uwaterloo.ca/connect-it/

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:41.109
We will keep the campus community informed
through these vehicles and the Daily Bulletin

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.479
as the portal progresses.
