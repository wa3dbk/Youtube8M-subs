Sometimes you want to work with a surface
that's already textured. And if you don't

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.360
want to buy something like papyrus paper,
which obviously has a lot of texture, or you

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:17.510
don't like this very linear texture then you
can add texture right on to your surface.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.220
Now, you can't do this with just paper it
has to be some sort of a board it has to be

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:27.940
a little bit heavier than paper, and a good
sort of adhesive to use would be something

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.640
like a matte medium. It dries clear, it says
matte, so it's going to dry matte, they also

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.460
have gloss medium and it's a clear acrylic
and it works essentially as a glue. So you

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:50.450
put this over your surface and you have to
work quite quickly and you're sort of glopping

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:56.980
it on, there's, there's no need to be fancy
here. And I'm going to use tissue paper, you

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:04.480
can use anything else, you can use rice paper,
you could put on some sort of patterned fabric

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:11.170
if you wanted. And just make sure that your
paper has rough edges, has broken edges, because

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:17.280
you don't really want sharp edges necessarily.
And you sort of smush it down there, and if

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:24.780
you're worried about it staying, you might
add a little bit more matte medium on top

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.320
to just make sure that it, it stays down and
you can work out any air bubbles that you

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.150
end up with. And you can smush this around
if you don't happen to, if you think that's

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.420
too strong, you want to sort of, you get in
there with your hands and kind of play with

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:48.640
it. And once this is dry, it will dry white
and then you can go over it and see what happens

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:57.439
with it as a textural surface. So you have
very quickly and very quickly created a textural

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:59.049
surface that you then can play with.
