00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.140
I’ve been wanting to try out some vintage
looking lights in my home.

00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:09.450
In this video I’ll go over my process on
how I added these two pendant lights to my

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.670
wall.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.039
While I was searching for ideas on how to
make a project like this, I ran across a site

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:22.089
called colorcord.com

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:26.630
And it basically had everything I needed to
make a project like this.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.920
The main thing that drew me in to their products
were all these great colors to choose from.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.399
They sell pendant light cord sets which are
already assembled, in a variety of colors

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.309
and sockets to choose from.

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:42.850
I ended up getting this dark magenta standard
grounded pendant set for one of my lights.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.899
They also sell cord by the foot and accessories
separate which allows you to customize your

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:48.899
project.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.930
I decided to make the other light custom this
way, using the turquoise bulb cage, 60 W edison

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:03.870
bulb, 15 ft of turquoise cord, clear standard
cord grip, porcelain socket, cord thumb switch

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.570
and cord plug end.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.370
If you want to order everything separate and
assemble it yourself, they do recommend you

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.260
consult a licensed electrician to help with
your project.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.820
And I have to say that I agree with them.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:25.780
I am a total beginner when it comes to wiring
anything electrical.

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.040
So I did work with a electrician on assembling
one of the pendant lights and he was kind

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.320
enough to let me film some of the assembly
process.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:42.220
To start, he wired the socket.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:47.250
The tape holds the fabric covering in place
as he works, otherwise it will bunch up and

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:57.560
unravel.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.130
Then wired the switch and plug.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:09.180
And used a current tester to make sure it
was wired properly.

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:16.180
Then added the bulb cage.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.739
Now for the other cord set I mentioned earlier,
it came already assembled.

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.230
Which was nice because after watching all
that electrical work on the turquoise light,

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.010
this one is a little more convenient because
I can finish it in a few steps.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:32.590
For this one, I chose the raw metal bulb cage.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.340
I don’t need the lamp shade ring, so take
that off.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.230
Because it doesn’t just fit onto the socket,
I need to stretch the cage a little.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.719
Since it’s just me making this, I need the
socket to stay while I put the cage on.

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:48.090
My method of doing this was to use a cup to
hold it.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:54.680
Remove the screws and stretch the cage over.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.190
Depending on your socket, you may notice the
screws it comes with aren’t long enough.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.909
So I replaced them with longer screws and
it worked just fine.

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:11.799
The put the light bulb in and it’s finished.

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:16.510
To hang them, I’m using this wall hanger
which I got from Lowes.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:31.030
The hardware you chose and the way you hang
it is totally up to your preference.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:35.060
Based on my experience with this project,
if you really want to go the custom route

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.390
and choose the length of your cord and accessories,
don’t skip out on consulting with an electrician.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.310
You don’t want to risk assembling the wires
incorrectly.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.569
Or if you want to save some time, go with
the pendant light cord sets which are already

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:49.569
assembled.

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.459
I found this route to be much more convenient.

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:55.400
They have a lot of cord and socket sets to
choose from and then you don’t have to worry

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.930
about assembling them.

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.139
