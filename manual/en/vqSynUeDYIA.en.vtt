00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:07.780
 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:18.800
Hello

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.580
Welcome to another video

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:24.580
of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.320
Hidden Legends of Games

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.080
in today's video we will talk about the

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:42.560
The Cursed Super Mario 64 cartridge

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:47.220
Opening

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.840
 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.680
 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.280
I always liked the super mario 64

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.500
When I was a kid, I remember

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.080
plays it almost every day in the house of the my Aunt

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:09.700
one day a pop up appeared from the

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:12.660
nothing while watching a video of

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.280
gameplay of this same game on youtube

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.495
I was a bit scared I was

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.420
about to close the window

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:31.500
when I noticed it was from a website showing a copy of Super Mario 64 sale

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:34.840
had photos and everything

00:01:35.295 --> 00:01:38.245
I usually do not trust these things.

00:01:38.245 --> 00:01:40.660
but the feeling of nostalgia and me

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.420
dominated and I wanted to buy it immediately

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:53.320
the whole thing was peculiar seeing how the game owner wanted the buyer

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:58.235
send an envelope containing $ 10 to a website address

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:04.640
instead of using something like the
paypal what made things more strange

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.760
was when I tried to access the website

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.500
after encountering problems with the game

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.040
the page could not be found anymore

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.800
a few days after the $10 was

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.400
sent is to receive a packet containing

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.240
a new copy of the game

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.220
the first thing I noticed when I opened the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.440
small box was that the official sticker

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.600
of the game with Mario flying in the air

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.100
with hat was apparently ripped off

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.500
something like

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:41.100
in its place there was a piece of tape

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.080
adhesive with roughly written MARIO with the permanent marker

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.460
I felt a little cheated but

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:56.040
counting that the game work if I do not I would mind, pulling nintendo 64 off

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:59.440
box and placed the cartridge on the

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:02.515
appeared with the face of her husband as always

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:05.460
that you could pull as much as I wanted

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:08.340
I remember laughing a lot with everyone

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.000
results when you could

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.540
I decided to sound a little just for the times old

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:18.280
move the cursor to the ear of the

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:21.660
and drew in large proportions

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:27.800
me and even do the same with the other ear when suddenly the TV made a

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:30.020
static noise too loud

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:33.600
Mario's head began to deform

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.620
in a way that I did not even know it was

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:40.060
possible with that model sounds

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:41.920
of the game began to play

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:44.820
along with static noise

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.540
while all this was happening I

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:52.960
could hear a weak voice whispering in

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.840
Japanese.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.660
The voice was weak and was crying.

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.520
I immediately turned off the game and

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.360
I tried again and did not mind

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:09.100
Mario's head this time only. I put a new file and started play

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:12.660
when I selected the file

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.320
game has proven all that introduction monologue of princess peach

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.900
and happened then was that...

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.820
 

00:04:27.005 --> 00:04:28.005
 

00:04:28.995 --> 00:04:30.375
 

00:04:31.515 --> 00:04:32.515
 

00:04:38.275 --> 00:04:39.275
 

00:04:40.415 --> 00:04:41.415
 

00:04:53.695 --> 00:04:54.695
 

00:04:55.145 --> 00:04:56.145
 

00:04:56.995 --> 00:04:57.995
 

00:04:58.985 --> 00:04:59.985
 

00:05:00.265 --> 00:05:01.265
 

00:05:19.915 --> 00:05:20.915
 

00:05:21.765 --> 00:05:22.765
 

00:05:25.655 --> 00:05:26.655
 

00:05:30.025 --> 00:05:31.915
 

00:05:32.525 --> 00:05:33.525
 

00:05:34.245 --> 00:05:35.245
 

00:05:49.425 --> 00:05:50.425
 

00:05:50.795 --> 00:05:51.795
 

00:05:55.995 --> 00:05:56.995
 

00:05:57.465 --> 00:05:58.465
 

00:05:59.145 --> 00:06:00.145
 

00:06:00.735 --> 00:06:02.325
 

00:06:04.465 --> 00:06:05.465
 

00:06:07.135 --> 00:06:08.135
 

00:06:15.485 --> 00:06:16.485
 

00:06:16.545 --> 00:06:17.545
 

00:06:19.725 --> 00:06:21.085
 

00:06:23.545 --> 00:06:24.915
 

00:06:26.965 --> 00:06:28.965
 

00:06:29.915 --> 00:06:30.915
 

00:06:31.085 --> 00:06:32.085
 

00:06:32.965 --> 00:06:33.965
 

00:06:34.265 --> 00:06:35.265
 

00:06:36.645 --> 00:06:39.075

00:06:41.555 --> 00:06:42.785
 

00:06:44.635 --> 00:06:45.965
 

00:06:46.895 --> 00:06:47.895
 

00:06:49.215 --> 00:06:50.215
 

00:06:52.585 --> 00:06:53.585
 

00:06:56.075 --> 00:06:57.075
