Hi guys! This is Christina , the Amputee OT. Iin this video,  I will be riding a bicycle.

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:17.399
I haven't ridden a bicycle since my amputation; in fact, I haven't ridden my bicycle in about

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.900
three years, I  think.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.149
One thing you should remember when you are trying new activities is safety first

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.309
You'll notice that I forgot my helmet and my knee pads and my elbow pads.

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.819
I really should have those, but I forgot them.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.520
So I'm not using them.

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.649
But you should use them.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.170
Okay, here we go.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.280
I'm finding that with a

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.779
prosthetic on the left, it's a little bit difficult to swing your leg

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:18.790
from your bike

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:25.019
over,  because you have to rotate your foot, and you put ends up kind of out of whack. So, for example if I start here

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:32.999
Swing over. Kinda awkward. Swinging back is even more awkward.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.100
So I thought about

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.869
going from the other side.

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.399
Then, this leg is the one

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.559
to get your balance, leaning over is really easy.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:55.899
Swinging back is really easy too. The only problem with mounting your bike from the opposite side is that the kickstand is on THIS side.

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:01.839
That's pretty easy to flip up, as long as you're looking. Actually...

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.439
I'm trying to do without looking. Ugh! There!

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.960
If you want to ride a bike,  your prosthetic probably has to be cut pretty low and back

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:52.640
because you bend your knee pretty high at the top of the pedal stroke; and so if your prosthetic is cut too high,

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:58.490
you won't be able to bend your knee like this, and it'll make riding a bike uncomfortable. So if you have that problem,

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:04.309
You can go to your prosthetist and ask them to adjust your prosthetic so that you are able to ride a bike.

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.340
Let's see what kind of video I can get

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:10.130
from my

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:12.830
makeshift Go Pro!

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:45.459
I'm finding that riding a bike with an amputation is actually pretty easier--It's easier than I thought. I

00:03:46.969 --> 00:03:52.089
was afraid that it would be hard to keep my foot on the pedal, but actually that turns out to be pretty darn easy.

00:03:52.249 --> 00:03:56.199
It's no big deal. My foot did kind of fall off the pedal a couple of times.  I

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:01.779
think if I was into competitive bicycling,  I would probably want a foot that clipped into my bike.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.369
But since I just do it as a hobby occasionally, I probably won't bother to do that.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.039
I can just ride it --just a regular bike,  no adaptations.

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.349
And that is how you ride a bike if you are a left below-the- knee amputee!
