00:00:02.112 --> 00:00:07.283
This is a tutorial on installing a double 
 cylinder deadbolt with a 2-inch backset.

00:00:07.946 --> 00:00:12.488
The backset is the distance from the edge of the 
 door to the center of the doorknob hole.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:16.123
Make sure that the backset of your door is 2 inches.

00:00:16.863 --> 00:00:21.323
If the backset of your door is larger than 2 
 inches, this deadbolt will not work properly.

00:00:21.994 --> 00:00:26.026
Once you've ensured that your deadbolt will fit, it's time to install.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:29.099
Stick the deadbolt through the edge of 
 the door and screw it in place.

00:00:31.167 --> 00:00:36.012
Next, we're going to figure out which cylinder is the exterior cylinder, so we can install that one first.

00:00:36.473 --> 00:00:43.235
Both cylinders have the same flat tailpiece coming off the end--the exterior cylinder, however, does not have screw holes

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.849
Slip the collar on the exterior cylinder, and install 
 it on the outside of the door

00:00:47.849 --> 00:00:52.520
with the tailpiece going vertically through the cross-shaped hole of the latch.

00:00:59.114 --> 00:01:05.856
Please note that the hole in our door sample for the use of this video is bigger than it should be in order to show more details.

00:01:05.856 --> 00:01:10.124
The hole in your door should be about 
 2 and 1/8 inches in diameter.

00:01:18.335 --> 00:01:24.240
Stick the key in the cylinder and throw the deadbolt before you continue with the rest of the installation.

00:01:25.405 --> 00:01:31.785
The interior cylinder is going to be installed with the tailpiece going horizontally, to interlock with the exterior tailpiece.

00:01:32.657 --> 00:01:41.350
However, the interior tailpiece can be flipped 180° and fit into the deadbolt. 
 BUT it only functions correctly one of these two ways.

00:01:42.457 --> 00:01:47.960
It's difficult to tell which way the tailpiece needs to be flipped unless we test it out.

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:55.210
To make sure we have the tailpiece in the right position, we're going to install it once without the collar around it.

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:59.680
Install the cylinder by fitting the tailpiece in place,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.810
and tightening the screws so they go through the deadbolt and connect to the exterior cylinder.

00:02:07.907 --> 00:02:11.670
Once you have the screws in place, insert
the key and test the deadbolt.

00:02:12.362 --> 00:02:15.230
Can the key be removed when the deadbolt is extended?

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.100
Can it be removed when the deadbolt is retracted?

00:02:26.948 --> 00:02:31.420
If the answer to both of these questions is yes, 
 the tailpiece is going the correct direction.

00:02:31.424 --> 00:02:36.380
If the answer is no, the tailpiece needs to be flipped 180°.

00:02:37.315 --> 00:02:43.160
As you can see, ours was not working correctly, so the tailpiece needs to be flipped the other direction.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.000
Re-install the interior cylinder with the tailpiece in the correct position and with the collar in place.

00:03:02.703 --> 00:03:05.340
Test the deadbolt again once you've got everything installed.

00:03:06.171 --> 00:03:12.350
If it all works correctly, congratulations! You successfully installed a double cylinder deadbolt on your door.

00:03:13.745 --> 00:03:14.580
Thanks for watching.
