Whenever you’re doing underarm waxing, you
want to make sure that you cover the clothes

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:13.559
on your client and on yourself. Just tuck
this in just a little bit just to make sure

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:24.740
that you don’t get anything on the clothes,
and we’ll do one more right in this area.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:31.460
You want to start with the pre-appellation
oil and just add a little bit of that on;

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:41.780
not too much because then you won’t be able
to pull the hair out. And another good tip

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:49.170
is that you want to make sure that you cleanse
the area first. And you can just do that by

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:57.760
just wiping the area off, you can use a little
bit of sanitizer. And you want to make sure

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.280
that you just apply the appellation oil on
there, and it’s just to soften the skin

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:15.179
and just to prepare the skin for waxing.
And you just get your wax; the underarm is

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:19.859
split in two most of the time. This lower
half right here, you want to make sure that

00:01:19.859 --> 00:01:27.929
you pull the wax down in a downward motion.
And then you’re going to take your muslin

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:38.119
strip, and apply that to the underarm in the
same fashion that you put on the wax. And

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:44.479
then you’re going to want to pull it, make
sure that you pull the skin, and then you

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:50.259
pull it off. And you want to make sure you
hold that, just apply a little bit of pressure

00:01:50.259 --> 00:02:01.389
because it helps with the pain, and then you
want to do the top half of the underarm. And

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:13.870
again you go with the hair line which is growing
up, and just do a thin layer. And you put

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.079
the muslin strip on the same way that you
put the wax, and you just brush it down just

00:02:20.079 --> 00:02:24.849
a couple of times, and then on this part you
want to make sure that you pull the arm hair,

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:32.090
and then pull again away from the hairline.
And just to help get some of that stickiness

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:36.140
off, and that’s your underarm wax.
