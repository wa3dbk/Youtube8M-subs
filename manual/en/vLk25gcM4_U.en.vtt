Annie’s Unprofessional Redstone Lecture
[Simple Auto Door + Double Switch]

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.400
Hey there, welcome to RedStone Poke, I’m Annie.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.420
Today I’m going to teach you how to make an auto door and bidirectional switches.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.300
And you can see here that I’ve made half of the door here.

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:18.080
Auto door’s like the ones you see at the convenient store.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:19.900
If you get close, the door will open.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.300
How to make this? Very easy.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:27.500
First, you have to lay a circle of redstones beneath the pressure plates.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.400
This is for when you step either on this plate,

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.620
Or this plate,

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:35.920
Or both, the door will open.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.880
Just to prevent it from opening just one side of the door if you only step on one plate.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:39.800
That would be awkward.

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.820
And we will want to make the circuit here connect to the block here

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:48.160
To charge this block.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.840
And if this block is charged than the torch on it will go off.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.320
And the piston will come back.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.060
And because the block above the torch will also be charged,

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.980
So the piston up here will also be activated.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:03.920
It’s as simple as that!

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.200
Like this.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.380
(BGM for Family Mart)

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.400
As simple as that!

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.940
So now what I’ll be teaching is a simpler…oh there’s a torch here.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.020
A simpler double switch.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.960
Yes, so after placing an upside-down L,

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.080
Place two pistons here.

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.540
And put two torches on the sides.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.780
Place a row of redstones up here.

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.700
And that’s it.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.640
We can already achieve the effect of these two blocks pushing each other.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.360
So how can it be made into a switch?

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.240
We…we have to dig a hole

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:48.400
At the very bottom.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.600
Put a torch.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.100
And let this block get charged when this block is moved.

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.180
In other words the circuit connected to it will be charged.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.420
And when the block moves away the connection would be lost.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.180
And to make this into a double switch is very easy.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.860
We just have to connect to circuit to the redstones up here.

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.600
Like…this.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:19.220
Eh…that should do it.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:21.420
Like this.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.340
So let’s connect the circuit to the auto door.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.420
Like this.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.780
Let’ take a look…press this.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:31.420
It opened.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.360
And press this.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:33.700
It closed.

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.940
Press this.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.020
It still opens.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:37.240
Press this.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.400
It closed.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.780
Yes so this is a very easy double switch.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.160
And now, for a rarer one…

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.540
No you can’t say it’s rare….

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.660
We just don’t actually use levers often.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.620
A double switch with levers…

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.320
Is more complicated.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:54.080
But not too complicated.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.220
To put it simple,

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:57.800
I’ll teach you how to make it first.

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.700
Umm…one redstone repeater…

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.720
One block,

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.200
One repeater,

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.160
And one torch here.

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:07.000
And place another repeater beside the torch.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.320
And then…

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.400
Place a piston here.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:12.900
And here a block.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.080
A block here as well.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:18.340
And connect the blocks with redstones.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:21.480
So that, if this torch is pulled,

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.240
We can…um no not torch.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:26.440
When we pull the lever we want the piston to push out.

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:29.600
Okay, then…it’s done.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.180
So now…we can test it.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:35.180
Um…like this.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.620
When we pull this lever it will turn on.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.740
Push it back and it will turn off.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:45.460
Pull, on, back, off.

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.220
And when we pull this and then pull this,

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.240
It turned off again.

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:51.560
Now, pull, and it turned on.

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.040
Anyways, if a lever is moved then it’ll turn off.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.040
Yes.

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.660
If you move either side,

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:01.500
It will turn either on or off.

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.420
And the reason behind this

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:06.720
When now both are

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:09.100
Not activated,

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.220
It’ll not glow.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.420
And if today I pull this one,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.700
It is a simple circuit.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:14.500
In other words…

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.640
It transfer the power through the repeater.

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.880
Blocks are conductive.

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:23.420
And we can directly connect it here.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.620
I think you all know this.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.420
And when I pull down this one,

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:30.200
The reason why it’ll not get activated is that

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:33.040
This power here charged this block,

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.540
So the torch on this block won’t glow.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.600
So the torch did not give any power to this repeater.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.880
So the power for this circuit is cut.

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.180
And then…APA go away!

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.140
Pestering me even when I’m teaching!!!

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.080
Okay so,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.320
When I pull this again it turned on.

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.580
The reason is that this repeater no longer provide power for this block.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:59.520
So this torch burned again.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.800
When it glows it’ll give power to this block.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.660
And then in turn gives power to these redstones.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.840
Yes, so…

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.460
It’s as easy as that.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:15.440
So basically this can also be used for

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.880
This.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:19.280
Let’s connect it.

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:24.940
And because redstones are only effective within 15 blocks so

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.740
Remember to place a repeater in the middle.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.860
And so we can make an auto door with switches.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.020
And can go over to the levers and pull them.

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:35.180
And if you forgot to pull it back it’s okay.

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:38.700
Because it can keep switch on and off on and off.

00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:42.060
Okay, so that’s about it for our lecture today.

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:43.820
Hope it can be useful to you.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:44.880
I’ll see you next time.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.600
Bye~

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.240
Super short additional info lol.

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:49.540
Okay so I thought that the fans would want to ask

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.220
How to make a three block door.

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.360
And it’s really easy.

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:56.440
We just have to add pistons up here.

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:57.980
Add piston…add…

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:01.360
Yes, and add a redstone here.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:03.400
And a redstone here too.

00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:05.460
And it’ll be a three block.

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.840
Because this block is charged, therefore the redstone above it will also be charged.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.320
And now it has become a three block tall door!

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:13.260
Yeah!
