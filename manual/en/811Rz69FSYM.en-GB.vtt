I love bow style hair but sometimes the big

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.119
ones can be a bit much!
Here's a simple mini bow.

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:35.100
Grab a section of hair from the top of your
head and brush it to one side.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.871
This technique is all about making loops of
hair with the elastic so you need a pretty

00:00:38.871 --> 00:00:41.920
stretchy one.
Mine can go over 4 times... so I wrapped it

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.100
twice before starting the bow.
Pull the hair through again but this time

00:00:48.100 --> 00:01:00.039
only a few inches so it's a loop.
Twist the elastic and pull the hair through

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:19.810
again for another loop.
Taadaa you have bow loops.

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:47.140
Now flip them so they face the right way.
And pin them in place.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:02:11.260
So one more time in case you missed it.
You should end up with something like this.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.970
To hide the band use a flower or some kind
of clip.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.790
You can also split up the tail so it curls
on both sides like ribbon tails.

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:38.720
Sweet and cure but not too over the top.
I hope this was a useful video, please check

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:43.010

for more information and tutorials.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:44.720
Thanks so much for watching.
Bye!
