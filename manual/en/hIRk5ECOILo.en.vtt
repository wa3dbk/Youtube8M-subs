00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.930
Having a waterproof or shock proof phone case
is great, but it doesn't do you a lot of good

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.470
if you can't retrieve your phone from where
it's been dropped.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.860
This is the Beeline case for iPhone 6 and
its main goal is to solve that very problem.

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:16.410
Beeline was kind enough to send me these cases
for review and in this review we'll find out

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.430
if Beeline's unique retractable carabiner
make it a worthy companion for your next outdoor

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.870
adventure.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:27.120
The case's primary selling point is a retractable
carabiner that's attached to a durable sprocket

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.530
in the back of the case via a 30" Kevlar cord.

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:33.450
Beeline refers to this as the stinger.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.690
The default mode is known as lock step.

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.579
The stinger pulls out, ratcheting along the
way, and stays where you leave it.

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.620
It retracts by pressing up on the button on
the back.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.230
If you hold up on the button it puts it in
free flow mode.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:49.080
This makes the stinger always retract and
make much less noise when pulling it out.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.730
Unfortunately you can't lock this button in
free flow mode but Beeline did say that's

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.030
something they're looking at for the next
version.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.750
For day to day use I did find myself being
very self-conscious about the ratcheting noise

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.230
that it made when you would pull your phone
out of my pocket.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.619
After all, you don't want to be this guy.

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.659
Thankfully, when you hold the button in the
up position it puts it in free flow mode so

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.340
it's a little less distracting.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.979
All the materials for the stinger feel very
sturdy.

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:20.289
The carabiner is made of zinc and the cord
is a non fraying Kevlar that doesn't give

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:22.869
at all and is surprisingly strong.

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.999
Also the attachment point where the Kevlar
cord meets the carabiner is really strong

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:27.359
as well.

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:30.619
The one downside of the stinger is the amount
of play that the latch has.

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:33.520
Most of the time it will spring back shut
with no problems.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.789
However if it's pressed to one side the latch
will hit the carabiner and not close all the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:38.789
way.

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:42.439
It's an easy fix but it's something that I
wish Beeline would have made a little tighter.

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.820
Most of the time I was able to quickly and
easily snap the stinger onto my belt loop.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.020
And to be honest it's not that noticeable
or distracting.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.799
For ladies on the go this makes a lot of sense.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.899
Just clip the stinger to something on your
purse, tuck your phone away, and you'll never

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:59.380
have to worry about losing your phone again.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.049
The case is a hard plastic material that doesn't
give much at all.

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.890
It has a soft touch smooth finish that makes
it nice to hold and easy to grip and hold

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:07.890
on to.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.702
The volume buttons are labeled with a plus
and minus and are a little harder to press

00:02:10.702 --> 00:02:11.750
than I'd like.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.680
They're also flush with the side of the case
which can make them a little difficult to

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.460
locate without looking.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.900
The mute switch is usually easy to toggle
but can be more difficult with my thumb or

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.060
if you have large fingers.

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:25.710
There are notches in the corners to allow
the edges to flex for installation.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.290
The power button is flush and equally hard
to press.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.920
It's not terrible, it's just harder than I'd
expect.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.880
Along the bottom are individual droplet shaped
openings for the speaker, a pretty normal

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.870
sized lightning connector opening, and a tency
wency headphone jack opening.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.890
I'm not sure why they chose to make this so
small but you're not going to get much more

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.970
than Apple's stock ear pods in here.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.510
I did manage to break the small plastic strip
above the Lightning port opening on one of

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.760
the cases in normal daily use.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.160
Beeline said they would cover this in their
one year manufacturer warranty.

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.050
You do have to be the original owner and show
proof of purchase to qualify, but that's pretty

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.050
standard.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.090
On the back is a compartment where the stinger
stays when not in use as well as the switch

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:02.230
for retracting it.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.610
Usually when retracting the stinger doesn't
go fully into the case.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:09.210
You can easily just press it in the rest of
the way for a tighter fit.

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.830
The camera is pretty deeply recessed but everything
is coated in black and shouldn't cause any

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:13.830
problems with photography.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.680
One of my biggest complaints with this case
is the lack of front protection.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.800
Beeline is obviously trying to make this as
thin as possible given how thick the back

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:23.600
is, but there's barely any lip at all here.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.830
I would highly recommend you pair this with
a durable tempered glass screen protector.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:32.400
The port where the cord enters the back of
the case is fitted with a small metal grommet.

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.740
The quality of the stinger and its associated
components was definitely a focus in designing

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:40.560
this case and it shows.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:45.240
To install the case you place your phone in
button side first and then snap in place.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.740
It snaps on very easily and is a very tight
fit.

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:51.360
Even though there's very little lip I'm not
concerned at all with my phone popping out

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.810
of this case.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.540
To remove you pull the carabiner out of the
way and use the ejection port behind this

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:01.430
area to pop your phone out of the case.

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:06.120
When dropped from pocket height the case ratchets
down a few inches and quickly comes to a stop.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.710
From texting height the stinger will fully
extend before coming to a stop.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.770
My main concern here would be that the phone
would swing around and hit something damaging

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:15.950
the screen since there's little protection
in that area.

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.400
Even when fully extended the case keeps your
iPhone from hitting the ground assuming that

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.430
the attachment point is more than 35" or so
off the ground.

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.349
The durable Kevlar cord and sturdy internal
sprocket were very impressive here.

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.910
I thought the stress of a fall this high might
rip the cord out of the case but it held up

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:32.840
extremely well in my testing.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.330
Don't be tempted by the Beeline marketing
to clip the phone to your body and let it

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:37.330
hang.

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:38.849
Even normal walking causes it to slowly ratchet
down.

00:04:38.849 --> 00:04:42.940
While this is a great case for dry environments
and it will prevent your phone from plummeting

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:47.520
to its death, there'd be a lot more use cases
if it also made your phone waterproof.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.210
I was able to speak with the inventor of Beeline
cases, Brent Williams, and although he wasn't

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.310
prepared to give me actual release dates he
did say that a waterproof version is already

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.370
in the works.

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.270
When I first heard about this case and how
Brent designed it after losing his iPhone

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:03.599
when he dropped it off a ski lift I was immediately
sold on the practicality of it.

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:06.669
After having used it for a number of weeks
I can definitely say it will keep your iPhone

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:07.770
safe by your side.

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:11.580
I just wish that it could do that while canoeing,
white water rafting, or even surfing.

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:15.509
I was very impressed with the durability of
the stinger and ratcheting mechanism.

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.219
Beeline said they have a case they've stress
tested with over 100,000 pulls on it.

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:22.039
You don't have to worry about these components
failing anytime soon.

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:26.740
I don't see this being a daily case for most
people but more of a case you'd use when hiking,

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.659
rock climbing, or biking.

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:32.169
However for people who travel in airports
a lot, construction workers, or motorcycle

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:34.610
riders this case makes a lot of sense.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:37.469
They even have a mossy oak version for hunters.

00:05:37.469 --> 00:05:41.830
You can purchase them from beelinecases.com
or Amazon for $60 with free shipping.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.809
They currently have versions for the iPhone
5 and 5S as well as the 6 and 6 Plus.

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:50.240
