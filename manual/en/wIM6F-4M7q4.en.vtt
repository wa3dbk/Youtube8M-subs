00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160
So here we have some leftover mashed potatoes

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.745
from last night's dinner,

00:00:04.745 --> 00:00:10.120
and Vanessa's going to turn them into potato pancakes

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.977
for this morning's breakfast.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:15.720
Magical way to use leftovers, huh? Yeah.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.451
Good morning. Good morning.

00:00:17.451 --> 00:00:20.171
So here I just have a little, these are of course local,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.080
wonderful Yukon gold potatoes.

00:00:23.093 --> 00:00:25.833
and they were mashed with butter, and milk,

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:29.493
and salt, and pepper, to begin with. To begin with?

00:00:29.493 --> 00:00:31.784
Yeah, and what are you adding right now? And today,

00:00:31.784 --> 00:00:33.584
I'm adding green onions,

00:00:33.584 --> 00:00:36.964
and I'm adding one egg. One egg I saw, yeah.

00:00:36.964 --> 00:00:39.124
And I add a little bit of Himalayan sea salt,

00:00:39.124 --> 00:00:40.544
which is my preference. Yeah.

00:00:40.544 --> 00:00:43.060
A little bit of pepper.

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.260
Okay, and some onion greens?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.068
And some onion greens, yeah. See?

00:00:47.068 --> 00:00:48.580
Little bit of flour.

00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:52.201
If you are allergic to flour, just use potato starch or

00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:54.980
corn flour or whatever you want.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.405
You know, anything to thicken it a little bit.

00:00:57.405 --> 00:01:02.285
A little more, okay.

00:01:02.285 --> 00:01:07.140
Here we have. So, you have a pan hot with butter in it,

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.760
I guess. I do. Butter and what? Butter and oil.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.280
Butter and olive oil.

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.020
So you heat it with olive oil first?

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.359
Yeah. And then add the butter, so it doesn't overheat.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:24.060
Right. Yeah okay. Now, here, I take this.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.736
And I take a spoonful,

00:01:27.736 --> 00:01:30.196
and I put it in my own breadcrumbs.

00:01:30.196 --> 00:01:32.196
Your own breadcrumbs.

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:33.747
Or it could be any breadcrumbs right? Yeah. Okay.

00:01:33.747 --> 00:01:35.560
If you don't have your own.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.618
Oh this is amazing. Bought breadcrumbs, right?

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.620
Okay, and this is a nice patty.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.100
And I like them when they look a little bit, you know.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.580
Rustic. Yeah a little rustic.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.460
Yeah. So, there it goes,

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.035
This needs a little more olive oil.

00:01:49.035 --> 00:01:52.545
And more. I was wondering how you're going to do this,

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.459
because I didn't think of the breadcrumbs.

00:01:55.459 --> 00:01:56.995
Quite soft. I didn't think of the breadcrumbs. Quite soft.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.340
So, that's why you put the breadcrumbs, yeah.

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.380
Quite soft. And you want to keep the softness.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.820
You don't want to have a doughy gush, right? Right.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:09.140
There you go.

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:14.000
Well. Mm Hm. And you don't really need to cook them,

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.180
just brown them, right?

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.674
Yeah, you need to just heat them up.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.800
Yeah. You heat them up. That's pretty amazing.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.920
So? Yeah. And if you like, you could put a dollop

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.160
of sour cream on it, when you serve it on it,

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:28.160
it makes a meal almost by itself,

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.000
with a salad. Yeah. Or you can put a little bit of

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.317
green onions on top, for garnish. Yeah.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.040
Right. Oh, look at this.

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.797
Quick quick, right. I know what I'm having.

00:02:38.797 --> 00:02:40.223
I know what I'm having. Yeah.

00:02:40.223 --> 00:02:43.380
And we have guests. It's fall here,

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.506
at the cottage, and we have guests who want the

00:02:45.506 --> 00:02:49.086
ham omelet, so this is a real nice rustic.

00:02:49.086 --> 00:02:51.680
Homemade. To serve, yeah.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.840
Very homemade, okay. Thank you.

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.180
And this is done. Thanks. Thank you, yeah.

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.680
