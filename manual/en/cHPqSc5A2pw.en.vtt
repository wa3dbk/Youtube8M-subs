00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.500
"My name is Minna Tuominen,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.900
I'm a fifth year finance student at Aalto University School of Business."

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.300
"My name is Erlend LÃ¸ken.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.800
I am currently a summer intern here at Nordea Markets.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.300
My background is mostly Finance.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.000
I have a Bachelor's Degree in Finance and a Master's Degree in Mathematical Finance."

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
"My main responsibilities here is to construct hedging solutions for clients.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I see what kind of interest rate risks they carry and then construct hedging solutions for them."

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.900
"I work at the currency desk.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.000
I especially work towards the customers that trade online."

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
"We sort of get to do what the real employees do."

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
"I want to contribute and make a difference for the department

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
afterwards so my presence have been felt."

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
"In the school you just study books and you learn the theory

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
but in here you see what actually happens is really really different."

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:16.800
"The tasks are huge, they are much larger than what you would get from the text book and they are a lot more complex."

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.500
"Most of my closest colleagues are pretty young so they know exactly what I'm going through. They take really good care of us.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.300
"Usually summer interns get together outside job as well,

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.500
grab a few beers and go to have some parties and stuff so

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.500
so I think it's a very active community socially as well."

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.800
"My colleagues are the best thing about the job.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.000
They are really laid back and we always laugh at work but still everyone is such a professional."

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:54.000
"Being an intern is a great opportunity. Personally, experiencing the Markets on first hand and obviously it's also a career start.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
It's also a way of getting the foot in the door with a big bank as Nordea."

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:05.000
"Nordea also gives opportunities to go abroad to New York, Singapore, Moscow or Shanghai - but I would love to go abroad"

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.000
"With Nordea being the biggest bank in Scandinavia it offers opportunities that simply isn't offered at other banks."

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.000
"I love it here. I feel like a kid in the candy store - I get to do all the stuff I wanted to do."

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:26.500
"I think you learn a lot more what you actually do in Finance by sitting here on the trading floor."

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:34.000
"I think having Nordea Markets on your resume is a very solid statement."

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:41.000
"My advice to future interns here at Nordea Markets is to really

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.000
be proactive, work hard, don't be late."
