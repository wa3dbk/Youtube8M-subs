00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:20.039
By law, Scotch whisky must be matured in oak
casks. Two kinds of oak are

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:26.300
used, American White Oak and European Oak.
The different kinds of oak

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:33.180
have a profound effect on both the color and
the flavor of the mature whisky.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.200
Now, these big casks, beside me are called
butts, they hold approximately

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.290
500 liters of liquid and they are made almost
always from European Oak,

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.269
principally from Spain. They would formally
have contained Sherry. They

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:58.019
have been seasoned with Sherry. While these
little ones are called barrels,

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.710
they are 200 liters in capacity, and they
are made from American White Oak.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:10.310
Now, over the course of time, the contents
of this barrel will be much darker

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.080
in color, it will have a wonderful polished
mahogany sort of color, and in the

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.759
flavors derived from the wood here, will be
much more fruity in terms of

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:24.850
dark fruit, Christmas cakey and spicy notes,
and sometimes, not terribly

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.020
desirable sulphury notes. Whereas from American
White Oak casks these

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:36.539
barrels, the flavors will tend to be more
to do with Vanilla, and coconut, and

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:42.149
the color, a rich golden color, its a much
more brighter yellowy gold color.

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:48.499
Below here, we've got the third style of cask,
which is called a Puncheon

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:54.670
also hold 500 liters same as the old Butt
here; they are mainly made from

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:01.130
European Oak, sometimes from American Oak.
And over here, we've got the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.280
fourth type of cask, which is called a hogshead.
These casks up here are all

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.670
hogsheads. But if you look down here, you
can get a better idea. Hogsheads

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.140
are made from American White Oak, they are
cannibalized barrels. So you

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:25.010
can see the difference in size, you pull together
four barrels to make 3

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.560
hogsheads. So rather than 200 liters, they
hold approximately 250 liters. But

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:43.070
they are almost invariably made from American
White Oak. And most of the

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.480
casks currently in the system are hogsheads,
like these.
