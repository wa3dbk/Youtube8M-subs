00:00:19.866 --> 00:00:22.966
Boy I’m really tired today.

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:29.800
OK, Titan. Just one more
load and we’ll be done.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.400
OK. Mr. Builder.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.566
I’m so tired I can
hardly keep my eyes open.

00:00:39.566 --> 00:00:42.200
Better take a quick nap.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.066
Right here is good.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.633
What’s that Jin?

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:53.566
Oh... this is my
very latest invention.

00:00:53.566 --> 00:00:56.533
It is a rear-view mirror
that lets you see everything!

00:00:56.533 --> 00:00:59.533
- Sounds interesting.
- It is, Amber.

00:00:59.533 --> 00:01:02.500
With regular mirrors you can’t
see everything behind you,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.366
but with this you’ll
even be able to see

00:01:04.366 --> 00:01:06.066
the top and bottom
of the car.

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:08.533
But Jin is that
really necessary?

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.466
Of course! With this mirror,

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:13.233
there are absolutely
no blind spots.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:16.566
- Jin!
- Are you OK?

00:01:16.566 --> 00:01:18.500
Jin, maybe you
should concentrate on

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.000
- what’s ahead of you.
- Yeah.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.400
By the way,
where’d Poli go?

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.366
Oh, Poli’s doing
a safety check

00:01:25.366 --> 00:01:27.266
at the construction
in the park.

00:01:27.266 --> 00:01:31.433
Say... I think Poli would look
much better with this than me.

00:01:31.433 --> 00:01:34.533
Yeah.

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:38.633
- One two three!
- We win!

00:01:38.633 --> 00:01:40.433
OK.

00:01:40.433 --> 00:01:41.400
One, two, three, four...

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.233
- Let’s go hide!
- Wait for me.

00:01:44.233 --> 00:01:48.066
- five, six...
- This spot’s perfect.

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:50.666
No... this is my spot SUJI!

00:01:50.666 --> 00:01:53.833
- It’s my spot too!
- No way!

00:01:53.833 --> 00:01:56.300
Fine...be that way!

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.566
seventeen, eighteen,
nineteen, twenty!

00:01:59.566 --> 00:02:02.200
Here I come!

00:02:04.566 --> 00:02:06.100
Found ya!

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.166
I let ya find me.

00:02:12.233 --> 00:02:14.933
Got ya! Guess not.

00:02:14.933 --> 00:02:17.033
She must be around
here somewhere.

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:19.000
Let’s check over
at the playground.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.433
OK.

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:25.366
I’m good at this game.

00:02:28.066 --> 00:02:30.633
Hey, boys. Sorry but the
playground’s under construction

00:02:30.633 --> 00:02:34.066
Uh Mr. Builder... have you
seen my sister, SUJI?

00:02:34.066 --> 00:02:37.300
SUJI? No I haven’t
seen her for weeks.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.833
Where can she be?

00:02:40.833 --> 00:02:44.733
SUJI! SUJI! SUJI! SUJI!

00:02:44.733 --> 00:02:46.833
- What’s going on?
- SUJI!

00:02:46.833 --> 00:02:48.566
- What happened, Doug?
- Hi Poli.

00:02:48.566 --> 00:02:51.300
We were playing hide and seek,
but we can’t find SUJI.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.266
Has she been gone long?

00:02:53.266 --> 00:02:56.933
I know I saw SUJI
walking this way.

00:02:56.933 --> 00:03:00.000
Is that...? SUJI!

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
- What are you doing?
- Oh, you found me.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.933
Get out of there! That’s
not a safe place to hide!

00:03:06.933 --> 00:03:08.866
I… wonder how long I slept!

00:03:08.866 --> 00:03:11.700
I better get going!

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.333
- SUJI!
- SUJI!

00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:17.000
They’re in danger!

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.866
All clear in back.

00:03:19.866 --> 00:03:23.166
Titan stop! Look behind you!

00:03:28.833 --> 00:03:31.900
Hey.
What did you do that for?

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.000
Sorry, Titan... but look.

00:03:37.633 --> 00:03:40.133
- Are you two OK?
- Yes.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.866
So you’re both alright?

00:03:43.866 --> 00:03:47.000
Yep...but I wouldn’t be
if you hadn’t saved us!

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.200
Or if I hadn’t found you.

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.833
I’m so sorry. I should have
been much more careful.

00:03:53.833 --> 00:03:56.900
I think we’re all very lucky
that nothing terrible happened.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.033
But kids, there are some things
that you have to remember.

00:04:00.033 --> 00:04:01.166
OK!

00:04:01.166 --> 00:04:04.933
Never play around cars or
trucks or underneath them.

00:04:04.933 --> 00:04:07.133
- Right!
- Why?

00:04:07.133 --> 00:04:11.233
- Because they have blind spots.
- What’re they?

00:04:11.233 --> 00:04:13.533
Well there are certain
spots around cars,

00:04:13.533 --> 00:04:16.266
trucks and buses
that drivers can’t see,

00:04:16.266 --> 00:04:17.966
called blind spots.

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:21.166
The bigger the vehicle is,
the bigger the blind spots are.

00:04:21.166 --> 00:04:24.733
If children like you walk or
play in these blind spots,

00:04:24.733 --> 00:04:26.433
the drivers can’t see you.

00:04:26.433 --> 00:04:28.166
What would happen
if a truck moved

00:04:28.166 --> 00:04:30.533
with you in its blind spot?

00:04:30.533 --> 00:04:35.966
Blam! A bad accident!
Just terrible!

00:04:35.966 --> 00:04:39.233
- That’s scary.
- Yes.

00:04:39.233 --> 00:04:43.066
That’s why you should never
play or run around any vehicle.

00:04:43.066 --> 00:04:43.733
Right!

00:04:43.733 --> 00:04:47.600
Poli, what should I do if our
ball goes under a car or truck?

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.800
- Yeah!
- If that happens,

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.866
You have to ask the driver
or an adult to help you.

00:04:52.866 --> 00:04:54.600
If you try to get it out
yourself

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.300
and the truck moves,
an accident could happen.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.066
- Got it?
- Yes, Poli!

00:04:59.066 --> 00:05:02.766
We’ll do just what you say!

00:05:02.766 --> 00:05:06.066
Poli... just try it on!

00:05:08.133 --> 00:05:10.766
Thanks but, no thanks.
Not for me.

00:05:10.766 --> 00:05:14.633
But Poli I made it
just for you!

00:05:14.633 --> 00:05:15.833
Poli!!
