00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:07.290
well there's my hinge this is how I had
to mount it so I can open it and then

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:16.980
open the door and I didn't make the
inside too small what I did was raise

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.519
the bottom of it four inches which
really removed a whole bunch of cubic

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.570
inches that this thing would need to
heat up and if it still doesn't heat up

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.989
I'm gonna bring the back end the same
amount four inches but I've had this out

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:38.989
here now for about thirty minutes and

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.160
was that up to

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:53.580
about two and a quarter and that's not
bad for just 30 minutes so I'm going to

00:00:53.580 --> 00:01:00.000
adjust this a couple of times over the
next hour and I'll show you what the

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:10.590
final temperature is all right it's been
about hour that is officially the

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:21.660
hottest I've ever got this 275 I'm
thinking I still may need to fill the

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.580
back of this thing in a few inches
that's a whole lot of cubic inches to

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.759
heat up for no reason I'm beginning to
understand that when you build a solar

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.820
oven it just doesn't make any sense to
build it any bigger then your pot you

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.960
know just the size that get whatever
you're gonna cook you in there and

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:50.690
that's it but I want to make this work
I'm pretty sure I can get it to 300 and

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.040
if I close that back in bring it in four
and a half inches like I did the bottom

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:06.750
I think it'll be satisfactory I have a
friend who's made a solar oven and his

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:11.880
solar oven has got the highest
temperature achieved so far on YouTube

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:22.680
and if you want to see that it's jww m2
and I've got his channel featured on my

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:29.459
youtube homepage Erica just look down on
the right lower right you can click on

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:35.070
that go right to his channel so I'll try
this in another hour and see what we've

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.810
gotten up to and that'll be about two
and a half hours out here and surely

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.459
it'll be as high as it'll get by then

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:52.960
yeah we're at 300 if this didn't get any
hotter than that I could live with that

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:59.530
I sort of neglected this I didn't come
out and adjust it and to the Sun you

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:07.180
know and it was way off so I'm gonna I'm
gonna give it a half-an-hour and check

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.830
it one more time because it might have
got hotter than that while I was gone I

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:16.420
was well I was in there on the computer
you know how you get lost sometimes and

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.680
lose track of time so this time I'm
gonna be diligent I'm gonna come back in

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:28.630
exactly a half an hour and that I'd be
about as high as it will get all right

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:39.700
one more clip well it's just a tick over
300 like maybe 305 maybe 310 and I want

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.580
to stop the test I'm happy with 300 I
don't know what happened I just cut it

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.440
off by mistake
I'm happy with 300 I can cook pretty

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.650
much anything I want to at 300 degrees
if it ever does get hotter than that

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:02.050
I'll be sure to let you know and I may
actually cook something in it tomorrow

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:09.070
and now I'm gonna put this video up and
then I'm gonna sit down I'm going to

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:16.959
tell you a very long very bizarre story
including my getting fired never been

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.240
fired my entire life but that stories
coming up look where it soon at a

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:31.650
newsstand near you well I thought I'd
check it one more time and it's actually

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:45.860
about 325 or so but look at this my
glass cracked and that's the it's the

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:53.720
inside piece I mean it cracked a lot so
I'm gonna have to remove that and I

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:59.530
bought these they're supposed to be
tempered oh well
