00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.630
matchday is when all medical

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.160
students across the country find out

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.299
where they're going to be placed for

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.630
internship and residency they start

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:20.550
applying early in the fall and they

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.010
interview throughout the winter months

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:23.590
and then

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.140
they place their list of where they

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.930
prefer and a rank list is submitted to

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:31.090
a national database the computer

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.650
basically lines up the programs with the

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.450
students and then instead of having

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.520
multiple offers and it'd be very

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.710
confusing they find out what is matched

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.390
how they matched up with the program and

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.320
they get

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.520
told where they're going basically

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.329
I will say that every year we try to

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:02.040
deliver the match envelopes in a

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.739
different manner this idea came from one

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.390
of the current fourth-year students who

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.000
I think they know who they are last year

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.330
someone suggested that we do Piñatas

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:17.460
the idea of 50 of you with 50 bats did

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.820
not seem to be a good idea so what we

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.070
did we've actually looked into pull

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.520
string Piñatas and the idea morphed into

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.789
what you see here so to design it when

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:34.399
you pull it your results will be inside

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.340
a round of applause for everybody

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.959
were so proud
