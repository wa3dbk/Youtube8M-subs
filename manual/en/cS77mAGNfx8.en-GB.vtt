00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.450
This would've been a great video

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:03.450
it really would

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.180
Special halloween treats from Google+

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.160
and look at the setup, fabulous!

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.330
*aha gary c*

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:11.330
What can I say?

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:12.879
The audio recorded but it

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:14.530
recorded really badly

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:15.540
and I wasn't happy with it

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.199
So let's get on with the video

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:18.789
and I'll try and let you know

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:20.570
what went down as it happened

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:21.750
I'm reading the sign right now

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.550
the little, little letter they sent me

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.550
and it said "Dear Gary,

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:25.550
you're amazing"

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.550
Well it didn't say that

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.550
but, right now I'm doing the

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.550
voiceover so I get to

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.550
say what goes

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.949
Anyway, it said carve your

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:33.380
scariest, funniest, most unusual

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.110
pumpkin and share your creation

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.870
on Google+ Google+ Google+

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:39.130
and it was all for the

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.380
YouTube pumpkin challenge

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.390
They sent me a little camera

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.810
a little Logitech camera

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:45.160
So I could go on Google hangouts

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:46.160
So I'm gonna give that

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.160
to my mum

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.160
because then she can

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:49.380
talk to my, to my nephew

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:50.510
Not very Halloween and scary

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:51.990
but very festive

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:53.190
So I'm checking through my stuff

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.190
Checking I've got all the

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.520
right bits and pieces

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:57.760
Slice open the pumpkin

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.190
Be very careful with that knife

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:00.190
because you know

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.190
I'm a danger to myself

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.190
and to others

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.190
Scooping out the bits

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:04.190
even made a little joke

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:05.780
"I'm spilling my seed everywhere!"

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.270
I thought I was hilarious

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.549
So I'm gagging and I'm

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:10.930
disgusted at the peasantry

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:12.180
of it all, scooping out bits

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.180
because you know me

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.210
I'm not one for the manual labours

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.210
So I'm scooping away

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:17.210
scooping away

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:18.450
Put his little hat on just

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.799
to show that it still works

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:20.799
because I cut it at

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:21.799
an angle, I did it right

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:24.399
Draw on a Harry Potter scar

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:25.399
Well not scar

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:26.749
Harry Potter lightening bolt because

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:27.840
that's what I wanted to do

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.840
If you notice you'll see the

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.960
Dumbledore office behind me

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:31.960
because I thought, you know

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.960
I went to Harry Potter recently

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.960
I'm doing a Harry Potter

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.520
video soon, keep it festive

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.780
keep it festive!

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.259
Tried to light a candle

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:40.409
unfortunately the lighter

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.409
didn't work

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:42.409
Went on a ten minute

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:43.409
run round the house

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.409
trying to find a lighter or

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.409
something because I

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:46.409
don't smoke

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.409
and it didn't light again

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:48.409
even a match didn't light

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:49.409
But I got there in the end

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:50.569
despite all the dramas

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:51.749
my Harry Potter pumpkin

00:01:51.749 --> 00:01:52.749
was finished

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:54.450
simple but effective

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.460
Special thanks to lizzy

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:56.680
from Google+ for sending

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:57.680
me all the little bits

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.680
and pieces

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.680
and thank you for watching

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.680
please give the video a

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:01.680
thumbs up

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.680
Happy Halloween

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.680
Take care of yourselves

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:04.680
I'll see you very soon

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.990
*blows kiss*
