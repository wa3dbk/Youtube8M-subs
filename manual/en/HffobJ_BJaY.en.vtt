My Korean Husband. Hi guys

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.660
we are from My Korean Husband blog

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.090
and we are going to answer some of your questions. Han what are you wearing?

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.090
My concept is "Nerd". Its my daughter's pants. The glasses?

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.890
My wife's glasses. He is family man. Very family

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.980
Okay first question from Meg: I want to ask about their experiences during

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:34.010
holidays in Australia, for example Christmas

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.120
here vs Korea. I think

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.670
Christmas in Australia and Korea

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.850
are different, Like Australia

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.940
the Christmas is more for family thing

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.510
but in Korea its for couples and friends, so I  remember when I was

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:55.610
in Korea I really hate Christmas because I

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.610
was single.... all the time.. except one. And I moved to Australia

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.390
and I had Christmas with my wife's family ant

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.270
it was really good, it was the best Christmas ever and I prefer

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.439
Australian Christmas than Korean Christmas

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:18.020
Yeah I used to hate Christmas in Korea especially when I was in Navy

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.080
Christmas in The Navy with a bunch of guys...

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.080
not fun

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.549
we had to watch Home Alone, such a like

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.960
Korean Christmas thing to do on Christmas Day

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.729
if you are single and if you stay with your family

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:40.860
like it's kinda like traditional
traditional thing

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.079
like we watch Home Alone

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.200
a whole series during the christmas

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.640
holiday. Sophie invited to her

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.920
family Christmas party and

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.299
because I was by myself in Australia

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:02.810
so she said I can come and there was some

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.799
interesting things in Sophie's family that they

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:09.860
sing a Christmas Carol

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.250
after have lunch and that was pretty fun

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.300
that's not the thing my family would do

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.580
so that was really interesting, its like family day

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.050
in Australia so I felt

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:29.040
Christmas Day in Australia is really

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.220
impressed impressive

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.450
Yeah I really like Australian Christmas because

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.069
there is so many good foods

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.739
also have

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.900
getting the presents from people

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.150
and don't need to do anything, just enjoy your christmas day

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.940
and if you need to work its a public holiday

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:03.129
you get paid more, double, which is really good, so I like Australian Christmas

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.390
yeah and also I was really shocked on christmas day

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:10.040
everything closed... shut

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.510
but everything opens in korea everything

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:18.260
all motels, hotels booked up, booked out

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.780

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.069
put this on the video. Next question

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:29.670

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.810

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:05.650
Doralis Coriano Ortiz

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.760
Hello Hugh and Han, besides English is there another language

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.780
that you consider is popular among Korean language learners?

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.910
and what other language would you like

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:19.940
to be fluent in?

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.940
Yeah I want to learn Chinese...Spanish

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:30.640
I want to learn French

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.440
or Italian

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.070
actually I want to learn British English, I want to have British accent

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:42.970
I guess Japanese

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:47.080
is very popular in Korea

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.860
