00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:17.789
now this process is called grafting and
I'm actually going to create a new

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.529
stitch to hold these two sides together
so I am going to take the yarn from the

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.660
back one or the front one it really
doesn't matter put it in that blunt

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:40.559
needle and I am going to go and create a
new stitch I take one stitch from this

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:49.950
side and of course this stitch already
has half of the yarn through and I take

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:57.090
it off my needle and go there and take
half of the next one this is the next

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:05.360
stitch I'll take it out so I go and
create a new stitch if you can see it

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:16.380
there it goes I take that other half and
half of the next stitch right there take

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:26.100
it off my needle that is the other half
of the stitch that we left behind and I

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:36.659
will take half of the other stitch go
through that one and this is half of the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:47.700
last one here and I take the new one and
as you can see we're having a complete

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:57.689
new row of stitches go ahead and grab
the half of the back one and take half

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.849
of the next one take it off your needle
I take this one off too...

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:08.729
go through the

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:16.650
half of this one
and half of the next 1/2 of this one and

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:26.830
half of the next one take it off my
needle half of this one and take the

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:36.100
next one and I go through the other half
of the one that I took off and half of

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:47.440
the next stitch take it off
do the same here go through the same one

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:55.300
that you took off on this side get half
of that one take it off your needle take

00:02:55.300 --> 00:03:01.930
the half of the one that you left off on
the other side and get half of that one

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:11.980
get it off your needle and we are
creating a complete new row these will

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:17.760
be put back if you want to we can
stretch them put them back in place

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:26.170
because that can be done you can create
the new stitch there as you can see it

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:39.190
it doesn't show I go half of that one
half of the next one that's the other

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:49.240
half take half of the one on this needle
take it off your needle get the other

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:58.780
half here and the other half there take
it off your needle and that's the other

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:09.010
half get at the other half on the other
needle take it off take half of this one

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:17.080
and half of the next one and as you can
see I'm creating a brand new stitch

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:23.930
which is that one I am creating a brand
new stitch and if I want it to

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:35.090
neater I just go and pull that which is
the one stitch that we are creating and

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:41.360
there we go and that's what it looks
like I have to pull the ones at the

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:48.680
beginning a little which I already have
the yarn there put them there and that's

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:56.449
it that's the way grafting goes now
with grafting you are creating a

00:04:56.449 --> 00:05:03.110
brand new stitch by knitting back and
forth by sewing it back and forth and on

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:09.530
the other side there is no traces
there's no lines there's no seams there

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.630
you go it's you're creating a new stitch
that's the way it looks in the front

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:21.220
that's the way it looks in the back
there you go
