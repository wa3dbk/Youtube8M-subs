MIKE SPINELLI: Hey, welcome to
Drive Central, the nucleus of

00:00:07.046 --> 00:00:10.006
Drive, where the Golgi bodies
of the mitochondria and the

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:11.876
endoplasmic reticulum--

00:00:11.876 --> 00:00:12.866
yeah.

00:00:12.866 --> 00:00:18.716
Follow us on @DRIVE and also
at facebook.com/drivetv.

00:00:18.716 --> 00:00:22.736
That's nice work, Ian.

00:00:22.736 --> 00:00:24.426
So this week on Tuned,
Matt Farah

00:00:24.426 --> 00:00:25.736
drives an electric DeLorean.

00:00:25.736 --> 00:00:29.766
And I my promise not to make
a single movie reference.

00:00:29.766 --> 00:00:31.056
88 miles an hour--

00:00:31.056 --> 00:00:32.416
let's watch.

00:00:32.416 --> 00:00:34.526
MATT FARAH: Ah, the DeLorean,
the car that

00:00:34.526 --> 00:00:35.786
made me love cars.

00:00:35.786 --> 00:00:38.706
From its stainless steel
construction, Giugiaro

00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:42.166
styling, and a role in one of
my favorite movie franchises

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.376
of all time.

00:00:43.376 --> 00:00:44.646
What's not to love?

00:00:44.646 --> 00:00:46.736
Well, there is something
not to love, actually.

00:00:46.736 --> 00:00:47.696
And that's the engine.

00:00:47.696 --> 00:00:49.746
Because although it does
work, it is boring.

00:00:49.746 --> 00:00:52.116
And I have been on a quest
to find a better,

00:00:52.116 --> 00:00:53.906
faster, cool DeLorean.

00:00:53.906 --> 00:00:56.186
So far it's been my unicorn.

00:00:56.186 --> 00:00:57.286
MIKE SPINELLI: Marty!

00:00:57.286 --> 00:00:58.536
Doc!

00:01:00.426 --> 00:01:01.956
That's Tuned every
Monday on Drive.

00:01:01.956 --> 00:01:04.806
And Tuesday on Live and Let
Drive, Alex shows up at the UK

00:01:04.806 --> 00:01:07.556
home of Chris Harris of
Chris Harris on Cars.

00:01:07.556 --> 00:01:10.396
What happens next defies any
explanation I can give.

00:01:10.396 --> 00:01:11.626
Let's take a look.

00:01:11.626 --> 00:01:13.846
CHRIS HARRIS: Last year, I was
in a market town near here.

00:01:13.846 --> 00:01:15.046
And I was in something
like this.

00:01:15.046 --> 00:01:18.746
I think I was in another GT3,
a press car, maybe an RS.

00:01:18.746 --> 00:01:19.866
And I parked it up.

00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:24.046
And in front of me was a lovely
jalopy that had a

00:01:24.046 --> 00:01:25.796
wood-burning furnace
in it or something.

00:01:25.796 --> 00:01:27.686
And it had one chimney hanging
out the top of it.

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:28.776
And it was about 20 years old.

00:01:28.776 --> 00:01:29.756
It was falling apart.

00:01:29.756 --> 00:01:30.716
And this family got out.

00:01:30.716 --> 00:01:31.566
And they were very earthy.

00:01:31.566 --> 00:01:32.866
And they were quite hippyish.

00:01:32.866 --> 00:01:36.336
And they looked really cool and
happy and didgeridooish.

00:01:36.336 --> 00:01:38.706
And they just looked like they
were having a lovely time.

00:01:38.706 --> 00:01:41.676
But the parents clearly
judged the vehicle.

00:01:41.676 --> 00:01:43.136
They saw me get out
the car and just

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:44.246
thought, capitalist scum.

00:01:44.246 --> 00:01:45.726
ALEX ROY: Right.

00:01:45.726 --> 00:01:46.902
CHRIS HARRIS: That
upset me a bit.

00:01:46.902 --> 00:01:47.356
I'm not like that.

00:01:47.356 --> 00:01:48.518
I don't live my life
like that.

00:01:48.518 --> 00:01:49.362
I just happen to like cars.

00:01:49.362 --> 00:01:51.786
It's doesn't mean I'm evil.

00:01:51.786 --> 00:01:54.789
But as they got out, they
looked at this car-- the

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:55.526
parents did-- and walked away.

00:01:55.526 --> 00:01:57.041
But one of their children-- they
had three children-- one

00:01:57.041 --> 00:01:59.876
of their children, the littlest
one, looked at their

00:01:59.876 --> 00:02:01.796
Dad and went, that's a GT3 RS.

00:02:01.796 --> 00:02:02.936
[LAUGHING]

00:02:02.936 --> 00:02:03.976
I loved that.

00:02:03.976 --> 00:02:05.776
That proved to me the
irrepressible

00:02:05.776 --> 00:02:07.875
nature of young people's--

00:02:07.875 --> 00:02:08.926
and just human being's--

00:02:08.926 --> 00:02:10.106
attachment to these things.

00:02:10.106 --> 00:02:11.816
ALEX ROY: Cars and children.

00:02:11.816 --> 00:02:12.556
CHRIS HARRIS: We
just love cars.

00:02:12.556 --> 00:02:15.216
And this kid's obviously
watched stuff here.

00:02:15.216 --> 00:02:16.416
His parents have tried
to stop him

00:02:16.416 --> 00:02:17.716
watching this thing probably.

00:02:17.716 --> 00:02:18.716
They said, get away from it.

00:02:18.716 --> 00:02:20.036
Get the garlic out.

00:02:20.036 --> 00:02:22.196
MIKE SPINELLI: That was mega.

00:02:22.196 --> 00:02:23.896
That's Live and Let Drive
every Tuesday.

00:02:23.896 --> 00:02:26.806
And on Wednesday, Chris Harris
drives something awesome.

00:02:26.806 --> 00:02:29.246
And wait til you see
how it turns out.

00:02:29.246 --> 00:02:30.496
Let's see a clip.

00:02:56.218 --> 00:02:59.186
That's Chris Harris on cats.

00:02:59.186 --> 00:02:59.986
No.

00:02:59.986 --> 00:03:02.446
That's Chris Harris on Cars
every Wednesday on Drive.

00:03:02.446 --> 00:03:05.481
And on Thursday, Jalopnik TV
goes behind the mystery of a

00:03:05.481 --> 00:03:09.156
Dino Ferrari once buried in a
Los Angeles backyard more than

00:03:09.156 --> 00:03:10.576
30 years ago.

00:03:10.576 --> 00:03:12.538
Let's see a clip of that one.

00:03:12.538 --> 00:03:32.756
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:32.756 --> 00:03:33.626
MIKE SPINELLI: Hi, neighbor.

00:03:33.626 --> 00:03:35.196
Hi, neighbor.

00:03:35.196 --> 00:03:36.126
I'm your--

00:03:36.126 --> 00:03:37.896
all right.

00:03:37.896 --> 00:03:40.366
That's Jalopnik TV every
Thursday on Drive.

00:03:40.366 --> 00:03:42.246
And don't forget to watch
Shakedown with Leo Parente

00:03:42.246 --> 00:03:45.636
every Monday and Friday for his
biting pre- and post-race

00:03:45.636 --> 00:03:48.016
analysis and General Motors
sports nerdiness.

00:03:48.016 --> 00:03:50.036
That's Shakedown on Drive.

00:03:50.036 --> 00:03:52.216
And if you want your faded old
beater to look like a show

00:03:52.216 --> 00:03:53.696
car, probably out of luck.

00:03:53.696 --> 00:03:56.816
But watching Larry Kosilla on
Drive Clean can't hurt.

00:03:56.816 --> 00:04:00.130
So don't face another Saturday
night without Drive Clean with

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:00.816
Larry Kosilla.

00:04:00.816 --> 00:04:03.676
And that is it for Drive
Central this week.

00:04:03.676 --> 00:04:05.996
We'll see you next week
for more awesome Drive

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:07.086
programming.

00:04:07.086 --> 00:04:09.276
Yeah, Drive--

00:04:09.276 --> 00:04:10.526
what the hell is--
what the hell?

00:04:14.516 --> 00:04:15.966
I had nothing for that.

00:04:15.966 --> 00:04:17.706
OK, see you, neighbor.

00:04:17.706 --> 00:04:20.886
Bye, neighbor.

00:04:20.886 --> 00:04:21.836
Mr. Rogers, right?

00:04:21.836 --> 00:04:22.396
You remember Mr. Rog--

00:04:22.396 --> 00:04:22.896
all right.

00:04:22.896 --> 00:04:23.566
See ya.

00:04:23.566 --> 00:04:24.522
See you next week.
