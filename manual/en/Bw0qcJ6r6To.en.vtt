00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:11.070
Perky-Pet速 offers an array of squirrel-resistant feeders. Our number one selling

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:16.379
squirrel-resistant feeder is from the
Squirrel Be Gone速 family. As you can see,

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.330
not only is it highly functional, the
feeder is weight activated and closes

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.400
the seed ports so the squirrels can't
feed, but it also has a decorative finish

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.130
as well, perfect for any backyard.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.720
Before using your feeder, remove the
label sleeve.

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.550
Directions for the feeder are inside the
sleeve.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.880
Simply press down on the roof of the
feeder, and gently lift the spring-loaded

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.100
cap.
Fill the feeder with up to two pounds of

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.390
your choice of mix seed.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.910
Replace the cap and let the cage slide
up.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.799
You are now ready to hang your Squirrel
Be Gone速 Wild Bird Feeder.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.210
Birds will be able to feed using the
bird preferred u-shaped perches at each

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.130
of the six feeding ports. The weight
activated mechanism of the Squirrel

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.149
Be Gone速 feeder will cause the feeding
ports to close if a squirrel should try

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.910
and steal the seed.
You can adjust the springs to make the

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:30.210
feeder more effective. Locate the springs
on the side of the feeder. The top hole

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.780
is for a lighter weight and will close
off the ports for squirrels and large

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.790
birds. To increase the weight required
for the squirrel and allow larger birds

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.830
to feed, lower the cage. Move the
spring-loaded hooks on to sides of the

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.590
feeder to one of the lower holes on the
decorative leaf.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.000
To make sure you have the proper setting,
adjust the springs in single increments

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.229
from the top hold down, until you lessen
the amount of squirrels attempting to

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.710
steal seed.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.420
Remember to clean your feeder every two
weeks with mild soapy water. Rinse

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.420
thoroughly and dry completely; wet seed
will cause mold to grow, which can be

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.290
harmful for birds.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.360
Keep your feeder clean and filled with
seed, and you'll be able to experience

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.099
many hours of bird-watching.
