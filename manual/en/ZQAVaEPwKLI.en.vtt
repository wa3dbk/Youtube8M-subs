00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:05.740
So you've laid down a couple of instrument tracks
in your Pro Tools session.

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:09.449
Let's recap on just how easy it is to create 
an instrument track,

00:00:09.449 --> 00:00:13.319
assign a sound, record it, and edit.

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:17.970
So here are the drums on the piano part that
we recorded in the previous video.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:24.349
The drum region, the piano region, and the
duplicates that we made.

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.240
Okay, let's use the Track Menu to create another Instrument track

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.780
To name it, just double-click the track header.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.350
And to assign an instrument or sound just click here,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.010
and choose one from the list.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.649
Let's record enable the track

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.930
and audition the bass patch.

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:54.000
Nice!

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Here we go.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.000
So again I want to duplicate the region.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.490
Just select it, and then hit CTRL D 
(Command D, Mac OS) to make the copy.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.000
Let's listen to playback.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.200
Okay so let's use the MIDI Editor to make
a change to that bassline.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.500
I'm going to delete these three notes.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.000
Gone!

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.950
I'm going to also delete the little bass run
just here, just hit backspace, or delete

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:01.439
and they're gone.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.000
To close the MIDI editor, simply click the divider line. Nice!
