hi youtube

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.060
today's video is so important

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.740
so the video is how to increase ram performance on low end devices

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:15.200
who use to carry 256 mb or 512 mb ram

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:20.140
thats amount of ram is very low for todays generation

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.540
first of all u need a class 10 external sd card

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.160
thats very important to have class 10 sd card because it gives you the max swap speed

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.600
now we have to install the roehsoft ram expander

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.600
the amount of ram is default 512 mb

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.700
but

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.920
I'm doing only 128 mb ram

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.540
you can choose 512 mb ram because its default

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.200
swappiness set to 100

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.700
now activate the swap

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.140
it will take some time to create the swap file

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:10.740
now we can see the total ram free is 494 mb

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.000
memory total 494 mb

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.180
now it is little bit fast

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.760
you can play HD games

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:27.820
and

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.420
you can do multi tasking

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:35.360
thanks for watching this video, guys

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.140
hope you enjoyed !!

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.780
bye

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.140
