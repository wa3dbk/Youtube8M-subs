00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.430
I'm often asked which essential oil diffuser
is best because there's several different

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:07.440
types to choose from depending on how you
want to use it.

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.730
So today I'm going to tell you what you need
to know in order to choose an essential oil

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.620
diffuser.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:21.570
A diffuser is something that disperses an
essential oil into the air so that you have

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:26.830
a constant stream of good smelling therapeutic
essential oils floating around.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.010
There are four different types of essential
oil diffusers: Nebulizing, humidifying, evaporative,

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:34.010
and heat diffusers.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.320
We're gonna be talking about each of these
today in the video.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.199
The first one we're gonna be talking about
is the nebulizing diffuser.

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:49.730
A nebulizing diffuser is one that you screw
an entire bottle of essential oils into.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.719
There is a small plastic tube that goes into
the essential oil bottle, an the other end

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.039
has a focused stream of air passing right
over it.

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:03.160
And this creates a vacuum to pull up more
oil from the bottom at the same time it breaks

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.200
up the essential oil quickly and disperses
it into the room as tiny droplets.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.979
The nebulizing diffuser is a work horse and
it quickly saturates a room with essential

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:13.979
oils.

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:19.390
This means that it goes through essential
oils more quickly, but it is perfect for large

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.390
spaces.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.950
It's usually a good idea to use the timer
on your diffuser so that it's only running

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.649
15 minutes out of every hour because too much
essential oil in the air will be overwhelming

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.190
to your senses.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:40.250
This type of diffuser also tends to run a
little louder than the others.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.909
Ultrasonic diffusers are also known as humidifying
diffusers.

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:47.799
They break up the essential oil into super
fine particles, much finer than the nebulizing

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:48.799
diffuser.

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.439
The super fine particles are much easier for
your lungs to absorb.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.009
So let me show you how to set one of these
up.

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:57.520
This is the AromaReady diffuser.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:58.979
The top comes off like this.

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.229
Fill it up with water to the fill line, I
already have that done, and then you add about

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.680
three to five drops of essential oils depending
on the size of your room and how saturated

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.700
you want the air.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.390
So I'm just gonna put three in.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.150
And I'm using Wild Orange here.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:16.819
The top goes back on.

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.730
Turn it on.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.690
And then a mist will come out the top.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.010
So this fine mist is a combination of water
and essential oils.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.870
Creating a mist from water usually requires
heat, but the ultrasonic diffuser does it

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:33.870
differently.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.780
There is a small disc underneath the water
that is made to vibrate very fast.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.290
This is what creates the mist so no heat is
required.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.599
The ultrasonic diffuser has a nice gentle
water sound while it's running.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:50.820
And you can consider this diffuser a gentle
diffuser in general because it doesn't use

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:56.040
up a lot of oils and it doesn't blow the mist
anywhere, it depends on the air flow in the

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.810
room to disperse the mist.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.750
Now on to evaporative diffusers.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:11.299
These diffusers depend on a fan that blows
through a pad or a filter that has essential

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.780
oils dropped onto it.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.590
This evaporates the oil and sends it out into
the room.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.430
Some are battery operated.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.930
There are even ones you can hook into your
computer through USB.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.330
There's even a manual called a Whispi diffuser.

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:33.930
You put a drop or two of oil on the pad and
then pump it yourself.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.110
Another type of evaporative diffusers are
ones that don't utilize a fan but depend on

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:43.950
the air in the room to slowly evaporate the
oil in a small area.

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.260
These are usually personal diffusers, so diffuser
necklaces, diffuser bracelets, or diffuser

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.610
pendants that you can hang in your car.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.739
There's one drawback to evaporative diffusers
and that is the lighter more volatile molecules

00:03:56.739 --> 00:03:58.760
will evaporate more quickly than the heavier
ones.

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.950
So you won't get the whole oil all at once,
you'll get the lighter molecules at first

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.950
and the heavier ones later on.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.950
If you remember my video about How Essential
Oils Work, you'll remember that the whole

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.280
oil has different therapeutic properties than
just parts of the oil.

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.940
So this type of diffusion may affect the therapeutic
qualities.

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.790
But despite that this is still a great way
to get the aroma of the oil into the air and

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:28.890
into your own personal space.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.950
Heat diffusers use heat to evaporate the oil.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:35.750
So just like evaporative diffusers, you'll
run into the same problem of not having the

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.040
whole in the air at once but just parts of
it at a time.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:44.571
These diffusers are completely silent and
if you're looking to buy one, you'd want to

00:04:44.571 --> 00:04:49.530
find one that uses a low level of heat because
high levels of heat can change the composition

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:50.760
of an oil.

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:55.140
My personal favorite diffuser is the ultrasonic
diffuser, by a landslide.

00:04:55.140 --> 00:05:01.080
If you are looking to buy an essential oil
diffuser, you can find great ones on Aromatools,

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.190
or even some on Amazon.

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.390
I will link to those in the description below.

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.130
Now I want to hear from you.

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:08.880
What is your favorite diffuser?

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.670
