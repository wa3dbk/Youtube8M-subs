00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.549
Have you stopped training specific areas of
your chest because someone told you that it's

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:06.549
impossible?

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:10.630
There's an old saying in the gym that says
'Believe nothing of what you see and even

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:12.330
less of what you hear'.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.390
I'll explain why today.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:24.599
What's up guys, Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.500
That old saying in the gym, believe none of
what you see and even less of what you hear.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.180
What I'm trying to emphasize here guys, there's
a lot of stuff that people say that just simply

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.180
isn't true.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.640
And a lot of us know it.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:38.670
Because we do things on our own.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:44.920
And we see results and we see things happen
that sort of rely on what we've been told.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.710
So what I want you to do is start rethinking
those that have told you that you can not

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.300
target specific areas of your chest.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.351
And the argument that they'll use is, the
chest muscle contracts all or none.

00:00:55.351 --> 00:00:56.351
And it does.

00:00:56.351 --> 00:01:00.740
But you have to acknowledge, as we have in
one other video that we've done, that the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.759
upper chest actually has a region ok, the
clavicular portion here,

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.619
that is actually separately innervated by
a different nerve.

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:14.950
And it's capable of a different contraction
than the major, the pec major area of your

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:16.329
muscle, here in the chest.

00:01:16.329 --> 00:01:22.610
So basically we do have a possibility of doing
that but beyond that too, even within a muscle

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.610
group.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.960
Because of the different arrangement of fibers,
and the direction of fibers, we have different

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.979
lines of pull that we can attack it with,
that will recruit in a different pattern,

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.429
motor units in a different pattern.

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:40.350
So if you think about that, it is possible
to work areas like, inner chest, upper chest

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.990
because we're able to again upper chest,

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.079
clearly because we have the separate innervation
but the inner chest because we have different

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:56.689
ways we can attack it.

00:01:56.689 --> 00:01:58.749
So what about that upper chest?

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:03.729
Is there a way we can incorporate an exercise
that really targets it using some key principles?

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:04.729
And I think there is.

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.920
I like to call it the Crossover Shrug.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.039
And all you need to do it, is a single dumbbell.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.930
Before I even pick up the dumbbell though,
what I want to show you guys is how do we

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.510
really activate the upper chest?

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.709
The first thing is we want to get internal
rotation of the shoulder.

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.650
So I've shown you before internal rotation
can happen with a straight arm or it can happen

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.370
with a bent arm, ok.

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.319
These are all internal rotation.

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.450
But if we're even out here, ok, I've externally
rotated.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.840
When I internally rotate, ok

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.530
just in here like that, you can see right
here this area of the chest actually gets

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:42.970
sort of a line going up.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.079
These are the clavicular fibers, ok.

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:54.372
Just by internally rotating, like that, you
should be able to see a little bit of that

00:02:54.372 --> 00:02:56.769
activation up at the chest.

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.730
We know that adduction, horizontal adduction,
which is taking your arm and bringing it across

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:10.790
your chest, that clearly will activate the
chest right, we're contracting it.

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.520
Which again, sidenote, I always say that's
why it's much more important to do all of

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.090
your pressing with a much narrower grip than
what people are used to.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.530
Because you simply don't get that adduction,
you know, yes you can with dumbbells but with

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:23.530
a barbell, no.

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.620
So you want to be a little bit more narrow.

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:32.000
So if we can get this internal rotation and
this adduction at the same time, we have a

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.269
good contraction.

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.180
Which is the next key point.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.739
You have to contract your muscles when you're
trying to get them to grow guys.

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:42.030
You've got to try to make sure that you're
feeling that muscle work.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.090
And if you aren't, you aren't going to be
getting nearly the results you could if you

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:47.530
focused on that.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.440
So we want contraction, we want internal rotation,
we want horizontal adduction and the third

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.390
component to really help contract the chest.

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.689
If we have the two and we're already through
here, we can bring this area of the clavicular

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:08.250
portion even more together by actually shrugging
up at the end, ok.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:12.120
So we're taking this spot, you can see it
right here between my two fingers.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.650
And if I do this, we've shortened it even
more.

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.419
So you talk about real peak contraction that's
what you have to do.

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.389
So how do we incorporate that with the dumbbell.

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:24.780
Simple, we pick the thing up and we do the
same exact thing.

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:30.450
Now the cool thing about this exercise is
you will see a difference in what happens

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:34.930
to my chest after even one rep, one set of
this, alright.

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:37.289
So, you see what it looks like now.

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:42.289
Basically, take this across, I'm going to
turn this dumbbell in first like this, ok.

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:47.880
Then I'm just going to bring it up and across,
so just like that.

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:48.880
Ok.

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:54.229
I'm shrugging and I'm bringing it up and across
my body as high as I can, and down.

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:56.270
Up, and down.

00:04:56.270 --> 00:05:02.520
A peak squeeze at the top.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.810
Just like that.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:17.940
Now, you can see, up at the top, the whole
upper portion of the chest is contracted.

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:20.340
Up and down.

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.960
Up, and down.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.540
You can see, again, here that line, upper
chest.

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:35.850
And just a couple more.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.830
And put it down.

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:41.830
Right there.

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.940
One set, as I contract, I can contract the
left side.

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:51.800
Doesn't near pop out as much as we have there
with just a single set.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:58.780
So, point being guys, you can clearly attack,
first of all, make the whole chest contract

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:03.360
more by actually putting it in it's position
of peak contraction.

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.819
But beyond that, because of the line of pull,
and incorporating the moves that are necessary

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:12.360
to target specific areas of the chest

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:18.020
and recruit the fibers in a different manner,
it's very important to attack it from all

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.300
different angles.

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.069
Don't listen to those guys that say all you
need to do is benchpress, especially the guy

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:24.979
that said do them out wide.

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:29.970
There's a lot more that goes into your chest
training if you start approaching your training

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:35.610
scientifically, alright, and that's what we
do at ATHELANX.COM.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:38.200
We add science back to strength.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:43.210
If you haven't already guys, our complete
program adds science back to strength to not

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.139
just get you to be talking bigger in the gym,

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:49.830
but to be getting bigger and getting better
results, because you're working the muscles

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:51.229
the way they are meant to.

00:06:51.229 --> 00:06:52.870
Head over to ATHLEANX.COM right now.

Leave me a comment.

00:07:03.060 --> 00:07:04.060
Try this.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.199
You don't even need a dumbbell.

00:07:05.199 --> 00:07:06.199
Do it.

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:08.970
Put your arm in that position and squeeze,
and you'll feel the difference.

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:10.139
And I'll be back here in just a few days.
