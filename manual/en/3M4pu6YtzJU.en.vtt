00:00:05.976 --> 00:00:08.530
SPEAKER 1: We're looking at
the famous sculpture called

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.020
"The Dying Gaul" in the
Capitoline Museum in Rome.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.300
And this is a sculpture--
a copy of a sculpture that

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:21.380
dates from the third
century BC, the original.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.910
So this is a Roman
copy, once again,

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.107
of an ancient Greek original.

00:00:26.107 --> 00:00:28.690
SPEAKER 2: But a Greek sculpture
that would have actually come

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:32.530
originally from Pergamum on the
coast of what is now Turkey.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:35.840
SPEAKER 1: Right, in one of the
areas that was a Greek colony.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.860
SPEAKER 2: And it was to
commemorate an important battle

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:40.760
over a group that
the Greeks would

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.980
have looked at as barbarians.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.290
It's interesting, because
in earlier Greek history,

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.240
if this Gaul was to be
represented as defeated,

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.180
he would have been
represented as a barbarian,

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.740
as somebody who was inherently
less than the Greeks.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.650
And although I think
you could still

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.820
make the argument that
that's the case-- if you look

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.710
at his hair, it's sort
of roughly handled.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.130
His face-- his brow is large.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.110
His nose is not as
idealized as the Greeks

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.600
might have represented
themselves.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.930
Nevertheless, we see his pain.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.040
SPEAKER 1: We do.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.940
In images of death from
the Classical Period

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.750
and the Archaic Period we get
sometimes that archaic smile,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.690
or a sense of-- I don't want to
say peacefulness, but a lack--

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:30.940
SPEAKER 2: A kind of nobility.

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:32.398
SPEAKER 1: Of
expression, something

00:01:32.398 --> 00:01:35.660
that transcends that
moment of death,

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.180
and something that is eternal
and represents, perhaps,

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:40.177
the heroic.

00:01:40.177 --> 00:01:40.760
SPEAKER 2: OK.

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.590
So that's interesting.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.090
But that would be the Greeks
representing themselves, right?

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.270
But here because,
perhaps, we're seeing

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:49.800
a kind of a lesser being, not
a Greek-- somebody outside

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.109
of the Greek culture,
There's a willingness

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:54.275
to represent, in a sense,
that pain, that suffering,

00:01:54.275 --> 00:01:56.070
and that weakness.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.150
But also there's a
kind of nobility here.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:01:59.730
SPEAKER 1: That
interest in emotion

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:02.080
was very typical of
the Hellenistic Period.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:03.830
SPEAKER 2: So this is
a late period, yeah?

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.910
SPEAKER 1: Moving away
from that Classical Period

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:09.360
of the fifth century, the
'400s, of that interest

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.100
in ideal figures, figures
that transcend the every day

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.310
to an interest in
figures that are older,

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.910
figures that display
emotion, figures

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.220
that are fully human in a way.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.470
SPEAKER 2: Yeah, that's right.

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:26.620
And this is an extraordinarily
human rendering of somebody

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.934
who's losing his power.

00:02:27.934 --> 00:02:28.600
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.610
He's fallen.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.420
He's been wounded.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.130
You see the--

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.450
SPEAKER 2: The broken sword.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.158
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:02:33.158 --> 00:02:35.510
The wound in his ribcage.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.620
SPEAKER 2: And the horns
that have been dropped.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:40.450
Perhaps he was a herald as well.

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:42.360
Or this is a heralding.

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.600
SPEAKER 1: And he's falling.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.520
He's about to lose his strength.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:48.016
We've got a real
moment of time here.

00:02:48.016 --> 00:02:49.390
SPEAKER 2: A
transitional moment.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.266
SPEAKER 1: Feel him
falling to the ground--

00:02:51.266 --> 00:02:52.890
SPEAKER 2: But even
as we feel that, we

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.180
feel the original
power of that body,

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.170
the strength of those arms.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:00.670
But that's failing.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.470
And it is a really
tragic moment.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.260
SPEAKER 1: It is.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.800
It's that beautiful
athletic body

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:11.100
that is now defeated
by imminent death.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:12.940
That's what makes
this so poignant.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:15.650
SPEAKER 2: There is this real
empathy that exists there.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.760
And that's right.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.840
It really is characteristic
of that late Greek,

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.180
that Hellenistic moment.
