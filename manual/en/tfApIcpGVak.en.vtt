00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:06.670
well, it is easy to make this maglev CD. a
CD which levitates magnetically. you need

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:13.670
a lot of ring magnets, old CDs and a CD box.
take an old Cd box and remove all the CDs

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.700
from it. what will remain will be the base
and the central stem. cut this stem at a height

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:31.760
of approximately 3cms. then place an old CD
on the central stem. apply glue in a ring

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:44.659
all around the periphery. let this glue dry
a bit and then take lots of ring magnets and

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:52.379
place them in a circle. you will get a ring
of magnets. this is the top view. now you

00:00:55.459 --> 00:01:02.459
take another set of magnets and stick them
to the second CD. both these CDs have similar

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.960
polarities. apply some more glue so that magnets
adhere very tightly to the CD. now take the

00:01:19.189 --> 00:01:26.189
top CD and if you put it on the stem. magnets
facing each other would be repelling and so

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:37.729
the top CD will be levitated. you can also
spin it, it will rotate. it will keep rotating

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.670
for a very long time because there will be
very little friction. it is rotating due to

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.670
pushing of magnetic forces. apply some glue
in the center and stick a lid. this would

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:57.490
be a handle to help you spin the top. now
place the top CD in its place. you will see

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.069
that the top CD is magnetically levitating.
if you spin it, because of low friction it

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:13.069
will keep rotating for a very very long time.
what we can also do is, apply glue on the

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:25.599
top surface of the VD and stick a seven colored
Newton's disc. because this is a very nice

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:27.819
mechanism to rotate CD for a long time. if
you spin the colored wheel all the colors

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:34.819
would coalesce and a color of greyish white.
so this is a two in one toy. its a levitation

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.599
CD and also a color disc.
