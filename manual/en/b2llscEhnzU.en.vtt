On the last...

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.550
Awesome Video Games.

00:00:32.896 --> 00:00:33.826
Where did you come from?

00:00:33.826 --> 00:00:37.045
I have been in that box

00:00:37.285 --> 00:00:39.600
for 2 years!

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.000
Without the Robotic Operating
Buddy, we have no chance

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.900
against Gyromite!

00:00:42.901 --> 00:00:44.671
Did you say...

00:00:44.706 --> 00:00:46.000
GYROMITE!?

00:00:46.223 --> 00:00:47.250
You've heard of it?

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.400
Hey dudes and dudettes!
Turns out R.O.B. is a

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.500
Robotic Operating Buddy!
- And with his help

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:10.800
nothing can stop us!
- Check it out!

00:01:12.086 --> 00:01:15.079
Let's get to work.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.000
As you can see, there's
a gnarly... "Column"

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
preventing us from diffusing
the Dynamite!

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.000
But we're not worried!
A few robotic operations

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.300
from our buddy, and
that Dynamite is a dud!

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.021
Okay...

00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:30.400
Here we go.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.900
Watch this...

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.850
Going to

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.068
spin some Gyros...

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:43.850
...from here.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.400
Over to here...

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.500
Helping Old...

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.750
Professor Hector...

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.550
Get past that...

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.000
Column.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:06.650
Thank you R.O.B.!

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:08.700
We'll take it from here, little buddy!

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.100
One down, five to go!
- But look out

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.500
here comes a Smick!

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.500
Smicks love
budding professors!

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.500
But even more than that
Smicks loves turnips!

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:22.750
As if...!

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.400
You know I've always said boys:
Give a greedy Smick a turnip

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.100
and he'll leave the professor... alone!
- Yeah Dad, you have always

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:31.750
said that!
- And it hasn't really made

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.250
sense, until now!

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.200
Look at him go
for that turnip!

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.550
Those greedy Smicks...
Good luck Chet!

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.500
Looks like we've got
another bogus column

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.800
here dudes and dudettes!
- Red or blue, R.O.B. will

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.550
make those columns
ancient history!

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:56.850
For good!

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.400
Leave it to me.

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.100
- Thanks R.O.B.!
- Thanks R.O.B.!

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.100
Oops!

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.500
Hey R.O.B.! What gives?

00:03:12.733 --> 00:03:13.900
My mistake.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.100
Hey, we all make mistakes R.O.B.!

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.500
You're just lucky
Dad's not around!

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.700
Won't happen again.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.800
No problemo dude!
- Smick alert!

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:30.000
There's greedy Smicks everywhere!
- Let's find some turnips!

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.250
Good idea!

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.081
Oopsies...

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.000
Looks like I...

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.500
Killed you

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.100
By accident.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:41.650
AHH

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:42.500
Again.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:03.750
What's up buddy?
- Shhh...!

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:11.600
You noticed anything weird
about R.O.B. lately?

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:12.350
No!

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.200
You know, the way he's acting?

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:15.250
Uh-uh!

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.000
Think about it Ace!

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.750
Special delivery...

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.350
Yeah... That hurt!
- You had to get

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.250
ten stitches Ace!
- Yeah...

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:30.500
That really hurt!
- And remember

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:31.750
what he did to Dad?

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.850
Stop squirming!!!

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.800
Heheh! Yeah...

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.300
He couldn't walk
for a week Ace!

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.700
He's still not right!

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.250
I hate to say it, but I don't
think this Robotic Operator

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.000
is any buddy of ours!

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:52.000
So what do we do Chet?
- I've got a plan!

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.250
Here's what we're gonna do...

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.500
Give a greedy Smick a turnip and
he'll leave the professor alone!

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.500
Yeah Dad, you have always said that!

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
You're giggling...!
- Hahahaha!
