00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.440
I'll tell you what, this machine right here from
HP, the HP dv51007c1, 

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:18.440
it's packed to the gills man, it is awesome.
It's a 15 inch notebook powered by 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.930
a Core 2 Duo Centrino Platform and you're not
going to go wrong with this one.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.170
It's not low-end, it's not middle-end, it's a
pretty high-end notebook,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.800
at a pretty valuable price, and it looks unique,
the screen looks fantastic, 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.930
and it's got some high-end features like tons of 
RAM, Blu-Ray drive, all that stuff.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.640
And overall you absolutely can't go wrong, when
buying a notebook from HP, especially one

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:49.860
like this one. It is the Core 2 Duo P7350 
processor. That's a 2 gigahertz Core 2 Duo 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.070
processor on this. It's got 4 'gigs' of DDR2 RAM,
320 gigabyte hard drive,

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.400
it's got a 15.4 inch glossy screen. Now, it's
going to run at a 1280 by 800 resolution, 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.400
and that's a really nice high resolution, you're
going to watch 720p High-Def videos, 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:10.900
in full resolution on this screen. It has the 
Intel X4500 graphics chipset onboard.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.300
The Intel X4500, of course, not a gamin'
chipset, 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.230
per se. It's going to be able to handle some
of your low end 3D games,

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.140
World of Warcraft, stuff like that. It's going
to run just fine,

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.400
when you get into the higher end stuff it's
going to start having a little bit of trouble.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:32.170
It's got 'a' 'g' and 'n' wireless built in, so 
you're going to be able to get in any of the high

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:37.580
speed wireless networks that are out there. BluRay
and DVD RW so you are going to be able to watch

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.490
your High-Def Blu-Rays on this screen, and you're
going to be able to use high storage capacity 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:48.080
Blu-Rays optical disks as well. It doesn't have
to be movies, you can store data on those things.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.330
It's got Express 54 slots, and it all weighs 
about 5.83 pounds. So let me

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.470
go ahead and show you what we got going on
here. This is the body. 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.980
First thing you'll notice, HP has now a very nice
glowing logo on the back. Take a look,

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.010
that's actually glowing. I don't know if you can
tell that it's glowing, but it is.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:09.970
It's a really really nice black, glossy black
top on this thing. It's sharp looking.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.900
On the front, all silver, a little bit of graphic
design in there. If you zoom in, you'll see

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.620
that there is a bit of a pattern in there as well.
So it's a really really sharp looking notebook.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.310
It's got the scroll zone on the mirror finish 
trackpad here. So it will double.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:29.900
Actually I don't think you can actually see 
yourself... Actually no you can!

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.970
Check it out. Look at this. You can see yourself.
I don't know if you can see yourself, 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.970
but you can see the camera in there, can't you?
No, this is a horrible demonstration.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.530
I tried looking at it, I'm like "Oh, I can see
myself, look at you." And you can't see it.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.830
it's fine. Tried to get all fancy there. That's
what happens when you try to get fancy.

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:52.030
It does have mirror finish though so you can check
your makeup if you want to. Trust me.

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.220
You might not be able to see it in the camera
with this lighting here, 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.510
but you're going to have to trust me on that.
Around the side here, this is where that Blu-Ray

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:02.770
drive is, right there. That's also a DVD RW drive.
2 USB ports,

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.950
you got a modem port right here. Over on the other
side is where you're going to find your VGA port,

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:14.460
you've got that HP expansion port there. There's
your LAN port, it does have HDMI.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.280
And of course what that means, especially this
is good when you have,

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.580
a laptop with a Blu-Ray drive, 'cause you're 
actually going to be able to hook this up,

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.470
to your 1080p High-Def television with just
 1 cable, and that 1 cable is going to carry

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:30.870
High-Def video and surround sound audio, to 
your television. That's all you have to hook up.

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:36.270
It's got a combo eSATA/USB port, and of course
eSATA means you're going to be able to hook up

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.010
your external SATA hard drives and devices here, 
and it also means you're not sacrificing

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:45.000
a USB port, because you can also plug a USB
device into that. 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:49.500
There's another USB port there, here's that
SD multi card reader, that's going to do SD,

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.030
it's going to be a Memory Stick, MMC, xD,
they're all going to fit in this tiny little slot

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.970
right here, and this is that Express 54 slot. 
So you're going to be able to very very easily

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:05.880
expand this particular notebook, with a 3G card,
or any of the other limitless

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:11.070
expansion possibilities that come along with
that Express 54 slot, so overall, 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:15.540
this thing's really really nice. It's got
great features,

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.200
 very high-end, lots of RAM, big hard drive, 
very nice screen.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:25.000
I think I forgot to point these out, didn't I?
Along the top you have this capacitive touch panel

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.510
for all of your media controls. You can very
easily mute and un-mute the audio, 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.030
adjust volume, all of your media controls are
right here, and you can very easily 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:39.200
turn your wireless on and off right here. That
is all a touch sensitive panel. 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.810
So you don't have to use any actual physical
buttons. 'Cause actual real buttons are so, 

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.800
1998. You know? No one's using real button
nowadays, it's kind of stupid.

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:50.900
And up at the top, you've got a webcam, for 
all of your,

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.660
things that you do with a webcam. I don't 
like to get into that stuff.

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.980
You know? It can be a little bit creepy sometimes
but you do what you want to do.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.030
No one's going to judge. This is a really
nice laptop, go get yourself one

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.580
If you're in the market for a nice one with
a Blu-Ray drive, and decent graphics, 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:10.600
and lots of storage, lots of memory, really
high speed processor, 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:17.730
this would be a good one to have a look-see at.
It's the HP dv51007c1.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:28.910
To get more info on the HP dv51007c1, go to
any of these retailers and type in M975-150020.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:31.260
For Computer TV, I'm Bauer.
