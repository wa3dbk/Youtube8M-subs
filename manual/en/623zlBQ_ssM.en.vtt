Hi! I’m John Antonelli on behalf of Expert
Village. This video lesson is going to be

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.940
discussing stick heights. Stick heights are
very important in our drum line ensemble to

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.700
make sure that we were all matching the same
sound and the same height visually for the

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:24.000
crowd. Now, I define stick heights in inches.
This is inches from the drum. First off, we’re

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.869
going to start on our ready to play position.
If I want something played from this position,

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:35.210
I call it one inch off of the drum. The next
position up, I call three inches off of the

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.929
drum. Now, how I do that is I make sure that
I change my stick angle from being two fingers

00:00:41.929 --> 00:00:48.969
off to making my wrist parallel to the ground
versus having that two finger angle to the

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:55.929
drum. This is one inch. This is three inches.
The next one that I tried to define is 12

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:04.159
inches. Now, that is having our stick 100%
perpendicular to the ground. This is 12 inches.

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:12.220
So, going up we will start at 1 then we make
our wrist flat 3, then perpendicular to the

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:19.329
ground for 12 inches. The next height I define
is six inches. Easiest way to do this is to

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:27.880
take dollar bill, stick it on the drum, and
then match the very tip to the top of that

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:34.710
dollar bill. I’ve got my one inch; I’ve
got my wrist flat at three, and then I’ve

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:44.999
got my six. Then I have my 12. The next height
I define is finding six inches; finding 12

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:51.619
inches, and then splitting it. This is what
I call 9 inches. Going up from the bottom,

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:59.479
I’ve got my one inch height; my three inch
height; my six inch height; my nine inch height,

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.969
and my 12 inch height. Please check out our
next video. We will be discussing tap accent

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:05.349
control.
