The sound presentation of the drums 
has been something of interest for me for a long time,

00:00:16.583 --> 00:00:23.625
I mean I started thinking about this when I was a 
teenager. My friend's a keyboard player, Jay Oliver,

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:31.792
we grew up together, and he  - not only being 
a great keyboard player - he had his own studio

00:00:31.792 --> 00:00:39.875
from a very early age as well, in his own house, and 
that was like a playground for us to experiment

00:00:39.875 --> 00:00:48.166
and we started learning about how, especially for me, 
the drums were captured with mics,

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:54.500
and the relationship of the tuning, and 
how that worked together in sound presentation

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:04.292
and then manipulation through processing and such, and
 that kind of transferred itself into the live aspect as well,

00:01:04.292 --> 00:01:14.166
because I wanted to, as best I could, 
represent really nice fidelity sound live,

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:21.000
'cause I remember, later, in New York, I would go hear 
all these great bands with all these great musicians

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.583
and everybody's got amps, stereo guitar amps,
 everything sounded like high fidelity,

00:01:26.583 --> 00:01:30.708
and the drums sounded like cardboard. 
I don't care what manufacturer they were, 

00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:36.208
but when you're competing against 
amplifiers, it's an acoustic instrument

00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:44.750
versus an electronic reproduced sound. 
So at that point it was really something for me,

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:52.000
that I started to think about as part of my setup, 
and I started, like I said I started doing this,

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.250
in my early twenties, really hardcore carrying 
stuff around, you know, speakers, mixers, mics.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:04.333
Everybody thought I was nuts,
 but I had the best live drum sound, anywhere, in clubs,

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:09.375
I was just at that time carrying a separate amp, 
a speaker, you know, a big speaker, 

00:02:09.375 --> 00:02:16.500
it was all kind of custom-made stuff at the time, cause 
nobody was really thinking about that kind of thing,

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.375
as far as lightweight, 
self-powered stuff.

00:02:21.375 --> 00:02:27.666
Where I grew up in St. Louis there wasn't a whole lot 
of people doing this kind of thing,

00:02:27.666 --> 00:02:31.166
even audio engineers, so we had to learn 
how to do it ourselves 

00:02:31.166 --> 00:02:34.916
to produce the sound that we were hearing 
elsewhere, on professional records,

00:02:34.916 --> 00:02:40.542
which of course we couldn't do with our gear,
 but we learned how to get close,

00:02:40.542 --> 00:02:46.792
even back in those days, and it was just an education, 
and it's a continuing education for me
0:02:76.792,0:02:52.333
to learn about sound, and mixing,
 and the production aspect,

00:02:52.333 --> 00:02:58.083
It's almost as much of a joy, for me,
 as the playing part.
