00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.580
Before you get your P-Plates it's a good
idea to practice driving in the country

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.540
with your qualified supervising driver.
Driving in the country is different from

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.230
driving in the city and suburbs,

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.499
it needs an entirely different approach.
Country driving may appear easier;

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:20.340
there are fewer traffic lights

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.029
turns and cars on the road, but this
can cause people to become less aware

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:28.080
and alert. Don't fall into this trap. For
this reason

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.850
country driving is much more dangerous.
You're driving in higher speeds, then you need to

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:36.230
concentrate a lot more. What differences
do you find driving in the country from

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.270
driving in the suburbs? "When you drive in the 
country you're driving at higher speeds and also

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:44.300
overtaking." "Driving the country can be
more dangerous because the roads are

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.270
unsealed and there can be more hazards."

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:50.160
"When driving in the country you have to 
look out for animals because they may jump out
in front of you."

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.989
You'll need to deal with driving at higher
speeds

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.550
cars overtaking you, possibility of animals
venturing onto the road

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:02.310
various weather conditions, dazzling
headlights, the remains of tyre blowouts

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.630
and potentially unfamiliar or dirt roads.
How do you feel about driving at high

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.970
speeds on country roads? "To become more
comfortable at driving at higher speeds

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.220
I practice when mum's in the car."
"I feel a bit uncomfortable about driving at high

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.860
speeds because it's easier to lose control of the car."

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:20.770
"Because I've only just started driving
I'm kind of nervous at driving at high speeds

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.090
but I reckon with practice I'll be alright."
Where the speed limits permit

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.100
start by driving at 80 kph, then after
some time start to increase your speed to 85,

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.200
to 90, to 95

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.980
to 100kph, the maximum speed that

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.150
a Learner can travel at.

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.080
If possible do this in multi-lane highways.
Be aware of the speed limit as you drive

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.719
through townships.

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:49.040
Generally you'll need to lower your speed
to 80, then 60 or 50 kph.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.700
You can get used to traveling at high
speed so watch your speedo as you enter 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.679
these towns.

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:54.900
So here are some tips for

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.600
driving in the country. The last
thing you need to do is get stressed.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.090
Allow plenty of time to get to your
destination

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.560
and allow extra time to for possible delays.
Be seen. It's a good idea when you're driving in

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.839
the country during the day to drive with
your headlights on low beam.

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:14.659
It makes you more visible to other vehicles.
Occasionally check your side mirrors to

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.230
make sure you're in the correct position
on the road,

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.660
fractionally left of the centre of your
side of the road. This will increase

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.090
the passing distance, called 'the buffer
zone' between your vehicle and oncoming

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.440
cars. When you're on a long trip
generally you should take a break every

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.699
two hours.

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:35.229
Fatigue is a common cause of serious
crashes. Use designated rest stops.

00:02:35.229 --> 00:02:38.599
Most of the busy single lane roads
in South Australia

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.480
have overtaking lanes at regular
intervals. These are the safest places to

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.370
overtake

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.999
so sit well back from the slower vehicle
relax and wait for these overtaking lanes

00:02:48.999 --> 00:02:52.409
to appear. On long journeys people can tend
to switch off.

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.090
This can be a fatal mistake. If you're
distracted or you lose concentration

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.919
then your car wanders off the road, your natural
reaction is to jerk the steering wheel in the

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:06.309
opposite direction. If your wheels leave the
bitumen ease off the accelerator and

00:03:06.309 --> 00:03:07.689
don't brake harshly.

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.169
Hold the steering wheel firm with both
hands and ease the wheels back onto the road.

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:15.919
There's no time like the present to
take on all this advice and become more

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:16.989
confident driving in the country.
