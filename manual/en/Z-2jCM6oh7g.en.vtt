00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:11.700
This video shows you how to remove the computers stand so you can attach a

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.860
mounting device.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.730
Your HP Pavillion All-In-One PC was designed to work with a vesa

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.140
standard mounting device. A mounting device was not provided with your

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.029
computer. You'll need to purchase it.

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.640
It should take you about five to ten minutes to perform this task.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.490
You'll need a flat head screw driver and a phillips number two screwdriver.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.950
A few words of caution before we start.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.780
Never open the cover when the computer is on or plugged in.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.290
Make certain it's turned off and unplugged.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:49.300
Static electricity can damage the computers electronic components.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.180
Be sure to touch the metal cage before touching any internal parts or

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.870
components.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.380
Avoid touching sharp edges inside the computer.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.680
And finally the appearance and features of your HP Pavillion All-In-One PC

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.250
may vary slightly from those shown here.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.400
Okay, let's get started.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.170
First, remove any media such as a DVD or memory card from the computer.

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:18.970
Next, turn off the computer and unplug the power cord.

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:23.790
Disconnect any attached devices such as a mouse, keyboard, or printer.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:28.380
Lay the computer down on a flat surface covered with a soft cloth to protect the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.760
screen from scratches and other damage.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.580
Insert a flat head screw driver into the back cover slot to gently pry it off.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:44.580
Use a phillips screwdriver to remove the four screws holding the stand in place.

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.500
Slide the stand assembly forward slightly toward the top of the computer,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:57.140
then lift and slide it backwards and remove it completely.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.520
Use the flat head screw driver to remove the plastic tabs covering the four screw

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.720
hole caps on the back.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.219
These are the holes where you will attach your mounting device.

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:12.409
Replace the back cover.

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:16.989
your HP Pavillion All-In-One PC is now ready for mounting.

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:20.499
You'll attach the mounting device here.

00:02:20.499 --> 00:02:23.999
Refer to the mounting device manufacturers instructions for

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:26.559
information about attaching your computer to the mounting device.
