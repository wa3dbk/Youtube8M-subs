00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.679
think we got about not even a word of a lie a

00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:07.129
meter us know last night

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:10.760
just finished shoveling our vehicle

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.450
logged on the old Facebook this morning
my good buddy

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.730
rick allen from the bomby Sunshine
Coast nominated me for the

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.330
2014 Winter Challenge

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.369
we live in Terrace BC

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.699
that's the lake

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:33.820
at least the meter and a half of snow on
top

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.280
and then about a foot of ice

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:43.379
not wanting to chicken out, I threw on my

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:48.640
swimming attire and I'm going to

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.640
go see if I can find water, thanks a lot Rick

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:16.520
Its too thick, bigger chainsaw

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.140
need a bigger chainsaw, I guess my only other option is I could

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.240
auger a bunch of ice holes in the ice

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.610
beside each other like 10 holes

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.130
that's gonna suck but

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.670
do what you gonna do probably a little bit
safer than

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.100
using a chainsaw in short, no shirt, be right back

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.160
where did you put the auger

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:55.160
Ahhh, right where you left it

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.400
baywatch

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.400
in the north

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.050
so thats about big enough for your

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:23.050
right foot

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:30.940
it's not deep enough there

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.959
I told you, I have to go clear another spot

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:42.959
try again

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:00.100
thats how thick the ice is

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.790
well I broke the auger, surprise surprise

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.640
that might holder for a minute..nope

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:18.080
well, the big question is

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:23.520
can I fit in there-I think your just gonna have to giver

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:29.140
K shoes of

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:36.140
not that it matters

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:44.750
K

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:53.020
here she goes...how does it feel?

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:57.640

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:01.000

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.920
