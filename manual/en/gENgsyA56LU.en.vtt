00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:07.410
 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.300
Welcome to the VitaLife show. I'm doctor Janine Bowring and thanks for joining me today

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.400
be sure that your subscribing to our
channel just to let you know because

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:15.970
we're always

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.100
uploading the newest health tips and
information so that you can be on top of

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.400
your health and being proactive about
your health which is so important because

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.619
prevention is always better than cure

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.289
so today we're talking about coconut oil. The benefits of coconut oil its one of my

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:31.279
favorite foods

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:35.809
I absolutely love it and a lot of people
used to be sort of scared of fats

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:36.480
because we know

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.699
coconuts are very fatty but it's a
special type of saturated fats which

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:44.800
contains medium-chain triglycerides and
these are called MCT's

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.000
and they actually go directly to the
liver to be processed from the digestive

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.510
tract

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.900
and are used for energy immediately so
what's so great about this is that

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:58.100
actually has a fat burning effect which
you know a lot of people are interested

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.449
in is becoming more and more popular so

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.100
taking you know just a tablespoon of
coconut oil

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.260
every day and you can find some
delicious one's out there

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.000
is one of the best thing you can do for
your health I also love to use coconut

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.600
oil

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.200
externally it's one of the best
moisturizers so you know here living in

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.100
Canada we have the coldest winters

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.200
I've been using all winter long on my
hands and

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.300
its absolutely remarkable and what it
can do for keeping your your skin moist

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.100
and again it's completely natural so I
encourage you to try that

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.800
it also contains lauric acid now
lauric acid

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:36.020
again helps to kill bacteria virus

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.420
and

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.880
fungus is as well so internally it has
that natural effect especially on a

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:41.900
digestive tract

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.300
to kill all of these things so that you
know there's a lot of value in that

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:50.140
for staying healthy and and keeping your
stomach and your intestines healthy

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.100
because this is often where a lot of
these bad guys will sort of

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.800
harbor so using probiotics and
make sure it's the right type of

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:57.850
probiotics so make

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.300

a lot of people don't know the difference
about you know there's a lot of

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.640
probiotics out there

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.500
most of them are not design for human digestive tract, so it should

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:14.660
always be the right

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.739

all those bad bacteria and things. Things
like H. pylori in the stomach really

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:32.280

in coconut oil which the doctors you
know used to say absolutely

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.480
away from saturated fat if you have high
cholesterol

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.090
well the opposite the is true that you

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.230

popular things that were seeing
unfortunately in our patients

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.700
because of the poor diet the stress
levels

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.900
