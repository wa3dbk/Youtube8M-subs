00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.590
Hey, I'm Andrea Lemire, the education coordinator
here at the Lion Brand Yarn Studio.

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:14.509
I'm going to show you some really cool techniques
for beginning crochet, and hopefully, you'll

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.290
have as much fun as I have with it.

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:22.240
Okay, lets get started.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.550
So I'm going to show you how to join a new
ball of yarn or another color.

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.890
It works the same way.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.210
You can do this in rows, in rounds, any time
you want to throw a different color in there,

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:39.390
or, run out of yarn and need to join that
next ball.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.769
So what you want to do is get to the end of
the row or the round that you're working on.

00:00:44.769 --> 00:00:46.030
So here, I'm working in rows.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:50.859
I'm at the end of my row, and I'm ready to
start the next one.

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:57.559
So I would, at this point, make my chain,
and continue, turn, and go back for the next

00:00:57.559 --> 00:00:58.559
row.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.859
But where I'm going to change colors, now,
just to show you how you can change colors

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:08.610
using this technique to make stripes, but
if you are using all the same color, it's

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.780
exactly the same way.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.750
I'm going to stop before I chain for the next
row.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:22.170
I'm going to take my new color here, or another
ball of yarn, whatever you're doing, and I've

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.530
stopped just before I'm making my chain to
go to the next round.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:33.140
And when you are looping that new yarn around
the hook, you want to make sure you're leaving

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.600
a nice long tail.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.140
And the reason for that is you want to give
yourself enough yarn to sew back into the

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.210
fabric when you're done with everything.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.380
So I'm going to pull that new yarn through,
to make my turning chain.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.350
And at this point you can continue on with
what you're doing.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:58.390
If you need a longer chain for a taller stitch
like the double crochet, you can continue

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:02.170
chaining with your new yarn.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.640
Or if you're working in rounds, so in a circle,
you would just keep going for the next round.

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:14.560
So with these tails, at the end of your entire
project, what you need to do is sew them back

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.870
into the fabric, just through the loops on
the stitches.

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.040
And if you're using different colors, it's
usually a good idea to sew the tails back

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.920
into the fabric in the same color sections.

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.390
So this blue tail I would sew back into this
area.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.190
And my yellow up here I would sew into my
yellow stripe.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:36.340
And that's how you join a new ball.
