00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.180
There are two primary ways that you can increase
your stitches. The first way is called the

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:11.759
bar increase, and this is where you're going
to knit into the front of your stitch. Don't

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:16.450
take the stitches off the needle, and then
you're going to go into the back of the stitch

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:22.720
and knit it. This increases a visible increase,
but there I've got my extra one. The next

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:29.820
kind is called the lifted strand. And what
you would do is take your left needle and

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.500
take that strand that's in the middle of your
stitches. There's one stitch. There's the

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.690
other, and you're going to lift that up. And
then you're going to knit that closed, twist

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.770
it shut. And this is an invisible increase.
So you'll I'll finish this row, and I'll show

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:59.230
you the difference. You can see it farther
down. So if you look over here, by this you

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.989
can see that there's my original stitch. And
there's the base of the stitch I made. So

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.860
that's quite visible. You know there's always
going to be a little bit of a hole underneath.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:17.210
With the lifted strand increase, this is where
I made it right here. There's no hole underneath

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:24.310
where there was wasn't a stitch before. Now
there was. So you can see the difference.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:31.360
This one's visible, and this one's invisible.
And then you would just work those stitches

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:59.240
on your reverse row as if they had always
been there and pearl them across. So now I've

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:05.150
got my increases, and you can see. Right here
your eye can go immediately to where I did

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.440
the bar increase. And you really can't tell
where I did lifted strand increase.
