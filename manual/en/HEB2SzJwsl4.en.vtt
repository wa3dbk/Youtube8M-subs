00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.430
To find Foreness Point, look along the top
of the cliff for the treatment plant - the

00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:06.830
path down to the beach is right next to it.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.680
Foreness Point gives the Kent shore angler
a unique chance of getting out to sea by walking

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.460
along either of the two pipes.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.409
With rough ground surrounding you, rock pools
and gullies, it really does suit an angler

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:29.239
carrying one rod and a few popper lures, or,
freshly collected prawns presented under a

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.360
shallow float.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.930
Out on the pipes we have a good view of our
next mark, Botany Bay.

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:51.399
Although close by and similar in nature to
our next mark, Joss Bay, Botany is in the

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.649
guide due partly to its free parking, easy
access down to the beach and mix of clean

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.800
sand and rough ground.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.569
Mainly though, it's just a lovely place to
spend a few hours pleasure fishing.

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:08.709
If you're the type of angler who wants to
fish in nice surroundings to escape life's

00:01:08.709 --> 00:01:12.160
daily pressures, then you'll like Botany and
Joss Bays.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:23.560
Fish-wise, good catches of sole and bass have come from here, so hopefully, you won't just

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.660
be taking in nice scenery.

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:40.790
In common with a lot of the bays we've seen,
Joss is made up of clean sand directly in

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.129
the middle with broken ground left and right,
giving you a chance to fish near the rocks

00:01:45.129 --> 00:01:48.580
and weed but keep your tackle out of the snags.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:53.150
A good example is this spot, at about 10 o'clock
as you look out to sea from the middle of

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.930
the bay.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:02:00.970
As you can imagine from this type of ground,
sole and bass again are both worthwhile targets,

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.540
with plenty of doggies to keep you entertained
while you wait for them.
