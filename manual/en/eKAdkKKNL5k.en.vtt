How you use the light can really affect the
quality of the colors. So, the light that

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:13.030
my model, Carrie, is sitting in right now
is, actually, really nice light for showing

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.720
of more vibrant colors and that's why we went
ahead and kind of wrapped this little scarf

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:23.770
around her; was just so you can see the effect
of this soft diffused light, and how because

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.260
the contrast and the shadows and those other
things are not emphasized as much, and because

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:34.680
the quality of the light allows for a more
saturated color, the blues in this scarf really

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:43.440
pop. Now, if I were to go ahead and plug in
our harsh direct light and aim that at our

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:53.080
model, it can actually cut down on the overall
saturation of the color. Now, this light has

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:57.040
a little bit of an orange tint, so, I have
to admit it is kind of bringing the yellows

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.890
out a little bit more; but if this were direct
sunlight, like say, you're photographing a

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.510
field of flowers; when the sun is hitting
the flowers, they tend to seem less saturated,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.440
and the colors pop less. Whereas if clouds
go overhead, the colors of the flowers can

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:21.930
really come through. So, another thing to
consider, with the light is that, the time

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:26.770
of day has a huge impact on it. So like I
said, with this tungsten light, it has kind

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.700
of this warmer light. It, actually, almost
has a little bit of the qualities of the end

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.480
of the day, where you have the golden light
or early morning. So, those colors, like when

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:42.500
you're looking at a sunset, they can make
the reds seem more vibrant and the yellows

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.780
and all those other colors come out or those
dusky blues. So, if that's something that

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.000
is really important to the mood or feeling
of your picture, then you want to make sure

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.479
that you have your subject; whether it is
a landscape or a person, in that type of light

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:00.060
that conveys that sort of mood.
