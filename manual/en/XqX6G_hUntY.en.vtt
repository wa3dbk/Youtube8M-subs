00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.350
If you've ever driven the Spaulding
Turnpike on a busy day odds are your

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.429
trip slowed to a crawl somewhere between
Newington and Dover. The combination of

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:18.360
too many cars on the road and lots of
exits in a short three and a half mile

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.800
stretch often creates a bottleneck
snarling traffic and creating safety

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.489
issues. Aware of the long-standing
problems in the area the state of New

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:29.849
Hampshire's Department of Transportation
is in the midst of smoothing this road

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.809
out for drivers. The centerpiece of this
project is the construction of a new

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.860
Little Bay Bridge which will link
Newington to Dover. However, the bridge

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.520
does more than carry cars across the
river. It also carries an important

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.820
natural gas transmission line bringing
heat to thousands of Unitil customers.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.540
Behind me over here you can see the
Piscataqua River itself and off over to

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.430
the right you've got the actual little
Bay Bridge.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.079
They're in the process of building the
second span which will serve as a

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.550
southbound lane and then the pipe is
currently located on the bridge that you

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.210
see here in the foreground that bridge
is going to be basically taken down to

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.780
its deck and then rebuilt. The problem
though is that the existing gas

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.200
transmission pipelines right underneath
that and in order to do the rebuild we

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.520
have to get the pipe off. So, how do you
get across the river if you can't use

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.900
the bridge? After comprehensive studies
Unitil engineers concluded that the most

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.910
cost effective, long-term solution was to
drill sideways and underneath the little

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.220
bay of the Piscataqua River. A 10-inch
gas pipeline approximately 2,600 feet in

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.149
length would be installed under the
river bed in what would be the largest

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.950
and most complex engineering project in
Unitil's history. Going underneath

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.390
certain environmental receptors that are
sensitive such as the shellfish beds

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.320
that are located out in the Piscataqua
River itself. By going underneath with

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.100
the drill less impact on the environment
is better overall.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:07.340
For Unitil customers it means a continued supply of low-cost energy that is very competitive with

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.519
existing heating fuels at this time. In
the process of planning the project

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.030
Unitil had to work with the number of
different agencies in order to obtain

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.950
the appropriate environmental permitting.
We had a great working relationship at

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.049
the at the state level. The partnership
between a New Hampshire DOT and Unitil is very

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:34.170
good. Their responsiveness and dedication
to complete the work has helped

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.760
facilitate the project moving forward. Some things that had to be considered as

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.209
we worked our way through the project is
some of the historical aspects. On the

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.290
Newington side you have the Bloody Point
Ferry. That was a ferry that operated as

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.340
the main means of crossing this pretty
much from the inception of Newington

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.920
sometime around 1623. Here where we stand
now Hilton Park although there's a

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.910
temporary disturbance that's ongoing, the
restoration once this is completed will

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.609
return it back pretty much to the same
setup that we've seen if not better.

00:03:04.609 --> 00:03:13.560
This high-profile project very very important
to Unitil there's a lot of different

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.930
parts and pieces and then you're dealing
in a congested area with a very busy

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:24.450
highway next to it. So, Unitil it's spent a
lot of time and a lot of effort in the

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.470
design and making sure that all the
parties that have a stake in this

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:35.549
project are involved. The way this
equipment works is a put down a drill

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:41.459
head like a bit followed by a bug motor
and then we'll add 30 foot long piece of

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.319
the four and a half inch drill steel. We're able to use devices on this

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:50.459
equipment to break the drill steel add
another piece tighten it back up and

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:55.430
keep drilling.
The driller operates this piece of

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.890
equipment from a drillers cabin meaning
in the console is an enclosed climate

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.760
controlled environment we run our
computers and everything from that

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:11.090
drillers cabin also. We're currently
about a week in a day into the pilot

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.790
hole we've just passed the halfway mark
the soil borings have indicated some

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:23.930
areas of very very hard rock. The job is
building a long according to plan.

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:28.310
After two and a half weeks of hard drilling
the bit breaks through on the Dover side

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:34.639
of the river - half a mile away from the
entry point. As advertised, it's a came

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:37.840
out where where we did it to be and now
we'll look

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:41.970
make this little bigger so you get ready
to go pull the pipe.

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:51.180
Right now we're on the Hilton Park side
of the bay. The pipeline is being

00:04:51.180 --> 00:05:00.240
prepared for installation through the
drill hole. Welding is currently in progress.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:10.060
And once the welding and inspection is
complete hydrostatic testing will take place.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:19.910
Once all those things are complete the
three segments will be joined and from

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.600
there we'll be able to pull the pipe
back in the opposite dress. It's kind

00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:28.010
of like a ballet games in which
everything has to flow appropriately but

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:31.040
once you're done with that the dance
looks beautiful you get the big encore

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:34.940
and at the end you have a completed gas
transmission pipe. The pipe is pulled

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.570
back to the newington side while the
segments which did the drilling are

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:43.550
detached as they resurface from under
the river. This dance goes deep into the

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:48.620
night 3:30 in the morning a successful
pipe pole and all the best planning and

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:51.700
everything would happen without the
people everybody involved.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.060
A good job and the pipe is in the ground.

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.500
With the pipe safely in place the
restoration process begins at Hilton

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:09.430
Park come springtime. The park is fully
restored for enjoyment by its many

00:06:09.430 --> 00:06:13.600
visitors preparations are also made to
connect the new pipe to the rest of Unitil's

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.800
infrastructure to continue serving
the surrounding communities for years to come.

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.530
Unitil is committed to natural gas
growth in providing more customers with

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:27.580
a lower-cost alternative to other
heating options in New Hampshire and beyond.
