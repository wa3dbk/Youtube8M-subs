00:00:02.283 --> 00:00:06.801
Good afternoon.  Earlier today the Supreme Court upheld

00:00:06.801 --> 00:00:09.933
the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act,

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:13.051
the name of the health care reform we passed two years ago.

00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:16.900
In doing so they've reaffirmed a fundamental principle

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.983
that here in America, in the wealthiest nation on earth,

00:00:20.983 --> 00:00:26.450
no illness or accident should lead to any family's financial ruin.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.983
I know there will be a lot of discussion today about the politics of all this,

00:00:30.983 --> 00:00:33.317
about who won and who lost,

00:00:33.317 --> 00:00:36.767
That's how these things tend to be viewed here in Washington.

00:00:36.767 --> 00:00:39.916
But that discussion completely misses the point.

00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:43.750
Whatever the politics, today's decision was a victory for people

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.301
all over this country whose lives will be more secure

00:00:47.301 --> 00:00:51.517
because of this law and the Supreme Court's decision to uphold it.

00:00:51.517 --> 00:00:54.433
And because this law has a direct impact on so many Americans

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:59.483
I want to take this opportunity to talk about exactly what it means for you.

00:00:59.483 --> 00:01:04.267
First, if you're one of the more than  250 million Americans

00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:08.917
who already have health insurance you will keep your health insurance.

00:01:08.917 --> 00:01:12.683
This law will only make it more secure and more affordable.

00:01:12.683 --> 00:01:15.900
Insurance companies can no longer impose lifetime limits

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.301
on the amount of care you receive.

00:01:18.301 --> 00:01:20.900
They can no longer discriminate against children with

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.083
pre-existing conditions.  They can no longer

00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:25.833
drop your coverage if you get sick.

00:01:25.833 --> 00:01:29.833
They can no longer jack up your premiums without reason.

00:01:29.833 --> 00:01:32.718
They are required to provide  free preventive care

00:01:32.718 --> 00:01:35.000
like checkups and mammograms,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.283
a provision that has already helped

00:01:36.283 --> 00:01:40.017
54 million Americans with private insurance.

00:01:40.017 --> 00:01:44.083
And by this August nearly 13 million of you will receive a rebate

00:01:44.083 --> 00:01:45.683
from your insurance company

00:01:45.683 --> 00:01:49.384
because it spent too much on things like administrative costs

00:01:49.384 --> 00:01:54.050
and CEO bonuses, and not enough on your healthcare.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.469
There's more.

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:58.916
Because of the Affordable Care Act young adults under the age of 26

00:01:58.916 --> 00:02:01.517
are able to stay on their parents' healthcare plans,

00:02:01.517 --> 00:02:03.301
a provision that has already helped

00:02:03.301 --> 00:02:05.950
6 million young Americans.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:08.400
And because of the Affordable Care Act seniors receive a

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:12.301
discount on their prescription drugs, a discount that has already saved

00:02:12.301 --> 00:02:14.699
more than 5 million seniors

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:17.533
on Medicare about 600 dollars each.

00:02:17.533 --> 00:02:21.650
All of this is happening because of the Affordable Care Act.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.899
These provisions provide common sense protections

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:28.385
for middle class families and they enjoy broad popular support.

00:02:28.385 --> 00:02:32.099
And thanks to today's decision all of these benefits and protections

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.767
will continue for Americans who already have health insurance.

00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:40.417
Now if you're one of the 30 million Americans who don't yet have

00:02:40.417 --> 00:02:45.083
health insurance, starting in 2014 this law will offer you

00:02:45.083 --> 00:02:50.567
an array of quality affordable private health insurance plans to chose from.

00:02:50.567 --> 00:02:54.468
Each state will take the lead in designing their own menu of options.

00:02:54.468 --> 00:02:56.750
And if states can come up with even better ways of covering

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:02.051
more people at the same quality and cost,  this law allows them to do that too.

00:03:02.051 --> 00:03:05.301
And I've asked Congress to help speed up that process and give states

00:03:05.301 --> 00:03:09.433
this flexibility in Year One.  Once states set up

00:03:09.433 --> 00:03:13.467
these health insurance marketplaces, known as exchanges,

00:03:13.467 --> 00:03:16.517
insurance companies will no longer be able to discriminate against

00:03:16.517 --> 00:03:19.433
any American with a pre-existing health condition.

00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:22.551
They won't be able to charge you more just because you're a woman.

00:03:22.551 --> 00:03:26.100
They won't be able to bill you into bankruptcy.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.683
If you're sick you'll finally have the same chance

00:03:28.683 --> 00:03:33.000
to get quality affordable healthcare as everyone else.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.067
And if you can't afford the premiums you'll receive a credit that helps pay for it.

00:03:38.067 --> 00:03:40.683
Today the Supreme Court also upheld the principle that

00:03:40.683 --> 00:03:43.135
people who can afford health insurance

00:03:43.135 --> 00:03:46.483
should take the responsibility to buy health insurance.

00:03:46.483 --> 00:03:49.366
This is important for two reasons.

00:03:49.366 --> 00:03:52.884
First, when uninsured people who can afford coverage

00:03:52.884 --> 00:03:56.483
get sick and show up at the Emergency Room for care,

00:03:56.483 --> 00:04:01.718
the rest of us end up paying for their care in the form of higher premiums.

00:04:01.718 --> 00:04:04.351
And second, if you ask insurance companies to cover

00:04:04.351 --> 00:04:07.017
people with pre-existing conditions but don't require

00:04:07.017 --> 00:04:09.916
people who can afford it to buy their own insurance

00:04:09.916 --> 00:04:11.900
some folks might wait until they're sick

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.767
to buy the care they need which would also drive up everybody else's premiums.

00:04:17.767 --> 00:04:20.367
That's why even though I knew it wouldn't be politically popular

00:04:20.367 --> 00:04:23.283
and resisted the idea when I ran for this office,

00:04:23.283 --> 00:04:27.017
we ultimately included a provision in the Affordable Care Act

00:04:27.017 --> 00:04:32.983
that people who can afford to buy health insurance should take the responsibility to do so.

00:04:32.983 --> 00:04:37.867
In fact this idea's enjoyed support  from members of both parties

00:04:37.867 --> 00:04:40.700
including the current Republican nominee for President.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:44.301
Still I know the debate over this law has been divisive.

00:04:44.301 --> 00:04:48.483
I respect the very real concerns that millions of Americans have shared.

00:04:48.483 --> 00:04:51.067
And I know a lot of coverage through this healthcare debate

00:04:51.067 --> 00:04:54.500
has focused on what it means politically.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.801
Well, it should be pretty clear by now that I didn't do this

00:04:56.801 --> 00:05:00.333
because it was good politics.  I did it because I believed

00:05:00.333 --> 00:05:02.783
it was good for the country.

00:05:02.783 --> 00:05:07.417
I did it because I believed it was good for the American people.

00:05:07.417 --> 00:05:10.817
You know there's a framed letter that hangs in my office right now.

00:05:10.817 --> 00:05:13.067
It was sent to me during the healthcare debate

00:05:13.067 --> 00:05:16.218
by a woman named Natoma Canfield.

00:05:16.218 --> 00:05:19.583
For years and years Natoma did everything right.

00:05:19.583 --> 00:05:23.483
She bought health insurance.  She paid her premiums on time.

00:05:23.483 --> 00:05:27.300
But 18 years ago Natoma was diagnosed with cancer.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.417
And even though she'd been cancer-free for more than a decade

00:05:30.417 --> 00:05:34.801
her insurance company kept jacking up her rates year after year.

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:38.400
And despite her desire to keep her coverage, despite her fears

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.850
that she would get sick again, she had to surrender

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:46.301
her health insurance and was forced to hang her fortunes on chance.

00:05:46.301 --> 00:05:49.600
I carried Natoma's story with me every day of the fight to pass

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:54.833
this law.  It reminded me of all the Americans, all across the country

00:05:54.833 --> 00:05:57.884
who have had to worry not only about getting sick

00:05:57.884 --> 00:06:01.233
but about the cost of getting well.

00:06:01.233 --> 00:06:04.283
Natoma's well today.  And because of this law there are

00:06:04.283 --> 00:06:09.033
other Americans, other sons and daughters, brothers and sisters,

00:06:09.033 --> 00:06:12.033
fathers and mothers who will not have to hang

00:06:12.033 --> 00:06:14.950
their fortunes on chance.

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.634
These are the Americans for whom we passed this law.

00:06:19.634 --> 00:06:22.384
The highest court in the land has now spoken.

00:06:22.384 --> 00:06:24.968
We will continue to implement this law.

00:06:24.968 --> 00:06:28.217
And we'll work together to improve on it where we can.

00:06:28.217 --> 00:06:31.883
But what we won't do, what the country can't afford to do

00:06:31.883 --> 00:06:35.916
is refight the political battles of two years ago or go back

00:06:35.916 --> 00:06:38.884
to the way things were. With today's announcement

00:06:38.884 --> 00:06:41.783
it's time for us to move forward.  To implement and

00:06:41.783 --> 00:06:44.566
where necessary improve on this law.

00:06:44.566 --> 00:06:47.582
Now's the time to keep our focus on the most urgent challenge

00:06:47.582 --> 00:06:50.783
of our time: putting people back to work,

00:06:50.783 --> 00:06:53.417
paying down our debt, and building an economy

00:06:53.417 --> 00:06:56.134
where people can have confidence that if they work hard

00:06:56.134 --> 00:06:58.417
they can get ahead.

00:06:58.417 --> 00:07:01.750
But today I'm as confident as ever that when we look back

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.884
5 years from now or 10 years from now or 20 years from now

00:07:06.884 --> 00:07:09.067
we'll be better off because we had the courage

00:07:09.067 --> 00:07:13.250
to pass this law and keep moving forward.

00:07:13.250 --> 99:59:59.000
Thank you.  God bless you.  And God bless America.
