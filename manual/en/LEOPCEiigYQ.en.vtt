00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.850
Obviously, animals can talk. If they couldn’t,
would we name social chat services after them?

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.670
When we say “animals”, we’re not usually
talking about humans. We have this intuition

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.600
that humans are very different from the rest
of nature.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:20.860
If we are so special, the search is on for
what makes us special. The first thing to

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:25.970
reach for is often human language. We can
talk to each other, but the rest of the animal

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:31.869
kingdom? Blank stares.
What about animals that can communicate?

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.620
Ants leave pheromone trails that other ants
can sniff out with their antennae. Bees dance

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.620
to tell the hive where to find flowers. Birds
learn to sing. But is any of this really language?

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.290
To sort this matter out, linguists, ethologists
and biologists came up with lists of things

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:58.399
that make a language a language. It’s not
an easy thing to do. Before you look at these,

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.289
try making your own.
Take one of the terms that often ends up on

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:08.070
these lists: displacement. Animals adopt postures
or vocalizations to signal an opportunity

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:13.490
or warn of immediate danger. But displacement
- signaling about something removed from our

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.150
surroundings, something far away, something
in the past or future - seems legitimately

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.770
rare. Not for humans! You’ll catch us languaging
displacement all over the place. We’re not

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.520
the only ones, though.
Enter the honey bee, who performs a waggling,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.460
rotating dance that contains information about
the direction and distance of a point of interest.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.189
This “waggle dance” definitely has displacement,
but it doesn’t have double articulation.

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:46.189
Double articulation or “duality of patterning”
gives us humans a layer of meaningless sounds

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.070
that we can put together and switch around
like building blocks to create a meaningful

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.649
layer of words and sentences. Linguists
argue that these two levels - meaningless pieces

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:02.490
we use to build up meaning - make us more flexible
talkers than we’d be if our smallest communication

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.280
units were already packed with meaning, like
if we communicated by pointing to pictures

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.859
of real-world objects.
Wait! You hear that? There’s a low rumble

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:17.659
building up in the audience. Hold on! What
about apes? Didn’t Koko the Gorilla cry

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:22.870
when she was told that Robin Williams died?
I mean, that sounds like displacement. And

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.760
it sounds like sadness. And doesn’t she
use sign language to build meaning out of

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:34.230
simple gestures? I mean, that’s double articulation
right there! Hmm, okay, let’s come back

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.290
to that.
But what do you think language is? And do

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.409
other animals have it? Set us straight in
