Hey guys, it's the Knitting Maniac again.
Welcome to my first actual knitting tutorial!

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.590
In this lesson you will learn your first knitting
abbreviation, how to do a slip knot

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.230
and you'll also learn the thumb method of
casting on stitches. So let's get started.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.089
Here's your first knitting abbreviation . . . CO.

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.989
With any knitting pattern, in order to start
a project you need to add stitches to your

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:26.779
needle, which in the knitting world

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:28.550
is called Casting On.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.150
So, let's move on to learning how to "Cast
On" your first stitches.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.020
Any method of casting on in knitting requires
a slip knot to start, so let me show you how

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.690
to do that now.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.220
Taking your yarn, wrap it around your finger
like this, forming an "X", and pinch it where

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.970
the "X" is.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.440
You're going to take your yarn tail and poke
it up through the loop, making a second little

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.280
loop.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.170
And pick that up with your needle. Pull your
needle up, and then pull the two yarn ends

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.280
to snug it up to your needle.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.079
Let me show you one more time.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:06.950
Take the yarn and wrap it around your finger.
Put the yarn through the loop.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:13.950
Grab that loop you just poked up. Grap that
with your needle. Tug up. Cinch it out snug

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.530
to your needle and that's the Slip Knot.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.350
Are you ready to learn your first cast on
method? Let's move on to the "Thumb Cast On".

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.100
Since this series focuses on the beginner
knitter, I wanted to start with a very basic

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.439
cast on, so I'm going to show you how to do
the Thumb Cast On.

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:37.439
All you need is one needle, your yarn, and
you have to have a slip knot on your needle!

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.149
So, you grab the yarn that's attached to your
yarn ball, and you wrap it around your thumb

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.359
like this.

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:52.840
Taking your needle tip, scoop it off your
thumb and onto your needle!

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.639
Don't snug it up too tight or it will be hard
to knit into when you start your first row.

00:01:57.639 --> 00:02:02.670
Go around your thumb, scoop it up, and slip
it off!

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.539
Let's do it one more time. So, around your
thumb

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:08.960
Scoop it up

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:15.960
Slip it onto your needle and don't snug it
up too tight.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.910
So that's your THUMB CAST ON!

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.620
I made little swatches to show you the end
result and

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.780
this is the cast on edge here. You can see
that it's nice and stretchy

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.640
and it's a pretty smooth looking edge.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:35.060
The only downfall to the thumb cast on is
when you go to knit into your first stitches,

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.280
it can be a little hard to knit into them.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.030
So, just really make sure you don't snug them
up too tight!

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.060
So, if you are interested in learning any
other cast on methods, I WILL link to 3 different

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:48.550
methods at the end of this video!
