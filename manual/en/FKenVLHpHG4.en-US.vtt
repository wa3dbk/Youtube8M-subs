00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.700
to make this cord i will be working long stitches

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:22.900
Make a foundation chain of 4

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:38.100
double crochet through the first chain stitch from the beginning

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.580
Now turn the work to the back side to have chain stitches on top

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:52.620
chain 4

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.660
and work into the chain space of 4

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:21.780
make 3 treble crochet stitches (yarn over the hook 2 times for a treble stitch)

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.540
Now i will be making long stitches

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.340
yarn over the hook once

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.860
work stitches around the posts

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.900
insert the hook into the space between the first treble and chain stitches

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.780
yarn over, pull up a loop

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:47.820
repeat: yarn over, insert the hook under the posts and pull up a loop

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.060
hold the loops on the hook with your finger

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.620
there will be 11 loops on the hook

00:01:54.620 --> 00:02:09.660
repeat 3 more times: yarn over and pull up a loop.

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.020
We have 11 loops on the hook

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:33.620
now yarn over and pull through 2 loops on the hook

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:53.420
then yarn over and pull through 3 loops on the hook 4 times

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.500
now yarn over pull through 2 loops on the hook to finish the stitch

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.620
we have one loop on the hook

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:04.980
chain 3

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:17.060
and double crochet 2 together into the chain space

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.020
onto this chain space we`ve made 3 treble crochet stitches.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:22.420
to make a double crochet 2 together

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.940
start the first double, work until you have 2 loops on the hook

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:30.940
and start the second double, work until you have 3 loops on the hook

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.740
yarn over and finish the stitch

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:39.500
Now turn the work to the back side

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.660
chain 4

00:03:45.660 --> 00:04:07.980
and treble crochet 3 into the chain space of 3

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.260
now let`s repeat the same making long stitches around the treble posts

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:20.340
yarn over, wrap the hook around the posts and pull up a loop

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.820
Help with you finger

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:34.620
repeat 4 more times: yarn over, pull up a loop

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:38.620
now yarn over an pull through 2 loops on the hook

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:49.100
then yarn over and pull through 3 loops on your hook 4 times

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:53.780
and to finish the stitch yarn over and pull through the last 2 loops

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:57.620
continue chain 3

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:17.500
then double crochet 2 together into the chain space of 3

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.780
Now turn the work to the other side

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:24.820
chain 4

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.500
treble crochet 3 into this chain space

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.980
and repeat the same as we did before

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:39.460
you can continue as many times as needed and make very long lace

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:47.900
the lace doesn`t have back or front side

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:06.020
I have the same lace made of variegated yarn. Later I will show you how to use this lace in you project.

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.020
thanks for watching.
