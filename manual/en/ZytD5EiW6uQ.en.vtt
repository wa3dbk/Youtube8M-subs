00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:02.266
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Well,
hello, everybody.

00:00:02.266 --> 00:00:03.133
AUDIENCE: Hello!

00:00:03.133 --> 00:00:06.066
PRESIDENT OBAMA: Selamat petang.

00:00:06.066 --> 00:00:08.800
I want to thank Prime Minister
Najib for bringing me here

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.567
today, as well as Cheryl Yeoh.

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:12.567
Where's Cheryl?

00:00:12.567 --> 00:00:14.734
She was here just a second ago.

00:00:14.734 --> 00:00:17.000
There she is over there --

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.200
            (applause)

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.834
-- who's going to be

00:00:19.834 --> 00:00:23.133
directing the Malaysian
Global Innovation and

00:00:23.133 --> 00:00:28.533
Creativity Center, or "MaGIC,"
and Startup Malaysia.

00:00:28.533 --> 00:00:32.033
As Prime Minister
Najib indicated,

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:36.934
we are here because we have a
shared commitment to fostering

00:00:36.934 --> 00:00:39.700
the spirit of entrepreneurship,
especially among

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.400
our young people.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.700
We want you to be able to create
things and start your own

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.200
companies and your
own businesses,

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.800
and come up with your own
products and services,

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.433
because that's how
our societies grow.

00:00:54.433 --> 00:00:57.900
And the dreams and talents of
these young people help to fuel

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.133
our economies and create
jobs, and they also bring

00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:03.166
our countries closer together.

00:01:03.166 --> 00:01:06.400
So, five years ago,
when I was in Cairo,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:10.533
I called for a new partnership
between the United States and

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:14.767
Muslim communities around the
world -- partnerships where we

00:01:14.767 --> 00:01:18.266
could focus on the things that
matter most in people's daily

00:01:18.266 --> 00:01:21.800
lives, including jobs and
providing for our families.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:26.100
So often the conversation
between the United States

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.734
and Muslim communities was
around security issues,

00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:32.967
but the truth is, day to day
what people are concerned about

00:01:32.967 --> 00:01:38.100
is jobs and businesses and
improving quality of life for

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.533
themselves and their families.

00:01:39.533 --> 00:01:41.166
And that was not enough
of a conversation that

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:43.800
was taking place.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:48.467
So I was proud to host the first
Global Entrepreneurship Summit

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:50.000
in Washington.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.667
Prime Minister Najib -- who
has been working to empower

00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:57.133
entrepreneurs here in Malaysia
-- hosted last year's summit

00:01:57.133 --> 00:01:58.533
in Kuala Lumpur.

00:01:58.533 --> 00:02:00.734
And the impact has
been phenomenal.

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:04.367
Around the world, we are helping
young entrepreneurs connect

00:02:04.367 --> 00:02:07.300
and collaborate and start
their own businesses,

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.400
serve their communities, tackle
global challenges like expanding

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.100
education and combating
climate change,

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.200
and create this center to turn
their ideas into reality.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.734
And this center is a direct
result of the entrepreneurship

00:02:21.734 --> 00:02:24.834
summit that the Prime
Minister hosted.

00:02:24.834 --> 00:02:28.834
It's a one-stop shop
so young entrepreneurs,

00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:33.533
they can come here, they can get
help to file a patent for their

00:02:33.533 --> 00:02:36.200
ideas, they can access
loans and venture capital,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.467
they can get technical
training and assistance,

00:02:39.467 --> 00:02:41.800
and they can get their
businesses up and running.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.000
And we just had a chance to see
some innovations of some young

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.934
entrepreneurs that have already
been started: An online tool

00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:51.467
that helps students learn
with digital presentations;

00:02:51.467 --> 00:02:55.934
a very impressive
electric go-kart;

00:02:55.934 --> 00:03:02.033
a device that helps diabetics
monitor cold sweats,

00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:06.834
so that if they are in need of
medical assistance somebody will

00:03:06.834 --> 00:03:08.667
be alerted right away.

00:03:08.667 --> 00:03:10.900
And so this is the kind
of entrepreneurship

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.333
that Prime Minister Najib and
I want to encourage.

00:03:14.333 --> 00:03:17.100
And it's innovation like these
that's going to make our lives

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.000
better and safer and healthier.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.200
These young people here, they're
going to be creating all kinds

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:26.767
of amazing things
when they get older.

00:03:26.767 --> 00:03:29.900
And the fact that this center is
giving them the opportunity to

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:30.900
learn computer coding early on,
understanding that computer

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:40.533
sciences and IT are going to
be one of the keys to future

00:03:40.533 --> 00:03:45.300
growth, I think is a testament
to some outstanding investments

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.367
by the people of Malaysia
and the next generation.

00:03:47.367 --> 00:03:49.900
So I want to thank Prime
Minister Najib for all his

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.533
efforts to support
young entrepreneurs

00:03:52.533 --> 00:03:53.567
and would-be entrepreneurs.

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:57.333
And I want to thank all of
you for your determination

00:03:57.333 --> 00:03:59.066
and your imagination.

00:03:59.066 --> 00:04:03.133
I'm very excited to see what's
going to happen not only

00:04:03.133 --> 00:04:05.767
with the entrepreneurs
here in the future,

00:04:05.767 --> 00:04:08.900
but these young people and
the remarkable things they'll

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.900
do to help Malaysia grow,
help the region grow,

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:12.900
and help the world grow.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.734
So, terima kasih banyak for the
good work that you're doing.

00:04:17.734 --> 00:04:25.266
(Applause.) 

00:04:25.266 --> 00:04:26.300
PRIME MINISTER NAJIB: I'm
not going to make a speech,

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.700
but I just wanted
to say a few words.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.100
You know, the first U.S.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.200
President came
here 48 years ago.

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:44.033
In a way (inaudible.)
48 years after that,

00:04:44.033 --> 00:04:47.734
we want President Obama to
see the modern Malaysia.

00:04:47.734 --> 00:04:50.800
The face of the new Malaysia.

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.400
And you are the face - the
faces of the new Malaysia.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.467
          (Applause.)

00:04:58.467 --> 00:04:59.800
PRIME MINISTER NAJIB: Secondly,

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.367
President Obama asked me
"When is this building or

00:05:02.367 --> 00:05:05.300
establishment going to start?"

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.834
So, President Obama
it starts today,

00:05:07.834 --> 00:05:11.667
because you are here to
officiate the opening of
(inaudible.)

00:05:11.667 --> 00:05:15.800
Because we drew inspiration
from his initiative,

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:18.266
Global Entrepreneurship Summit.

00:05:18.266 --> 00:05:21.600
So I'd like to thank President
Obama for his initiative and we

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.467
have responded to him
by creating the center,

00:05:25.467 --> 00:05:28.300
by creating many, many
more young entrepreneurs

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:29.200
of the future.

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.900
By the way, there are
8,000 people in a tent.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.467
But 200 yards away and
they are listening to us.

00:05:37.467 --> 00:05:40.967
Unfortunately, they cannot get
up close to President Obama,

00:05:40.967 --> 00:05:45.867
but his words will certainly
inspire them to achieve whatever

00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:49.700
dreams that they have, to
turn their dreams into real

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:54.233
businesses, to become
successful (inaudible),

00:05:54.233 --> 00:05:56.834
to scale greater heights.

00:05:56.834 --> 00:06:00.333
And finally, to commemorate
President Obama's visit,

00:06:00.333 --> 00:06:06.700
I'd like to announce that the
oval field in front of this

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:12.100
center is going to
be called Obama Oval.

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.066
           (Applause.)

00:06:14.066 --> 00:06:18.834
PRESIDENT
OBAMA: Thank you.

00:06:18.834 --> 00:06:22.800
Well that's a great honor and to
the thousands of people who are

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.300
in the tent across the way, I'm
sorry that I am not able to join

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.133
you directly live.

00:06:28.133 --> 00:06:32.600
But the Prime Minister has told
me about some of the exciting

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.967
work that you're doing.

00:06:33.967 --> 00:06:38.133
And I want to make sure that the
message of entrepreneurship and

00:06:38.133 --> 00:06:41.100
partnership between the
United States and Malaysia,

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:44.266
that's a message I want
all of Malaysia to hear.

00:06:44.266 --> 00:06:50.900
Especially young people, because
I'm convinced as the world gets

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:54.867
smaller and more integrated that
people are going to be sharing

00:06:54.867 --> 00:06:58.967
ideas from all kinds
of different cultures.

00:06:58.967 --> 00:07:02.000
And one of the great strengths
of Malaysia is the fact that it

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.734
has a diverse culture; people
from different backgrounds.

00:07:05.734 --> 00:07:09.567
That's how you learn, that's how
you get new ideas by talking

00:07:09.567 --> 00:07:13.533
and interacting with people
who aren't just like you.

00:07:13.533 --> 00:07:20.100
And that's part of the
power of the internet.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.033
The information era is that all
these ideas from all around the

00:07:24.033 --> 00:07:24.834
world are colliding.

00:07:24.834 --> 00:07:28.100
So, thank you again Mr. Prime
Minister for your vision.

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:31.600
To all the people out there
thank you and dream big.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:33.667
We look forward to seeing all
the great things that you're

00:07:33.667 --> 00:07:34.700
going to be doing in the future.

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:35.767
Thank you.

00:07:35.767 --> 00:07:36.767
(Applause.)
