00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.359
I am make-up artist Lilly Keys, and today
as Valentine's Day is around the corner, I'd

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.870
thought I'd show you a really beautiful date
night make-up.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:18.750
[music]
So the skin is all prepped and primed, and

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.180
I'm going to go straight into the foundation.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.460
I'm going to be using this really cool foundation.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.580
It's actually a CC cream, it's from Bourjois.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.300
CC stands for color correction, so this actually
anti-fatigue, anti-redness and anti-dark spots.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.510
It's a really lovely color, this is #32 Beige
Clare.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:46.070
I'm just going to squeeze a little into my
hand, and with my foundation brush from Sephora,

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.890
I'm just going to be putting the foundation
from the middle of the face outwards.

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.700
This is date night makeup so we don't want
to be too heavy handed with the makeup and

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.880
scare off the guys.

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:02.649
We want to look really natural and pretty,
just a really nice extension of ourselves.

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.570
Onto the brows, and I'm using this clear mascara,
this one is by Collection 2000.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.210
Clear mascara is really, really good.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.630
It's an underrated product.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.820
Basically what I use it for is to set the
brows in place.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.119
Also gives it a very nice, subtle sheen.

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.700
It really, kind of defines the brows without
look too over the top.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.970
[music]
Going to be slightly darkening the brows,

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.780
and I'm using this eyebrow pencil by NARS.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:32.780
It's called Eye Panama.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:38.520
So I've given a good sharpening, and basically
I'm just going to be taking it slightly thicker

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.750
on the inner corners of the brows.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.860
You want to go with the direction of the hair
growth with little, short, feathery strokes

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.750
like I'm doing now.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.910
[music]
For the eyeshadow, I'm using this really beautiful

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.560
pallet from Clinique, and it's called Maple
Blossom.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.979
So I'm just going to be taking an eyeshadow
brush, a fluffy one, and with the gorgeous

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:07.980
color just dip it in the product, remember
to tap off any excess so it doesn't drop down

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:08.980
your face.

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:14.870
The reason that I am using this color is that,
generally as a base, slate grey, as a color,

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:21.290
really accentuates most eye colors, and it
is actually a flattering color that people

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.050
overlook and favors browns.

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:30.150
But for date night, we want to look quite
fresh and beautiful and slightly different

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.970
which is why I am going for this color.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:36.090
The second eye shadow color I am using is
this one, and it's kind of like a grey mushroomy

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.090
color.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.150
It's by MAC and it's called Ground Cover.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.590
With another eyeshadow brush, this time I'm
using a smaller angled one.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:49.440
I'm just going to get the color, and just
kind of us accentuate it on the outer corners

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.110
of the eye, just to give a bit of definition.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:56.840
So I'm using a coal pencil now to define the
eyes a little bit more.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:59.950
I'm using this one by Clinique; it's called
Blue Grey.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:04.819
It's really cool because it has a smudgey
bit on the other side so it's easier to use.

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:12.010
So what I'm going to do is take it along the
upper lash line, really kind of get it into

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.340
your lashes.

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.800
So we're not using a black eyeliner today,
because I don't want it to look too dark.

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.510
I want it to look very pretty and natural
and fresh.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.090
So even this is quiet cool, because it's a
blue grey color.

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:24.900
Black can sometimes be a bit harsh.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.220
So with the other side of this brush, I'm
just going to smudge it in to the lashes,

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:36.280
just so you've got a nice blending, and the
top as well.

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:41.840
Okay, so for the last step for the eyeshadow,
I'm using this really cool color by Bobby

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:43.760
Brown, and it's called Silver.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.670
For this I'm really going to be using it on
he middle of the eyelid.

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.890
So, just to kind of really pop that color
out.

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:57.099
[music]
Kind of give it an extra, extra dimension.

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:02.659
And I'm also going to be on the inner corners
of the eyes, so I'm just going to do it like

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:03.659
that.

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:04.659
Mascara next.

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:09.810
And I'm using this one by Top Shop, it's called
False Lash Mascara in black.

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:12.200
So I'm just going to be.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:14.410
You've got to be careful with this because
it's got a really big brush.

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.650
Just look down for me darling, thanks.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.350
So I'm really going to wiggle the brush into
the roots.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:23.919
Careful not to clump the lashes.

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:26.800
So I'm going to be doing the bronzer and the
blusher now.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.970
I'm using the duo product by Top Shop.

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:35.490
It's called Break of Day, and it's a bronzer
and blusher duo which is perfect.

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.460
So I'm using this Bobby Brown blusher brush
with this.

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.030
I'm kind of mixing it up, I don't want do
two, you know, separate products too much.

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:49.680
So I'm going to go under the cheekbones with
little strokes like this, just to really get

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.180
it blended in.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.530
And when I want to use the blusher, I'm just
going to concentrate on the pink, and just

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.460
do it more on the apples of the cheek over
here

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:04.180
I'm now going to highlight the face and I'm
going to be using this Iconic product from

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:05.180
MAC.

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:09.570
It's called Pearl, and it's a cream-color
base, so that's what you want to look for

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:10.570
when you go get it.

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.960
And I'm just going to take my finger and blot
it into the product, as you can see it's got

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.780
this really beautiful sheen on my finger.

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:25.010
And I'm going to be dabbing it onto the high
points of Theresa's face, her cheekbones here,

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:31.630
and a little bit just above the eyebrows.

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:35.820
Sometimes I like to do it just above the cupid's
bow as well, because it has a really nice

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.860
sheen and it makes the lips appear fuller.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:44.370
So now onto the lips, and I'm using this really
cool lipstick by Burberry.

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.580
It's called Pink Apricot, so I'm just using
my lip brush from Bobby Brown, and doing this

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.110
color directly onto the lips.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:56.840
Not going to be using a lip liner or anything,
because we don't want it to be too overstyled.

00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:04.240
I just want it to look like your natural lip
color really, slightly matte, very velvet

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.240
looking.

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.960
Okay, so lastly, I'm going to be setting the
face with some powder.

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.700
And I'm not going to be putting too much on,
because we still want to look fresh and young

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:12.700
and dewy.

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:17.490
But I'm using this powder by this really amazing
brand I've newly discovered.

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.699
It's called EX1.

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:23.710
This is called InvisiWear Powder, and this
is in Shade 100.

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:28.660
This makeup brand is really geared towards
olive skin, but it can also be used for darker

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.130
shades as well.

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:37.250
And it's such nice powder because it's lightweight,
and it doesn't sit in your skin, and you know,

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:41.229
sit in lines or anything like that.

00:06:41.229 --> 00:06:42.229
So it's really lovely, it really does what
it says.

00:06:42.229 --> 00:06:47.500
So I'm generally just going to be putting
in on the T zone on the forehead, around the

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:52.395
nose, and just on the chin, and that's it
really.

00:06:52.395 --> 00:06:55.349
So here we have it guys, here's the finished
look for today, date night makeup.

00:06:55.349 --> 00:06:57.919
I really hope you enjoyed this how to video.

00:06:57.919 --> 00:07:00.800
If you have, please give me a big thumbs up.

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.099
Don't forget to tune in next week, where I'll
be showing to recreate Rosie Huntington Wiley's

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:07.490
beautiful makeup look.

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.979
I'll see you then guys.

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:09.580
Bye
