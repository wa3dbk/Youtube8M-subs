00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:06.950
Providing reliable protection from the elements,
the Women’s Patagonia Torrentshell Jacket

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.870
is the perfect travel piece where you might
be in towns and you might be in the back country.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.839
It would be great for hiking and back packing
and just every day use.

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:23.630
The first thing to talk about with any rain
jacket is the fabric and how it protects you

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.980
from the rain.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:33.000
So Patagonia uses a two and a half layered
H2No fabric which is a proprietary Patagonia

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:41.370
fabric that allows you to breathe as you are
moving so in warmer temperatures this is a

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.550
breathable, fully waterproof piece.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.230
It is seam taped so you don’t have to worry
about water sneaking though the seams and

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.510
the H2No fabric keeps you dry from the in-side
by being breathable.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:59.039
And it keeps you dry from the outside from
the rain.

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.579
It is 100 percent nylon rip stop material.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.750
And something else that just keeps you a little
bit more dry from the inside and more breathable

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.440
is the integrated pit zips in this piece.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.871
So the pit zips just allow warm air to escape.

00:01:15.871 --> 00:01:22.390
It is underneath of your arm, so you are still
protected from the rain, but it is just going

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:28.220
to allow you to be a little bit more comfortable
as you are moving and as you are hiking.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.130
This is a fully featured rain jacket.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.610
So starting with the full length zipper, you
have two layers of protection in front of

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.710
that zipper.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:45.030
You also have a storm flap behind the zipper,
so that is really going to protect water from

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.970
sneaking in through the zipper.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.180
Down at the bottom of the jacket around the
hem you have points of adjustability on both

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.180
sides.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.180
So you can really cinch that down.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:01.730
If you are wearing a back pack with a hip
belt or you are wearing a climbing harness,

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:06.170
this is definitely going to keep the bottom
of the jacket cinched down around you.

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:11.890
There are two hand level pockets on this piece
and one of the pockets you can actually stuff

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.840
the jacket down into that pocket.

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.530
But these are really comfortable hand level
pockets.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.170
So they are set up height enough that if you
are wearing a back pack or a harness you can

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:23.710
still access the top of the pocket.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.260
They are not set up too high that it is uncomfortable
for every day use.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:34.920
Again, you do have pit zips under your arms
and right here on the cuff you just have an

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.340
adjustable Velcro cuff on either side.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.310
Moving up to the collar and the hood you have
a lot of adjustability there.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.510
So the hood is big enough you could wear a
helmet underneath of it.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:52.310
But it is not so big and bulky with all of
the adjustability you have there that if you

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.580
are wearing it for every day use you can cinch
it down and it is... it doesn’t feel too

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.820
big.

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.780
The jacket actually has an area where you
can roll up the hood.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.290
So if you aren’t wearing this jacket in
the rain, if you are just wearing it as a

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:13.660
windbreaker, you can roll down that hood so
that it is out of the way and it is not bulky.

00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:19.319
The fit of this jacket is exactly what I would
expect from Patagonia in their more relaxed

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.320
fit, in their rain pieces.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:26.240
I am wearing a small right now and I normally
wear smalls in Patagonia in most of their

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:29.270
other women’s outerwear pieces.

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:31.190
I have enough room to move.

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.510
I don’t feel confined wearing this size
small.

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:43.120
And I am wearing a light weight fleece piece
underneath of this and a light weight t-shirt.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.880
So there is definitely room to layer up underneath.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:53.209
If you like to wear your jackets a little
bit tighter, I might size down, but all in

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:55.000
all this fits really well.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.380
I feel like I can move in this and there is
enough room in the shoulders that if I am

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.760
moving around I don’t feel like the jacket
is going to ride up on me.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:08.480
All in all this is the perfect all around
rain jacket.

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.470
You are going to be completely protect-ed
from the elements with that H2No fabric.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:17.549
And it comes in fun colors, fun style lines.

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.389
So it is going to be just as at home downtown
as it is in the backcountry.

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.090
It is the Women’s Patagonia Torrentshell
Jacket.
