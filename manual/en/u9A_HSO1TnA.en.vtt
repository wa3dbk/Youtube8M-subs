00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.279
• From lakes that actually explode to a
twin planet that crashed into Earth once upon

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:10.350
a time, we count 15 facts about the little
blue planet we like to call home

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.760
15 - 24 Hours,
• The common saying goes that there's only

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:19.740
24 hours in a day - but that isn't actually
true, the Earth spins on its axis for 23 hours

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.640
and 56 minutes
• The reason we add an extra 4 minutes is

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.199
because the distance in which we've orbited
the sun is so great that it takes some extra

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:32.599
time just for us to face the sun again
• And since the Earth is spinning slower

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.920
and slower every few million years, in around
250 million years a typical day will actually

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.040
last 1.5 hours longer
14 - Gravity Glitch,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.550
• There is an area in Canada known as Hudson
Bay with uneven mass - and where there's uneven

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.250
mass, there's uneven gravity
• Long-since melted glaciers once lined

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:56.000
the area, but now they're gone and the burden
of gravity remains in both the ice sheets

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.879
and underneath the Earth's crust, leading
to lower gravity here than anywhere else on

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:03.290
Earth
• Don't get too excited though - it's not

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.020
like you'll be able to start moon-jumping
around Canada - the difference in gravity

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.000
is only a 0.005% reduction, so minute that
you can't even feel it

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.700
13 - Photo,
• 65 miles above the atmosphere, the first

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:23.900
ever photo of Earth was taken with a camera
carried by a V-2 missile in 1946 - it snapped

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.439
a frame every second and a half and managed
to survive re-entry

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:31.810
• The scientists who reviewed the footage
were beyond ecstatic, jumping up and down

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.950
with joy that they could finally see their
own world in a still image

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.630
• Likewise in 1967 the first full-on, colour
Earth image was taken by the DODGE satellite,

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.200
which you can see on-screen here
12 - Ocean Salt,

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.960
• Most of the salt in our ocean comes from
rocks on the shores, mainly because rainwater

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.320
which is naturally acidic breaks down the
rock and distributes their components into

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.800
the water
• Seawater salt is so dense that if you

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.659
were to dissolve all the oceans in the world
and spread the remaining salt over all the

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:06.830
land on earth, you'd have a 500 foot thick
salt layer coating EVERYTHING

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.379
11 - Rocks Can Walk,
• There exists a flat lakebed in Death Valley

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.969
known as Racetrack Playa, in which rocks physically
move from place to place

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:19.609
• And it's not just small rocks, but ones
weighing tens or hundreds of pounds - the

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:24.389
theory goes that these ice-encrusted rocks
are flooded by meltwater from the hills

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:29.230
• This makes everything nice and slick which,
along with a hard breeze, allows the rock

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.549
to travel
10 - Twin Planet,

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:34.540
• There is a well known theory that at the
beginning of Earth's development there existed

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.709
a smaller twin planet known as Theia, roughly
the size of mars

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.730
• 4.5 billion years ago it crashed into
Earth and while most of it was absorbed into

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.249
Earth's crust, the rest drifted off and formed
that celestial body known as the Moon

00:02:48.249 --> 00:02:53.019
• The reason this theory came about is because
typically planets of Earth's size don't have

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:57.829
moons quite so big, and not to mention various
matters found on the Moon are somehow shared

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.649
with Earth
9 - Heat,

00:02:59.649 --> 00:03:04.120
• Many assume the Sun to be our main source
of energy, a life-giving ball of energy to

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.089
which we are utterly dependent - and that
if we ever stopped receiving heat from the

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:12.879
sun, the human race would go extinct
• In reality, Earth's core is just as hot

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:17.109
as the surface of the Sun - between 5,000
to 7,000 degrees celcius

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:22.219
• In the event of a catastrophe say, sun
rays are permanently blocked by clouds and

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:27.459
all land on Earth freezes, we can still harness
the energy within Earth to keep us alive

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.700
8 - Exploding Lakes,
• Three lakes in Cameroon, near the border

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.159
of the Congo named Nyos, Monoun and Kivu - more
commonly referred to as the exploding lakes

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:42.529
• In 1984 on a small stretch of road, a
gas cloud appeared and swallowed a great many

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:46.840
local villagers walking on their way to work
before getting swept away with the wind

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.559
• 37 people were killed instantly, and they
discovered the gas cloud was in fact carbon

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:56.059
dioxide released in an explosion from the
lakes, which happened to be sitting above

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:59.150
volcanic Earth - and continue to do so to
this day

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.689
7 - Unexplored Oceans,
• Even though we've touched down on the

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:07.010
Moon and conquered vast mountains, the truth
is we've only explored little under 10% of

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:10.040
the ocean
• To this day we've only discovered near

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.669
210,000 underwater species with an estimated
20 million yet to be seen

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:20.269
• That means a distant fish-human hybrid
may indeed have evolved somewhere deep beneath

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.930
the ocean surface, and mermaids could still
be a real thing - either that, or more species

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:27.800
of fungus
6 - Supercontinent,

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:33.210
• Back a long time ago when dinosaurs first
roamed the Earth, there existed a supercontinent

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:37.580
called Pangaea that merged all the countries
of the world together into one landmass

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.319
• But did you know that another supercontinent
will form in the next 250 million years?

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:48.240
• It's name will be Pangaea Ultima, including
a subduction of the western Atlantic, the

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:53.360
destruction of the Atlantic and Indian basin,
rejoining America with Africa and Europe - the

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.840
centre of this giant landmass effectively
a semi-arad desert prone to extreme temperatures

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:02.520
5 - Leaving a Mark,
• Nuclear tests in the 1950s continuing

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:07.550
to this day have thrown dust into the atmosphere
circling our planet - most of it falls down

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:10.520
as rain and snow, but some gets trapped in
glaciers

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.960
• These glaciers formed over millions of
years leave timeline indicators that help

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:19.649
scientists date the exact time that piece
of ice formed in Earth's history

00:05:19.649 --> 00:05:25.069
• Which means when scientists of the future
look at our glacier slice, they'll no doubt

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:31.050
shake their heads and whisper a gentle "goddamnit"
• That's IF the glaciers survive their rapid

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:35.629
melting from global warming - which they aren't
4 - Earth Isn't Round,

00:05:35.629 --> 00:05:40.330
• For a long time in Earth's history, people
have believed the world is flat and no doubt

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:44.120
you'll find people tell you this even in the
comment section of this video

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:49.120
• But the Earth isn't exactly round either
- there's a bulge inside the equator stretching

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:54.120
about 20 miles outwards, which actually gives
it more of a rotund appearance if you look

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.810
at it from the right angle
• So while it is technically circle, like

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.840
all bodies that have eaten take away one too
many times, the slight gut gives it away

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.909
3 - Underwater Gold,
• If you were to go exploring in the deep,

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:10.129
vast oceans, you might discover some flakes
of gold, but did you know there are more than

00:06:10.129 --> 00:06:13.750
20 million tons of gold at the bottom of the
sea?

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:17.669
• The only reason we haven't grabbed our
scuba gear and excavation equipment is because

00:06:17.669 --> 00:06:23.669
the gold is spread out over such a wide area,
where one litre of water contains just 13

00:06:23.669 --> 00:06:27.120
billionths of a gram of gold that people don't
think it's worth it

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.419
• There currently doesn't exist any efficient
way of harvesting this gold - but if we could

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:36.720
manage it, we'd have enough to give every
single person on earth 9 pounds worth of gold

00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:39.590
2 - Largest Living Thing,
• Most would point to the Blue Whale if

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:44.449
asked to identify the largest living creature
on this planet, but there exists another living

00:06:44.449 --> 00:06:49.590
organism that could easily top it
• One mushroom grows fungus which tunnels

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.620
underground, one particular variety of honey
mushroom found in Oregon was discovered to

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:02.190
be over 2,200 acres big, stretching all underground
• Try to imagine yourself with body hair

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:07.699
spanning over 2,000 football fields and you're
able to feel everything that comes into contact

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:10.479
with it - and you'll know what it's like to
be this mushroom

00:07:10.479 --> 00:07:13.249
1 - Super-Earths
• Earth has always been a curious place

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:17.349
because it's only just barely far enough away
from the sun not to get burnt, but not so

00:07:17.349 --> 00:07:20.029
far that it freezes
• Scientists have been searching through

00:07:20.029 --> 00:07:24.659
a number of exoplanets, planets that orbit
another star other than our sun that happen

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:29.240
to be in the habitable zone, not too hot and
not too cold - just enough of both to sustain

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.310
life as we know it
• Since 2012, several Super-Earths have

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:38.039
been discovered considerably bigger than Earth
but still in the habitable zone - we've even

00:07:38.039 --> 00:07:42.430
seen a planet discovered this year that is
roughly the same size, could theoretically

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:46.319
sustain life and orbits a red dwarf
• There's no telling if we'll ever find

00:07:46.319 --> 00:07:49.659
another Earth - that's a job left to the future
generations
