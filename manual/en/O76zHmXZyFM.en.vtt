Hi! My name is Kara. On behalf of expertvillage.com,
today we’ll be talking about how to do a

00:00:15.541 --> 00:00:22.090
leg wax. Now we’re ready to begin our wax.
Gently apply the stick to wax and apply to

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:30.910
a small area of your hand to make sure that
it is not too hot. Once it’s tested, you’re

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:40.180
ready to begin. You want to gently apply the
stick to the wax and remove all the excess.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:59.489
You then want to apply the wax in a downward
motion. Apply several times if you need to.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:10.470
You want to then take your strip, gently place
it over the waxed area, and press down 2-3

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:23.200
times. Holding the leg taut, you want to then
pull. Go over once or twice until all the

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.920
excess wax comes out. Apply a small amount
of pressure to the area and move your hand

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:42.630
downward. Continue through the next few sections
until the leg is completed.
