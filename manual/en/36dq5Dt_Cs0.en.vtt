Hi and welcome to AC News! Here’s today’s video, movie news are coming up!

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Charlie Sheen, Bill Murray and Jason Schwartzman

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
are all starring in A Glimpse Inside the Mind of Charles Swan III, by director Roman Coppola.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Unusual title for a movie, but maybe not so unusual for Coppola.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The director is very happy with his choice for the lead role, played by Sheen,

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000
who very charming and full of charisma was evidently perfect for this role.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
We don't know much about the plot of the movie,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
but from some photos we have a peculiar,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
positive and special feeling about it.
