Hi. My name is Darren.
I work for Virgin Media.

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.920
Today, I want to show you how to connect
your Windows Vista machine

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.200
to a wireless network.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.560
The first thing we need to do is to
check that your Super Hub is online.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.120
On this particular Super Hub, we are
looking at the centre green light,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:22.480
which has a tick above it.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.000
This should be solid.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.960
On this Super Hub,
we are looking for the blue tick light,

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.880
which also should be solid.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.960
Moving over to the machine,

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.920
we want to navigate down
to the bottom right-hand corner.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.080
In that corner, we click
on the symbol of two tellies.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.200
Then select
"wireless networks available".

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.760
The window pops up, showing all the
available networks within the vicinity.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.120
From there, we want to select
our wireless network.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.600
You're looking
for your wireless network name.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.280
This is your SSID.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.440
The wireless network, or SSID,

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.480
is located on the label
on the rear of this Super Hub

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.280
and the bottom of this Super Hub.

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.720
Once we have identified our SSID,
we select it from the list.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.000
Click "connect".

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:18.560
You'll be prompted for a Pin.
We don't want to use a Pin.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.160
Instead, we want to use the passphrase.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.480
Towards the bottom, it gives us
the option to use passphrase instead.

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.600
Select that.
We are then prompted for a passphrase.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.200
This passphrase is located
on the Super Hubs.

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.960
On this Super Hub,
it's on the rear label.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.080
On this Super Hub,
it's on the label on the bottom.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.840
The passphrase is case-sensitive.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.280
This is the default,
unless you have changed it.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.800
We pop that in the box.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.680
Then click "connect".

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.920
This may take a little while.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.200
We then get confirmation

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.160
that we are successfully connected
to that network.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.240
Just close that box.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.480
On your machine,
you may be prompted for a location.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.000
Just select "home".

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.760
That's it. We are now connected
wirelessly to the Internet.
