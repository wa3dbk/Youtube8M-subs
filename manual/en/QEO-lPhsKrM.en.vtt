00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.170
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL DAY FOR THE FFA
MARKET SHEEP SHOW.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:32.020
180 EXHIBITORS INSIDE SHOWING
396 LAMBS.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.489
§
OUR JUDGE TODAY IS SAM FUNK

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:34.610
FROM DEFIANCE, MISSOURI.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.490
IF YOU COULD JUST GET THAT TO
OPEN UP, THERE'S A LOT OF MUSCLE

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.580
COME RIGHT ALONG - RIGHT THROUGH THERE.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:43.350
IN A MARKET LAMB, WHAT YOU'RE
TRYING TO FIND IS AN ANIMAL THAT

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.640
BOTH EXHIBITS WHAT WOULD BE GOOD
TO HARVEST THE LAMB ON A CARCASS

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.670
ONCE WE'RE WAS GOING TO HANG
THAT LAMB ON THE RAIL TO HARVEST

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:51.290
THE ANIMAL, AND THEN YOU'RE ALSO
LOOKING OBVIOUSLY -- BECAUSE

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.090
WE'RE NOT JUST JUDGING CARCASSES
ON THE ANIMALS.

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.879
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THEIR SHOW
RING APPEAL IN THERE AS WELL, SO

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:56.879
YOU'RE LOOKING AT STRUCTURE.

00:00:56.879 --> 00:00:57.879
YOU'RE LOOKING AT BALANCE.

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.079
YOU'RE LOOKING AT HOW THAT
ANIMAL TRAVELS AND ALL SORT OF

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.190
INTANGIBLES THAT COME INTO PLAY
THAT YOU WOULD NEVER SEE IF YOU

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.831
HARVESTED THE LAMB ON THE RAIL,
BUT AT THE SAME TIME, YOU'RE

00:01:05.831 --> 00:01:18.140
GOING TO SEE IT IN THE SHOW
RING.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.470
§
ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.180
AGRICULTURE, AS OF JANUARY 2012,
THERE WERE 5.35 MILLION HEAD OF

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.799
SHEEP HERE IN THE U.S.
SHEEP ARE PRODUCED IN ALL 50

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.520
STATES, AND IOWA RANKS TENTH
WITH 195,000 HEAD.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.760
§
WHY DON'T YOU GO AHEAD AND MOVE

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:40.850
FORWARD.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.469
EXCELLENT LAMB.

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:46.020
TREMENDOUS QUALITY OF LAMBS.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.110
IOWA STATE FAIR HAS HAD A
REPETITION FOR HAVING SOME OF

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.799
THE MOST OUTSTANDING ANIMALS FOR
ALL SPECIES AND ALL FAIRS.

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:54.780
I THINK OBVIOUSLY THE LAMBS HERE
TODAY HAVE JUST BEEN ABSOLUTELY

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.780
OUTSTANDING.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.780
THE KIDS HAVE BEEN EVEN BETTER
THAN THE LAMBS.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.380
I THINK THAT'S THE IMPORTANT
THING.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.380
FOR THIS SHOW.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:00.380
FOR THE FFA SHOW.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.700
WE ARE HERE FOR THE
FFA YOUTH EXHIBITOR.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.619
AND THEY HAVE BEEN JUST ABSOLUTELY
GRAND BEING HERE TODAY.

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.619
AND THEY HAD A WONDERFUL LAMBS
COMING HERE.

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:09.170
IT WAS TOUGH TO TELL, SOME OF
THEM, I LIKE ONE LAMB MORE THAN

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.070
OTHER ONE BECAUSE THERE WERE SO
MANY GOOD ONES.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:15.780
AT THE SAME TIME, I WOULD SAY
THE QUALITY IS EXCELLENT.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.760
§
THE WORD "LAMB" IS USED TO

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.760
DEFINE SHEEP MEAT FROM AN ANIMAL
THAT IS LESS THAN ONE YEAR OLD,

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.790
WHILE MUTTON IS USED TO DEFINE
MEAT FROM SHEEP ONE YEAR OLD AND

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:29.790
OLDER.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.900
ABOUT 2.2 MILLION SHEEP AND
LAMBS WERE SLAUGHTERED IN THE

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.790
U.S.
LAST YEAR, PRODUCING 149 MILLION

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:39.920
POUNDS OF CARCASS WEIGHT LAMB
MEAT.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.110
NOW, HERE IN THE UNITED STATES,
THE PER CAPITA CONSUMPTION OF

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:45.450
LAMB, IT'S VERY LOW.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:47.590
LESS THAN 1 POUND PER PERSON.

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.520
HOWEVER, THERE'S GROWING DEMAND
FOR LAMB, ESPECIALLY AMONG

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.830
PEOPLE OF CERTAIN ETHNIC
BACKGROUNDS.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:00.890
§
WELL, IT LOOKS LIKE THE JUDGE IS

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.690
TAKING ONE LAST LOOK AND IS
GETTING READY TO CHOOSE THE

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.150
CHAMPION.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:10.730
I'VE GOT TWO LAMBS IN HERE THAT
DEFINITELY MEET WHAT I THINK I

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:17.880
WANT TO BE ABLE TO USE FOR
OVERALL AND RESERVE OVERALL, SO

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:31.519
I'M GOING TO DO THE SELECTION
RIGHT NOW.

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:32.519
YOUR CHAMPION IS GOING TO BE
YOUR CHAMPION WETHER OVER HERE.

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:33.519
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:34.519
§
YOUR RESERVE CHAMPION OVERALL

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:35.940
IS GOING TO BE THE RESERVE
CHAMPION WETHER.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:37.290
CONGRATULATIONS.

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:39.990
GOOD JOB.

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.790
OUTSTANDING JOB.
