00:00:02.787 --> 00:00:06.112
Dorothea: Drawing is the bones of thought.

00:00:06.112 --> 00:00:08.503
I always find I'm reading or seeing

00:00:08.503 --> 00:00:11.250
or doing something and the only way

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.921
I can think is with my hands and drawing.

00:00:19.489 --> 00:00:22.804
I went to Black Mountain College in 1950.

00:00:22.804 --> 00:00:26.807
Two weeks after I was at Black Mountain

00:00:26.807 --> 00:00:29.118
I must have said something

00:00:29.118 --> 00:00:30.956
because Max came up to me and said,

00:00:30.956 --> 00:00:33.491
"I want you to take my class."

00:00:33.491 --> 00:00:36.384
Max Dehn was a mathematician.

00:00:36.384 --> 00:00:38.554
While people came from all over the world

00:00:38.554 --> 00:00:40.683
just to study with him, he never had

00:00:40.683 --> 00:00:42.352
more than three students, but the students

00:00:42.352 --> 00:00:44.328
he had were really significant.

00:00:44.328 --> 00:00:48.597
When he asked me to take
his class, I was horrified.

00:00:48.597 --> 00:00:52.740
I said, "I've had no training;
I can't take your class."

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:55.406
He said, "You haven't been math poisoned"

00:00:55.406 --> 00:00:56.775
which is right.

00:00:56.775 --> 00:01:00.572
He said, "I will teach you
mathematics for artists."

00:01:00.572 --> 00:01:05.011
He showed me mathematics in nature.

00:01:05.011 --> 00:01:07.021
He wasn't teaching a mathematician,

00:01:07.021 --> 00:01:10.095
he was teaching an artist
how to think mathematically.

00:01:10.095 --> 00:01:13.761
It was so wonderful and so heady.

00:01:13.761 --> 00:01:16.948
I felt big! (laughs)

00:01:18.702 --> 00:01:21.226
I was studying transitive geometry

00:01:21.226 --> 00:01:23.898
and I wanted to find
a transitive material.

00:01:23.898 --> 00:01:27.522
I located the carbon paper,
and by folding and unfolding

00:01:27.522 --> 00:01:31.771
the sheets, I could
transpose the equations

00:01:31.771 --> 00:01:36.814
I'd been working into
a materialized artwork.

00:01:36.814 --> 00:01:39.995
I was very interested in the fact that

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:43.126
the whole room should represent the art.

00:01:43.126 --> 00:01:45.157
I painted the walls with the brightest

00:01:45.157 --> 00:01:47.335
white paint you could find.

00:01:47.335 --> 00:01:49.372
As people walked into the room,

00:01:49.372 --> 00:01:54.841
their footprints became
part of the drawing.

00:01:54.841 --> 00:01:56.291
That was my plan.

00:01:58.167 --> 00:01:59.360
I lived on Chamber Street.

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.849
I was working all kinds of jobs at once

00:02:01.849 --> 00:02:03.510
plus I had a child I was raising,

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:04.829
and I didn't have the money to buy

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:06.240
art supplies; they were expensive.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.310
So I went across the street
to the hardware store

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:13.085
and I bought crude oil,
gallons of crude oil.

00:02:13.085 --> 00:02:15.867
People look on the crude oil as

00:02:15.867 --> 00:02:18.045
a big insight into material.

00:02:18.045 --> 00:02:19.616
Believe me, it was not.

00:02:19.616 --> 00:02:22.101
It was accident. (laughs)

00:02:22.101 --> 00:02:24.908
But I also had done some tests

00:02:24.908 --> 00:02:26.372
and I knew what it would do

00:02:26.372 --> 00:02:29.274
and I knew that it had
incredible properties.

00:02:29.274 --> 00:02:33.574
Color-wise it fell right
into my Beaux-Arts training

00:02:33.574 --> 00:02:36.455
because this was a natural,
in the earth material

00:02:36.455 --> 00:02:40.063
and to me it has a lot of color.

00:02:42.155 --> 00:02:45.464
By this time I'd been looking
at a lot of Italian painting

00:02:45.464 --> 00:02:52.061
and realized that they were
all based on the golden mean.

00:02:52.061 --> 00:02:54.445
I was very familiar with what

00:02:54.445 --> 00:02:56.075
the golden mean looked like.

00:02:56.075 --> 00:02:59.116
Our bodies are all golden mean.

00:02:59.116 --> 00:03:00.032
This is all golden mean.

00:03:00.032 --> 00:03:04.042
Everything is, you begin
to realize. (laughs)

00:03:04.042 --> 00:03:06.160
It's a magic proportion.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.544
If you do anything using
it, you can't go wrong.

00:03:08.544 --> 00:03:10.295
It's bound to be a success!

00:03:10.295 --> 00:03:11.377
It's amazing!

00:03:12.115 --> 00:03:13.552
I wanted to work with curves

00:03:13.552 --> 00:03:15.871
because everything that
moves in the universe

00:03:15.871 --> 00:03:17.781
moves on an elliptical.

00:03:18.779 --> 00:03:21.178
I was able to work with the watercolor

00:03:21.178 --> 00:03:24.350
very, very thick, so it
has a real presence to it.

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:26.843
The canvas has been painted white,

00:03:26.843 --> 00:03:29.862
so that acts like the
white surface of paper,

00:03:29.862 --> 00:03:32.841
and it resonates through the colors.

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.705
When one is dealing
with art or mathematics,

00:03:39.705 --> 00:03:42.916
there's always an element of magic.

00:03:42.916 --> 00:03:45.245
If everything adds up and works out well,

00:03:45.245 --> 00:03:46.983
you're on the wrong trail.
