00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.370
You know, I have a secret, but this is a secret you wanna share. It's like when you know

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.660
something and no one else knows.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:51.590
Her secret is a dermal filler. A variety of quick and easy treatments that

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:56.710
can take years off the appearance of your face. Treatments so successful they've been

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.309
called the liquid facelift.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.500
You know, I know I'm gonna continue to get older, so this is a way to kind of lessen

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.250
some of the trauma of it.

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.229
It's a way to dramatically roll back the clock.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.970
Dermal fillers will fill in the wrinkles around your mouth, around your jaws; around your

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:21.290
eyes and any place you have on your face that
you have wrinkles. It's a very nice way

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.979
of filling in everything that has -- the nature has taken away.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:31.300
I was at a point in life where I needed to get a face lift or do something different.

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.119
It makes me feel really, really good. I have often told the doctor that he has single handedly,

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.060
without cutting my face, made me feel beautiful.

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:48.140
Facial fillers are injected just underneath the skin. Smoothing, tightening, plumping

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.649
and volumizing with virtually no downtime or pain. Epione's Dr. Simon Ourian, a Harvard

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:00.360
trained cosmetic dermatologist uses the newest
generation of dermal fillers, which, unlike

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.149
their predecessor collagen, normally do not elicit an inflammatory or immune response.

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:09.069
And most do not require allergy testing.

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:16.069
Radiesse, Juvederm, Restylane and Artefill all have unique qualities, and a trained consultant

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.630
at Epione can help you decide which filler is right for you. The choice will be based

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.880
on where you need the injections, the longevity
you desire and the beauty budget you have

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:27.150
chosen.

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.130
It's just little teeny -- the smallest little needle pricks to number your face and

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:36.680
just really doesn't hurt 'cause it's just very superficial. It was exactly what

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.420
I had expected and it was easy and it last a really long time.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.939
Although no one can say for sure, some studies
have shown that Radiesse injections can last

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:51.930
at least two to five years. Artefill, on the other hand, can be permanent. You can expect

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:56.879
the effects of Juvederm and Restylane to last
up to a year or longer.

00:02:56.879 --> 00:03:01.590
At Epione, the goal is to have every patient
leave looking 5 to 10 years younger.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.959
It's a very natural look. You just look like you did a few years ago [laughter].

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:13.870
The dermal filler procedure itself is quick, just a few minutes for a few precise injections.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.599
Immediately after a treatment, there may be redness, swelling, tenderness or itching at

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.799
the treated area, but the inconvenience is temporary and normally goes away in a day

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:24.170
or two.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.279
It was actually a lot easier than I thought it was gonna be. I had instant results that

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:34.829
-- as soon as I left. I mean I was a little swollen but by the next day it was very smooth

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:38.810
and in fact I had absolutely zero lines and it was filled in.

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:45.499
There was little minor swelling with it, but that went away and I would say within two

00:03:45.499 --> 00:03:51.140
to three days, it's like the creases that were there were just totally plumped out and

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.489
I looked years younger.

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.780
When you come to Epione for a Radiance treatment, you know you're getting Radiance from someone

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.019
who knows exactly what they're doing.

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:08.599
Dr. Ourian has done thousands of these dermal
filler injections. His years of experience

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:17.150
pay off for patients at Epione in looks and in self-esteem.

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.680
It makes me feel so good. It's subtle changes but it's just -- I always feel like I'm

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.740
doing something nice for myself and treating myself.

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.720
It just makes you feel more confidence. And out in the business world, if you're more

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.680
confident, then you achieve more.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:38.260
What Dr. Ourian's patients at Epione say they've achieved is their very own fountain

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.550
of youth.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.810
I don't have to go for surgery, and I don't have to be put under and I don't have to

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:50.810
be pulled, I definitely found the secret. I wake up in the morning and my eyes are smooth

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.870
and I have no puffs. And I can go out without make up.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:01.150
I just feel more confident and I'm less self-conscious and that's just one less

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:02.430
thing to worry about.

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:03.379
