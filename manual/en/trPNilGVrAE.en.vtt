00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:05.109
In the history of life on Earth, plants have
had a far more profound effect on our planet

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:10.750
than any other kingdom of life. Yet, in reconstructions
of Earth’s past, plants seem to be minor

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.850
players or, in some cases, mysteriously absent
altogether. With that in mind, this series

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.800
aims to explore one of nature’s greatest
untold stories.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.230
In this eight-part series, we’ll see how
the first photosynthetic cells emerged in

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.960
the primeval oceans, how plants shaped our
atmosphere, and caused some of the greatest

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.960
catastrophes of all time. We’ll see their
progression onto dry land, how they paved

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.050
the way for land animals, our own ancestors,
and how the oxygen they produced created giant

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.129
prehistoric monsters. And we’ll see how
the plant kingdom adapted to a changing world,

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.660
creating changes in shape, life cycle and
associations with animals and fungi. While

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.120
the latter are not plants, some examples are
so extraordinary that they are worth visiting.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:00.800
The algae, meanwhile, may appear to be closely
related to plants, but are almost as distantly

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.500
related to them as we are, and since they
do not change greatly since their first formation,

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:10.770
they will be left behind early on.
Along the way, we’ll see how plants left

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.930
us telltale clues in the fossil record, allowing
us to get a sense of how they lived and reproduced.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.890
The series is intended as general interest,
but for those interested to learn more, I’ll

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.000
be posting references and further reading
for each video on my blog. I would also recommend

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.650
the following books:
Palaeobotany and the Evolution of Plants,

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.570
a rather heavy textbook that aims at an academic
level.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.610
The Greening of Gondwana, a book centred around
plant evolution in modern-day Australia and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.990
Antarctica, filled with stunning photographs
of plant fossils

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.000
and The Emerald Planet, A complete tour through
evolutionary time, focusing on how plants

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.850
evolved and affected our climate.
And finally, a few caveats. Many of the details

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:57.750
of the events depicted in the series, such
as the cause of the extinction of the dinosaurs,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.450
are still disputed by the scientific community.
Because this series is aimed at a general

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.750
audience, I will only be presenting one series
of events, usually the majority view. Anyone

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.250
interested in exploring the controversy should
consult the scientific literature. In some

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:17.062
cases, small details have been fabricated
and educated guesses made to make for a more

00:02:17.062 --> 00:02:22.500
interesting narrative. Especially in the earlier
videos, images of living species are used

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.090
to illustrate ones that are now extinct, on
the basis of visual similarity.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.220
With all that in mind, I hope you enjoy the
series as much as I have in putting it together.
