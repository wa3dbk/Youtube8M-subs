Hi. I'm Mark Emiley on behalf of Expert Village.
In this segment we are going to be talking

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:11.710
about aging our beer and then finally, drinking
our beer. Now, you finally have all your beer

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:16.520
bottled and capped. Now comes the hardest
part; you have to wait. What you are going

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:25.960
to want to do is you're going to put it into
a dark area of your house at about room temperature

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:32.140
(60-70 degrees or so) and it's going to sit
there for about two to four weeks. And during

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.300
this time, the yeast that is still in solution
is going to eat up all that priming sugar

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.730
that we just put into it. And that's going
to release carbon dioxide and pressurize the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.629
bottle and give you carbonation. So, in two
weeks, you can try to have one bottle and

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:53.441
see if it's got enough carbonation, you're
good to go. If three weeks, you're probably

00:00:53.441 --> 00:00:58.430
going to get a little bit more and about four
weeks, usually most beers will be plenty carbonated

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:03.021
so that you can drink them by then. Alright,
so several weeks have passed and it is time

00:01:03.021 --> 00:01:09.290
to taste your beer. So, what you'll notice
is that there's a nice fine layer of yeast

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.580
slurry on the bottom. The good news is, is
this is full of Vitamin B and it is actually

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.640
very, very good for you. However, as you pour
your beer, you're going to try to avoid pouring

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.640
that. So, you're going to pour until you get
the last one ounce in there and then stop

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:30.030
pouring. What I like to do is swirl it around
and take a sip of it, because I like the vitamins.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:38.400
So, you are going to take your bottle, have
a nice clean glass ready. Open up your bottle

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:48.659
and pour on in. You're going to enjoy the
nice colors that you've created. And the great

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:57.542
carbonation the yeast will have provided.
And finally, you'll be able to savor the fruits

00:01:57.542 --> 00:02:08.920
of your labor. Before we leave I will leave
a tip of advise always clean everything that

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:15.700
you use immediately afterwards. If you wait
for a while you taking the chance that some

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:22.540
gunk forming a nice hard cake and it becomes
a lot harder later. Second clean okay take

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.180
the time to clean and sanitize everything
that is touching the beer this is the biggest

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:32.930
chance of making your beer not as not as good
as it could be so pay attention to that you

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.510
are in good shape. Finally if it does not
come out the first time try it again and try

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:44.340
the recipe and do some more research for even
continue trying home brewing in very good

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:51.720
prospective in the fundamentals. But over
all try these worlds and take and relax don't

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.130
worry.
