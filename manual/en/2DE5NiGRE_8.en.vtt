and cinema news is coming up!

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Joel Edgerton will have the lead role in the new movie by Kathryn Bigelow,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
still without a title but which talks about the SEAL Team Six and

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.000
the hunt for Osama Bin Laden.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000

The screenplay was written by Mark Boal.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The project was in creation already for a while,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000
but when the news about Bin Laden's death was announced last year,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
the movie was pushed in pre-production with a change in the finale.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
It will be out December 9th 2012.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Matt Damon will not be back for The Bourne Legacy,

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000
so Universal Pictures is stressing that the new lead will not be Jason Bourne,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
but a completely different character called Aaron Cross and

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.000
interpreted by Jeremy Renner.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Also casting Rachel Weisz, Edward Norton,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
The movie, that will be out August 3rd 2012,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
is written and directed by Tony Gilroy.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
That's all for today,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
