00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.670
Right, I'm going to make a red wine sauce
here.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:09.769
It's a very, very simple thing to do.

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:13.779
What I've got here is a beautiful Co-operative
Sirloin steak, it's a British steak with a

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:17.769
beautiful sort of marbling on there, a nice
little tiny bit of fat you know, that's what

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:18.769
you're after.

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:20.890
You've got the pan here, you see it smoking?

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.189
That's what you want, it needs to have some
intense heat but what we don't do is put the

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:25.460
oil in the pan okay?

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.970
It creates a lot of smoke and you don't want
that.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.070
So what we do is we oil our steak, a little
bit of seasoning as well.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.690
So what I do is I season the steak and then
I season the plates just so I can get some

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.300
seasoning underneath it.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.090
Now that is all the oil that you're going
to have.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.320
That then goes into our hot frying pan and
you can hear it seal there Ð that's what

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.320
you're after.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.050
It's very, very important not to press it.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.670
Just leave it, let it do its own thing but
what I am going to do is add some flavours

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.670
now to this.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.800
I'm just going to take a little bit of garlic
and I'm just going to roughly chop it and

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.242
that can go into our pan as well, it's just
going to give us a bit of depth of flavour

00:01:00.242 --> 00:01:01.242
to it all.

00:01:01.242 --> 00:01:07.260
And then a couple of shallots as well okay?

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.310
Eventually as the steak sort of cooks it will
sort of release a little bit of juice in there

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.240
so I'm just going to leave that cooking away.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.770
So this is a Fair Trade Co-operative red wine
and what you want is about 100mls or so just

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:26.780
glazing the pan but you notice I'm leaving
the steak in there okay and you get that lovely

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.479
sear and bubble and that's what you're after.

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:30.540
We want to cook the alcohol out of it.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.049
Now at this stage just go in with a little
bit of thyme; a couple of little sprigs of

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.360
thyme in there just give it a bit more flavour
to the whole dish.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.189
I can just tell from touching the steak, you
know there's the old saying where as if you

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.360
bring your thumb and your index finger together
and press this sort of soft bit of your hand

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.840
there, if you do that one that is rare okay?

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.789
If you go to your middle finger and feel it,
it toughens up a little bit Ð that is medium.

00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.740
If you go to the next finger along it is really
tough Ð that's well done, okay?

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.270
Just lift the steak out, I've got a warm plate
here and I'm just going to pop that on there

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.759
to rest.

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:11.630
Red wine sauce is so quick and easy to make
whilst the steak is resting.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:19.390
I've got some beef stock here just from a
concentrate stock cube and again what we're

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:22.330
going to do now is reduce it down.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:26.620
I've got some butter here, just a tiny little
bit Ð it's probably about 5 or 6 grams of

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.640
butter there.

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:28.640
It's chilled.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.640
It has to be chilled.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:32.060
You can't use soft butter for this otherwise
it will curdle the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.060
sauce.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.080
That little bit of butter goes in and what
you do is you keep it moving Ð very important

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.900
to keep that butter moving around the pan.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.460
And just take this wonderful sauce and just
pour it over our steak.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.780
Look at the richness in that!

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.920
And then lastly, just for a bit of colour
nice bit of watercress; that is absolutely

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.950
wonderful.
