00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.160
Stay with me

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:09.740
Having previously not commented on his sexuality,
Sam Smith revealed in an interview earlier

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:15.540
this year that his hugely successful debut
album, In the Lonely Hour, was about a man

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.150
who he loved, but who did not love him in
return.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.710
Stay with me

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.500
Ahead of a live performance at London's Somerset
house, 22-year-old Sam was asked about the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:27.869
guy in question.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.240
I told him before the album came out, and
it gave me a lot of closure actually. It made,

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:38.510
made the whole, it just put a book end at
the end of the record. It was amazing. I'm

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.630
so happy I did it.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:45.520
What I wrote the songs about don't affect
me anymore, and that's what I rely on. I literally

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.650
rely on, you know, when they're singing it
back to me, the songs almost come alive again.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:55.350
It makes me emotional. Every, every moment
when they're singing back I'm thinking, I

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.070
can't believe this is happening to me.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:10.980
Oh baby, oh baby, oh we both know the truth
If it were the real me and you,

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.440
This wouldn't be the right thing to do

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:21.240
And Sam has got a lot of love for his fans
and how they reacted to him opening up about

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.400
his sexuality.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.520
Do you know what I am? I'm proud of the world
and the people in the world for the way that

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.880
they've reacted because they've hardly reacted
which is exactly what we wanted.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:35.860
You know, if you go through my record collection,
they're all straight people. They're all straight

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:41.649
guys, straight women singing, and I can still
relate to their music if you know what I mean.

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:48.400
And I wanted to make an album that - I hate
the idea of just relating to one type of person,

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:52.810
you know. I wanted, my dream from a young
age was the world to sing my music, you know,

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:58.530
so I will forever make, make, that a, you
know, I'll make that promise to myself that

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.219
my music will, will hopefully everyone will
be able to relate to it. That's my aim.

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:09.079
When I go home
I tend to close the door

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.820
Well, with the record-breaking success of
the album on both sides of the Atlantic, it

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.930
looks like In the Lonely Hour did just that.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:23.860
I mean in my gut I was like, I feel like I've
listened to music, American music my whole

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.970
life, and the album's been influenced by so
many American artists that in my gut I was

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.860
hoping that they would cling on to the, to
the album but I honestly didn't think it would

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.040
be like this. When I go over there, it is
just insane.
