00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:04.109
Okay, what happened is we got an f 51 error code. This is a Maytag bravos

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.490
MCT

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:08.790
There's some videos on how to do this

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.040
But they don't explain all the way

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.899
how to get the tub out if you need to get the tub some people will be able to go into the edges here and

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:20.459
they'll be able to find the sock or what articles in between there, and just fish it out with

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.119
a clothes hanger or something like that, but it'll be down in in this area here

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.040
it gets down in those crawls over the crevices and that happens sometimes

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.279
so the part I'm going to show you we already have the

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.669
The part off we've got the two clips off and we've got it pulled up. We took the cap off of here

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.890
Just some little clips here. You just

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.570
Push those down lift  those up and that pops right off

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.680
We disconnected the hose

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.249
But the part I want to really talk about is

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:56.099
how to get the tub out so if you have to get the tub out

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:01.739
I'm going to show you how to get this tub out without having to spend $187 for some fancy tool

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.869
To do it so one of the things you have to do is you're going to have to take this cap off now

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:08.040
You don't have to screw this off

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.069
it just pops off so you just take a little something and that just pops right off of there, okay, you can see that just

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.830
[pops] off want to be careful, but you get a screwdriver in those little divots there and just pop that [right] off

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:22.949
next you're going to want to take this bolt out and

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:25.679
take a socket set and

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:29.459
You'll better get that bolt. It'll be a little cruddy

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:32.250
From use that's okay

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:34.060
Alright

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:39.750
So once thats off, you can just take this right off here

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.939
Just lift it off and get underneath it and that pops right off

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:52.409
There you'll be [able] to clean that off and so forth, [too]

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:59.008
If it's dirty set that aside, so [jays] appliance has his fancy tools about $187

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.259
that is really cool looking [tool] real heavy

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:08.729
[but] it's expensive so I want to show you that there's a there's a

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.199
cheaper way to do this, and you probably have everything you need in your garage to do it

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.709
So now that we got the cap off what we want to do is take this piece off. Rather than have you see me

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.659
unscrew all of these I've taken them all out just to save time so I've taken all those screws out and

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.359
Then this little piece here, we're going to remove that okay

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.869
Set that aside, and then we have this little piece here. I'm just going to pull that off

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:42.629
Okay, it's got a little washer you want to leave that there so just turn that upside down

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:44.859
like that

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:51.329
Okay, and so now what we want to do is you don't want to try to pull this up, okay?

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.950
It's extremely difficult you'll hurt your back trying to do it. So that's why Jays tool

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.979
Is very instrumental in what it does, but what we figured out is just it's really a physics problem

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.128
Okay, and it's a physics solution. So he's using

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:10.799
Leverage to pull the tub up by keeping the spindle down and I'll show you what I mean by that

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:17.609
So what we did is we simply did this we take this little jack this comes out of my daughter's little [protege]

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.359
You can get any one of these?

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.219
You probably have them in your car if you've got a small car if not go to a neighbor

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.229
They probably have it okay, and so what we did [is] we're just going to set that on [top] of there like that

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:31.439
okay, and

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.899
Then I have this I think this is about [oh]

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:38.099
22 inches

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.769
About 20 inches across okay?

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.948
So we cut that the saw just a 2x4 then what we're going to do is just kind of wedge that in there like [that]

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.869
Just underneath the lip so you want to make sure it's it's about 20 inches

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:55.919
You know the approximate width?

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:58.060
20 inches exactly is

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:03.269
really what you need just make sure you get that and then what I'm going to do is I'm going to crank this and

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.409
Now what I want you to see what's going to happen let me pull that off for a minute

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:11.039
Is we're going to pull?

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:13.599
this Tub

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:15.599
Bottom part, we're going to pull it up

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.139
Okay

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:20.519
So we're going to pull it up, but keep that spindle down

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:24.478
So we're really going to just going to put pressure here to push that down [and] pull this up

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:26.870
It's going to save your back a ton of trouble

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:33.920
[it's] going to save your purse about 187 bucks, and you won't need the Maytag man. Yo, you can leave him at home sleeping

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.420
Okay, so what I'm going to do is just crank on this I?

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.839
Want to do this slowly? I'm gonna make sure I'm

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.750
even here

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:47.930
And I'm just [gonna]

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.730
Crank that and I can already feel it moving [up]

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:02.030
oh yeah! coming up, so there you go

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.290
And I tell you what it's not taking much at all

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:10.490
To pull that up

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:15.170
Okay, now you want [to] take your time with this you don't want to break your plastic or anything like that?

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:19.190
So you want to make [sure] you're just slowly just kind of rotating that around

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:28.010
This is way easier. Okay? Did you hear it pop? There's just a little pop there [that] meant that meant I broke that seal

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:34.309
My tubs a little dirty on the bottom there, but

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.729
We'll get that cleaned up is just really pretty much his hand tighten this you can do it with one finger

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.809
Deal with a wrench, but it really doesn't take much at all

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:50.419
Yours may be different. Maybe lighter may be a little tougher to do okay

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.490
So I think I've got [it] all the way down [now]

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:58.220
So now what I want to do is use this as leverage what I'm going to do is just lift the tub right out

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.540
So it should come out may need to if you have two people to help you it may be easier

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:04.999
Im gonna try to do it here myself

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.600
There you go, so there I've got the tub out

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:17.639
what we did is I just took a quarter inch socket and

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:24.419
Took these off decide to go in and look at the filter. We didn't find any socks or anything down here

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:26.419
so that wasn't a problem, but

00:06:26.979 --> 00:06:33.059
Occasionally there would be loose articles you know change things like that, so we took this off. We just used a little

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:39.689
You know turkey baster got all the water out. You could use a towel and sop it up whichever

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.680
But from there, i was able to get this

00:06:44.560 --> 00:06:46.539
filter Cap off

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.539
get that off and

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.539
This is [what] we found in there, so

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.510
Hey, you know we saved one hundred and eighty seven dollars on that tool Jay was talking about and looking here

00:06:57.669 --> 00:07:01.319
We're about what 55, 56, 57, 58 cents rich

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.729
that we got up there an extra little collar clip and

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:12.449
So what we'll do is. We'll these things can get lodged down in here, so we went ahead and cleaned all that out of there

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.340
Let's get all that money out so we we actually made money on this deal

00:07:18.099 --> 00:07:20.609
gonna have to let Jay know that

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:26.609
So we'll just wind up cleaning this out. This was a mess [too]. We cleaned all that out as well and

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:33.119
And there you go, and you solved your problem, put it all back together, and we'll get it running
