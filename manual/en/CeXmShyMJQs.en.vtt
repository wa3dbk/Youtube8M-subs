00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:13.460
I'm Mike Hanley with cars com the
infiniti FX is one of the sportiest

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:18.859
driving crossovers around in for 2013
the base model gets a larger v6 engine

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:24.529
and a name change to fx37 VFX can carry
bulky cargo in a pinch but it's designed

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.489
for the driving enthusiasts in 10 years
after its original debut it still

00:00:28.489 --> 00:00:32.870
delivers if you're going to put together
list of production cars that look like

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.340
concept cars i think the FX would be on
a lot of those lists infinity has made

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.000
changes to the exterior over the years
including new front grille and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.629
headlights and also a new rear design
but the thing that's remained constant

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:49.550
is this model's hunkered down low slung
stance that really implies performance

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.649
the biggest thing that sets the FX apart
from its luxury competition is how it

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.329
drives the crossovers built on the same
platform as the nissan z sports car and

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:02.899
you can tell there's something different
here when you toss it into a corner the

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:07.400
responses are precise it feels really
sure footed and it really seems like

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.730
you're driving at all riding sports car
which is something none of the luxury

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.860
competition offers power has never been
a short coming in the FX range but with

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.280
the new 3.7 liter v6 the fx37 offers
more horsepower 325 horsepower and

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.390
slightly better gas mileage than its
predecessor the rear wheel drive models

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:30.500
are rated at 17 miles beyond the city 24
on the highway in this all-wheel drive

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:37.250
version is slightly less efficient it's
right at 16 22 MPG the FX has its share

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.330
of luxury touches like these optional
quilted leather seats look really nice

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:44.990
but they're also some downmarket
elements like some of the switches and

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.710
vents on the dashboard it's not the most
spacious from the driver's seat though

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.120
it's roomy enough it's really a part of
this roof line which is kind of wraps

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.930
around you enhance that sports car
feeling I was talking about one of the

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:00.470
issues though with the cabin is rear
visibility because it's very limited by

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.040
the small rear window and even though
the backup camera helps a little bit

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.680
it's no substitute for natural
visibility

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.780
despite the FX is coupe-like profile
there's surprisingly good room in the

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.620
back seat for adult passengers I'm about
six foot one and i have the front seat

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.010
position where i would drive and i still
have good leg room back here and

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.330
surprisingly good Headroom the backseat
also reclines a little bit for extra

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.790
comfort all FX's have a 60-40 split
folding back seat now the rear cargo

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.830
area of measures 24.8 cubic feet when
you pull the levers on the side walls

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:36.800
and flip the seats forward to get 62
cubic feet

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.650
one thing though is that the lift over
height is pretty tall so we have a

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:45.440
suitcase you have to lift kinda hide it
clear it in bringing together a sports

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:49.370
car like driving experience in some
crossover utility the FX is managed a

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.780
rare feat in its class but it's not like
a lot of its competitors are trying to

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.220
duplicate it as they mostly go for more
comfort oriented driving experience but

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.360
if this combination of two vehicle types
is what you're after the FX fits the

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.360
bill nicely

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.780
yeah

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.099
yeah
