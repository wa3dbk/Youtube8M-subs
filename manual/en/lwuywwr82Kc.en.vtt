00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.730
Hey this is Phil Coonrod on behalf of Expert
Village today we're going to talk about Madden

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:13.269
'08. Ok we're here in round 5, I just picked
Randy Moss I got a couple of solid defensive

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:21.199
players, I got a solid tackle. So now I'm
going to take a look I need to see and make

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:27.400
sure all the quarterbacks aren't leaving here.
Still got some pretty decent quarterbacks

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:35.200
still go, who I'm really targeting is a Cuttler
or Romo down here and I'm there going to hang

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:42.050
on for another round. I'm going to look and
see what they have for halfbacks. Frank Gore

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:51.120
really young guy, really talented. He's cheaper
than just about anybody else. But this Morris

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.170
Drew Jones character is another guy I like
cause I feel like he's going to hang on for

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:03.500
another round at least. Willie Parker another
really solid back and he's 97 speed, speed

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.140
kills, and he's really cheap. I'm going to
really be hoping that a couple of these guys

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.440
hang on for a couple more rounds. I'll probably
go get another, I'll probably need another

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:19.060
aw, offensive lineman. I think that's who
I'm going to go ahead and do, you see these

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:25.020
tackles are already getting dwindled down
big time. Here's another really cheap tackle,

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:31.000
only 24 years old one of the best available
I'm going to go ahead and get another tackle

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.240
I'd really like to sure up my ends. I don't
like getting quarterback pressure from the

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.640
outside at all so aw I'm going to go ahead
and pick this young guy here, this tackle.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.810
We're going to be really solid on our offensive
line now. Start worrying about getting either

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:55.740
a running back or some defensive, maybe a
linebacker or a defensive end would probably

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.829
be pretty good. So I'm going to go ahead and
get this guy Shane Olivia.
