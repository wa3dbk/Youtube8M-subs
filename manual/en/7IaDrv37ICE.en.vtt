00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.259
Hello once again drummers and percussionists. Welcome back to another 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.670
video on Ross Goes Drumming. 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.579
Last video, (which was far to long ago now - I haven't been able to make videos, just because of

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:17.839
renovations going on next door; drills going into walls *arrr*) ...  Any way! 

00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:19.860
Here's a new video.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.170
The last one was about

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.080
changing up our subdivision 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.100
while playing (so in the groove). 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.160
So if you'd like to see that video first, there'll be an annotation link on the

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.960
screen

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.510
to go and check out that video first. But now, we're going to do something similar

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.110
but using some triplet subdivisions. 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.219
So we're going to start off with the basic pattern. 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.870
On beat four (that's our second snare stroke)

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:47.480
We're going to break into a 16th note triplet which will then bring us back around 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.000
to loop back into beat 1 of the next bar. 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.800
It sounds more complicated than it is. 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.800
Here we go. 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.110
And so when you practice this make sure you use a metronome 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.899
I don't have one down here in this room. 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.870
so I'm just going off feeling

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.340
But when you do practice this, the metronome will help make sure the subdivision

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.950
switch over time 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:37.870
is nice and...

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:42.730
Right on the beat. And one other way to practice this (just in its most basic form) is

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.090
just going from the straight notes into the triplets  

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:54.090
and again, just with the metronome. 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.420
Now let's work on those triplets at the end and start making them sound a little 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.030
bit more interesting

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.200
So one way to do this is to spread out the different strokes

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.329
between snare and bass. 

00:02:12.329 --> 00:02:17.339
I'll show you how that sounds. 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:24.339
Now let's see how that goes with the rest of our groove! 

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:54.519
I think I'll make a couple of changes. The last stroke of our group of six triplets, I'm going to change to a snare.

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.270
And then at the start of the groove 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.270
the second 16th note is also going to be a snare. 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.520
So the change that I made to the triplet at the end of the bar - if you didn't catch it

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:38.520
sounds like this when I slow it down. 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:53.829
So now, let's just have a bit of a play with that, putting in that subdivision break at 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:04:00.829
different places in the groove. 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.669
So if you want to build up into groove like that, when you practice the first exercise make sure

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.830
your really using the metronome getting those transitions between the straight 16ths 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.889
and the triplet 16ths 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:35.689
nice and smooth. 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:39.579
And that's where we'll leave it for this video. I do hope you enjoyed it and 

00:04:39.579 --> 00:04:41.259
