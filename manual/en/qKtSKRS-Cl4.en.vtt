Hi, I’m Matt from eSpares.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.420
Cooking with a dirty oven doesn’t just stink
out your kitchen, but it can also sour the

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.750
food that your cooking as well. I’m going
to show you how to give your oven a really

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:20.900
deep clean, the sort of thing you should probably
about once a year.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:27.410
You’re going to need some rubber gloves,
some bin liners, lots of kitchen towel and

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.440
some ordinary kitchen spray, a bowl and a
scourer. you might well need a hob scraper

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:40.250
and a screwdriver, and then a choice of oven
cleaners. So for the non-caustic method, you

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:44.420
mix yourself a thick paste of soda crystals
with water, smear it all over the inside of

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.310
the oven, leave it overnight, and then brace
yourself for some serious scrubbing. Or you

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.969
could use a non-toxic cleaner, like this Ovenrens
cleaner from Electrolux. However, I’m going

00:00:54.969 --> 00:01:00.679
to go for the full-on chemical assault from
Mr. Muscle. That means I need to make sure

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.370
that the kitchen is well ventilated, so let’s
open the windows.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.490
If yours is an electric oven like this one,
do make sure that you’re switched off at

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.670
the mains. Now, there are three main areas
that I’m going to be concentrating on: the

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.710
door, the shelves and shelf supports, and
the main cavity of the oven. If yours is a

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:22.953
self-cleaning oven, you’ll only really need
to do the door, and the shelf and shelf supports.

00:01:22.953 --> 00:01:27.569
You’ll need to refer to your instruction
manual on how the cleaning part works.

00:01:27.569 --> 00:01:34.640
So let’s start by removing the door itself.
On this one, I just need to flick this catch

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:45.539
on either hinge and then the door should just
lift straight out. So then I’ll just remove

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:51.989
the shelves and shelf supports. So I’m going
to put the shelves and shelves’ supports

00:01:51.989 --> 00:02:09.479
in a bin liner, and then take my oven spray
and give it all a really good spray. So that’s

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:13.560
really nicely covered in the spray. I’m
just going to loosely tie that bag up and

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.890
then go and put that outside and let it do
its work.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.630
So, now let’s spray the main cavity of the
oven. Do avoid spraying into the fan or on

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:39.170
the elements or around the pilot light if
it’s a gas oven. So once the oven cleaner

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.349
is getting to work, let’s get started on
the door. Oven doors can be made up to four

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:49.030
pieces of glass thick, like this one, and
as well as all the gunge and grime you can

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.950
see on the inner glass here, the grease can
accumulate between the layers of glass, so

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:57.940
we’re going to take it apart completely
so we can give it a really good clean. This

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:05.730
one just has a couple of screws, one on either
side. Now on this door, the hinges just slide

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:13.450
out of the bottom there. But all oven doors
are a little bit different in how they’re

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:20.180
put together, but it’s not too difficult
to work out how to do that. And then on this

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:28.530
one I can just slide these end pieces off
and then just separate out the pieces of glass.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:32.129
So once you’ve separated out the parts of
your door, just give it as good spray with

00:03:32.129 --> 00:03:44.760
an ordinary kitchen spray and then get in
there and give it a good clean. For this innermost

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:49.209
piece of glass with the heaviest stain on,
I’m going to give it a good spray with my

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.400
ordinary kitchen spray and then use this glass
scraper and that will soon fetch that off.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:04.569
Ok, so that’s the last piece of glass in
place and I just need to put the door back

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:15.489
together. So let’s get the shelves and supports
out of the back one at a time, and just get

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:22.120
them in some warm soapy water with a scourer.
Yeah, and that’s coming off nice and easy.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:30.590
Ok, lets crack on and clean the cavity of
the oven. You’ll see I’ve got my scourer

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.570
and my bowl of water ready, and I’ve also
got a bin-bag at hand because we’re going

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:41.750
to start by getting a load of paper towel
and giving it a good wipe, get all that thick

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:48.090
gunge out of there. So that the thickest of
it out and so I’ll go with a scouter now

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:57.040
and really have a go at those burnt out stains.
So let’s give it a last dry around with

00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:07.110
the kitchen towel. So I’m going to give
the fascia and the knobs a clean. If any of

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:13.160
the knobs are particularly messy then you
can just replace those, they’ll be available

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:26.010
on the eSpares website. And once I’ve done
this, I can put everything back together again.

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:37.720
There we go, that’s one very clean oven.
Now all that’s left for me to do is put

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.970
the power back on, put it on a high heat for
about twenty minutes and that’ll burn off

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:46.330
any access cleaner which is still left in
there. A little tip for you, why not get yourself

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:53.230
a inexpensive extendable oven tray, put some
tin foil on it and that’ll catch most of

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.860
the food that drops down there and make cleaning
easier next time.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.660
That, along with spare parts and accessories
for all makes and model of oven, are available

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:02.660
on the eSpares website. Thanks for watching.
