00:00:00.674 --> 00:00:04.384
(cheery guitar music)

00:00:18.329 --> 00:00:20.569
- Hi everyone, it's me Anne.

00:00:20.569 --> 00:00:23.286
And today I have a very
very special guest.

00:00:23.286 --> 00:00:25.539
Mindy, from Cute Girls Hairstyles.

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:26.629
- Hey everyone

00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:29.206
- I can't believe she made it.
- I'm so excited.

00:00:29.206 --> 00:00:31.168
- I'm super excited that you're here,

00:00:31.168 --> 00:00:34.421
can you tell my viewers
about your channel?

00:00:34.421 --> 00:00:36.021
- It's kind of self explanatory,

00:00:36.021 --> 00:00:37.669
on my channel, Cute Girls Hairstyles

00:00:37.669 --> 00:00:39.364

00:00:39.364 --> 00:00:41.107
tutorials for women and children

00:00:41.107 --> 00:00:42.552
of all ages.

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:43.868
Check us out we do

00:00:43.868 --> 00:00:46.447
braids, flips, twists, ponytails,

00:00:46.447 --> 00:00:47.915
you name it, it's there.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:48.849
- Yes, and you're going to do

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:49.848
my hair right after this

00:00:49.848 --> 00:00:50.869
tutorial right?
- Yes.

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:52.309
- Over on her channel.

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:53.469
- Definitely don't forget to check out

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.908
Mindy's channel after this tutorial.

00:00:55.908 --> 00:00:57.463
- So today, Mindy's going to help me

00:00:57.463 --> 00:00:59.772
make a few hair jewelry pieces

00:00:59.772 --> 00:01:01.231
and hair bows.

00:01:01.231 --> 00:01:03.867
So we're going to recycle some old

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:05.214
ties right here.

00:01:05.214 --> 00:01:06.234
And also we're going to recycle

00:01:06.234 --> 00:01:08.393
some necklaces and turn it into

00:01:08.393 --> 00:01:10.310
hair jewelry.
- [Mindy] Hair jewelry.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:11.656
It's very popular right now.
- [Anne] Yes.

00:01:11.656 --> 00:01:12.985
So let's skip right into this.

00:01:13.153 --> 00:01:14.930
Okay guys, so Mindy and I are

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.055
going to go over the materials.

00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:19.655
So basically what I have over here,

00:01:19.655 --> 00:01:21.513
I have some old chains, and all

00:01:21.513 --> 00:01:23.812
you will need are some bobbypins

00:01:23.812 --> 00:01:27.080
and I will be using some jump rings.

00:01:27.306 --> 00:01:29.187
You call them O-Rings.
- [Mindy] I call them O-Rings.

00:01:29.187 --> 00:01:31.415
- [Anne] You can find
these at Hobby Lobby.

00:01:31.415 --> 00:01:33.795
- [Mindy] Michaels, JoAnns, where I live.

00:01:33.795 --> 00:01:37.812
- [Anne] This is not
necessary unless you have

00:01:37.812 --> 00:01:40.227
small chains and you
can't fit it through this

00:01:40.227 --> 00:01:41.354
right here.

00:01:41.354 --> 00:01:42.468
Then I would recommend getting

00:01:42.468 --> 00:01:44.752
some jump rings.
- [Mindy] As a connector.

00:01:45.532 --> 00:01:47.075
- [Anne] So let's just
start with something

00:01:47.075 --> 00:01:48.220
very basic.

00:01:48.375 --> 00:01:50.116
I'm going to use this chain right here.

00:01:50.116 --> 00:01:51.533
The first thing you want to do is kind

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:53.774
of determine your length and then

00:01:53.774 --> 00:01:55.132
just cut it.

00:01:55.132 --> 00:01:56.374
If you want, this is

00:01:56.374 --> 00:01:57.953
your pair of scissors.
- [Mindy] Awesome.

00:01:57.953 --> 00:02:00.832
- [Anne] Just go ahead and cut one chain.

00:02:01.842 --> 00:02:03.491
I left my pliers at home so we're going

00:02:03.491 --> 00:02:05.115
to have to deal with this.
- [Mindy] Improvise with

00:02:05.115 --> 00:02:07.468
our scissors here.

00:02:07.635 --> 00:02:09.028
- [Anne] I'm not sure exactly how

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:10.676
this is going to cut.
- [Mindy] Got it.

00:02:10.676 --> 00:02:11.896
- [Anne] I did a good job.

00:02:11.896 --> 00:02:14.525
Okay, yay.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.359
So here's two jump rings for you.

00:02:17.537 --> 00:02:18.351
- [Mindy] Lovely.

00:02:18.351 --> 00:02:19.709
- [Anne] Two for me.

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.834
Okay, so, I'm going to have to use

00:02:21.834 --> 00:02:22.751
my fingers.

00:02:22.751 --> 00:02:23.737
We're going to have to use our

00:02:23.737 --> 00:02:26.211
fingers, and open the jump rings now.

00:02:26.211 --> 00:02:27.337
And what you're going to do is put

00:02:27.337 --> 00:02:30.030
it at the end of each chain.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.726
Oh, you're fast.

00:02:30.726 --> 00:02:32.468
Once you have that in the chain

00:02:32.468 --> 00:02:34.791
then you're going to loop it into

00:02:34.791 --> 00:02:37.170
your bobby pin.
- [Mindy] Bobby pin.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.307
- [Anne] And then close it.

00:02:38.307 --> 00:02:39.096
It's that easy.

00:02:39.096 --> 00:02:39.955
It's all you have to do.

00:02:39.955 --> 00:02:41.035
- [Mindy] Oh you see, I closed mine

00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:43.194
mine, and then I just
put my bobby pin through.

00:02:43.194 --> 00:02:44.634
- [Anne] Oh yeah, you could do that too.

00:02:44.634 --> 00:02:46.354
- [Mindy] So either way
will work just fine.

00:02:46.354 --> 00:02:48.071
- [Anne] Exactly.

00:02:48.071 --> 00:02:49.702
- [Mindy] Voila, love it.

00:02:49.905 --> 00:02:51.391
So easy.

00:02:51.391 --> 00:02:53.887
- [Anne] So we're going to make three.

00:02:53.887 --> 00:02:55.594
It's fun to mix it, like mix different

00:02:55.594 --> 00:02:58.121
textures and different designs together.

00:02:58.861 --> 00:03:00.030
You can really have fun with it.

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.271
If you want to go for a more casual

00:03:01.271 --> 00:03:02.385
look then you could just stick

00:03:02.385 --> 00:03:04.429
to the chains, and if you want

00:03:04.429 --> 00:03:06.007
something more fancy then find

00:03:06.007 --> 00:03:08.155
some chains like this.
- [Mindy] Pearls or some

00:03:08.155 --> 00:03:11.046
little jewels, something
with a little shimmer.

00:03:11.046 --> 00:03:12.091
- [Anne] That would be cute.

00:03:12.091 --> 00:03:14.645
Okay, so let's jump into the bows.

00:03:14.645 --> 00:03:16.015
Okay guys, so this is one of my

00:03:16.015 --> 00:03:18.284
favorite tutorials to do.

00:03:18.394 --> 00:03:19.752
It's just so simple because you

00:03:19.752 --> 00:03:21.204
could recycle this into something

00:03:21.204 --> 00:03:23.050
new, re-purpose this.
- [Mindy] I love this.

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:24.768
I have never even seen this

00:03:24.768 --> 00:03:25.848
out of ties.

00:03:25.848 --> 00:03:27.485
- [Anne] Do you have any ties

00:03:27.485 --> 00:03:29.309
from Shawn you can recycle?
- [Mindy] Are you kidding?

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:30.863
- [Mindy] Yes, tons.

00:03:30.863 --> 00:03:32.233
- [Anne] Okay so, basically what I

00:03:32.233 --> 00:03:33.951
do is I usually use the end of

00:03:33.951 --> 00:03:36.394
the tie, and just kind of determine

00:03:36.394 --> 00:03:39.681
how wide I want the bow to look.

00:03:40.012 --> 00:03:43.088
Basically something
about four inches wide.

00:03:43.088 --> 00:03:44.470
That's something I want to go for.

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:45.212
- [Mindy] Okay.

00:03:45.432 --> 00:03:46.746
- [Anne] I'm just going to go

00:03:46.746 --> 00:03:48.451
ahead and clip this.

00:03:50.241 --> 00:03:51.639
So as you can see, this end is

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:53.722
a lot wider than this end.

00:03:53.722 --> 00:03:54.929
So what I would usually do is

00:03:54.929 --> 00:03:56.710
I would just fold it in a little bit,

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:59.131
take some hot glue,

00:03:59.131 --> 00:04:00.304
my viewers always make fun of

00:04:00.304 --> 00:04:03.242
me for using a glue gun for my projects.

00:04:03.531 --> 00:04:05.006
They're like, "Anne, what would she

00:04:05.006 --> 00:04:06.423
"do without the glue gun?"

00:04:06.423 --> 00:04:08.106
So funny, so cute.

00:04:08.106 --> 00:04:10.149
Okay, so once that glue's dry,

00:04:10.149 --> 00:04:11.600
what I'm going to do now is just

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.277
fold this in just like that.

00:04:15.281 --> 00:04:17.632
Add a little glue right there,

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:20.168
keep it in place.

00:04:20.168 --> 00:04:21.585
Really really easy.

00:04:21.585 --> 00:04:23.500
And then with the other part

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.507
of the tie, all you need

00:04:26.507 --> 00:04:28.121
is basically enough to wrap

00:04:28.121 --> 00:04:29.996
around this.
- [Mindy] Wrap around it.

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:31.720
No more tie.

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:32.810
- [Anne] No more tie.

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:34.502
You just need to cut a second piece.

00:04:34.611 --> 00:04:36.341
So next part you just need to

00:04:36.341 --> 00:04:38.379
kind of pinch it in like that.

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:41.297
- [Mindy] Wrap it around.
- [Anne] Wrap this part around.

00:04:44.464 --> 00:04:46.344
And guess what, glue it again.

00:04:46.344 --> 00:04:48.242
Glue it together.

00:04:49.107 --> 00:04:49.966
- [Mindy] I'm amazed you don't burn

00:04:49.966 --> 00:04:51.325
yourself, I'm terrible at that.

00:04:51.325 --> 00:04:52.730
- [Anne] Oh, I do.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.389
I'm just like used to it.

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:56.195
I can tolerate it now.

00:04:56.363 --> 00:04:57.292
So just hold it together as

00:04:57.292 --> 00:04:59.272
tight as you can until it dries.

00:04:59.451 --> 00:05:00.984
Do it right, yes.

00:05:00.984 --> 00:05:02.192
It's a little bulky but you can

00:05:02.192 --> 00:05:04.548
always cut off extra materials

00:05:04.548 --> 00:05:06.354
if you don't like that.

00:05:06.382 --> 00:05:08.147
And then you can just use any

00:05:08.147 --> 00:05:09.674
hair clip like this.

00:05:12.744 --> 00:05:14.236
Glue it onto the hairclip.

00:05:14.369 --> 00:05:16.424
- [Mindy] JoAnn's, Michaels, Hobby Lobby,

00:05:16.424 --> 00:05:18.694
just sell the actual silver clip part.

00:05:18.723 --> 00:05:20.406
You could use that too.

00:05:20.406 --> 00:05:21.986
- [Anne] Tips from the hair genie.

00:05:21.986 --> 00:05:23.924
All I did was add glue to the hair clip

00:05:23.924 --> 00:05:25.085
and I glue it on.

00:05:25.085 --> 00:05:25.990
And that's basically it.

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.966
It's pretty simple,
- [Mindy] I love it.

00:05:26.966 --> 00:05:28.045
- Straightforward.

00:05:28.045 --> 00:05:29.068
Okay so, we are all done making

00:05:29.068 --> 00:05:30.529
these fun hair accessories, thank you

00:05:30.529 --> 00:05:31.842
so much Mindy for helping me,

00:05:31.842 --> 00:05:32.980
and I cannot wait for you to play

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.222
with these on my hair.

00:05:34.222 --> 00:05:35.428
- They're going to look adorable.

00:05:35.428 --> 00:05:37.623
- I seriously need some new styling.

00:05:37.623 --> 00:05:39.110

- Yeah.
