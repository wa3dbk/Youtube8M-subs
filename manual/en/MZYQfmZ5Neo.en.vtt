00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.860
At CCI Solutions, we consider the Audio-Technica 2000 Series WIreless

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.350
Microphone to be the entry level for a good installed wireless microphone system.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.660
There are a lot of inexpensive wireless microphone systems

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.980
that you can just stack on top of a box, or take to a gig. But if you want to install them in a rack,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.170
and want it all to work together, use remote-mounted antennas,

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.890
for more reliable performance, then the Audio-Technica 2000 is definitely the way to go.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.110
The Audio-Technica 2000 has a metal case. It does not have a plastic case. So the

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.090
metal case gives you better protection. It's a better product. And, it's rackmountable,

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:58.870
so you can take two of these and put them together. Another critical factor is

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.280
it has removable antennas on a nice BNC connector. It's not a fixed-mount or screw-in

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.060
type connection. It's a BNC. So if you're going to set it up, you know, you start out just

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.700
set it on a counter or that, it works great. But if you're going to rack it up

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.100
you can't just leave these antennas in the rack. You have to remote mount them.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.370
So here's how you do that. You take these antennas off, and you connect it

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.490
to an antenna distribution amplifier, no controls on the front.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.640
You go ahead and connect up to four receivers. You can see there's 2 connections for each

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.820
receiver here: 1, 2, 3, 4. And then 2 connections for your remote-mount antennas.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.450
So the remote-mount antennas simply use an antenna cable, and go ahead and put your remote-

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.810
mount antennas further away out and up. So they have clear line-of-site to the transmitter.

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.600
The antennas that'd you'd use for that are over here. We'll walk over this way.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.890
You can see we have a paddle-mount antenna, for a high gain.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.240
So, if I'm at the back of an auditorium, I can aim these up to the platform.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.810
We have an amplified antenna. And one that we don't see here is a

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.300
half-wave antenna. Which is much less expensive than these but gives you higher gain.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.530
Don't...Let's go back here. You don't want to use these small 1/4 wave-length

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.330
antennas. They don't have a ground plane. The half-wave antenna's a taller antenna.

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.710
And so go ahead and talk to our CCI experts about that. They'll get you set up with

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:30.130
the right thing. So the Audio-Technica 2000 Series can be purchased with a dynamic microphone

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:36.460
for handheld use, or a fairly simple bodypack system. A simple bodypack system

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:40.670
...really their aren't any controls other than a nice "On/Off" switch here

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.800
and of course frequency adjustment. The nice thing about that is if you're trying

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.150
to fumble around and there's a power control and a mute control

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.760
you can hit the wrong one. Here you can't. It's just gonna be "on" and "off."

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.820
So, very straightforward, simple bodypack system with the 2000.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:00.250
If you want to take a look at a, at a more frequency selection, you want to run more

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.070
wireless microphones, and you want to have a better selection of microphones,

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.820
then you go to the 3000 Series right here.

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.710
You can see that we have the front panel control that gives you your frequency.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:14.220
We have a wider selection of frequencies to choose from

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.100
still the remote-mouted, remote-mountable antennas,

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:23.560
fully rackable, metal case. And this particular case in the 3000

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.330
you've got a little bit better head on the dynamic microphone.

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.350
You now have a condenser microphone that you can choose from, so

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:34.550
you, a lot of people prefer a condenser microphone, uh particularly on

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.650
some voices. And the bodypack has a cover over the frequency controls.

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.240
And the "Power" and "Mute" switch is on the side.

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.380
In either case, Audio-Technica produces an outstanding value

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:53.520
in either the 2000 entry-level wireless for good, clean installation and high

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:57.680
performance, or the 3000 Series. Again, call our experts

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.730
and they will set you up with the right cables, the antenna distribution amplifier

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.510
and the right antenna so you will get optimal performance.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.160
You have to have remote-mount antennas for these if you're going to put them

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:13.450
in a rack so give us a call - Audio-Technica 2000 and 3000 Series Wireless Microphones.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:22.000
