Hi, this is Josh with JHE’s Log Furniture Place.  You can find us online at www.logfurnitureplace.com.

00:00:11.939 --> 00:00:15.790
Today we will be looking at our Contoured Comfort Yard Swing.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.319
This is the 5 foot version.

00:00:18.319 --> 00:00:20.850
We also do make a 4 foot version.

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.810
The 5 ft

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.410
seats three comfortably. It is made out of Northern White Cedar.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:30.560
All the hardware is provided

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.980
and all the hardware is zinc dichromate

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:34.420
so it will not rust.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.990
As we can see here some of the features of this swing,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.030
it has the

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.190
contoured seat slates.

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:47.500
This is one right here.  What that does is it supports the body a whole lot better than

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.000
the flat boarded swings.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.780
Also on the end we sand

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.050
it right down nice and smooth so it doesn’t end up pinching the leg.  It is very comfortable.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.960
I could sit on this swing for hours.
The A frame is provided

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.160
in the yard swing version.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.900
It is made out of Northern White Cedar.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.950
We use all screws

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.050
and bolts for this.  We don’t use any staples to hold the seat slats in or the back slats.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.770
You can just grab a hold of this

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.860
and pull on it all day and you wouldn’t be able to pull one of these things off.  It is very strong.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.250
We use a Mortise and Tenon design

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:39.740
to assemble it.  It is very strong and sturdy.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.950
There are some people who make other versions of this swing

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.800
or imports from China.

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.799
The best way to tell

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.970
if you're getting one of ours or someone else's
is to try and pick it up.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.280
This unit is very heavy

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.150
It is very hard to move,

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.679
which is a good and a bad thing.  If you ever want to move it,

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:01.930
you will need to get two people.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.050
But for wind and all that it’s very strong and sturdy

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.509
and it will put up with a whole lot of abuse.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.999
