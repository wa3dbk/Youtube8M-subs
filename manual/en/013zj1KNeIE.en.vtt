&gt;&gt; Gloria Steinem:
Well, actually,

00:00:01.133 --> 00:00:02.233
when I got the call
from The White House,

00:00:02.233 --> 00:00:04.000
I said "are you sure?"

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.266
What makes this medal
mean so much

00:00:08.266 --> 00:00:11.066
is that it's for waging
peace you might say.

00:00:11.066 --> 00:00:15.033
It is because the division --

00:00:15.033 --> 00:00:18.667
the so called gender division, 
the idea that there's

00:00:18.667 --> 00:00:21.800
a subject and an object,
masculine, feminine,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.934
dominant, passive,

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:29.600
is the route or the normalize
of their violence

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:34.734
that has to do with race
and class with ethnicity,

00:00:34.734 --> 00:00:39.867
with sexuality that
has to do with men's ideas

00:00:39.867 --> 00:00:41.567
that they have to
defeat each other

00:00:41.567 --> 00:00:43.400
in order to be truly masculine,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.467
you know, it is the root
of the false idea

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:52.667
that we are ranked as human beings 
rather than linked.

00:00:52.667 --> 00:00:57.600
We are truly linked so I feel
blessed and enthusiastic

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.333
and lucky to be part of a
movement that is fundamental.

00:01:04.333 --> 00:01:07.433
Humans are communal animals,
we need to have

00:01:07.433 --> 00:01:11.867
that kind of shared community 
which doesn't have to do

00:01:11.867 --> 00:01:14.266
with how different we are,

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.367
we need to be different,
we learn from difference

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:18.934
not from sameness but
from shared values.

00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:22.567
And I have that, I mean that's
what you have in a movement,

00:01:22.567 --> 00:01:27.233
it's huge and so it
enables you to keep going

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:29.533
and also to be angry when
you need to be angry

00:01:29.533 --> 00:01:33.233
and to do unacceptable
things when you --

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:35.033
because you know that
there's somebody over there

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:37.033
who's going to understand
why you did it.

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:40.000
We are linked as human
beings, not ranked.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.900
That we are also linked to
the environment

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.900
to try altogether to have
a paradigm in life

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.133
that's a circle, not a pyramid,

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:49.300
not a hierarchy,

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:54.000
to have companions
in that worldview,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.900
and then at the
same time, you know,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.567
that we understand that
we're shared humanity,

00:02:00.567 --> 00:02:03.367
to also understand
that we're each unique.

00:02:03.367 --> 00:02:08.200
We are each the combination
of who knows millennia

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.266
of environment and heredity
that got convened

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:16.166
in this particular way
that exists in each baby.

00:02:16.166 --> 00:02:19.767
You know, really there's a
person in every baby, right?

00:02:19.767 --> 00:02:24.633
So the -- we can tap into
that strength if we think,

00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:26.600
"Okay, what do I love to do?

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.867
What does it -- why do I forget
what time it is when I'm doing?

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:32.934
What would I do even
if I didn't get paid?

00:02:32.934 --> 00:02:36.066
Do I want everybody
to get paid?"

00:02:36.066 --> 00:02:38.934
and to try to let that guide us.

00:02:38.934 --> 00:02:41.767
I think it's a balance
between our shared humanity

00:02:41.767 --> 00:02:43.767
and our uniqueness.
