00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.149
Hello.

00:00:01.149 --> 00:00:02.700
Welcome back to the Taster Tenner series.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.870
I'm Tess, and today I'm going to be making
a delicious Mango Carrot Noodle Salad, which

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:15.509
is all going to be made for under 10 pounds.

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:16.580
[Music]

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.029
Okay, so my water's come to the boil, and
I've got my soba noodles, which are going

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.360
to go straight in.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:30.589
So I've just got my soba noodles into the
pan, they're boiling away, and they're going

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:34.870
to need about 5 to 7 minutes, so while they're
boiling, I'm going to get on with everything

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.930
else.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.470
I've got a fresh mango.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.140
It's unripe, which is really important, because
if it's too ripe for this recipe the juice

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:46.580
goes everywhere and it doesn't work, so it
needs to be an unripe mango, the harder the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:47.580
better.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:55.850
I'm going to cut the bottom off so it's easy
to stand up, and I'm going to run my knife

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.190
over the edges to get the skin off.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:07.290
Be really careful of your fingers while you
do this.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.250
Where I've cut the flat side on the bottom
of the mango, I'm going to stand that up and

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:21.280
I'm going to run my knife down until I find
the stone, and then I'll push it out a little

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:25.310
bit and just run my knife around it.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.380
I've got quite a nice, flat edge, which is
great for cutting.

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:36.950
So I've got my mango here, and I'm going to
finally just chop it up into a bowl here.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:41.120
I'm going to check on my noodles quickly because
they only need 5 to 7 minutes.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:49.170
The best way is to taste them, none of this
throwing to the ceiling to see if they stick.

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.920
Yes, so they're done.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.310
So I'm going to drain them, and I'm going
to pour my noodles which have been drained,

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.060
into the bowl.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:06.880
I'm going to add about a tablespoon of sesame
seed oil into the noodles now.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:09.499
This will prevent them from sticking whilst
they cool.

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:12.180
I'm going to mix them through like so.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.030
For the full list of ingredients, check out
the description box.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.570
I'm going to leave them out for a second to
cool for a little bit, because you don't want

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:21.709
to put hot things straight in the fridge.

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.749
So I'll set them aside and then I'll pop them
in the fridge to cool for about 15 minutes.

00:02:27.749 --> 00:02:32.730
While my noodles are cooling I'm going to
carry on with the mango, just literally slicing

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:44.230
it up into centimeter slices, arranging them
and cutting back the other way.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.189
That's that.

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:50.700
Right, so now I'm going to get on with my
carrots.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:59.709
I'm simply going to cut them in half this
way, and then slice them finely.

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:06.969
You want to be sure to slice them nice and
finely and do that with the rest of the carrots

00:03:06.969 --> 00:03:08.029
and put them into the bowl with the mango.

00:03:08.029 --> 00:03:15.260
I'm going to slice up the rest of the vegetables,
and finely slice up the chili, there we go.

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.840
So with the chili finely chopped and I've
chopped up my spring onions.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:23.120
I'm just going to chop up the coriander, and
then I'm going to dress the noodle salad.

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:29.219
I'm going to go in with about 3 to 4 tablespoons
of fish sauce,

00:03:29.219 --> 00:03:38.159
and I'm going to go with 2 teaspoonfuls of
sugar, and I'm going to give that a little

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.159
mix up.

00:03:39.159 --> 00:03:44.040
I'm going to go with a little squeezing of
lime, like so.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.290
Okay so now I'm going to go in with some of
the carrots and mango.

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:54.389
I'm going to reserve a little bit at the end
to garnish on the top.

00:03:54.389 --> 00:04:01.359
I'm going to mix that in.

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:09.420
I'm going to go in with about two-thirds of
my spring onions and half of the coriander

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.340
and mix that through as well.

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:23.610
I'm going to serve up some of the noodles.

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:27.130

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:34.919
I'm going to add just a bit more coriander,
the chili, and some fresh spring onion on

00:04:34.919 --> 00:04:39.030
the top, it's nicely colorful and vibrant.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:43.740
And finally, the chopped, roasted peanuts.

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.900
I just ran my knife through them very quickly
just to chop them up a little bit.

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:59.931
I'm going to add a drizzle of lime juice and
a little drizzle of sesame seed oil, and there

00:04:59.931 --> 00:05:01.230
we have it!

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.840
It's my Soba Noodle Salad with Carrots, Mango
and Roasted Peanuts.

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.740
See you again for one of my Tasty Tenner episodes.
