00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.870
Hi this is Peter from JoomlArt. And today,
we are going to talk about the T3 version

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:11.030
3 Framework.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.939
This is one video in a multi serie part of
videos showing you how to use the T3 Framework

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:22.300
effectively and easily. So there are 5 main
parts included in this tutorial:

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.180
1. Global Settings
2. Theme Settings

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:29.119
3. Customize Layout
4. Navigation Settings

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.230
5. And Menu Assignment

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.140
Once you install successfully, it's time to
explore the framework. First, go to: Extensions

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:45.140
then Template Manager. In this tutorial, we
are going to use JA Argo as our template.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:51.720
JA Argo - the responsive Joomla template for
both 2.5 and Joomla 3.0.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.879
So this is the information page.

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:00.879
We can check to see if our version of the
template is up to date, and also for the version

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:02.850
of the framework is up to date.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:11.200
OK, let's go to Global Settings. So we go
in the General and go to enable the Development Mode.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.030
This should be enabled when you are developing
your site. When enabled, your site can load

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:22.399
LESS files. Now let's save.

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:28.320
In the front-end, we can check by right-clicking
and going to Inspect element and we can see

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.020
the matched CSS Rules here and all the LESS
path.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.259
The LESS files of the template is located
in "template/template_name/less".

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.210
When you finish your Development, you should
turn off the Development mode. In this case,

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.539
your site runs on CSS files. The CSS files
are compiled from LESS files and they are

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:59.270
located in Template/JA_Argo/CSS in this example.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:06.270
OK, now go Compile LESS to CSS with a simple
click of the button.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.039
We will get a blue bar saying, "Successfully compile LESS to CSS".

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:18.039
Next, we go work on ThemeMagic. First, we
enable ThemeMagic by clicking Yes under General.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.120
Now, open the Theme Magic working panel.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.010
There is a sidebar menu to the left. You can
play with the theme here: you can change the

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:34.209
colors, work on the grids, the layout. There
are so many things you can do with ThemeMagic.

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.560
We can add unlimited groups and parameters.
We can work on Navigation such as background

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.560
color, text color, link color. So let's change
the background color here to gray. And let's

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:52.459
change the link color hover. How about green?
Now let's preview it.

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.860
Go up to the top and click Preview. As you
can see, the colors have now changed without

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:02.250
having to go back into the back-end of the
site.

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.959
Now we can either Save or we can Save As to
make a new theme with this. So let's call

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:17.640
this Dark-Cloned. Okay. Now it's saving. As
you can see "Dark-Cloned Theme changes successfully saved".

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.319
As T3 is a responsive framework, all templates
developed within the framework will be fully

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:33.900
responsive. Now, to enable this feature, click
Enable responsive. Also the T3 Assets folder

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.390
is to store the cache to help improve site
performance. Feel free to name whatever you

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:44.959
would like as you can see here, it's named
T3-assets.

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:52.800
Here is the T3 logo in the front-page. Feel
free to enable or disable easily.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.560
Click Show T3 Logo yes or no.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:04.239
JA Argo has a special feature where it's
using Ajax to load articles in the Article

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:08.939
detail page and it is an extended setting
in JA Argo only.

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:12.640
Okay. Next, we move on to the Theme Settings.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:19.190
So, select the style first before we make
any changes. So in this, we will select JA

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:25.160
Argo green color. Go back to theme. Now, let's
select the one we made in ThemeMagic - the

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:32.400
"Dark-cloned". Now T3 supports 2 logotypes:
image or text. We can change the site name

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.530
to whatever we want or just leave "Argo" here,
and then the slogan as well. You can change

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:45.530
the logo image, just browse to the logo you
want and replace it with the current one.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:55.000
Okay? Don't forget to save. Okay. Now let's
go to the front-page.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:03.460
Great. We can see our settings have taken effect. Now, the style
uses the dark-cloned theme with the logo changed

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.000
as we made in back-end.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.000
Okay. Next, go to Layout. The Layout settings
allow you to change the structure of the layout

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:19.540
and configure responsive layout. First, select
your layout. All your layouts will be listed;

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:24.060
please select the one you wish to modify.
Also, note that the layout you are configuring

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:31.060
is only applied for the current style. There
are 2 parts in Layout Customization: Module

00:05:32.190 --> 00:05:36.400
Positions and Responsive Layout.

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:41.060
For Module Positions, you are allowed to change
the number of positions in each spotlight

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:47.310
block. You can change to any position that
you want. If you don't want to publish any

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.620
position in the front page, just assign it
to none.

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.770
As you can see, there are 5 responsive layouts
that you can configure. Select the one you

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:02.470
wish to configure. In each layout, you can
enable or disable any module position. In

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:09.130
this example, we're gonna select mobile layout,
and we're gonna disable positions in the spotlight

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:16.130
block. Ok. Scroll down.

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:24.800
Click on the position
name to enable it. We can also drag to resize

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:33.000
the module position. So go do that with 5
and 6. Pull 6 up to the 5.

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:41.900
Next, we will configure the Mega Menu. So,
T3 supports Mega Menu feature. It is very

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
easy for you to configure. We can see that,
we have a great Mega Menu in the front-page.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.270
We also have a separate video tutorial for
configuring Mega Menu.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:59.860
The last part of this tutorial is the Menu
Assignment. First, select style. Let's select

00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:09.900
JA Argo - Dark Color. Go back to the Assignment
tab. Scroll down. Select the menu that uses

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.950
to select the style. In this case - JA Argo
dark color. And don't forget to save your

00:07:17.030 --> 00:07:24.030
settings. In the front page, we go to K2 menu.
We'll see the menu uses JA Argo Dark color

00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:27.430
style that gives it a different look.

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:33.750
So, this's is the end of our tutorial today.
