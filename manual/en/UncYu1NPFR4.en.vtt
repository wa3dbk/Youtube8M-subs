00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:07.940
I bought my first .22 when 12 years old, picking
up the mail-order treasure and riding it home

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:09.780
on my bicycle.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.650
For years after that, squirrel hunting was
a favorite pastime in the hills around Mound

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:15.650
City.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.880
It’s been a long time since then, but I
still enjoy this small game hunting opportunity.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.000
And if you’re looking for a challenging
way to stretch hunting season, this is it

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.020
in the Kansas woods.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.320
Be warned: wild squirrels are extremely wary,
nothing like their city cousins that bask

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.000
around feeders.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.290
If you treat this hunt lightly, you’re likely
to enjoy a long walk with few shooting opportunities.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.790
But if you’re patient and stealthy, this
basic hunting could renew the good times of

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:47.790
youth.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.440
It’s also a great way to teach young hunters.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.980
Squirrel season is open statewide until February
29, so there’s plenty of time to get out

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.120
there.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.010
Here are some tips to get you back in the
game for this underutilized Kansas hunting.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.930
First, look for sign.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.670
Lots of leafy nests in trees are good indicators,
and old timber with numerous tree holes provide

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.330
winter squirrel dens.

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.240
Nut trees like hickory and walnut are good
food sources, and cuttings on the ground beneath

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.070
trees can show favorite feeding places.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.630
Winter squirrels also like to eat developing
buds.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:37.070
Water is important, and timbered small creeks
or seep streams offer perfect habitat.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:43.979
Camouflage clothing helps hide a hunter from
sharp eyes, and slow, quiet movement is essential.

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.090
Dry leaves are the nemesis of a moving squirrel
hunter, since walking noise alerts nearby

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.760
squirrels to danger.

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:54.760
Sneaking in damp conditions helps.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.740
Otherwise, slip along deer trails or down
dry creek beds to keep noise at a minimum.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:09.009
Often, simply sitting in good habitat to wait
for squirrels is the most effective way.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:13.939
Set up around feeding habitat and let your
eyes do the work.

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:18.249
Squirrels are easy to spot in the bare winter
woods, and a hunter is too.

00:02:18.249 --> 00:02:23.150
That’s why a stationary hunter has the advantage.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:28.680
Especially with squirrels, Solunar tables
may help pick the best hunting times.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.739
Wild game and fish usually feed on predictable
daily schedules that are correlated with sun

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:37.019
and moon phases during each month.

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:42.129
Check these on the Internet, or they are programmed
into some watches.

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:46.270
Try to hunt the major peak on the day you
are hunting, when squirrels are most apt to

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:49.469
be active.

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.370
Squirrel calls can be useful at times.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:03:00.810
Luring squirrels out of hiding can be accomplished
with a bellows type squirrel call.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:07.810
Squirrel distress whistles are good for summer
hunting, but they don’t work so well in

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:10.340
winter.

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.450
Shotguns can be used, but most squirrel hunters
prefer scoped .22s and long rifle ammunition.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.909
Moving squirrels are hard to hit, so wait
for them to stop.

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:27.370
Shoot off of a dead rest whenever possible
to avoid missing or wounding game.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.339
Good squirrel shots are usually taken at 25
yards or less.

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:38.510
Always be certain of your target and what
lies beyond it for safety.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:43.349
Kansas squirrel hunting is usually close by,
provides a challenging hunt, and can lead

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.159
to tasty eating.

00:03:46.159 --> 00:03:51.720
Plenty of good hunting exists on public lands,
and you’ll seldom have competition.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:56.260
As always, get permission before hunting on
private lands.

00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:03.099
Give squirrel hunting a try in this season
without bugs, sweat, ticks, and chiggers.

00:04:03.099 --> 00:04:05.069
The daily limit is five.

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:08.939
