Hi I'm Reyno Benjamin with expertvillage.com.
We talked a little about hockey sticks and

00:00:05.229 --> 00:00:13.540
pucks and the ball we would use. We are starting
off with the traditional wood stick. On the

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:21.310
lefty shooter, either you’re a righty or
lefty, the curve is basically when you prefer

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.689
some guys like a lot of curve. Some guys like
a little bit of curve. This is a traditional

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:35.460
wood stick. It is what they been using forever,
since hockey started. The other stick is a

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.690
lot of the good players in the NHL use is
an aluminum shaft stick. Basically this is

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.149
called the shaft it is aluminum, there is
a wood blade that you insert into the aluminum

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:56.289
shaft. Gives you a better snap shot. It basically
is like a sling shot. You take a slap shot

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:04.559
the aluminum bends a little bit. Gives you
a more whipping shot feeling. The last one

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.780
is basically a graphite stick. There is no
shaft, it is all made into one and it gives

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:23.710
you a lot more sling shot. Take a wrist shot
or a slap shot it really bends. You can snap

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.850
it a little further. Now in hockey, I'm going
to talk to you about different types of hockey.

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:35.320
This is ice hockey; they use a rubber puck,
very heavy. In roller hockey they use a puck

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:42.560
with little beads in it. It is a lot lighter
weight. It goes, they play on cement surfaces,

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.500
so it slides over better. In ball hockey or
deck hockey you use, it’s basically like

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:58.969
a Malik rubber ball. Then also in floor hockey
it is just a plastic puck. In some leagues

00:01:58.969 --> 00:02:03.900
that I played for in floor hockey put 25 beebes
in it and tape it up with black electrical

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:10.550
tape, which makes it heavier and slides a
lot better. This is for floor hockey, ice

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.099
hockey, roller hockey, and deck hockey.
