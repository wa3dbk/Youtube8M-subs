00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:11.510
Sometimes it's nice to leave the adrenaline
pumping, high speed, obstacle avoiding, death

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:15.700
defying games for a while and play something
with a slower pace.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.580
What's more relaxing than the ambient sounds
of running water?

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:23.700
And what if you had control over that water,
tilting your iPhone around to pour it into

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.790
the seeds of flowers and roots of trees to
rehydrate the land?

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:29.830
Well that's where Sploosh comes in.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:34.110
It seems sometimes cacti get a little too
greedy and suck up all the water, sending

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.300
flower seeds into hibernation.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.920
The solution is of course to poke each cactus
till they burst in a cry of anguish and then

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.769
direct that water to those that need it more.

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.629
It's been a while since we've played a game
with full tilt controls but it makes you wonder

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:49.489
why more games don't.

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.719
Rotating your iPhone will change the gravity
and send the water splashing down to the ground,

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.749
or running along curves as you guide it to
the tree at the end of each level.

00:00:57.749 --> 00:01:01.519
Sometimes you need to pool the water and then
flatten your iPhone, which will enact a sort

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.850
of zero gravity mode where the water turns
into blobules that you can guide into harder

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.670
to reach areas.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.550
Sploosh doesn't make use of the greatest water
physics, in fact a lot of the time instead

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.960
of water, it feels like you're controlling
a more viscous liquid, like a syrup, but this

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.890
doesn't detract from the enjoyment of the
gameplay.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.870
Stars are awarded at the end of each level
for accomplishing various tasks.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.330
There's a star for hydrating the majority
of the level for instance.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.370
Any surface the water touches will grow grass,
and each level has a different percentage

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.810
that needs to be reached for this star.

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.250
There's a star for waking up all the flowers
in a level, there's a star for completing

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.530
the level in a certain time, and another star
for beating that time.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.930
It's an interesting balance in that game takes
such a laid back approach that the stars aren't

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.890
that important, yet hydrating the level and
waking the plants is something that you want

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.490
to accomplish while playing anyway.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.830
With a colorful yet muted palette and affective
audio ambiance, Sploosh offers a physics puzzle

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.090
experience that's worth a play.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.340
Like all physics puzzlers, things can get
frustrating in the later levels, but you'll

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:06.670
find yourself returning to this world of exploding
cacti and water rotation when ever you need

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:15.920
to slow things down and have some fun.
