00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.620
I'm Zoe Smith, I've been weightlifting for
four years and in 2008 I won the Commonwealth

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.570
Youth Games and today we're at Europa Gym
where I train.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.250
I remember, when I was really little I did
swimming and stuff then I started my kind

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.350
of career as a Gymnast and now I'm into Weightlifting.
It was kind of an accident, I moved gym clubs

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.990
to Europa, I trained at a different one before.
I wasn't going to go far as a Gymnast and

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.460
by chance they just asked me if I I'd like
to have a go at Weightlifting because it was

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:41.270
kind of on the site, and it turns out I was
pretty good.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:47.620
My parents have helped me along the way by
just like paying for my membership in Gymnastics

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.420
and Weightlifting etc., buying my equipment,
dropping me to the Gym and back.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.650
My Mum, she makes sure she sees what I'm eating
and tells me off if I'm eating the wrong things,

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:10.560
which is quite annoying, but it works!
My coach, Andy, he's a real inspiration and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.009
he pushes me a lot. In 1994, I think, he won
the Commonwealth Games which is my eventual

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.560
aim as well. So yeah, he's a great inspiration
for me. In the competition we have the two

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.710
lifts which are the ‘snatch’ and the ‘clean
and jerk’, so obviously they're kind of

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:31.159
… all the exercises that he sets me on the
programme are related to that, things that

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.270
will basically help me ‘clean and jerk’
and ‘snatch’ more. So things like squats

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.349
to build up leg muscles and pulls to build
up shoulder and arm muscles – well not build

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:43.880
them up but just make them stronger, pretty
much.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.329
During the week I'm pretty busy and if any
of my friends say ‘come out with us after

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:55.889
school’ and stuff I'm like, ‘no I can't
I've got training’!

00:01:55.889 --> 00:02:01.559
Once you're kind of in the warm-up room you're
focused anyway. Your coach is there just putting

00:02:01.559 --> 00:02:04.090
weights on the bar and that's all you're thinking
about, you're just thinking about that first

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.670
lift when you're out on the platform, and
how you're going to execute it and what you

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:15.311
can do to make it better.
I love competing internationally actually,

00:02:15.311 --> 00:02:21.100
it's one of my favourite things about the
sport. It's just great because you get to

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.469
see so many places you wouldn't have just
seen anyway. Last year I went to Thailand,

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:33.360
I went to Sweden, I went to lots of places
and I just really enjoyed it. In a way it's

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.129
kind of worth the sacrifice you make by missing
out on days out and nights out with your friends

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.620
because you're thinking wow I'm getting to
travel to all these places and they're not

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.459
really – it's great.
There's not very many girls in Weightlifting,

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:55.620
there's more than you think, but still not
like lots. We kind of have, like, our own

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:00.820
little community even so it's quite good fun.
You'll get like the old school Weightlifters

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:06.540
who say things like, ‘women shouldn't be
lifting weights!’, and then there are the

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:12.409
new generation who would encourage it.
You don't really think of sports people, particularly

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:17.390
Weightlifters to be glamorous, you kind of
want to challenge the stereotype by looking

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:22.361
your best.
Being photographed by Bettina was actually

00:03:22.361 --> 00:03:28.100
quite good fun. I remember just standing in
front of the Thames on this bench with a stamp

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.180
on my head actually, that's for focussing,
but I just thought it was quite funny at the

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.060
time.
I like the location because it was in Greenwich

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.920
which is where I was born and it's where the
Games are going to be pretty much so I really

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.400
liked it; I thought it was a great idea having
it in Greenwich. I‘m actually going to go

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.750
and see it, and just stand in front of it
all day I think and be like, ‘that's me!’

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:58.560
It will be fun.
I went as part of a scheme by the British

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:04.900
Olympic Association, for up and coming athletes,
to kind of experience the Games without actually

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.590
having to compete in one, and yeah I just
thought that was amazing. We saw two categories

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:17.180
of Weightlifting which was the men's 56 kilo
category and the women's 48 kilo and it was

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:22.150
just so inspiring. The Chinese lifters won
because they're pretty much the strongest

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:28.009
in the world; I saw the support that was behind
them from their home crowd and it was just

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:33.240
phenomenal and I hope if I get to the 2012
Games my home crowd will be just as supportive

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.869
and kind of give me that little bit of extra
luck even.
