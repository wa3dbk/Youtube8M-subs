Hi my name is Danny and I river surf

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
My name's Megan, I've been river surfing for about three years

00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:14.000
Hi, I'm Neil from the Alberta River Surfing Association

00:00:14.609 --> 00:00:15.500
I'm talking about river surfing

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:19.500
I'm landlocked but I love surfing but I want to surf everyday

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.490
so to change that we want to build a wave that can be replicated around the world 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.000
so anyone who is by a river can surf

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.000
what we are talking about is the perfect wave all the time

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
when you're river surfing you can actually surf, forever, non-stop, it's amazing!

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.930
It's awesome!  It's so much fun.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I started river surfing a few years back, 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.750
mostly because I was stuck in Alberta and away from the ocean. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.360
But it's funny because I don't think I would call myself a surfer anymore, I'm just a river surfer.  

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
I haven't been to the ocean in years now.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.880
River surfing is amazing for so many different reasons.

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.000
I think it's just a really neat sport to get into because it's so simple.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.690
When I'm up on the board, looking up at the woods, looking up at the mountains in front of me, 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.220
looking at the water rushing past me, there's nothing else in my world.

00:01:07.221 --> 00:01:09.000
It's just me and the board and the wave.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:14.000
One of the great things about river surfing is there is no sharks.  

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.000
I mean there may be the odd bear or ducks or things like that you need to look out for but you're never worried about your life.  

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:21.560
At least from underneath.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.020
With skateboarding it's because they can build a stationary ramp and practice it everyday 

00:01:26.021 --> 00:01:31.700
and dial in those manoeuvres that their able to do such amazing things.  Imagine those possibilities with surfing.

00:01:31.701 --> 00:01:35.000
And I think the biggest thing I've gained from river surfing is 

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:39.000
I've met an awesome community and a really great group of friends.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.000
If you look at skateboarding and how it spawed out of surfing as a whole.  

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:45.000
I mean it was this idea of surfing a concrete wave.  

00:01:45.001 --> 00:01:47.000
We are dream about surfing a standing wave. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.940
 There's a number of companies already doing it with million dollar wave parks and these surfing machines and standing waves and those are great.  

00:01:53.941 --> 00:01:58.490
It's fantastic that those are out there. But why does it have to be so complicated?

00:01:58.491 --> 00:02:02.050
Why can't it just be a standing wave that naturally occurs and we just tweak to make it that much better?  

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Something that is FREE for everybody that wants to surf, that wants to get out there.  

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:18.190
Something that takes surfing right from the ocean, from the coast, from these remote breaks to this awesome spot that can occur anywhere!  In any town!  In any city around the world!  

00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:24.420
All you need is a river, you need some flowing water, and you need to make this feature.  And that's what we are doing here.

00:02:24.421 --> 00:02:30.000
We want to design a world class river surfing wave that is going to be free for anyone.  All they need is those few things.  

00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:35.360
That flowing water, and the money, and the will to make it happen.  That's what we want to create.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:43.609
So there's a group of people who have been working on this project for a really long time and now they need your help.

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.310
What we need you to do is join the movement.  Share the information, spread the word.  

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:53.259
Tell your friends, tell your family, tell surfers, tell anybody who's going to care.

00:02:53.259 --> 00:03:00.000
There is this want and passion for it.  But we need to provide the facilities to make this all happen, to make it come together.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.009
We have the conditions to build an international wave building facility.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.000
We can research waves.  We can tell you how to build them. 

00:03:06.001 --> 00:03:08.839
We can try out your designs.  We can make it easy and we can make it better.

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:12.189
The river we are building it in is dam operated and it turns off at night.  

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:14.000
So we can go in and do what ever we want.

00:03:12.001 --> 00:03:19.030
And it's perfect, it works every single day of the year.  It's always there and there's always people on it.  

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.000
Utilizing it, having fun and enjoying it.  It's fantastic.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.500
Our plan is to make it open source.  That means anyone can use these plans.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.711
So your small contribution, 5 bucks, 10 bucks here and there.  

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.000
That's going to get you the plans to build a river surfing wave in your back yard.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Help us with this project.  

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
It's going to benefit your community, it's going to benefit you, it's going to benefit your kids.

00:03:40.919 --> 00:03:43.000
You're going to see these wave cropping up in cities around the world.  

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.800
If you've got the drive they can crop up in a city near you; in your neck of the woods.
