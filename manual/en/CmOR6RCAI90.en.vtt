00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.760
Here's something you rarely hear friends talking
about: retirement.

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:07.730
It's a long, long time away, right?

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.350
Well, yes it is, but if you start planning
now, you will give your future self a great

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:19.790
gift: not just a retirement nest egg, but
also the ability to have options—to travel,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:23.830
to start your own business, even to retire
early.

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:29.090
Starting young and making wise investment
choices is the formula for a secure and successful

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.160
future.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.630
To make it easier for you to grow your retirement
nest egg, the federal government enables you

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:38.950
to put your retirement investments into certain
accounts that have tax advantages.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.430
Here are three common types:

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.930
Number one: individual retirement accounts
(IRAs).

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.050
You can put away up to $10,000 a year depending
on your situation.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.810
The money you put into an IRA often can be
deducted from your taxable income, so you

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.140
pay less in taxes each year.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.820
That’s huge.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:06.380
Your IRA money is not taxed until it is withdrawn,
a big advantage because you'll have more money

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.630
that will grow by compounding year after year.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:14.350
You can withdraw your money without penalty
after you reach age 59 1/2.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.350
If you take out money before then and do not
meet certain conditions, you'll face large

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.700
penalties.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.799
Number two is a Roth IRA.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:27.219
You won't get a tax deduction on the money
you contribute to it each year.

00:01:27.219 --> 00:01:32.869
However, one advantage to a Roth IRA is that
after age 59 1/2, you can take out the money

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:37.649
you put in plus the interest earned on the
account without paying taxes on any of the

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:38.789
money.

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.130
Number three is 401(k) and 403(b) plans.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:48.579
401(k) plans typically are offered by private
employers, while 403(b) plans usually are

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:51.570
available to employees of nonprofit organizations.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.569
Usually, you tell the company or nonprofit
how much to take out of your paycheck to put

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:58.810
into your plan.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.009
The maximum amount is set by the federal government.

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.380
These plans have several advantages.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.410
First, you don't pay taxes on the money you
put into the plan.

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.120
You pay taxes on the money only after you
take it out of the plan, usually after you

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.120
retire.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:19.340
Second, the money you put into the plan usually
can be invested in a wide range of investments,

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:22.340
from risky to reasonably safe.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.560
You've heard the expression, "don't put all
of your eggs in one basket.”

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.530
Well, that's especially true when it comes
to creating your investment portfolio.

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:34.740
Spread your money around in low, medium, and
higher-risk investments.

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.910
That way, if one of them performs poorly,
you have solid backups in other areas.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.940
Here are some common investment methods:

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:46.720
Mutual funds pool your money with the money
of many other people.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:52.460
Instead of buying just a few assets, a professional
fund manager purchases many stocks, bonds,

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:54.720
or other investment vehicles.

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.260
This diversifies your investment.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:02.740
Treasury securities include federal government
bills, notes, and bonds.

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.660
Interest payments are guaranteed, and the
principal is safe as long as you hold the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:09.770
security to maturity.

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.970
Stocks give you ownership in part of a company.

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:16.300
In general, if the company does well, the
value of the stock rises and you may receive

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.270
some of the profit in the form of a dividend.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:25.130
Of course, if the company doesn't do well,
the value of the stock goes down.

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.910
Bonds are issued by companies and the government.

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.690
The bond is a legal promise to pay you interest
for the use of your money and to repay you

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:35.380
the original amount you paid for the bond.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.750
Real estate investments include residential
rental property, land, a real estate investment

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.280
trust, or commercial real estate.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:48.320
Educating yourself on investments and creating
a solid, diversified investment strategy is

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.340
a great way to make sure that your future
is full of options.
