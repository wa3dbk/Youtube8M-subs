00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:26.119
Well, weíre really stuck in it now.

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.481
Of course, when you cover Nintendo platforms
for a living, you get used to it.

00:00:30.481 --> 00:00:37.010
It comes to every console, this thick and
suffocating nothingness that so abruptly surroundsóand

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.519
for some definesóan otherwise excellent system.

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:43.050
The GameCube suffered it in 2005.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.559
It hit the Nintendo 64 years earlier, and
again this year, another console has succumbed

00:00:48.559 --> 00:01:02.789
to the great and terrible Nintendo Drought.

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.960
As you might have noticed from the Wii games
weíve been reviewing this year, it can make

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.710
business unbearably slow.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.520
But every once in a while, something breaks
through.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:13.969
Something you didnít expect.

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:19.350
Something that offers a refreshing little
burst of rain to a parched gaming landscape.

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.490
Something like this.

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:26.119
Its significance may be a bit inflated due
to the circumstances, but even in the Wiiís

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.690
glory days, this wouldíve been a noteworthy
game.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.130
In 2011, itís one of the consoleís very
best releases.

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:47.119
Itís escapeVektor: Chapter 1.

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.960
The surprise of escapeVektor is multifaceted.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.509
First, you canít buy this one in stores.

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.700
escapeVektor is a WiiWare exclusive, which
prompted some here at the underwater base

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:04.310
to ask, ìSo they still make WiiWare games?î

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.610
But whatís more surprising than its format
are its components.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.700
Even in an age when retro has become a new
trend, Iíve never seen a game that does quite

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.440
what this one does.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.500
escapeVektor isnít just notable because itís
a good Wii game in 2011óand a WiiWare game,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.110
no lessóbut also because itís a good game,
period.

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:30.330
Arcade fiends have probably deduced this by
now, but escapeVektor is a unique combination

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.140
of classic retro concepts.

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.560
It merges the space-claiming gameplay of a
game like Qix with the frantic pursuits characteristic

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.380
of Pac-Man, resulting in a new experience
that pays homage to not only its two primary

00:02:44.380 --> 00:03:02.460
components, but classic gaming in general.

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.510
escapeVektor tells the tale of Vektor, a hero
who is trying to escape.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:13.290
Trapped inside a strange computer, Vektor
is forced to navigate complex mazes of gadgets

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:18.320
and circuitry, desperately trying to escape
this surreal digital realm.

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:23.800
Like fellow WiiWare standouts the BIT.TRIP
games, escapeVektor presents a simple focus

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.880
on old-school gameplay and wraps it up with
gorgeous minimalist presentation.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.100
The simplicity of the graphics creates the
perfect vibe for escapeVektor, and thereís

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:37.750
even a sense of foreboding as you try to escape
the your artificial incarcerator.

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.600
Of course, to do so, youíll have to do a
lot of running.

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:45.940
Vektor travels on lines, and you have to guide
him through these mazes while highlighting

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:46.940
every line.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:51.670
You can fight back by blowing up completed
squares, but the primary goal is to reach

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:59.420
the exit that appears once youíve successfully
filled in the maze.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:06.780
Like the arcade classics itís based on, escapeVektor
is easy to play but very hard to master...and

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.370
almost impossible to put down.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.900
The design is elegant and smart, giving you
multiple exits to find, high scores to beat

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:19.370
and even badges to earn...as if the core gameplay
wasnít enough to get you hooked.

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:23.350
escapeVektor isnít the first WiiWare game
the team at Nnooo has done.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.070
They also developed the WiiWare launch title
Pop, which had loads of style...but not quite

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.180
the same amount of substance.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.650
With this, theyíve evened the levels.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.770
escapeVektor is a standout not only for WiiWare,
but for the Wii in general.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.160
And in a drought season
for Nintendo, it gives us the perfect chance

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:54.100
to run in the digital rain.
