00:00:00.613 --> 00:00:03.205
Hi! In this video, I will show you

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.304
how to create super easy and quick gradient nails express 

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.330
without using any sponge!

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.389
All you need is a color and a clear nail polish. 

00:00:15.733 --> 00:00:19.434
I’ll start with my favorite technique, the simplest

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.618
You may use any color you wish

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.144
and you'll need a transparent nail polish that dries quickly

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.706
First I apply a base coat

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.690
I apply some polish like for a French manicure

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:36.981
I apply some clear nail polish at the end the French

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.245
And before the nail polish dries, right after

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.144
I fade the nail polish 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.645
using the top coat brush to the cuticle. 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.277
It might takes a little time to do this part

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.674
because some nail polishes do not fade very well 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.133
It might be because of the texture. 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.128
I let it dry a little bit

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.938
then I add some more colors because this one is not bright enough

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:01.088
Depending on the nail polishes that you use, 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:02.864
you will have to apply 3 coats 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.890
As you know, I love very much glitter flakes!

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.968
While the nail polish is still sticky

00:01:09.962 --> 00:01:12.133
I apply some glitters flakes with my finger. 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.746
And finally I apply the top coat and it's done! 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.045
There is no need for a clean up after like with a sponge 

00:01:17.637 --> 00:01:21.162
Now, I’ll show you the same technique with a Pastel Nail polish 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.757
You can use any type of nail polish.

00:01:22.752 --> 00:01:25.162
I apply my nail polish, right after I apply the top coat

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.040
I fade it with the top coat. 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.634
The more top coat you add, the more faded it will be! 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.040
You must also keep mind to wipe the brush before putting it in the bottle

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.042
so as not to dirty your top coat. 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.970
I add some more nail polish and I fade it. 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.869
If the brush is dirty, clean it, then continue with the gradient. 

00:01:45.488 --> 00:01:47.994
Then I wait a few minutes to let it dry. 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.221
You can use this technique will all type of nail polishes. 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.938
Even with metallic or glitter ones. 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:54.608
Repeat the same steps. 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.562
Apply the nail polish, then the top coat and fade it. 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.592
This simple gradient on the edge of the nail

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.120
is one that I really love to do! 

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:06.986
Japanese girls love this type of gradient a lot!

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.106
Usually they do it with gel or semi permanent nail polishes

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.346
And now with my finger, 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:14.410
I add some glitter and pigments 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.709
just before the nail polish dries completely

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.562
Here the is no need to use a fan brush, do it with you finger

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.416
The glitter flakes will not only beautify your nails,

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.069
it will also help to hide the imperfections of this type of gradient.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.360
Since it is not a very neat gradient, 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.610
The glitter flakes will mask the imperfections. 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.181
No one will notice that it has been done in a hurry. 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.160
And now, here's another technique. 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.016
This one, you can use it only 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.365
when you are sure that the second varnish you'll use

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.728
is very opaque or will appear very well on the first varished 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.650
And when the first vanish is dry

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.354
I apply the second varnish on it. 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.573
You may use this technique for example when 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:56.016
you have chipped nail edge

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.640
and if you don't have time to do your manicure. 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.069
Apply a nail polish on it, fade it and it will disappear!

00:03:02.645 --> 00:03:06.160
Here is another example with this time, a glitter nail polish. 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.597
Will the nail polish be beautiful or not?

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:12.746
This will depend entirely on the color you have chosen to use. 

00:03:17.797 --> 00:03:19.882
Here's another method. 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:21.594
I don't like this one.  

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.224
For this method, you'll need two colors. 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.146
Apply the first color half of the nail

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:29.536
fade it and then apply the second color. 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.392
For this one, I won't use the previous technique I've shown you

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.957
Because I knew that my yellow nail polish 

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:39.173
won't be opaque enough to cover the pink color. 

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.376
I would have turned to orange. 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.405
So I was obliged to do it half and half and to fade it. 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.682
According to me, this method is better 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.445
when you do it with a sponge. 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.589
I would advise you to use this method 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:55.690
with a sponge if you use two colors.

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:58.725
Unless if you decide to superimpose the colors

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.328
like I've done with glitter nail polish. 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.898
I don't really like this method and the result. 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:08.085
But you see that when you will add the rhinestones and decorations

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.752
it will look beautiful, as you can see here. 

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.392
So if you do not have a sponge, you can use this method!

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.994
I hope that this video will be useful to you

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.277
and you have learned new things from it. 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.757
May be it will help you make your nails quickly when you don't have time. 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.368
See you next week for a new video! Bye!
