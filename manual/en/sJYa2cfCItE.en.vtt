Transform photos into paintings using the powerful cloning and photo-painting tools of 
Corel Painter® 2015.

00:00:18.266 --> 00:00:25.599
Clone images by hand or let the Auto-Painting palette paint a photo for you using your 
choice of brush and media.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:40.066
Corel Painter lets you clone an image to create a work of art. In other words, you can 
use cloning techniques to give your digital photographs a second life.

00:00:40.533 --> 00:00:49.833
Using a photo together with the Cloning brushes, Clone Source or using the Auto-
Painting features to turn an image into a stunning piece of painted art,

00:00:50.266 --> 00:00:55.499
is one of the most-common and unique, Corel Painter workflows for Photographers.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:06.666
The Photo art arrangement displays palettes commonly used by photo artists and 
provides the optimal setup for cloning photos, textures, and paintings.

00:01:07.466 --> 00:01:18.066
If you wish to convert an image into a painting by manually cloning the image, then 
the Clone Source panel will allow you select the source image that you want to clone.

00:01:22.833 --> 00:01:33.633
Corel Painter then duplicates this source image, preserving the original, and embeds 
the image as a clone source in the clone document. 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:41.966
The clone document appears in a new document window, and the clone source is 
displayed in the Clone Source panel.

00:01:44.633 --> 00:01:54.766
We can also use the Auto-Clone icon in the Clone Source panel to create a clone that 
incorporates tracing paper laid over the top of the embedded image.

00:01:54.966 --> 00:02:05.599
Tracing paper displays a faded-out version of the source image beneath the clone 
document, which lets you precisely apply clone colors to the canvas.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.600
Unlike traditional tracing paper, the Corel Painter tracing paper is only a viewing mode 
that you can use as a reference for painting or tracing images.

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.333
It’s not a real object, such as a layer or a document.

00:02:19.966 --> 00:02:27.066
When you apply media to the image with tracing paper enabled, the media is applied 
to the clone document, not the tracing paper.

00:02:35.633 --> 00:02:44.533
Use the command CTRL+T (CMD+T on the Mac), to toggle the visibility of the 
underlying image on and off.

00:03:02.833 --> 00:03:13.366
You can also open the source image in a separate window, which allows you to paint 
on the canvas with the source image displayed by its side.

00:03:19.933 --> 00:03:27.533
A crosshair cursor appears in the Source Image window to identify which area of the 
source image you are painting.

00:03:37.833 --> 00:03:48.366
If cloning by hand is not your thing, Corel Painter’s auto-painting tools streamline the 
process of creating a painting that is based on a digital image or scanned photo.  

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:55.966
And no previous experience with digital art is needed to use these tools.
Just follow the three basic steps:

00:03:56.566 --> 00:04:01.299
1. Underpainting, which prepares and clones a photo for painting.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.233
2. Auto-painting, where you can choose which brushstrokes to apply to the canvas.

00:04:29.766 --> 00:04:36.466
The SmartStroke™ brush technology follows lines and contours in your picture, just like 
a real artist would.

00:04:40.966 --> 00:04:49.932
3. And finally, under Restoration, we can fine-tune and perfect our artwork by 
restoring some detail to the image.

00:04:52.833 --> 00:05:03.899
With the cloning and photo-painting features in Corel Painter 2015, you’ll be creating 
incredible photo art that will amaze your audience in no time!
