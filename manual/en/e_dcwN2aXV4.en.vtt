00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.500
before we take a break either time came
up with this idea to order some of these

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.960
like chocolate covered crickets are
other bugs that are edible numbers than

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.909
you think that

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:11.129
it's more sustainable supposedly the
needing a lot of other animal protein

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:13.020
spent on once the order some bugs

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.390
lewis said you'd be interested in trying
them i think we should do this on the

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:20.869
shuttle we could order some of these and
would you guys try them on the show

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.830
you wouldn't in town

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.140
i don't know if i would i mean a
chocolate covered cricket

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:28.499
i don't know i understand is not sure
about it

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.989
and there's not really sure we found is
website highland unique

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.780
which has ubuntu different items they've
got bags of assorted edible bugs for

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.440
like five bucks maybe what we could try
that

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.710
the chocolate covered crickets those are
expensive there actually individually

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:47.660
wrapped i wonder if it's almost consider
like a buggy delicacy of some kind

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.629
didn't think crickets word general
playwright i mean

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.769
when you cover anything in shock with
the press was acquitted there goes up in

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:57.879

chocolate that sounds delicious and i

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:59.159

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:11.610
beatles little little too

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.760

crunchy nominated remove the

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.710
are around the access code that maybe
they do know also we've got header a

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.820

brutality of the insect world

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.189
you should consider doing l album up
about the brutality of the edible insect

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.170
world that could be a compelling piece
of uh...

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:50.229
