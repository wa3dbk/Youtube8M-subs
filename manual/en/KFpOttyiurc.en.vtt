Hello! My name is Grady Johnson and I am a
professional painter. Today I represent expertvillage.com.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.350
Now I am going to go over the basic tools
that you need to remodel your living room.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:15.930
Now a lot of these tools you are going to
recognize from some of my other segments because

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.429
these are the basic tools you need whenever
you are painting. There are a lot of extra

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:24.470
stuff out there, a lot of new kind of inventions
and they are all kind of based on these basic

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:28.279
tools. One of the first things you have to
have in your kit is your prep materials and

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:32.870
you see here, this 5-in-one tool. Originally
I started off with a putty knife but that

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.240
is what it graduated into. I recommend you
use the 5-in-one tool. It has a lot of different

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.300
uses that you are going to need on the sight.
Always keep one of those in your pocket and

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.760
a duster. Now I've got 3 different kinds of
dusters here for different kinds of jobs.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.350
This little one I always keep in my pocket
all of the time along with my rag. Always

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.650
keep a rag in your pocket. If a duster isn't
handy, your rag will always work to get that

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.940
dusty stuff out of there, cobwebs and that
kind of stuff. It is also good for cleaning

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.030
up excess paint. Also I've got the caulking
gun. It is important that you do your caulking

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.760
with this. That is what makes the job look
really, really good and you can see it has

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.750
this little poker on here that I use to poke
the diaphragm. If you don't have that on there,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.860
you can always use a stick. Now also I have
some tape. We are going to tape a little bit

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.940
today. We are going to show you how to do
the taping and most important how to paint

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:25.810
that taping and the wire brush. Now the wire
brush is what I utilize to clean up my brushes

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.270
at the end of the day. Now with paint brushes,
we are using Latex today, be sure to use a

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.229
polyester nylon blend. So are the best brushes
to use. They are going to work the best for

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.990
you. In the acrylic latex and straight latexes
as well. Don't use any kind of china bristle

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.140
that is only for oil paintings. We've got
some paint sticks here to stir with. You can

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.040
use a stick off to the side but I have some
sticks that I picked up at the paint store

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.270
and I have a couple of cut pots. Always use
cut pots. It is important. Don't just paint

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.540
out of that can and you will see a couple
of those here. Now when we start out rolling

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:03.049
today, we see several different naps here
and I've got some I always use for ceiling

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:07.880
and some I use for walls and a new one if
I need it. I always get an inch and quarter.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.099
It is kind of universal for me. I can use
it indoor or outdoor. You can go to a 3/4

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.490
inch on interior painting that way it won't
throw as much. I can control paint pretty

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.260
good so I don't worry about it but I do recommend
that you use about a 3/4 to an inch nap that

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.090
way you can get enough paint on there but
it is not going to fly all over the place

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:30.250
on you. Then of course you need to have a
good roller frame and screen. Use the screens

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.900
to control the paint so be sure you have roller
screens to be able to keep that paint into

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:41.150
the roller. Finally it is very important that
you have a roller pole. A roller pole helps

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:45.400
you control the roll and you are never going
to be able to do that with your hand because

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.510
your wrist can never control the roller like
you can with a pole. Now you do have drops

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:55.040
to drop off the area. I have canvas drops
to cover everything up but I also do have

00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:00.931
9x12 in biscayne. Now this is just plastic.
Get the 2 mill thick and that way you are

00:03:00.931 --> 00:03:04.180
not going to have to worry about it tearing
on it and you can cover everything you need

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.989
to. Finally we've got to fill in the spots
with a little bit of cardboard. These are

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.860
all the basic tools you need for remodeling
the living room.
