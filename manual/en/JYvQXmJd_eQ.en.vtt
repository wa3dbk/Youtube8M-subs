Here's your opportunity to take the platform
and give a speech. So how do you write a good

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.040
speech? Hi, everybody, I'm John Graden. I'm
a professional speaker, trainer, and the author

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:14.240
of seven books including The Imposter Syndrome.
I have given hundreds of speeches. Key note

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.980
presentations, training programs, this is
a subject that I'm not just familiar with,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.289
but I love to do this stuff. It is exciting
for me. It's fun. It gives me a reason to

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.750
get up in the morning. So let me share with
you some of my experience. When I'm writing

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.330
a speech, I have to first know who my audience
is. I want to make sure that I know what the

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:37.860
goal of the presentation is. So I'm going
to talk to the boss who hires me. The meeting

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.560
planner that hires me. I'm going to call the
very supervisors within that company and find

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.370
out what do you, what would you like your
people to walk away from this presentation

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:53.580
with? I want great, and I provide great take
home value. I want to be entertaining, I want

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.940
people to say hey, man that guy is a really
good speaker. That's all very nice. It's ego

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.760
stroking. The hard work is to create a presentation
that makes change. That helps people to improve

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.220
their lives, to improve their productivity,
and to improve overall outlook on how they

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:12.160
face the challenge of everyday. That's what
I love doing. That's why I'm so thrilled about

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.610
talking about programs like The Imposter Syndrome,
which is how to replace self doubt with self

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.441
confidence and train your brain for success.
Boy, isn't that exciting for everybody to

00:01:21.441 --> 00:01:28.360
learn? So when I write a speech, A, number
one, who's my audience? In order, number two,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.380
what is the take home value? OK, so I've got
that assignment from the person who's hired

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.910
me, or it's one of my own presentations. I
know what it's, what I want them to leave

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.409
with. From there, I'm going to start to write
the speech in three parts. There's going to

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.540
be the beginning, a middle, and the end. Let's
say that it's going to be about an hour speech,

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:49.770
maybe forty-five minute speech. I'll write
it in eight to ten minute segments. That's

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:56.110
about how long a television program lasts
between commercials. So that's in our attention

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.190
deficit rule. That's about how long you can
keep somebody locked in on one particular

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.950
point or subject before having to transition
into another angle or another spin on that

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.890
same story. I'm going to use three sections
within that eight to ten minute sections.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.031
So, I'm going to have three little points
that I want to make. So, it helps spend a

00:02:16.031 --> 00:02:19.920
little, OK section number one, I'm going to
do my intro, I'm going to talk about the overview

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.150
of the company, and I'm going to have point
one, point two, point three. Section two,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.420
I'm going to have point one, point two, point
three. And then, I'm going to move this speech

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.950
all the way towards its conclusion, which
is where I'll have my call for action. Humor,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.370
of course, is big part of every speech. It's
difficult to write humor into a speech. For

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:43.060
me, humor typically is a spontaneous comment
or quip that's made from the stage. I don't

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.781
usually structure humor into my speeches,
even though they turn out to be entertaining

00:02:46.781 --> 00:02:51.180
and funny. That's just the nature of the way
that I speak when I'm on stage. But one of

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:57.171
the secrets that I'll share with you is a
great way to get a laugh every time. If it's

00:02:57.171 --> 00:03:02.030
appropriate. When the person gives you your
introduction, they read off this great introduction.

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.040
It's glorious. It just builds you up to be
the greatest speaker since me. You walk to

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.069
the microphone, grab the microphone, and say,
Mr. Jonas I want to thank you for that great

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:15.380
introduction. You read that just like I wrote
it for you. That's a guaranteed laugh. And

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.319
the beauty is, that's a great way to start
off your presentation. It loosens everybody

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:25.820
up. Ever notice that if you go to a Broadway
play, when the curtain pulls back, there's

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:30.959
about thirty seconds of a maid sweeping the
ground, or somebody reaching for a book, or

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:37.910
some kind of activity that is meaningless.
That's designed to allow the audience to focus

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:42.460
in on the new subject and to get comfortable
with what is about to happen. So when I make

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:48.739
that initial comment, that little joke, it
gives my audience a chance to aw, I like him.

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:53.150
He made me laugh right off the bat. Then I'll
dive into my presentation. I'm John Graden.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:57.910
I love making presentations. I hope one day
to make a presentation for you or your organization.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.959
In the meantime, that's how I like to write
a great speech, and I know you'll do the same.

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:02.650
Thanks so much. Bye.
