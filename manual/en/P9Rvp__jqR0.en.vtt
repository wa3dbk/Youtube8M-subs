00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:08.000
Today we go to learn you a trick,
Today we learn you the manual barspin.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:16.000
To practice first: stay on your back pegs
and make a wheelie like this.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.180
If you can do that,
go to the next step.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.170
If you pull up your steer to much,
it's possible that you fall back.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.200
Then you have to practice a bit
and then you will jump of it like a reflex

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.000
Because if you try to correct them
you will bail (if you are a beginner).

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.000
Then you have to try the next step:
Grab your seat with one hand

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.200
I like to grab with my left hand,
because i spin my bar with right.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.000
But if you are left handed
you maybe like the other way.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Then you go to practice this.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.200
The same rule at this:
If you pull up your steer to much...

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:17.300
it's possible that you fall back.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.750
But in this case you only have one 
hand on the wheel and one on the seat.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000
If you fall back, be sure 
you keep your hands tight.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.000
Then this will happen.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.000
And i jump of it like a reflex.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.200
If you can do this step
without bailing to much.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.000
You can move on to the next.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
That means: one foot on your pedal
and one on your back peg.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.200
Pull a bit on your seat,
and then spin your bar.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.000
I will show you.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.000
I told you what happend if you go to high.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.000
But now I'am gonna show you
what happend if you go to low.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
In this case i made a half barspin

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.000
But it's possible that you make 
more than a half, like this.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.000
And belive me you don't want that.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.300
So keep this in your mind: It's 
better to go to high than to low
