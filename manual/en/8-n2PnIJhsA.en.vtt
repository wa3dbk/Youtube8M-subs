00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.800
Here at the University of Exeter
the department of Archaeology

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.240
has a very vibrant community,
it has a very vibrant feel to it.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.259
We have a great reputation for teaching
and a great reputation

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.680
for research as well. Our department
offers a diverse range of programmes.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.500
Many of our students choose to take a single
honours Archaeology degree, however many students

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.099
choose to combine it with another subject;
they take Archaeology alongside Anthropology,

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:31.990
alongside Ancient History or combining it
with Forensic Science.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.140
And something that's unique about Archaeology,
something I'd really stress, is it has a strong

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.489
interdisciplinary feel and character, so
we have strong links with

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.559
Geography, with Biosciences, with History.

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.340
When it came to make my university
decisions I found that Exeter University

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.520
offered a great variety of courses, not
just British and European, but also global

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.500
and really opened my mind to the variety
of Archaeology that's out there in the world.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.100
Well I first got interested in studying
Archaeology here at Exeter

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.840
because my brother was here as a
Physics student a couple of years ago

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.229
and I met some of his friends who were

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.770
current Archaeology students and they
let me know about the

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:14.900
great opportunities of travel and the real
quality of the degree here at the department

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.300
to get really physically involved in history
rather just learning about it.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.689
We encourage students

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:23.630
to get involved in team working skills,
we try and enhance

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.790
their ability to solve problems;
these are some of the skills that make

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.990
students employable in the workplace.
What the students are doing is, they're putting into

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.229
practice what they've learnt

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.670
in their lectures about how to find
clandestine remains,

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.549
trying to find bodies of victims
subjected to

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.450
a murder investigation and they go
round, they find those remains and they

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:45.110
recover them

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.960
archaeologically and they exhibit any
evidence that they find.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.710
I chose Archaeology with Forensic Science
at the University of Exeter because it

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:58.140
gives me the opportunity to combine two very
interesting disciplines.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.869
This is a very unique course and it's
great to actually

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.850
learn both sides of it and then learn
about where the two meet.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.720
Our students really value the fact that
here at Exeter, research

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.500
feeds directly into our teaching. All our
members of staff

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.300
are acknowledged experts in their field;
we have expertise ranging from

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.709
well from Paleolithic Europe right the way
through to the later Medieval world.

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:24.810
I originally did my BA in Ancient History and Archaeology

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.120
at Exeter University and it's great to be back

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.450
disseminating what I've learnt since to the
students in the Archaeology department.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.709
The teaching here is fantastic,
we have many lecturers

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:39.940
each with different specialisations,
we'll cover a really broad field

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.269
and they're always accessible,
always helpful

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:46.000
it's just a fantastic support network to have.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.470
Through flint knapping, we're looking at the
development of human language and

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:54.780
the only insight we have into hominid
brain is the size of the brain itself

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.450
and what the people did, and flint
knapping is something that's preserved

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.069
and so we can look at how complex
they were thinking

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:07.690
back through time, if we understand the
procedures. One of the most satisfying parts of

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.150
being here at Exeter, is that I can
take students into the field, I can

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.280
excite them about my research and if
they're really interested they can

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.610
actually become part of that research
process and produce something original.

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:22.909
It's not just reiterating or
regurgitating what we tell them,

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:27.400
they actually contribute something original
from themselves. That's exciting stuff.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.870
There's so much variety in Archaeology
globally and you

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.180
can get so many opportunities if you
come here,

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.430
to travel, like I've been to Denmark
and I've been to Germany,

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:39.870
and it gives you so many transferable skills
that you can put into any different

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.409
career path that you choose.

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:47.590
It's been the greatest three years of my life.
