Do you feel like you're the reigning champ? i would
say every single one of these guys that

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.950
are in there can win that's what's scary
about this contest and all comes down to

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:22.930
the day how you feel that day how the
board falls on your feet and a you see

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:26.590
people under pressure that you don't
really get to see under pressure that

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.160
often and it's more or less a
free-for-all the best skaters in the

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:33.160
world

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:55.790
yeah

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.130
yeah

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.130
ok

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.210
the board that attention not losing that

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:34.440
yeah yeah

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.390
reviewing your actual you have that
wasn't a compression fracture

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:47.850
yeah it's not a new compression fracture
but there's an old oh that could enough

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.850
first exactly first time

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:58.460
. is making us

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.460
alright

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:04.690
much

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.930
it hurts bad when I only turn this way
but not this way

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.830
when I was in Spain

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.530
like last month and I landed like this
and like that compressed when I came up

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:24.660
my whole like my back just walked up on
me and I said well felt so weird i

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.740
couldn't touch my toes it was hard to
walk and like

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:32.650
yeah it's hard to get out of bed it can
escape for a few days

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.940
like I need to check this thing out

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.200
development again that's where we take
the extra

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.300
rule out

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.900
fracture

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.900
