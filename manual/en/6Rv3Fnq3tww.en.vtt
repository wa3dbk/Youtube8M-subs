00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.240
-Hi, Kristina.
-Hi!

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.760
-Where to?
-To my hotel, please.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.680
What a performance : you kicked out the world n.2!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.480
I wouldn't say "kick out", as I had some trouble,
fortunately, one could say.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.360
But it's just great!

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:28.400
We work for such moments
so at Roland Garros... couldn't be greater!

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.520
The public doesn't know you very well.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.760
What would you tell them first to introduce you?

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:39.280
Nickname: Kiki.

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.720
-Nickname: Kiki?
-Yes.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.280
What is your first memory on the court?

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.640
I was around 8 years old
and my parents had taken me

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:54.320
to my first mini-tennis lesson
at my club in Malo-les-Bains.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.120
Do you remember your first disappointment?

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.000
The juniors final I played at Wimbledon.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.200
I had just won Roland Garros as a junior

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.120
and Wimbledon really is a tournament I love.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.440
-And it's your favorite surface, isn't it?
-Yes.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:14.680
The same day, I lost both singles and doubles finals.
It was a big disappointment.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.720
We're going to relax with a bit of music.

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.480
-Hello.
-Hello, Adriano.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.320
-How are you?
-Fine.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.200
I'm here to record the original soundtrack
of "Road to Roland Garros"

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.880
with the participation of all players.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:31.640
-Can you play the door?
-No.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.160
-It can be an instrument.
-Let's use it.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.000
Come on, open it...

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.680
Perfekt!

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.160
-That's exactly what I needed!
-It's magic!

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.160
I needed a little something
when the drums start again.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.960
I wish I was that talented!

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.360
We like to end the interview with a little selfie...
