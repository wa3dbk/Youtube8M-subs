00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:06.129
Queen of the Night - fine enamel, designed
and created by Christopher Palko.

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:10.510
The inspiration for this beautiful piece is the large, white and wonderfully fragrant

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:14.179
Queen of the Night flower of the 
cereus cacti.

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:18.960
It blooms only at night, once a year for a single night. Many people wait up to 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.960
ten years to see a single flower.

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.400
What better way to capture this moment in
time than with a fine enamel. 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:31.250
The enameling technique used is cloisonne. 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.650
It starts on a base of pure fine silver
which is formed from a sheet of metal.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:40.050
Then a clear enamel or flux coat is
applied to the front and a counter enamel

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.960
is applied to the back which prevent
warpage and stress of the enamel.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:48.919
Fine silver cloisonne wires which you can
see are thin and flat -

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:53.490
are laid out on edge and lightly attached
to the surface with an organic glue.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.060
When heated the wires base holds the
molten glass firmly -

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.260
attaching it to the piece.

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.090
As you this time the glue burns off leaving
no residue.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.310
As you can see there are now "cloisons" or
compartments formed at this stage

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:12.260
they are filled with powdered enamel. This
is a very delicate process of an

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.700
application using a very fine paintbrush.
The powdered enamel is kept wet to assure -

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.740
an even glass layer.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.740
When fired in the kiln the glass melts and is 
a fraction of its original height. 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.759
For this reason layer upon layer is
added to fill the areas.

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:35.460
Enameled pieces can have only a few
layers to as many as ten or more.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:42.250
Queen of the Night piece had about had about fifteen firings by the time it was completed.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.670
At this time the surface is ground down by
hand to level the piece.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:51.570
It then enters the kiln for one last time for the fire polish as it's called -

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.869
which smooths out the surface.

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:58.990
When the enameled piece is finished it is set like a gem showing its depth of color

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.260
and textures. So intriguing and unique.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.220
Truly a one-of-a-kind piece.
