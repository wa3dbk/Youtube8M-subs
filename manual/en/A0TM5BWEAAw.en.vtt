00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:23.220
Kingdom Hearts made a big splash, blending
together lots of Disney… stuff… into a

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.460
smooth, frothy, RPG-like substance.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.439
Hit Maker, on the other hand, didn’t have
nearly as much to work with, so they raided

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:34.560
stock RPG worlds and the public domain, pulling
liberally from Alice in Wonderland, some generic

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.180
Nightmare-Before-Christmas pumpkinny stuff,
Japanese folklore, and whatever else happened

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.760
to be on hand, all to bring you THIS: A Witch’s
Tale, baby’s first RPG.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:54.559
Which is really strange, because I don’t
think I’ve ever seen an E10-rated game use

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.960
the word “Damn” this much before.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.280
And while I realize it’s trivial to put
one over on the ESRB - anyone who’s familiar

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.500
with .hack//GIFT will completely understand
- it raises the question, “Who the heck

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.980
is this game for?”

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:11.900
Is it one of those mythical “girl games”
doomed to failure by its very label?

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:16.000
Is it an attempt at a completely stylus-driven
RPG on the DS, and had to cut a few corners

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.829
as a result of that?

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.520
Mechanically, we’re seeing glimmers of Pokemon,
in the collection and utilization of dolls

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.520
to round out your party, along with representations
of the bosses you defeat as prestige units.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.399
But then it’s all taking place on an ever-shifting
background of ice and sugar and youkai and…

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:40.640
Steady, TJ, just take a step back, roll some
footage, and you’ll be fine.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.520
… So we’ve got an overconfident Etna-wannabe
witch-in-training, who’s after the greatest

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.140
magic ever to magic in the history of magic,
and accidentally releases an ancient evil

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.520
who’s been waiting a millenium to have her
revenge.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.960
Yep, sounds about right.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.850
She’s supported by her catgirl subordinate,
a vampire who’s really into tomatoes (to

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:05.939
the point where they’re used as get-out-of-game-over-free
buttons), and various NPCs appropriate to

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.710
the seven major areas.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.230
The ultimate goal: to defeat this evil presence,
and prove that our girl Liddell is greater

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.730
even than Queen Alice herself.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.810
Again, nothing that really pushes the envelope.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.900
The character designs, sprite work, and environments
are decent and well-animated, but once in

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.310
battle you’re going to be facing the same
handful of palette-swapped enemies over and

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:27.310
over again.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.129
The soundtrack, as well, succeeds in showing
quality throughout most of the experience…

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:37.190
but in parts, especially the opening titles,
it sounds like something went very wrong.

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.230
Just listen to that static.

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:47.600
It’d be easy to take a rather poor view
of A Witch’s Tale, but… then it goes and

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.920
does something actually cool, like drawing
the runes of your magic spells to power them

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:52.920
up.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.470
It’s a fun little tactile thing that sells
the entire “stylus-only” concept rather

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:58.470
elegantly.

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:59.470
See?

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.720
A shining glimpse of positivity… that’s
then mitigated by rather unbalanced enemy

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.720
encounters.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.159
You struggle through the early game, getting
into real slobberknockers before you have

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:12.190
the healing items or spells to do anything
about it, with a protagonist who’s completely

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.680
dependent on magic for attacking, resulting
in several-minute-long random battles.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.310
Then you develop an MP pool and obtain items,
allowing you to just one-shot entire encounters

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:23.920
if you so desire.

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.890
Add in a near-incomprehensible “collect
a deck of 53 cards” sidequest, and… well,

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:32.810
it’s not really the way to sell folks on
RPGs as a concept, I fear.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:37.410
You’d have a better chance turning Final
Fantasy into badly-disguised Doctor Who fanfiction

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:49.329
and oh wait that already happened.
