00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:17.980
Welcome to Expert Village.com. My name is
Patrick Eves. We are going to be talking about

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:25.660
what gear is needed for paragliding. A couple
of basic obviously you need is your wing (your

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:33.580
instructor can pick out which one is right
for you), your harness and most harnesses

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.680
now come with a back protection. You want
to find one with foam back protection or nice

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.090
airbag back protection. A reserve parachute
is another thing that is needed. Having a

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:49.790
nice reserve parachute is a good thing. Gloves,
you always want to have gloves when you are

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.789
flying because some of the maneuvers you do
when you go to stop your wing in case you

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.059
are dragging, the lines can really cut your
fingers so you want to make sure you have

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.680
gloves. You want to have thin gloves that
will protect your fingers but still allow

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:08.182
you to still have some dexterity. A hook knife
is a good thing to have just in case you get

00:01:08.182 --> 00:01:13.970
in an emergency you will be able to cut lines
and usually I try to mount the hook knife

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:20.120
somewhere on my harness where I can get to
it really easily. A helmet, you can get an

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:24.869
open face helmet or a full face helmet. I
recommend getting a nice full face helmet.

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:32.069
You can buy one specifically made for flight
and paragliding. A radio is a great thing

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:37.810
to have for emergencies and to hear what else
is going on in the air. There is a two-meter

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.679
radio; this is what most paraglider’s use.
You do need a license, a hand license to use

00:01:44.679 --> 00:01:49.179
one of these radios for transmitting. It is
real easy to get the license. Contact your

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:53.849
local club and they will help you pass the
test. The other thing you can have is an instrument

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:59.290
panel. This instrument panel has a vireo.
A vireo is an instrument that beeps when you

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.819
are going up and beeps when you are going
down so you will know how fast you are going

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.069
up and how fast you are going down and will
be able find thermals better. I also have

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:11.700
a GPS on here so I can see how far I have
flown in a day. Another thing you want is

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:15.690
possibly a flight suit. Flight suits are awesome
because a lot of times at launch it is going

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.129
to be real hot and you want to be warm. Once
you get up high I guarantee it is a lot colder.

00:02:20.129 --> 00:02:25.819
You should also have a sturdy pair of boots;
something with stiff ankle protection that

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:31.620
will protect your feet in case of hard landings
and something you are able to hike in. One

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.680
last thing I find is essential is a bag to
put my paraglider in when I am sitting around

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.120
waiting. UV rays will damage your paraglider
so anytime you are sitting at launch and not

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.409
quiet ready to launch yet, fold your wing
up and put into one of those stuff sacks.

00:02:48.409 --> 00:02:52.230
You don’t have to totally pack your wing
but you will still have it ready and in a

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.700
bag protecting it from the sun. One last thing,
avoid buying used gear unless your instructor

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.090
specifically recommends it.
