On today's episode we have Golden Heroes in
HearthStone, a quick exit for the Harry Potter

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.039
MMO and Zombies Ate My Pizza!

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.780
It was that delicious cheeseburger pizza from
Papa Johns too.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:28.540
Those bastards!

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.040
Your daily XP starts now!

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.210
Over the weekend, Blizzard released some teaser
images for the upcoming debut of Golden Heroes

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.670
in HearthStone, Heroes of Warcraft.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.570
Golden skins is not a new idea, but one that
players seem to love, as you'll find them

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.160
in plenty of games these days.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.840
In HearthStone players will need to accumulate
500 wins in Ranked Play if they hope to unlock

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.480
these permanent gold skins, which is no easy
feat.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.270
The golden heroes will gain unique animations
to their portrait and Hero Power, but also

00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:00.750
have the ability to scare the bejesus out
of a lesser experienced opponent.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:01.809
It's like the Knicks showing up to gameday
with LeBron James wearing his black mask,

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:02.809
sure scared them shitless.

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.230
We mentioned a Harry Potter Online type MMO
game last week and now we can retract any

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.320
statements we made.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:08.500
Well, mostly.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.900
Things have changed pretty quickly, as Bio
Hazard Entertainment and Warner Bros. Entertainment

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.310
have seemingly nixed the Harry Potter project.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.150
The video with developers has been deleted
from YouTube and the website has disappeared.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.970
But, Bio Hazard does still plan on making
a game, it just won't be Harry Potter related,

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.860
no, it will just be wizard related and has
taken the name, World of Magic.

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.170
So take that Warner Bros.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.450
You don't have control over wizards, if anything,
wizards have control over you!

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.909
Reality Squared Games today announced the
beginning of the closed beta testing event

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.600
for the upcoming action shooter browser MMO
Zombies Ate My Pizza.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.700
Imagine for a moment, that the world is overrun
by a race of extraterrestrial bugs that have

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.979
infected the population with a deadly virus
that turns them into, yeah you guessed it,

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:56.979
zombies.

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.270
The zombies of course, are obsessed with Pizza,
as is accurate with Zombie lore, and your

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.890
job is to drive back the onslaught, and save
your local pizza joint.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.819
Well, that's not totally accurate, but come
on, it's a humorous take on zombies and pizza,

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:11.829
so we take what we can get.

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:13.029
