This video shows how to replace a cartridge
in your HP LaserJet Printer.

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:15.400
To begin, turn the printer on by pressing
the Power button.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.730
Next, lift the scanner assembly to gain access
to the cartridge door.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:28.730
Locate the cut-out near the output tray. Place
your finger into the cut-out and lift to open

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.700
the cartridge door.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.780
Grasp the handle on the print cartridge and
pull it straight up and out to remove it and

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.840
then set it aside.

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:53.040
Now, take the new cartridge out of its box.
To do this, first pull the tab from the side

00:00:53.040 --> 00:01:10.819
of the box. Pull the cartridge from the box
in its packaging. Tear open the plastic packaging

00:01:10.819 --> 00:01:21.819
where indicated. Then remove the cartridge
from the plastic.

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.770
While holding the new print cartridge by its
sides, gently rock the cartridge to distribute

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.539
the toner evenly inside.

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:39.539
Remove the protective tape from the new print
cartridge.

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:49.599
Touching the shutter or roller can damage
the cartridge. It's important to only hold

00:01:49.599 --> 00:01:54.469
the new print cartridge by its sides or by
the center handle.

00:01:54.469 --> 00:02:01.469
Then, grasp the new print cartridge by the
center handle and insert it into the printer.

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:07.909
Make sure that the tabs on the cartridge align
with the slots in the printer. Then insert

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:13.069
the cartridge until it stops.

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.290
Close the print cartridge door.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:24.290
Then, lower the scanner assembly.

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:31.290
Place the used print cartridge in the bag
and box to return it for recycling. For recycling

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:39.069

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.069
The printer 
is now ready for regular use.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:54.310
