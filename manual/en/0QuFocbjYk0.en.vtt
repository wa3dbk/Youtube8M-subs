Hi, I'm Jim Harmon, with California Pest Management
here in California. We're going to talk a

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.660
little bit about moles in the landscape and
in your yard, and how to stop them. First

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.700
off, the mole is a very small insect eating
creature. They are underneath the grass in

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.610
the soil; swimming through it if you will,
and as they burrow they're pushing the soil

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:26.040
up. Now, you will see, on moles, small circular
mounds. These conical, circular mounds is

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.920
where they've come up closer to the surface.
But, they don't come out typically, like we

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.300
see with gophers, and forage on the surface.
They like to stay below ground at all times.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.710
They can't see very well, but their sense
of touch is incredible, and they're well adapted

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.960
for literally swimming through the soil. Now,
when we're dealing with the moles biggest

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:49.030
problem is control, because they don't leave
an open tunnel that's verily, easily accessible.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.329
Now, if you call a professional be prepared.
A mole control program is very extensive,

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.729
and it takes three, or four, or five visits
from the service person. There's only a few

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:03.300
new products, but they're great. Talpirid
is one of them if they call it by name. Make

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:08.119
sure you get the right competent company to
do this. They're going to be probing and making

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.130
notes where all the new burrows are; then
come back the next day after doing all the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.460
marking and see if those burrows have been
closed back up. If they have then we have

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.010
activity. They'll put the bait inside, and
that, typically, will knock it out. Make sure

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:27.689
though, if you have pets we don't want the
pets getting the moles and chewing on em',

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.860
or trying to eat them because it might make
them sick. One of the other best ways to get

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:37.970
a mole is going to be with a trap. The scissor
traps, big, ungainly, and dangerous. They

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.342
are designed to shish kabob, literally, a
mole underground, so they're under a spring

00:01:43.342 --> 00:01:48.009
tension and they shoot spikes straight down
into the soil when they the mole trips the

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:52.429
trigger. If you have children or pets this
is definitely not the way to go. So, let's

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:57.450
talk a little bit about one thing you can
do. There's an old home, old remedy of mixing

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.390
up some Murphy's Oil Soap, some cayenne pepper,
and spraying that all over our ground here.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.570
Now, I'll read you the recipe. The recipe
calls for one cup of Murphy's Oil Soap, with

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.000
one ounce of Castor Oil, and a quarter cup
cayenne pepper, and that's all in our nice

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.260
little hose end sprayer. And what we want
to do, make sure you wear gloves when you're

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.290
handling this stuff, cause' it is nasty and
if you got a cut it will burn, and that's

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:27.440
the idea. We want to spray this all over the
turf and really soak it in so that way it

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.140
soaks deep into the soil. Water it in afterwards
really good for at least twenty to thirty

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.200
minutes with your sprinkler system. You want
this to settle down all the way, soak into

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.540
the soil so as that mole is swimming through
the soil he's going to encounter it, sense

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.860
it with his whiskers and turn the other way.
This is one of the better remedies if you

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.920
don't want to use traditional pesticides.
The sonic materials; they don't really do

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.000
a whole heck of a lot. You really need to
rely on either a professional, or take your

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.740
chances with one of these. Good luck.
