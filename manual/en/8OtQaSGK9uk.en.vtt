00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:14.319
Hi this is Jaystepher here, and I'm going to show you some Lego kits that I bought.

00:00:14.319 --> 00:00:19.810
And I got these from Lego.com. This particular little set

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:26.810
Kingdoms or something like that. It's got 
31 pieces.

00:00:27.739 --> 00:00:32.230
Set number 30062. This came with my free shipping.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.280
Because I think I spent 75 dollars or more.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.210
So they actually gave this to me.

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.920
Yeah, so it looks pretty cool.

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:48.920
You get like some pieces. You know, for
freebie, I'm not really going to complain.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.910
Now I also ordered

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.830
some of these cool blue base plates.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:01.550
I got two of them

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.240
for some water themes or something like that.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.720
I only have one green one like this.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.800
I only have one green one like this.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.000
I only have one green one like this.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.450
So I'm glad I got two of these but they're like five bucks.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.240
So I'm glad I got two of these but these are like five bucks

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.030
a piece so I was happy.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.430
I got the big 15 by 15 inch base plate.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.300
I got the big 15 by 15 inch base plate.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.159
Kind of cool looking.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:32.870
Kind of cool looking.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:36.120
I can build a lot of stuff on this.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.150
So not a big deal with this here, but this was fifteen dollars.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:43.960
Very pricey.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.230
It's worth it since I don't have a lot of stuff. I'm planning on building a house on that.

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:48.670
It's worth it since I don't have a lot of stuff. I'm planning on building a house on that.

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.780
I bought two kits.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.270
One is the Winter Bakery.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:59.010
Now this one is kind of cool because it's got the light brick.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.360
I'm interested in the trees,

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.370
the wagon.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:03.860
the wagon.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.440
the wagon.

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.579
Let me put this down on the table here. Point my cam down, my hand is getting tired.

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:11.319
So you know a lot of detail in here, the ice.

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:17.319
So you know a lot of detail in here, the ice.

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:20.229
It's summertime. I bought this now.

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:24.619
What the hey, you know. This will be a cool little kit to put together.

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:30.509
So this one here was like 54, 55 dollars,

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:35.430
and it's set number 10216, 687 pieces for 54 dollars.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.179
So you're getting little bit like under 10 cents a piece. Good deal.

00:02:38.179 --> 00:02:41.400
So you're getting little bit like under 10 cents a piece. Good deal.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.719
And I'm saving the best for last.

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:51.969
I actually splurged and got the big giant Lego Fire Brigade.

00:02:51.969 --> 00:02:55.599
I actually splurged and got the big giant Lego Fire Brigade.

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:02.599
Set number 10197 has 2231 pieces.

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:09.419
This is a massive set I have to admit.

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:10.930
It was 150 dollars.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:12.420
I'm getting probably about nine, nine and a half cents a piece.

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.480
I'm getting probably about nine, nine and a half cents a piece.

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.290
A really good steal.

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.540
Lots of detailing, lots of windows, arches. I bought this just to put together,

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.869
Lots of detailing, lots of windows, arches. I bought this just to put together,

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:22.879
and enjoy it, play with it.

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:25.089
and enjoy it, play with it.

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:29.009
I'll probably end up tearing it down. I know some people tell me I should keep these up.

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:31.069
Now I actually have the Cafe Corner

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.419
Now I actually have the Cafe Corner

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:35.709
for the Lego theme that goes with this.

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:36.809
for the Lego theme that goes with this.

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:39.989
for the Lego theme that goes with this.

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:43.099
That's probably about the other one. I couldn't even find the Green Grocer. I was trying to get that.

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.249
I was going to order the Taj Mahal, they didn't have that.

00:03:47.249 --> 00:03:48.829
They didn't even have the, at the time,

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:51.229
They didn't even have the, at the time,

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:55.229
they had the Death Star  something like that. I think it was 400 dollars but I'm not sure.

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:59.529
I didn't get that but I got this instead and all this other stuff.

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:02.189
Really, I got a good deal on all this stuff.

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:07.189
I can't find the Green Grocer. I guess that's gone.

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:10.170
I guess they don't make those anymore. Except on Ebay and you'll pay a fortune.

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.459
I guess they don't make those anymore. Except on Ebay and you'll pay a fortune.

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:12.790
So yeah,

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.519
the detailing in the fire truck.

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.270
I will be doing reviews on the kits.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:18.099
I will be doing reviews on the kits.

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:20.900
On that and the Winter Bakery.

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:25.020
On that and the Winter Bakery.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:26.479
