Hello, this is JB. I'm with Austin Homebrew
Supply in Austin, Texas, and today we're talking

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:17.330
a little bit about fermentation of homemade
beers and homemade wines. Also regarding that,

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:24.070
you'd also have ciders and sakis and mead,
and all the other miscellaneous homebrewed

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:32.160
things that you can make. Going to touch briefly
upon the different choices that are available

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:43.310
in fermentation material. In general, you
have food grade plastic, glass, pet, kind

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:52.260
of a polymer plastic material, or stainless
steel. All these are applicable for beer making.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:57.510
Most everything here's applicable to wine
making or cider making, with exception of

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.350
this one here. In wine making you need to
minimize your head space, so because of that,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.850
this one really is best for beer, the conical
fermenter. But that being said, some different

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.170
choices available depending on what kind of
material you want to use. Plastic is a little

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:22.880
more, less expensive, and stainless steel
is the most expensive, so, because of that,

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.700
it kind of hinders some people getting in
to using stainless steel, but none-the-less,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.661
you just have different sizes. For instance,
on plastic, you have your eight or seven gallon

00:01:33.661 --> 00:01:38.920
one. In glass we have a number of different
sizes. This is a five gallon and a three gallon.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:44.150
There's other available, depending on the
size that you're doing. PET comes in five

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.229
gallon and six gallon. And then conical fermenters
go all the way from seven gallon, all the

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:55.800
way up to like forty five gallon, so. So,
little bit about fermentation vessels and

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.170
the different choices that will be available
to you.
