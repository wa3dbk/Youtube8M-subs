Hello Bakers.

00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:07.740
The Frosting Guy here today with another tip
on how to use Fido's Royal Icing.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.929
This is an all-natural, sugar-free, yogurt
based product designed specifically for dogs.

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:19.670
It dries hard, does not melt, and will last
longer than the treat that you put it on.

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:23.310
Today we're going to be talking about how
to create a web design.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.900
In front of you you can see we've got one
web design here on a treat.

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.560
We've got another web design here that's on
a round treat, and you can see sort of the

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.980
different phases here which I'm going to go
through and show you step by step how to do

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:40.400
it.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.600
First thing we're going to do is we're going
to take a regular type of treat.

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.030
In this case I'm using a round type of treat.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.550
Then we're going to mix up the royal icing.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.160
In this case I'm using white but you can use
whatever color you want.

00:00:54.160 --> 00:01:01.390
And we simply spoon it onto the top of the
treat and spread it around so that we have

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.710
a nice even coating.

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.210
As you can see it's very easy to work with.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:19.130
And the royal icing will pool so it gives
you a nice, smooth coating as it sits.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.810
Now we've got the base.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.860
Imagine if you wanted to do a pumpkin, for
example.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.530
You might use an orange-colored base, and
then a black-colored web design.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.370
In this case we use blue because it shows
up better on the video.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:34.500
We wanted you to see how it worked.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.350
I mixed up some additional royal icing.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.220
I added the blue color to it.

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.950
I put it in a zip-lock bag.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.450
I cut the corner and I put a small piping
tip on.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:54.460
And all I'm going to do is I'm going to create
a circle made out of a thin line on top of

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.740
the base of the frosting, of the icing, excuse
me, and there's one circle.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.060
And I'll do it again.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.920
You can see how easy this comes out.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:12.520
And then in the middle I'm going to give it
a nice litle dab.

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.060
So now we've got what looks like a target
design, which is a design in and of itself.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.720
But we want to take this and we want to transform
it into the web as you see here.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.810
So all we do is we take a toothpick.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.970
A basic, household toothpick, and you're going
to put it right down in the middle of the

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:37.010
center dot and then you're going to drag outwards
all the way to the edge of the treat.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:48.070
And you're simply going to repeat that as
you go around, and around.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:53.300
You can see the design starting to take shape
now.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:58.849
And one last one.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:02:59.849
Take a look at that.

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:02.660
If that doesn't look like a web, I don't know
what does.

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:03.940
You saw how simple that was.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.379
You watched from beginning to end.

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.519
Probably a maximum of maybe twenty seconds
to do an entire treat.

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.840
Imagine doing that making Halloween designs,
pumpkin designs.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.160
In this case it looks sort of like a Napolean.

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:22.819
You could do it with a,a brown-colored um
stripes on a white-colored base to get the

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.720
traditional Napolean top.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.580
Um, you can be as imaginative and inventive
as you like with your colors.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:35.980
And um some people even add litle pearls and
dots and things to give it some texture.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.660
But anyways, there's the basics of how to
do a web design with Fido's Royal Icing.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:45.260
We'll be back with some additional videos
teaching you more tips and tricks.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:46.260
Come on back.
