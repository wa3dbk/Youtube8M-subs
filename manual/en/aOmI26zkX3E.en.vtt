00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.330
Concussion

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.600
Crashes are a part of cycling, and unfortunately
so are head injuries.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.710
&nbsp;Concussions are a form of brain injury resulting
from a direct blow.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.590
&nbsp;Wearing a helmet significantly reduces the
chances of injury, but cannot completely prevent

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.980
concussion.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.070
Achilles tendinitis

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.840
If you’ve got pain in the Achilles through
cycling the it’s likely to be Achilles tendinitis,

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.789
which is an inflammation commonly associated
with overuse.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.320
&nbsp;It can also be brought on by poor bike fit
or an issue with cleat position.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.300
Patellar Tendinitis

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.700
Tendinitis of the knee.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.949
&nbsp;This is commonly associated with &nbsp;having
your saddle too low, or if you grind a big

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:45.659
gear and your glute muscles aren’t working
as hard as they should be.

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:46.960
Broken Clavicle

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.830
Otherwise known as a broken collarbone, this
is the most common ‘break’ in cycling,

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.360
commonly caused by putting your arm down to
save yourself in a low speed crash.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.730
&nbsp;Once you impact the floor, the collarbone
is often the weakest link of the chain, and

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.609
first to snap.

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:02.609
&nbsp;

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.540
Pro tip: try to keep hold of the handlebars
when you crash!

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:07.610
Broken scaphoid

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.770
If your collarbone isn’t the weak link in
a fall, then your scaphoid bone often is.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.610
&nbsp;The scaphoid is one of the carpal bones
on the thumb side of the wrist.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:20.210
&nbsp;Often not visible on X-rays, this fracture
is frequently mistaken for a simple wrist

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.210
strain.

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.140
When the scaphoid breaks it can cause significant
problems because there is only blood supply

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.500
into one end of the bone.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:31.360
&nbsp;Left untreated, if there is a fracture,
it can lead to avascular necrosis, which,

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.409
effectively, is cellular death of bone.

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.280
Fractured pelvis

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.720
If you don’t put your hand down to break
your fall, the first point of contact with

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.330
the ground when you crash is often your hip.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.650
&nbsp;Pelvic fractures are common amongst amateur
and professional cyclist alike, and as fractures

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.909
go, this one is particularly painful.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.470
&nbsp;It normally doesn’t lead to any major
complications, unless it was a particularly

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.270
bad break.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.270
Saddle sores

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:00.920
Basically, saddle sores are a skin disorder,
and the biggest cause appears to simply be

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.630
long hours in the saddle.

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:07.600
&nbsp;However, not riding with a chamois, riding
in dirty shorts, having your saddle too high

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.019
or using a cheap saddle can also cause this
unwanted irritation.

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.420
&nbsp;Plus wearing any items of clothing under
your shorts will not help!

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:16.420
Lower back pain

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.450
You’ll often hear cyclists complaining of
this when riding.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.200
&nbsp;In addition to feeling twisted or ‘blocked’,
the discomfort often means riders are unable

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.990
to get full power through the pedals.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.819
It’s often caused by a bad bike fit, long
hours spent in an un-natural position, and

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:33.890
the constant vibration coming from the road.

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.670
Lower back problem can lead to feelings of
a-symettry in the pedal stroke.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.110
&nbsp;It’s important to make sure these issues,
if they continue, are addressed because if

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.510
you continue riding it can lead to problems
elsewhere such as your knees.

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.420
Neck pain

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.250
Similarly to lower back pain, soreness or
sharp pains in the neck can normally be put

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.800
down to spending a long time in a fixed position.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.000
&nbsp;This leaves the neck in extension for long
periods of time which can impinge the neck

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.090
joints leading to irritation.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:04.290
&nbsp;Equally, a faulty bike fit can lead to the
same issues.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.790
Numbness of the hand

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.360
Officially known as Thoracic outlet syndrome,
or TOS, this is a condition where the blood

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:14.730
vessels or nerves are compressed as they pass
from the neck region to the arm, resulting

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.690
in numbness and/or pain in the arms and hands.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.569
&nbsp;This is often a result of tight muscles
around the neck area, and can be relieved

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:25.720
with proper stretching, which will in turn
promote circulation in that area.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.720
The typical area that can cause entrapment
of the thoracic outlet is the neurovascular

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:58.590
bundle (which is the nerve and the blood supply)
which can get trapped by the scalene muscles

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.530
and the first rib.
