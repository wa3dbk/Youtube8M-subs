00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.580
hi everyone here's a quick video on how
to start searching

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.919
the on-line catalog the library's online
catalog

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.469
for books and the West Valley College
home page

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:17.470
click on library in the upper banner and
then on the library page click

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.710
on find books and media over on the
right

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:23.949
once that pages opens you want to click

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.960
on that big link at the top to get your
own

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.460
West Valley College webpage

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.540
open for searching and then what you're
going to do is pick

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.809
two keywords out of your

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.760
research question and add them together
you're going to see a

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.039
and search tutorial and Boolean
searching and that's what we're gonna

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:48.070
use here is simply the word AND

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.320
and basically that's showing the system
I need to find books

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.620
that have both words either in the title
page or

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:58.899
a table of contents so I'm gonna search
TECHNOLOGY

00:00:58.899 --> 00:01:05.229
and PRIVACY now you see here have an
asterisk * after the G

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.790
basically that's showing
the system to get

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.000
any variation of that word the asterisk
is what is called a truncation mark

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.470
or a wild card and it tells it to get
any variation

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.580
after the chase so it would get
technology technologies

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.930
technological any variation that word
okay

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.060
let's go hit Search and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.100
hopefully I'll get the results soon yes
okay 87 results

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.810
now what you're looking at are results from

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.880
both Mission College and West Valley and this first I want to

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.170
bring to your attention very quickly it
says Mission College online

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.040
basically that means only Mission
College students have access

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.170
to those online books these are e-books that

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.579
you need a Mission College ID the second one

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.140
is also at Mission college let's go ahead and open that up

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.950
you see then the words that we searched

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.780
in red and perhaps this is something
that you'd like to borrow

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.989
you can borrow print books from Mission
and you can tell this is a print book

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:10.580
because it has a call number:

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.879
that's basically the address the book on
the shelf how you find the book

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.510
so what you could do for this one is
simply click the Request button up here

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:20.160
at the top

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.760
fill out the form that comes up hit
Submit

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.590
and within one to two days your book
will be waiting at the West Valley

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.180
College Library so

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.709
remember though that it's summer our
hours are limited

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.239
you might want to go to our website to see what the hours are this summer okay

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.000
on the back here can go back again

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.590
and when you see something that just
simply says Online

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.910
just Online that means West Valley
College students had access to that

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.650
see you can click on the title and then
what will appeared next

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:57.379
is a link to the electronic book

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:02.040
via the World Wide Web just click that
be putting your name on your ID number

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.250
and it will give you access to that book
you'll be able to page through it will

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.920
be a look at the table contents

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.290
you'll even be able to cite it and I
think there is the to document

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.640
in Week 2

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.760
that talks about how to read

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.830
and cite ebooks okay

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:26.819
that's pretty much it, actually let
me show you one more thing

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:29.940
let's say you want a search a phrase

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.799
let's say you have this phrase wanna put it in
double quotes

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:38.120
so that it tells a system

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.890
I need to search that as a phrase and
then it'll come back

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.940
and it will search that phrase okay
that's pretty much it

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.569
is very simple there are a couple of
other things I'd like to show you

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:51.640
and I'll do that next video thanks
