00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:09.879
Now we are going to do a bold lip on
Alex. We're going to start by using the neutral

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:19.470
lip pencil and we're going to line her whole
lip with that first. Close your lips. You

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.090
just want to start at the bow and by lining
it with a neutral lip color first that's really

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:33.790
going to help when you go in with the red
because sometimes with the red lipstick it

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.730
kind of has a tendency to bleed. So you want
to make sure that you have a solid base underneath

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:47.720
it so it won't bleed.
For those of you that don't know what bleeding

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:56.899
is, it's when the red lipstick seeps out through
the cracks in your lips and gets on your face

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:05.940
and it doesn't have that perfect flush line.
Now we're going to go in with a deep burgundy

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:17.360
lip liner. We are going to start at the bow,
keep your lips closed, and do that little

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:22.600
"v" shape. I like doing that first just because
it's my favorite part of the lip and then

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.960
you can also do this part and then just connect
it. So you want to go all the way down the

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:38.360
side right on top of the neutral lip liner
that you just used and then the bottom, pull

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:47.179
it down on the sides. Make sure you really
get into that corner because a lot of people

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:56.119
forget the corners of their lipstick and it
looks weird. So get that corner. Then you

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:06.290
want to fill it in slightly, fill in the corners,
the lip right here, a little bit right through

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:17.150
there, in the corners and just kind of blend
it up so you don't have that line because

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.180
there is nothing more unattractive than a
line not blending with the lip color. Drives

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:30.610
me crazy. Now we are going to go in with the
red. The red and burgundy lip liner is going

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:42.840
to give us a really nice colored lip stick.
So I'm using a lip brush because it's just

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:53.230
easier to control red lip stick application
with a lip brush instead of the actual stick.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.220
It's kind of hard to use the stick because
if you go out of the lines and then it's hard

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:06.230
to fix it. So you want to start with the inner
part of the lips and work your way out. Start

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:16.340
with the inner part, open your mouth a little
bit, and don't forget those corners in there

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:24.489
and if you smudge outside of the lips at all
you can take a q-tip and just wipe it off

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:31.050
or a makeup wipe and your nail and just use
it right on the edge and that kind of help

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:48.720
keeps the line. Close your lips Alex. Now
she's ready to go out with her bold lip.
