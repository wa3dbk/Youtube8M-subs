00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:22.760
It’s Russ here to review Far Cry 3.

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.391
With tons of guns, and the most freedom you're
likely to see in a First Person Shooter, Far

00:00:26.391 --> 00:00:31.539
Cry 3 is out to make a lasting impression,
the story is also very well written.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.120
Basically you're a rich overprivileged twenty
something, and after some skydiving you're

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.870
caught by a ruthless murderer named Vaas.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.690
The island is populated by two factions, one
the group of pirates that caught you, and

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:46.519
a band of rebels which takes you in and arms
you.

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:47.519
.

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.860
Admittedly some of the tribe and warrior stuff,
thats touched on is a bit out there, but the

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:55.750
personal tale of revenge and sacrifice is
quite strong.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.980
The main character Jason has a pretty good
story arc.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.550
The story is superb, with memorable characters
and great voice acting.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.979
Vaas is a very interesting, and dynamic character.

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.299
We don't see enough of that in gaming.

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:12.920
Now this is an open world fps, with a huge
tropical island to play in.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.970
It’s not just storming gates, and shooting
people.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:20.380
Although you will do plenty of that, there’s
a lot to do in Far Cry 3.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.200
From races, to hang gliding, hunting, and
gambling, this is the closest you will come

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.579
to a true sandbox FPS that plays like a good
shooter.

00:01:28.579 --> 00:01:33.030
Speaking of shooting, the controls are very
precise, and the guns look and sound great.

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.250
It may not be the best shooting mechanics,
but there pretty impressive all the same.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.409
Not to mention the fact that the game has
well over forty different guns and weapons

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:52.720
to use.

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.420
There are light RPG elements, you will level
up and gain new abilities.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.890
Its done well, and with each new skill Jason
gets a tattoo.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.950
A bit gimmicky but it works.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.700
There’s a ton to do, sidequests, hits, towers
to take over, compounds to capture.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:13.670
You can also hunt, to make bigger ammo bags,
and be able to carry more weapons, and money.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.790
Not only does that offer plenty of variety,
but each mission each objective 90 percent

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:21.160
of the time, can be completed anyway you choose.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.019
Stealth, rigging bombs, a full on assault.

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.120
The amount of depth is staggering.

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.700
The game world is also very expansive, it’s
filled with tons of detail and life.

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:37.130
The game is just very impressive, the facial
animations are incredibly real, it really

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.530
brought life to these characters.

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.760
Textures are clean with no jaggys, however
there is a good amount of screen tearing and

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.849
pop in.

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.500
Given the epic scope of the game, it’s easy
to forgive, and it never got in the way of

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.500
gameplay.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.880
It was just noticeable, but never annoying.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.930
Now beyond the excellent single player experience,
there’s co op and multiplayer.

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.459
Co op is pretty fun, however it's far more
linear than the main storyline.

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:07.409
Still the fact they packed a whole nother
story is impressive, it will last you around

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.030
8 or 12 hours.

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:14.239
We then have the map editor which is robust
and fun, not my cup of tea, but very well

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:15.459
made.

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.879
Finally rounding out this incredible game
is the multiplayer, however it’s really

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:21.470
nothing to write home about.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:23.900
It’s functional and provides some fun.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:26.310
The map editor does help it stand out.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.689
But at the end of the day, this game is about
the singleplayer experience, Which is very

00:03:30.689 --> 00:03:31.689
refreshing.

00:03:31.689 --> 00:03:36.629
The game is not without a few flaws, but it's
such an impressive and fun game that you won't

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:48.150
notice any of them.
