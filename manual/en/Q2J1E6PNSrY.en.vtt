00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:10.160
Hi this is Julie with beadaholique.com and in this show &amp; tell

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:13.420
I wanna show you our new selection of gemstone bezel

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.660
pendants and links. If you remember a
couple months ago we got our first

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.650
collection in

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.730
of these wonderful gemstone bezels

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.009
and they were very popular and we've got a lot of request to get some more in so we

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:26.490
did

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:30.970
and right here I have just a collection
of some other new styles that we

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:31.699
have in

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.700
and you'll see we have this amazing dyed

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.969
purple stone which is just spectacular,
Here's a bracelet that Kat did

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.170
and we have the instructions for it on
beadaholique.com

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.519
A really fun bracelet where you have that
focal piece. We also have

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.359
these great new dipped pendants

00:00:50.359 --> 00:00:54.140
which are fun and you can see what they look like. So they've got

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.859
it on both sides and the hook and they're
dipped

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:02.429
so that they just have that really
fabulous topper and here I've taken a

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.370
little bit of

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.510
gemstone chain and you can see just how
pretty this one would look if you just

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:10.340
hung it from it and that would be a
great necklace

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.159
piece. I have another project example
right here and again this is by Kat

00:01:15.159 --> 00:01:18.900
it's a wrap bracelet with this beautiful
green stone

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.990
as the focal. So I'm going to kind of show
you an

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.060
overview of these and you can go onto our website and actually pick them out and 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.560
see what different

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.920
stones they are but we've got this intense

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:33.290
turquoise color, we've got a great dyed
green

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.439
and dyed purple, which will really add a pop of color

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:40.530
there's a new shape for us, this is
something we don't have in the last

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:41.500
batch

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.530
These are really fun dramatic for perhaps a
pair of

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.430
earrings. All you really need to do is
hang an earring hook on that and you're

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.140
done

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.149
you have Labradorite, I have Chalcedony

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.930
beautiful black, intense coral color

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.820
a lot of different things you can do
with these

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.909
a whole new selection of the druzys

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.490
here it's flat on the back and it's
got that great

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.940
druzy on the front. We have these in
both pendant style

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.230
and link styles, so you can hang something from the bottom of it

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.410
as well and then of course the dipped
which come in all different sizes and

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.940
all different stones

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:24.650
so pretty. Real quickly again I'm just
gonna pick these up so you can see them

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:26.220
from all sides

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.519
do that with these as well. Beautiful
focal pieces, really unique

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.050
will offer you something different. This is the type of jewelry you can put together

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.239
really quickly and easily

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.250
yet it looks like it came from an expensive boutique which is really fun

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.629
and nice to be able to produce something
like that and not have to spend a lot of

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:46.430
time at it

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:50.640
Just so so pretty. You can check
these out along with our other

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:52.800
