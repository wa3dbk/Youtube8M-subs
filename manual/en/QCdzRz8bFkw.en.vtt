Hello there unboxers and welcome to another mini episode of Unboxholics presented by Sakis Karpas! This is the SanDisk Extreme USB 3.0 Flash Drive.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.150
This is the 16GB version. 32GB and 64GB versions are also available in the market.

00:00:28.299 --> 00:00:43.150
Included inside the retail package of the Sandisk Extreme USB 3.0 Flash Drive is a one year subscription of RescuePro Deluxe Recovery software which helps you recover your valuable digital files.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:55.100
First of all, I'll start by saying that I've lost numerous USB sticks in the past and I'm happy that its size is big. I also love its small gap at its bottom end side which is useful for attaching it to your keys.

00:00:55.201 --> 00:01:02.470
Its overall build quality is solid, its matte surface adds a nice touch and the glossy details make it look shiny.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:15.400
All USB sticks nowadays are quite easy to plug in and the Sandisk Extreme USB 3.0 is no different. You just push the switch forward and you're all set.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:33.000
Where all USB Flash Drives distinguish themselves is their performance. And the Sandisk Extreme USB 3.0 excels here. With a 245 MB/S Read Speed and 50 MB/S Write Speed, we have a USB 3.0 Flash Drive 12 times faster than the fastest USB 2.0 flash drive.

00:01:33.114 --> 00:01:42.800
All this is possible with the power of USB 3.0 technology, but it does not mean that you can't use the Sandisk Extreme USB 3.0 Flash Drive with a USB 2.0 port. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:54.280
The Sandisk Extreme USB 3.0 Flash Drive 16GB is available now for €25. The 32GB Edition costs €35 while the maximum storage version which is 64GB costs €65.

00:01:54.385 --> 00:01:59.400
That's all for today! See you on the next episode.
