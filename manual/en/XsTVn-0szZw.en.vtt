Travis:
I'm Travis; I was a patient of Dr. Mahtabifard;

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:05.009
I'm from Los Angeles.

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.900
Personally, I've gone my whole life, you know,
when I was playing video games, my controllers

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.600
would just be soaked with sweat.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.840
Whenever I picked up a towel, they would just
be soaked.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:19.230
Also, I work in retail and in retail, you're
shaking people's hands a lot showing them

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.900
products and it was just one of those times
I was just so embarrassed to shake people's

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:28.730
hands because my hands were just so sweaty,
and I'd always want to dry them off before

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.119
shaking someone's hand.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.420
I discussed Botox with my mon because she
worked at Kaiser and she saw a lot of people

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.499
at Kaiser getting that; but she also saw them
keep returning and that was one of the things

00:00:37.499 --> 00:00:42.429
My doctor did tell me about, that it's not
something permanent -- and insurance won't

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:43.620
pay for it.

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.620
So my doctor suggested this surgery and that
it was something permanent.

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:53.370
He said the downsides were very minimal and
I said, "I've tried everything else; I've

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.780
tried powder.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.229
I've tried using different types of cream;
nothing's worked so if it's gonna fix it,

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:02.229
let's go for it."

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.229
The surgery was awesome.

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:04.229
It took like, 30 minutes.

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.240
Got here at 6 o'clock in the morning; it took
me about a day, two days to recover and I

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:11.520
was back on y feet and working again.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.990
And scars are pretty much non-existent.

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.840
La Peer was awesome; they checked in on me
every 10 minutes before the surgery and after

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.840
the surgery.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.850
They made sure I made it into the car okay,
they made sure I had a driver, everything

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.250
was smooth.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.000
I would come here again for another surgery.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.719
The result's been life-changing.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:30.679
I mean, I can go day to day shaking people's
hands and not having to worry about drying

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:32.420
my hands off before I shake their hands.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.120
I can have friends over and play video games
with them and not pass them the controller

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.159
and have them wipe it off on a towel before
they take over.

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.340
Dr. Mahtabifard was awesome, whether he was
contacted through cell phone or email, he

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.999
would respond within a day.

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:47.749
Even after it was over, he would check in
on me.

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:51.700
You know, most doctors would be like, "Okay,
cool; surgery went fine -- that's it."

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.479
He even came into the store when I was working
and checked to see how my hands were.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:58.749
He wanted to shake my hand personally to see
if I was sweating.

00:01:58.749 --> 00:02:01.969
And you know, I was happy to go up to him
and like, "Sure, you can check my hand whenever

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:02.969
you want.

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:04.670
I'm not sweating anymore."

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.630
It was just amazing -- his service was amazing.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.720
If someone else is having the same problems
I was having, I would pretty much tell them

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.500
to go talk to a doctor and see if they can
get the surgery like I did because it's changed

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:20.970
everything about my everyday life.
