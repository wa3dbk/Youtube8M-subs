Hi dog owners. Let me show you a simple way to stop your dog from biting the leash

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.800
Pay attention to Dan explaining this process

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.500
This is little Ruby she's an eight month
old little spoon lynch's gorgeous little

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.060
girl

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.259
however when she went for a walk she was
causing her own as a whole host of

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:23.970
problems

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.539
here is one little trick which helped to
turn her around

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.150
as you can see soon as the lead came out

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.379
even in the back garden little Ruby
would go pretty crazy

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.629
pulling and yanking and mouthing in
chewing the leash

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:42.339
she was a small dog but she could pull
the leash pretty strong

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:46.590
and she was tenacious she didn't give up
even on long walk she'd keep pulling

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.110
all the way down the road and across the
street she'd be dragging it here dragging

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:50.600
in there

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.750
she even drag you back home, there she
goes she just doesn't stop pull pull

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.379
pull

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.289
choo choo choo it was a nightmare. Let me
show you a simple way

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.739
of correcting this behavior. As always
the key to everything

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.700
was gaining Ruby's trust and respect and
I did that

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.210
through implementing in putting in place
those five golden dog training rules

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.590
here is a little trick that helped
establish a little bit more respect on

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.220
the walk.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.430
One very simple way of getting her to
change behavior

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.570
is to put a little chain through her
collar

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.790
and so that the first foot-and-a-half of
her leash is now a chain

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.100
but she still has a soft little fabric
collar.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.810
Now Ruby still free to jump up into the
chain if she wants to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.880
it's her choice there's going to be no
shouting or

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:43.610
pulling on the lead we're gonna let her
change her own behavior

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.060
on her own free will. As you can see here

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.510
she thinks about it she has a look he
says I think I'll try and jump up and

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.190
get the lead

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.850
she has just one good jump there you go tries to
get it

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.850
she can reach it she says fine as quick
as that.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.190
Now she's a changed dog she's not gonna
bother chewing the chain anymore

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.680
she just gonna walk nice and sensibly
perfect

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.200
as you can see very soon she was walking
perfectly by my side

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.570
happy to walk behind me very loose leash
and she's not chewing it.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.660
And here we are on the way back home
still a very loose leash

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.950
and remember this is outside we're not
in the garden anymore far more

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.860
distractions but she's perfect.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.970
And one she's changed her behavior

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.510
we can revert back to the old leash, no
chain required

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.940
it was a temporary training tool. By
putting in place the five golden rules

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:36.920
of the pack leader

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.440
I gained ambers immediate respect, she
knew she could trust me

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.070
and should follow me and so walking
nicely on the leash by my side

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.510
made perfect sense

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.500
How simple is that?
