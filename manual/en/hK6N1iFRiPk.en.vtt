00:00:00.091 --> 00:00:04.024
The President:
I just want to say a few words about two milestones that have

00:00:04.024 --> 00:00:06.991
passed in the last few hours
that represent encouraging

00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:09.325
progress for our country.

00:00:09.325 --> 00:00:13.258
The first was the historic vote
the House took last night on

00:00:13.258 --> 00:00:15.224
health insurance reform.

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:18.124
For years we've been told
that this couldn't be done.

00:00:18.124 --> 00:00:21.291
After all, neither chamber of
Congress has been able to pass a

00:00:21.291 --> 00:00:25.525
comprehensive health insurance
reform bill for generations.

00:00:25.525 --> 00:00:28.958
But last night the House
proved differently.

00:00:28.958 --> 00:00:32.191
The Affordable Health Care
for America Act is a piece of

00:00:32.191 --> 00:00:34.558
legislation that will provide
stability and security for

00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:36.858
Americans who have
insurance; quality,

00:00:36.858 --> 00:00:39.024
affordable options
for those who don't;

00:00:39.024 --> 00:00:41.124
and bring down the cost of
health care for families,

00:00:41.124 --> 00:00:44.525
businesses, and our government,
while strengthening the

00:00:44.525 --> 00:00:46.792
financial health of Medicare.

00:00:46.792 --> 00:00:49.658
It is legislation that is fully
paid for and it will reduce our

00:00:49.658 --> 00:00:52.792
long-term federal deficit.

00:00:52.792 --> 00:00:55.725
Given the heated and often
misleading rhetoric surrounding

00:00:55.725 --> 00:00:58.692
this legislation I know that
this was a courageous vote for

00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:02.491
many members of Congress, and
I'm grateful to them and for the

00:01:02.491 --> 00:01:07.191
rest of their colleagues
for taking us this far.

00:01:07.191 --> 00:01:10.158
But more importantly, so are
the millions of Americans whose

00:01:10.158 --> 00:01:14.024
lives will change when we
achieve insurance reform --

00:01:14.024 --> 00:01:17.825
families with preexisting
conditions who will finally have

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:21.958
insurance coverage; parents who
will be protected from annual

00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:24.792
and lifetime limits that can
force them to pay exorbitant

00:01:24.792 --> 00:01:27.858
out-of-pocket costs
for a child's illness;

00:01:27.858 --> 00:01:29.758
small businesses that will
finally be able to cover their

00:01:29.758 --> 00:01:33.892
employees; and working folks who
will finally be able to afford

00:01:33.892 --> 00:01:36.858
health insurance for
the very first time.

00:01:36.858 --> 00:01:40.758
Americans like Katie Gibson, a
cancer survivor from Bozeman,

00:01:40.758 --> 00:01:44.258
Montana, who shared her
story with me this summer.

00:01:44.258 --> 00:01:47.291
Because of a medical condition
Katie's insurance policy was

00:01:47.291 --> 00:01:49.758
suddenly revoked when
she needed it most,

00:01:49.758 --> 00:01:51.892
even though she was
paying her premiums.

00:01:51.892 --> 00:01:54.892
I called Katie this morning and
I told her that when the bill

00:01:54.892 --> 00:01:57.991
that passed last night becomes
law we'll be able to protect

00:01:57.991 --> 00:02:00.825
Americans just like her from
the kinds of insurance company

00:02:00.825 --> 00:02:02.958
abuses she had to endure.

00:02:02.958 --> 00:02:05.658
And I told her that it was
because of her willingness to

00:02:05.658 --> 00:02:10.558
share her story and the
extraordinary activism that she

00:02:10.558 --> 00:02:14.658
and people like her all across
the country displayed --

00:02:14.658 --> 00:02:18.191
not just this year, but over
the last several years --

00:02:18.191 --> 00:02:22.124
that we are finally this
close to getting reform done.

00:02:22.124 --> 00:02:25.391
Their lives are what's
at stake in this debate,

00:02:25.391 --> 00:02:28.391
and moments like this are
why they sent us here --

00:02:28.391 --> 00:02:31.158
to finally meet the challenges
that Washington has put off for

00:02:31.158 --> 00:02:35.091
decades; to make their lives
better and this nation stronger;

00:02:35.091 --> 00:02:37.024
to move America forward.

00:02:37.024 --> 00:02:40.792
That's what the House did last
night when it brought us closer

00:02:40.792 --> 00:02:43.591
than we have ever been to
comprehensive health insurance

00:02:43.591 --> 00:02:45.491
reform in America.

00:02:45.491 --> 00:02:49.191
Now it falls on the United
States Senate to take the baton

00:02:49.191 --> 00:02:51.692
and bring this effort to the
finish line on behalf of the

00:02:51.692 --> 00:02:53.024
American people.

00:02:53.024 --> 00:02:55.558
And I'm absolutely
confident that they will.

00:02:55.558 --> 00:02:59.391
I'm equally convinced that on
the day that we gather here at

00:02:59.391 --> 00:03:02.291
the White House and I sign
comprehensive health insurance

00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:05.458
reform legislation into law,
they'll be able to join their

00:03:05.458 --> 00:03:08.658
House colleagues and say that
this was their finest moment in

00:03:08.658 --> 00:03:12.825
public service -- the moment we delivered change we promised to

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:15.625
the American people and did something to leave this country

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:18.325
stronger than we found it.

00:03:18.325 --> 00:03:21.191
The second development I want
to mention is a significant

00:03:21.191 --> 00:03:24.658
breakthrough in Iraq, where
Iraq's parliament has approved a

00:03:24.658 --> 00:03:29.358
new election law that paves the
way for national elections early next year.

00:03:29.358 --> 00:03:32.391
This is an important milestone
as the Iraqi people continue to

00:03:32.391 --> 00:03:35.625
take responsibility
for their future.

00:03:35.625 --> 00:03:38.658
I want to congratulate Iraq's
leaders for reaching this agreement.

00:03:38.658 --> 00:03:41.258
Their flexibility and commitment
to their country sends an

00:03:41.258 --> 00:03:44.491
important signal to the world
about Iraq's democracy and

00:03:44.491 --> 00:03:45.692
national unity.

00:03:45.692 --> 00:03:50.024
And I look forward to prompt
approval of this law by Iraq's

00:03:50.024 --> 00:03:51.991
Presidency Council.

00:03:51.991 --> 00:03:55.091
Iraq has known many challenges,
and in the past several weeks

00:03:55.091 --> 00:03:58.224
we've seen that there are still
those who would kill innocent

00:03:58.224 --> 00:04:04.358
men, women and children to deny
the Iraqi people the future they deserve.

00:04:04.358 --> 00:04:06.925
Today's step forward is another
reminder that these enemies of

00:04:06.925 --> 00:04:09.491
the Iraqi people will fail.

00:04:09.491 --> 00:04:12.124
The United States will continue
to stand with Iraq as a strong

00:04:12.124 --> 00:04:14.391
partner and as a friend.

00:04:14.391 --> 00:04:16.291
Tough challenges remain and
I'm sure that there will be

00:04:16.291 --> 00:04:18.191
difficult days to come.

00:04:18.191 --> 00:04:21.458
But this agreement advances
the political progress that can

00:04:21.458 --> 00:04:23.892
bring lasting peace
and unity to Iraq,

00:04:23.892 --> 00:04:27.958
and allow for the orderly
and responsible transition of

00:04:27.958 --> 00:04:32.558
American combat troops out
of Iraq by next September.

00:04:32.558 --> 00:04:35.291
So I want to congratulate our
troops and civilians who are

00:04:35.291 --> 00:04:38.958
serving so capably in Iraq, and
I want to congratulate the Iraqi

00:04:38.958 --> 00:04:42.091
people who have taken an
important step forward in

00:04:42.091 --> 00:04:43.858
pursuit of a better future.

00:04:43.858 --> 00:04:45.491
There's much more
work to be done,

00:04:45.491 --> 00:04:47.825
but with today's news we're
continuing to move in the right

00:04:47.825 --> 00:04:52.991
direction as we continue to look
forward to Iraqi elections early next year.

00:04:52.991 --> 00:04:54.124
Thank you very much.
