00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:02.460
Rome.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.580
Alright, I’m going to stop myself right
there.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.130
Let’s not even try to pretend that I’m
trying to pretend that I’m Anthony Bourdain.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.100
There’s only one Anthony Bourdain, and there’s
only one cacio e pepe.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:16.760
In the Rome episode of “No Reseverations,”
Anthony Bourdain describes Rome as the one

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.330
shot in films from the 1960s, often in black
and white. For me, Rome is an ancient city

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.270
where the ruins are now gravestones to gladiators
and the Roman people, a mecca for Catholicsm

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.029
and the soul of a dead language I wished I
paid attention more in school.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.289
Two years ago, I was visiting a friend who
is getting his PH.D. in Rome. I asked him

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:37.730
to skip the touristy and show me the Roman
way. To my delight, he said, “Do you know

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.600
of Anthony Bourdain? Because I think I found
Restaurant X.”

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.649
Cacio e pepe. Cheese and pepper. So simple
and yet so delightful. It’s the adult version

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:48.870
of mac and cheese and it’s just as simple
to make.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.690
To start off, boil fresh spaghetti. Remove
the al dente pasta and save the water because

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.129
who have thought that pasta water would make
great pasta sauce. The Italians knew of course.

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:02.320
Melted butter, pasta water and fresh cracked
pepper. Now here comes the fun. The spaghetti

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.110
is tossed in so it can soak up the juiciness.
Finally, the beautiful pecorino cheese gracefully

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.280
dances on top of the pasta. As the spaghetti
and the pecorino are mixed together, you can

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.920
see cheese slowly melts and making love with
the pasta in the most sexiest way possible.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.900
But oh no, the love making doesn’t happen
in the pan. That’s just foreplay. Imagine

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.780
this: a bowl made from fresh parmesan cheese.
That’s the bed. Now add the two lovers on

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.909
top. Use your imagination however you want,

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.439
but remember, this move is called cacio e
pepe.

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:36.530
It all finishes with the first taste in your
mouth: an explosion of bliss.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:40.960
Anthony Bourdain said, “There’s good cacio
e pepe, adequate cacio e pepe and everything

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:41.470
else.”

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.930
See this, this is adequate, and I’ve been
to Restaurant X. That was good cacio e pepe.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.869
This is my homage to it. The pasta that changed
my life.

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:54.560
Until you make it to Rome and find Restaurant
X, this will have to do.
