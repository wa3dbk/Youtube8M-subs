00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.080
On behalf of Expert Village, I'm Terry, and
I'm here to tell you today about building

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:10.020
a wrought iron fence. Here I'm going to show
you two types of welding, downhill, and uphill.

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:15.830
Uphill is usually done for strength. Downhill
is not as strong, but it's faster, and if

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.150
you're working on thinner material, then you
don't burn in quite as long, and you can lay

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.289
a bead much quicker. Going uphill you have
to move it a lot faster. Right now I'm going

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:34.730
to show you downhill though. Making in a circular
motion while you're going down. No need to

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.660
preheat because the bead wants to go ahead
of you anyway. Okay, I kept my nozzle pointed

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.690
up because I'm trying to push that up to keep
it from going down. If I was to go down, it

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:51.730
would obviously lay in a lot less material.
You wouldn't have near as much material laying

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:57.030
in there. So your nozzle wants to go up at
a forty-five degree. I'm ambidextrous so I

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.300
can weld with either hand, upside down. Some
people, this just feels really weird. They

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.690
think they have to get in here and go like
this. Well obviously things are in my way

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:19.770
so you have to be adaptable to where you can
weld in any position. That's a downhill weld.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:26.860
Now I'm going to go with uphill weld. On an
uphill weld you also want to do the horseshoe

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.420
effect, or you can do the zero effect. Now,
the weld's not going to look like this. It's

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.450
going to be high in the center because you're
going to be passing over the same place twice

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.280
and it just, it lays in more material. But
you have to move faster. If you point your

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:50.470
nozzle upward, like I did the first time,
see how fast I'm moving the nozzle, I'm having

00:01:50.470 --> 00:02:07.860
to really stay going. It's not too bad of
a weld. Let me touch on cleaning real quick.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:16.580
Keeping your nozzle clean, and free of what
we call dill berries or dingle berries, won't

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:38.730
ground out your nozzle, won't ground out your
cone to your wire tip. See, much better looking

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.709
weld. Now what would happen if I was pointing
down and trying to follow it up? It would

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:54.720
ground out way too much, it would look like
a bit old bugger on there. See how it's mounted

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:03.400
up in the middle? It's virtually flat. That's
what the mig weld would do. Stick welding

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.060
is a little more, is a little more complicated,
of course because you have to work your rod

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.620
back and forth. With a mig welder that's all
you need for building a basic project.
