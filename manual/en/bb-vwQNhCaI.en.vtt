00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:36.960
Whoever put the terms Dynasty Warriors and
Advance together either had a sick sense of

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.120
humor, or wasn't paying attention at all.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:45.979
Don't they know that the Koei and Omega Force-conceived
hack-and-slash series that has gained quite

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:50.250
the cult following never changes?

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.390
It's a franchise that has beaten the search
and destroy horse to the grave and back.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:07.420
But dammit, I can't get over it.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.000
Even though Nintendo published this combination
piece movement and beat-em-up featuring a

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.100
slew of Chinese generals from the Romance
of the Three Kingdoms era, the consummate

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.220
Dynasty Warriors fan knows that Nintendo probably
had very little to do with it and probably

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.170
only published it because they were out of
Pokemon or Final Fantasy rehash deals.

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:35.490
So here we are with this barely and probably
unnecessarily tactical version of the semi-beloved

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.840
Dynasty Warriors series.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.729
What stands out the most?

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.770
I'd have to say it's the super deformed character
sprites that will make fans of Lu Bu and Zhang

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.840
Fei go “aww, look at the cute widdle generals
and their toothpick weapons!”

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.950
Kind of like any Puzzle Fighter game where
the characters look like toddlers.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.159
The cuteness, however, gives way to the familiar
weapon-based action on which the Dynasty Warriors

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.460
series builds its foundation.

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.870
It's much of the same: regular attacks, musou
and charge attacks, special abilities, but

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.450
dammit if I can't jump up and pound the ground,
stunning an entire battalion of Yellow Turbans.

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:24.450
Unfortunately, the turn-based, boardgame-like
structure of Dynasty Warriors Advance takes

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.629
away from what the second up until modern-day
versions have to offer.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:33.989
Instead of going up against the entire army
or at the very least a group of two hundred

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:40.930
soldiers all at once, DW Advance feeds you
small bite by small bite, as you attack groups

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:48.260
of archers, swordsmen, and go face to face
with generals of the Wei, Wu, or Shu.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:51.870
The quicker you wipe out your opponents, the
better of a result you will get.

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.590
A Triumph is achieved when you win the battle
before the clock on the top right runs out,

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:03.659
as opposed to a regular victory when the numbers
are red, or worse, a Close Call when the clock

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:07.579
has run out completely and is colored purple.

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:11.640
The element that I love most about Dynasty
Warriors that goes beyond gameplay is the

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.230
driving heavy metal soundtrack.

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:19.260
Of course, you aren't playing on a DVD disc
and instead are on a GBA cart, but I still

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.519
say the unification of China is best achieved
with better musical production.

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:37.389
Let me tell you something folks.

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:44.249
Even though Dynasty Warriors is poorly received
by most, those people are missing the point.

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:49.579
Anyone who seriously tries to look for something
deeper than contrived dialogue or repetitive,

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.739
button-mashing action is seriously delusional.

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.780
If you think anything is gonna change, forget
about it.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.400
Koei knows what their fans want, and as long
as those loyal consumers keep buying up the

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.169
next title and the next title and the next
title, nothing needs to be changed.

00:04:06.169 --> 00:04:11.239
So, if you are one of those fans, give Dynasty
Warriors Advance a try.

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:17.519
You'll definitely appreciate cute sprite animations,
small groups of equally cute opponents to

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:23.380
fight, and the fact that Lu Bu is still the
baddest mother**** in the entire history of

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.690
China.
