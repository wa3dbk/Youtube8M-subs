CADRY: Hello.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.720
I'm Cadry, and today I'm going to tell you
how to make a cashew kale smoothie.

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.549
Many times when people want to make a green
smoothie, they think that they have to have

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.330
a high speed blender to break down those fibrous
walls.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.900
But actually with a few tricks even a person
who has just an ordinary blender can make

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.810
their green smoothie dreams come true.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.820
Speaking of dreams, it's always been a dream
of mine to have a certain special guest on

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.419
the show.

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:33.300
And today that dream is coming true.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.150
You might be familiar with him, but if not,
I can't wait for you to meet him.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.150
His name...

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:40.079
Well, let him introduce himself.

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.829
GULP: [ROARS]

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:48.329
CADRY: Well, Gulp, it is a real treat to have
you on the show.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.011
It's something that I've thought about for
many years, and I'm sure all of you out there

00:00:52.011 --> 00:00:54.670
are probably long-time fans of Gulp.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.179
Long time fan, first time having you on the
show.

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:03.280
I think that you're going to love this cashew
kale smoothie, because it's super filling.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.730
It's like great for breakfast.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.200
It's great for a mid-afternoon snack.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.730
And I know you, you've got a big appetite.

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:11.000
GULP: [ROARS IN AGREEMENT]

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.830
CADRY: You may not have always been a fan
of kale, but actually it's very nutrient dense.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.520
It has vitamins A, C, K.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.330
It's high in iron and calcium.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.270
And it has folate.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.030
It's just, it's really good for you.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.280
GULP: [ROARS IN DISGUST]

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.400
CADRY: Oh.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.200
Well, yeah, yeah, some people think it's bitter,
and it can take a little bit of getting used

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.520
to but not in a smoothie.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.780
Because actually it's so sweet from having
frozen bananas, and also creamy cashews, and

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:51.130
this full-bodied quality from ground flaxseed
that all of that bitterness kind of floats

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.240
away.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:58.730
And Gulp, in your honor instead of using curly
kale, which is what I typically use for this

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:08.030
smoothie, I'm going to use lacinato kale!

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.050
You know, dinosaur kale?

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.720
Yeah, so it's gonna be really good.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.490
Yeah, you're gonna like it.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.490
Okay.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.840
Well, Gulp, are you ready to get started?

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.299
GULP: [ROARS]

00:02:19.299 --> 00:02:23.719
CADRY: So the first thing that we'll have
to do is freeze chunks of bananas.

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:29.000
Now it's really important that you don't skip
this step, because frozen bananas give a smoothie

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.330
such a nice, creamy, full quality that's almost
reminiscent of ice cream.

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:34.980
GULP: [ROARS INQUISITIVELY]

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.739
CADRY: Well, non-dairy, of course.

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:38.739
Gulp.

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:39.950
GULP: [ROARS HAPPILY]

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:46.680
CADRY: So first I like to peel the banana
and then put it into chunks of five.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.799
That way if later on I want only one banana,
or two, or however many then I know for each

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.510
group of five that I have one banana.

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:57.760
So here we go.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:01.510
1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.379
And then just go ahead and cover these and
pop them in the freezer.

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.650
Let them get nice and frozen.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:14.030
So the key to making a really smooth smoothie
in a non-high speed blender is blending the

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.609
greens first.

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:20.700
Otherwise, when you're drinking it if you
try to blend it all at once, you're gonna

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.659
have chunks of kale or collards in the smoothie
with you.

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:26.870
And that's just not nearly as appetizing.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:34.930
So first things first, we'll put in four leaves
of kale.

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:40.030
At the end you want to have about three and
a half or four cups of greens, which generally

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.730
is about four or five leaves.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.190
You won't need to put the stems into the smoothie.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.040
You can go ahead and juice those or compost
them.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.969
Next we'll put in 3/4 cup of non-dairy milk.

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:55.560
My favorite for this is vanilla soy milk,
but you could also use rice, or almond, or

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:05.109
oat, or even water is just fine.

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.519
And then we let this blend.

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:22.880
You'll need to stop it occasionally, and stir,
and just help the blender out.

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:25.220
Next we're going to blend cashews and flaxseeds.

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.400
Gulp, maybe you can help with this!

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.000
GULP: [ROARS ENTHUSIASTICALLY]

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.720
CADRY: Gulp, here I have a heaping third cup
of raw cashews and two tablespoons of whole

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.760
flaxseed.

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.020
Would you mind smashing them for me?

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.640
Oh, thanks.

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:44.450
Okay.

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:49.880
Oh, thank you.

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:54.600
So in case you're not friends with a dinosaur
to help you out with that step, here's what

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.660
else you can do.

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:57.950
You can use a coffee grinder.

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:12.310
Just take your raw cashews, put those in,
and two tablespoons of flaxseed, and grind

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.450
them until they're like a flour.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:21.980
Now we'll just put those in.

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:28.250
Oh, and if you don't have access to a coffee
grinder or a dinosaur, you can just soak the

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:32.510
raw cashews for about eight to twelve hours
until they're soft, put them directly in the

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.410
blender, and then buy ground flaxseed and
use that instead.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:44.390
So I have my bananas that are fully frozen
in chunks.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:53.840
And I'll add in those three frozen bananas
into the smoothie.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:58.310
Add the top and blend.

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:05.200
So at this point it's nice and creamy and
fully blended.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:31.880
And then I like to add in six ice cubes for
a little icy crunch.

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:36.360
Drink up, Gulp!

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:39.890
Wow, he really likes it!

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:40.970
GULP: [ROARS HAPPILY]

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:45.690
CADRY: All right, well, a big thank you to
my big friend, Gulp.

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.750
And I hope to see you all back here again
soon at Cadry's Kitchen!

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:49.750
Thanks!
