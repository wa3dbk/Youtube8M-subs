00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
What's goin on you guys TechStupid bringing you the latest release of the iMac just a few weeks before.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The new model comes with the latest Intel Hanswell processor speedy wireless internet capabilities 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and improved graphical performance 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
so this model unboxing currently goes for 1499 which come with the following specs.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
It has a 21.5 inch LED back-lit display rocking a 1920 by 1080p

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
it runs on a 2.8Ghz quad core intel i5 processor with turbo boost to 3.6Ghz

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It also has 8gigs of ram

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
and 1 terabyte of hard drive space

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and also this baby even has Nvidia Geforce GTX 750m with 1 gig of memory

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Alrighty! enough of these specs portion and now let's move on to the unboxing.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.000
So here you have it the newest release of iMac from apple

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000
one of the things that I love about iMac unlike PC it has everything on display.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:34.000
On the top of the screen you have your 720p HD front facing camera along with you ambient light sensors.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000
On the back side you will find all the necessary ports on the same side.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I felt really inconvenient when the usb ports were situated behind the iMac

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
but after getting used to the mac for a while you'll be okay with it.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000
First stop you have your headphone jack then the SD card slot

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000
4 usb 3.0, 2 thunderbolt ports and the Ethernet port if you choose to connect your cable 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:07.000
on the opposite side you'll find your power button in between of all these 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
is where you will plug in you power chord.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000
The iMac also has a papered edge measuring 5mm at its thinnest point

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000
giving me the look and feel of a very thin surface

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:43.000
also in the back of the iMac is where the two microphones are located

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:48.000
the first one is located on top of the apple logo that is used for noise cancelation 

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
and on top of the display is where the actual mic is located which is for input.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.000
I love the specs on it and the 21.5 inch display is ridiculous

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
you can feed a lot of stuff into that screen making multi-tasking very easy job.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.000
The video card is also a huge plus

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000
if you're like me who edit videos you can definitely benefit from that.

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:18.000
I have always been a pc guy and haven't paid much attention to apple products besides their iPhone 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.000
but after playing around with this I can see why iMac are being really popular

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000
price may be really high but I'm assure you all get what you pay for.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:32.000
Overall it seems like a very solid desktop.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000
So what kind of person are you guys? PC, iMac or both

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
let me know on the comment section down below 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I believe there are huge benefits from both sides.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
That will do for the unboxing and overview of the new iMac desktop 

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
