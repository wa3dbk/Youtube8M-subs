00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.350
In this video i wanted to tell you about a
simple thing that you can do to help to

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.549
save time while creating your online
music business

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.939
This is something that I do it and
recommend to my clients as well

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:18.890
What you call it is up to you but
i like to call it your stash.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:25.789
Keep watching and I'll tell you all
about it.

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:29.289
This is about getting organized with a
simple tool that I like to call -

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.539
Your Stash

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.800
Tthis is just a handy place to keep
important information.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.230
When creating your online music business
you will be signing up for all kinds of

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.750
sites and services.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.190
For example when you get your domain
name you'll sign up with a domain registrar

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.040
and you will get a login password for
that.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.440
You will sign up for web hosting.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:51.840
You'll get a login and password for that as well
you will also need a video hosting account

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.780
which comes of course with a login and
password

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.730
Promoting affiliate products and
other sites and services the more sites

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.260
and services the more

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.280
techniques that i show you that you
employ the more such data you're going

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.790
to accumulate.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.420
So your staff can range from a
spreadsheet to simple text editor

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.430
I like to use a spreadsheet because it
allows me to sort the information to keep

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.050
things more organized.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.440
Now the types information you want to
put in your staff would be the URL of

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:22.870
the website

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.170
your username your password

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.380
and a note or description that helps
you know what the information's all

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.740
about

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.250
So keep your stash on the computer where
you're going to be doing most of your

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.150
work so you can get to the information
quickly and do simple copy and paste into

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.170
the text boxes of the website you are going to.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.180
Let's keep it is simple, save the most
time so you have time to get on the more

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.380
important things

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.800
like your music.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.290
So your stash is just a simple way to save
time and money.

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.740
Searching around for scraps of paper or old emails for login information that's

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.210
just a big waste of time

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.720
if you're serious about creating your
own online music business

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.840
then create your own stash.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.440
So final word

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.320
if you have a question or comment

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.719
just leave a message below or shoot
me an email at george at ebusk.com

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:13.969
