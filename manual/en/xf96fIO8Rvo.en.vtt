00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:01.190
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.800
I’m Susie and welcome back to readsusieread.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.970
Probably by the time you see this video February
will be half over, but as of today I have

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.970
yet to read anything.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.190
So I think that means it’s okay for me that
I share with you the books I might read in

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.910
the remaining weeks of February.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.950
I have so many books checked out from the
library and on my personal shelves at home

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.840
that I’m dying to read.

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:24.720
But considering my reading habits as of late,
I optimistically chose five books and one

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.590
audiobook to show you today.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.260
My first four books I have here are my picks
for the #ReadSoulLit project, which is a part

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.519
video project, part photo challenge, and part
call-to-arms created by Didi from FrenchieDee

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:38.710
in celebration of Black History Month.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:43.420
The month of February in Canada and the United
States is Black History month, which means

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.120
it is set aside to remember, honor, and celebrate
important events and people in the history

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:50.510
of African diaspora.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.129
On Twitter, Danielle from OneSmallPaw in conjunction
with Wikipedia helped me better understand

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.010
Black History Month and African diaspora.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.589
In case you were wondering, as I was, African
diaspora (to the best of my understanding,

00:01:03.589 --> 00:01:07.720
correct me if I’m wrong) refers to groups
of people of African descent who have been

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.810
disbursed against their will to other continents.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.890
If I read anything this month it will be one
of the #ReadSoulLit picks.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.030
So let’s get to the books.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.390
I am currently subscribed to Audible so this
month I used my credit to get Their Eyes Were

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.390
Watching God by Zora Neale Hurston.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.500
I have this book on my kindle and started
reading it a few months ago, but it is written

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.580
in a dialect that I find kind of difficult
to understand so I’m really looking forward

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.740
to listening to the audiobook while reading
it on my Kindle.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.650
This is a classic piece of literature that
to my understanding deals with marital expectations,

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.330
self-realization, and so much more.

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.810
I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings by Maya Angelou,
this was supposed to be a buddy read with

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.610
friends Max and Karina, but I believe they’ve
already started reading or finished reading.

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:50.660
But this is one I’ve meant to read for ages.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.350
It is a memoir of Angelou’s young life,
where she deals with prejudice, abandonment,

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:59.540
self love, and discovering a love for authors.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.920
Next we have Family by J. California Cooper,
I picked this book up off of the recommendation

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.100
of Stephen from SteveReadsBooks, who did an
excellent video talking about this book so

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.590
if you haven’t seen that video I highly
recommend you check it out.

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.650
This recommendation was also seconded by Andi
from EstallasRevenge on Twitter.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.640
It is a generational family story told from
the perspective of an enslaved woman named

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:21.640
Always.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.490
I’ve read a few pages of this book while
I waiting in a drive thru of a fast food restaurant

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.000
and it was absolutely captivating.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.060
And I just need to find the time to sit down
and commit to it.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.880
The Color Purple by Alice Walker is an epistolary
novel about African American women growing

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.230
up in rural Georgia.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.440
This is a highly recommended and beloved book
that I’ve heard nothing but good things

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:44.440
about.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.870
And I have a deep seeded love for epistolary
novels so again I just need to sit down and

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:49.930
commit to it.

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:55.170
Onto my non-#ReadSoulLit books - Americanah
by Chimanda Ngozi Adiche.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.391
This is the pick for the Blank Space Book
Club, which I am so gratefully a part of.

00:02:59.391 --> 00:03:01.810
I will leave a link to the goodreads group
down below.

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.349
We are just getting started, so come on and
join us if you’d like.

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:07.520
I’m sure that you’ve heard or seen this
book.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:08.560
It has been everywhere.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.820
And I have no doubts that I will enjoy it.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.880
The last book on the list is The Orenda by
Joseph Boyden.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:16.860
This is another hopeful buddy read with Max
from Welldonebooks.

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:22.470
He was so kind and pre-ordered this beautiful
floppy paperback edition for me for Christmas.

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.319
An old friend of mine raved about this book
and I’ve been meaning to read it ever since.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:30.620
It is written by a Canadian author and tells
the stories of two tribes that have been in

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.680
conflict for generations.

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.620
Hopefully you’ll see some of these in my
February wrap up.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:35.620
Fingers crossed.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.270
As always please feel free to share your thoughts
on any of the books I mentioned here today

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.270
in the comments below.

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:43.410
Thank you so much for watching and I hope
to see you soon with a new video.

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.600
Bye!
