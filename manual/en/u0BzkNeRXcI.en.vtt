&gt;&gt;William Haynes: Welcome back to SourceFed. I'm William Haynes.

00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:02.140
&gt;&gt;Reina Scully: I'm Reina Scully.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.700
Will: We're going to talk about Harry Potter because you always should.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.700
Will: Harry 
Potter a series of books and films that’ve
brought us things like Professor Dumbledore,

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:15.520
Severus Snape and most importantly my OTP
Hermione Granger.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.240
Reina: A study was recently done in the Journal
of Applied Social Psychology that shows that

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.690
reading the Harry Potter series greatly improved
young peoples’ consciousness of groups that

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.050
are often stigmatized. People including immigrants,
homosxuals and refugees.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.180
Will: That’s because everybody in Harry Potter
is a stigmatized person. Look at Ronald Wesley

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.370
and listen to the things he says for 10 seconds
and tell me you don’t feel like stigmatizing

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.040
the crap out of him. Cause I do.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.560
Reina: In the study 34 Italian fifth graders were
put into a 6 week course of the wizardly tales.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.430
Will: The researchers also started by having
the students complete a questionnaire on immigrants.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.630
Kids are great for things like this because
they do not know when to not say things

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.910
because they do that all the time. Kids love
honesty.

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:53.489
Reina: After the questionnaire the researchers
divided them into two groups, which began

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.260
to read specific passages from the series.

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.989
Will: I hope it’s the part where Harry yells
“The scar! It burns! Hermione should be

00:00:58.989 --> 00:00:59.969
MY girl friend.”

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.350
Reina: I don’t remember that part.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.610
Will: Tell them about the study.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.610
Reina: The first group of students talked about
prejudice and bigotry, which are essential

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:09.370
themes in the books. For instance when Malfoy
said things like:

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:12.610
Will: “No one asked your opinion, you filthy
little Mudblood.”

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:14.090
Reina: What he’s basically saying is:

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.570
Will: “I hate people who are different than
me racially speaking.”

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.250
Reina: The second group of students in the control
group didn’t read those passages and after

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.630
time showed what the researchers are calling
“improved attitudes towards immigrants”

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:27.850
but only the students who found themselves
identifying with Potter felt that way.

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:31.590
Will: Another study was done with 117 Italian
high school students and discovered that the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.100
their emotional identification with Harry
was connected with a more positive understanding

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.260
of the LGBT community.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.670
Reina: Strangely a third study which surveyed
U.K COLLEGE students found no relation linking

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.560
an emotional bond with Harry and perceptions
of stigmatized communities. It did find that

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.060
students who found themselves with less of
an emotional identification with Voldemort

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.689
were found with “improved attitudes towards
refugees.”

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.810
Will: That’s probably because Voldemort is
evil. I would like to firmly state to the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.630
conclusion of this study my humble opinon
of: duh. Harry Potter is like the bible in

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:02.549
my family. My middle name is James just like
Harry. My father’s name is James just like

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.590
Harry. A dude tried to kill me when I was
a baby just like Harry. I have a scar on my

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.900
forehead just like Harry. And that’s why
I’m not racist. But I am sexist. Go clean someting.

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:14.080
Reina: It all makes sense now. Are there any books
or forms of storytelling that’ve helped

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.700
shape you into a good person or a bad person?

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.740
Will: Will you be prepared when the dark lord
returns once more? Let us know in the comments down below.

Will: You're my patronus.
