00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.099
Funny story.

00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:03.360
The other day I was buffing my new couch,
one of my favorite things to do because I

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.230
always find leftover food between the cushions.

00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.750
This time I found falafel.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:07.930
And some lentil soup.

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.540
But then I found one of my exploding pens.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.820
It's a good thing I managed...

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:12.820
Oh, that's right.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:13.820
That was five minutes ago.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.730
I still haven't finished my lentil soup.

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:19.710
Wheezy Waiter
I got schmutz...

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.539
I got schmutz on me.

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:24.580
Now listen very closely, alright, because
I'm gonna be discreet about it.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.110
Today is Wednesday, Wednesday, Explosion Wednesday.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.010
Were you paying attention?

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.330
Every Wednesday we talk about things explosion-related.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.920
At least we're testing it out to see if we
want to make it a permanent fixture in the

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.920
Wheezy repertoi-ah.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.920
Whoa!

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:36.920
Did an explosion just happen?

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.629
Ah, I was saying French words again.

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:39.629
Bonjou-ah!

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:40.629
Ratatoui-ah!

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:41.629
The Tou-ah de France.

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:42.629
Honh honh honh.

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:43.629
Sorry.

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:44.920
Anyway, in explosion news, Tabata: SCORCH
calories without a time commitment.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.249
Everyone's all about being healthy and saving
time these days.

00:00:47.249 --> 00:00:50.780
Well, if saving time's your only goal, I got
you covered.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:51.780
Observe.

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:52.780
Excuse
me.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:53.780
Two birds one stone.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.780
Boom.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.780
Time saved.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.780
Anyway, what is this Tabata crap?

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.269
Apparently it's a cycle of 20 seconds of high
intensity activity followed by ten seconds

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:00.440
of rest for four minutes.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.589
Whatever activity is up to you.

00:01:01.589 --> 00:01:03.449
I think my activity will be saying Tabata.

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:08.360
Tabata Tabata Tabata Tabata Tabata Tabata
Tabata Taba...

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.750
Tabata Tabata Tabata Tabata Tabata Tabata.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.479
And then I'll try another activity.

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:16.479
Eating.

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:17.479
Cookies!

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:19.450
I feel the calories melting away already.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.470
In other news, Catching FIRE has started SHOOTING.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.259
Catching Fire is the sequel to The Hunger
Games.

00:01:23.259 --> 00:01:25.320
Now I never saw or read The Hunger Games.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.320
That's alright.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.909
I don't need to see or read the first one
to be excited about the sequel.

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.690
I can pretty much assume what the first one's
about.

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:31.740
It was something like this.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.659
- Man, I'm so hungry I could eat a house.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:34.659
- Oh yeah?

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:35.659
I could eat two houses.

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.619
- Well, I could eat a duplex with two fat
families inside.

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:38.619
- Cannibal!

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:39.619
- Pig families.

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:40.619
- Oh.

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:41.619
Aw, I just watched Babe.

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:42.619
- The Babe Ruth movie?

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:43.619
- No, that's The Babe.

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:44.619
- Oh.

00:01:44.619 --> 00:01:46.619
I could go for a Baby Ruth right now.

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:47.619
- I could go for two.

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.740
- I wonder if there's any in the couch.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.740
Aw man.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.270
It's just a giant bag of grapes.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.270
That's mostly water.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.270
What is this?

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.270
The Thirsty Games?

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.270
Am I right?

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.270
Am I right?

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.270
- Shut up.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.270
Spot on!

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.270
With what I think happened.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:01.490
Why is everything so far in today's video
food-based?

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:03.490
I guess I shouldn't write scripts before I
eat breakfast.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.490
What's next?

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.490
Omnomnomnomnomnomnom.

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.490
Oh.

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.490
I guess I must have eaten at that point.

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:08.490
We're done with food now.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:09.490
In other news...

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:10.490
Huge EXPLOSION spotted on Jupiter.

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:11.490
Really?

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.490
That's awesome.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:13.490
Let's watch the video.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:14.490
Oh, here it comes.

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.490
Wait for it.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.490
Wait for it.

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:17.490
Uh....

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.490
What?

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:19.490
Please.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:20.490
I can do better than that.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.490
Check it out.

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:22.490
Okay, let's fullscreen this puppy.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.490
Here goes, ready?

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.490
Here it comes.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:25.490
Wait for it.

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.490
Wait for it.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.490
Ha ha ha!

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:28.490
That's better.

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:29.490
In other news...

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:30.490
Oh.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:31.490
I...

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.490
I guess we're done.

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:43.490
Wheezy Waiter
So you may have noticed that I'm wearing this

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:44.570
shirt today that says PoPS.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.570
Can you see it?

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:46.570
Here, let me get it closer.

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:47.570
PoPS.

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.570
It stands for Platoon of Power Squadron.

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.820
It's a web series that my friend makes that
I am in.

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:52.440
I shoot lightning out of my hands.

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.170
There's lots and lots of other awesome superhero
stuff.

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.000
You should check it out because the sixth
episode just came out today.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Part one.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Hey and you know what else pops?

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Explosions!

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.180
Well, I guess balloons pop too.

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.180
And bubbles.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:04.280
But this isn't Balloons and Bubbles Wednesday.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.530
This is Explosion Wednesday.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.980
Test.
