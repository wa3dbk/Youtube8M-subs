00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.320
Hello! I'm Taumich, and i'm now going to show
you how to import DOTA 2 files.

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.529
in to the 3D software called
blender.

00:00:08.529 --> 00:00:13.119
these are the programs you are going to need.
I'll link to them in the description.

00:00:13.119 --> 00:00:18.900
So let's start of by opening GCFScape... So
let's let just locate the files by...

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:19.970
going to

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:22.139
computer

00:00:22.139 --> 00:00:23.369
c:/

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.109
/programs/

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.500
/steam/

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.509
/steamapps / common/

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:31.859
/DOTA 2 Beta / Dota/

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:32.890
and then

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.030
pak01_dir

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.320
then press OK

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.780
and now, for tutorial use. I'm going to
export these files into my

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.510
tutorial file

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.420
in a sub-map called /Import/

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.720
so let's make this /Import/ map right here

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.620
Import and...

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.419
and now I'm going to direct it towards
the import file

00:00:57.419 --> 00:00:58.700
now it's starting to load

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:05.700
And this could take a while so I'll pass forward.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.670
so now it's done

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.550
so let's just go in there and go into

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:12.830
/Models / Heroes / and then...

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.290
choose /Axe/

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.070
probably the best thing to do would be
too

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.940
drag that file

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.159
Let's now make a new file called
Axe Exported

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.300
In here we will put our smd. files

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:34.460
and to get them we need the program
called the Studio Compiler

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.880
so let's just boot it up

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:39.730
let's just close those windows

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:45.860
then press here. And now im going to direct 
 it to our mdl. files

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.090
right there

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.500
the axe.mdl

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.220
and then press OK

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.930
and now we are going to chose the export location

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:57.500
so I'll just copy

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.200
the exported location and paste it

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.460
and then it starts to load...

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.110
well it won't work..

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.519
since you need to change the name

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.909
from dx90 to dx80

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.900
after changing the name it won't to be a
problem

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.669
and name changes needed

00:02:17.669 --> 00:02:23.569
since the Studio Compiler is a bit outdated
compared to DOTA 2.

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.719
So now we don't need this Studio Compiler
for this tutorial anymore so let's...

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.719
just close it

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:31.859
now we just need one thing more

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:36.309
and that's the texture. Let's create a
fast file and name it texture

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:40.219
and the texture files can be found at
/imports/

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:42.410
/root / matherials/

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:43.589
/models/

00:02:43.589 --> 00:02:47.869
/heroes/ and then... just choose Axe

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.670
and to open these files,

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:50.819
We'll need

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.439
the VTFEdit

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:56.279
so yust press open

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:58.169
Then we'll just

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.329
find these files. Copy &amp; paste here

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.349
and choose the right one

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:05.619
ops, this was the wrong one

00:03:05.619 --> 00:03:08.159
It's the Axe body color

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:13.059
And now we'll just exported i to the texture
map

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:15.140
king at the normal sound

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.590
You can get the normals and other stuff like that

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.189
It's called Axe_body.mask2 and Axe_body.normal

00:03:21.189 --> 00:03:25.829
but those things we will go through in
another clip

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:29.200
so here i have the other textures too

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.109
The body color, body mask and body normal

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.739
Ops, booted up photoshop accidentally

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:38.469
and now we must start bender

00:03:38.469 --> 00:03:41.680
so let me adjust the screen

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:47.930
and the one thing left now
is to just import the smd files of Axe

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.539
let me ask prepare for the model to

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:52.469
be shown here

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:57.599
and so now when this is fixed we can
start to import

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:01.089
the smd. file

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:02.130
right here

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:07.629
then we'll just find the files we made

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:08.839
/desktop/

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:11.499
/tutorial1/

00:04:11.499 --> 00:04:13.249
/Axe exported/

00:04:13.249 --> 00:04:16.180
and then we'll choose to biggest file

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:17.480
let's see here...

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.989
this one

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.129
so now wen he's imported, we could...

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:27.180
just tilt the camera right and

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.159
then fix his rotation

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:32.590
and that should be done by pressing his

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.789
feet bone

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.849
them pressing the "R" button

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:38.820
and then...

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.270
then "X"

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.880
and then type "90" and he'll

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:47.469
stand up

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:49.830
and that's how you import the

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.749
the DOTA 2 file into blender

00:04:52.749 --> 00:04:57.830
I'll just fast show you how it looks like with the textures on

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.369
remove the light

00:05:00.369 --> 00:05:03.199
go to one of these areas

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.239
select the image editor

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:08.749
the fastest way to do it is too

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:14.439
Right-click on him. Mark everything (with "A") and then open
up an image

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:18.279
This image will be overlapping the UV

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:21.300
And thus give him his texture look

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.729
here's the file

00:05:22.729 --> 00:05:24.910
and now it's done

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.170
i hope I've help you much which is tutorial

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:31.160
please post a comment about what the
next video should be about. Thank you for watching!

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.430
and Goodbye!
