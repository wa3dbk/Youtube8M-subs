00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:03.750
Hey guys!

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:13.230
I'm Alejandra, and I'm Caroline, and today
we're making easy peanut butter sticky buns.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.110
So this is such a fun recipe and I've made
it as easy as possible, because that's the

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.540
way I like it.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.220
We've got some great ingredients, here, some
nice brown sugar, some honey, some cinnamon,

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.330
a little salt, corn syrup, and very important,
some butter.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.510
This sauce is so good, and it's what is going
to make our sticky buns.. sticky!

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:38.219
And classic, the sugar, the cinnamon, it's
exactly what I want to be eating right now.

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.219
Exactly.

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.250
So I've got a sauce pan I'm already heating
up a little bit, and it's so easy.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.520
I'm just going to combine all of these amazing
ingredients right in this pan.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.220
We'll start off with the brown sugar, some
of that delicious honey.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.450
Oh yeah, hear that sizzle!

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:00.660
Alright, some butter, cinnamon, some corn
syrup, and our salt.

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:09.990
I'm just going to use a whisk to give this
a stir, and you really, all you want to do

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.770
is just melt that butter and sugar until you
have a nice syrup.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.570
This is going to go in the oven later, so
you don't have to worry about cooking it now.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:17.570
This looks so good.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.890
It's a nice dark brown already, even before
it gets more caramelized.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.960
Yeah, just like this amazing sticky caramel.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.810
It smells so good.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.170
I can guarantee your kitchen will smell like
this right away.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:31.290
Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.600
So this is good, and now I can pour this sauce
right into our pan.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.680
And I just get that all in there.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.560
You just want it to coat the bottom.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:48.079
And I'm using a square pan here but you can
also use a round, something kind of shallow.

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:50.850
Yeah, there we go.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.850
Perfection.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:52.970
Alright, this looks so great.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.090
And now I'm going to add some roasted salted
chopped peanuts.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.619
This is going to make those peanut butter
sticky buns even peanut buttery-er-er?

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.070
Stickier and peanut buttery-er!

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.860
Alright, fantastic, so check that out.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.509
Now we are going to work on our stick buns.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.910
So we used the refrigerated dough, you can
get at your grocery store, and you just roll

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.510
it all out to get a nice rectangle.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.420
And I'm just going to sprinkle a little bit
of flour.

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.300
And I'm using two tubes of this so they come
about standard size.

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.030
So you just roll a little bit of flour on
top just to kind of keep it from sticking.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:34.180
Then a little bit of flour onto our rolling
pin.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:38.780
And we're just going to roll it out a tiny
bit just to kind of smooth it out.

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.670
You don't want to make it much bigger than
what it is already, just smooth it out a little

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:43.670
bit.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:44.670
Perfect!

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:45.670
And now the fun part.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:53.140
So we've got here some cinnamon raisin peanut
butter, and I'm so so excited to put this

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:57.080
in here, and what's great is this is our sticky
bun filling and it's nice and easy.

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.780
You don't have to use a whole bunch of ingredients.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:00.300
It already has all the deliciousness.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.670
So I'm going to just start with a big scoop
of this right in the center.

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.440
It looks like it's been warmed.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.780
Yeah you can put it in the microwave and just
warm it up a little bit.

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.470
It just makes it easier to spread.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.340
So I'm going to put a nice big scoop in there.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.790
You can do the rest of that.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.790
Alright.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.990
And I'm just using a little spatula, or the
back of a spoon, to spread it out.

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:24.659
Just a nice thin layer.

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:29.620
And sticky buns are supposed to be a little
bit messy and sticky so don't worry too much

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:32.349
about that if it gets all over the place.

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.810
I love the raisins already in here!

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.470
It's nice, you've got like everything already
in there.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.290
You're leaving like just a little edge around
the side right?

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.870
So yeah just a little bit of an edge.

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.700
I could probably even put a little more here.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.700
Alright, awesome.

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.510
So once you have that all spread out, you
can start rolling it up.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:52.530
You're going to start with the long side and
bring it forward.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.200
So it's going to go like this about an inch
in.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.430
And then repeat.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:05.750
And just go all the way through until you
have a nice roll.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.310
There you go.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.939
Look at this, a stick bun baby.

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:12.069
Nice and gooey too, you can already tell.

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:13.069
Oh, totally.

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:15.830
So then just use a nice sharp knife, and we're
going to cut this in to about 8 pieces.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.720
I like to chop off the little ends here because
you don't need them.

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:24.580
And then here we're just going to go like
this.

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.080
Eight pieces!

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.280
Snip off these little ends here.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.250
And look how cool this looks.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:39.380
So as we roll that in you can see all that
peanut butter swirled inside with the dough.

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:40.720
Amazing!

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:44.720
So I've got our pan that we prepared earlier
with the sauce.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.610
And these just go right in, sort of with the
circle facing up.

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:52.630
Don't worry if it's not perfect, you just
kind of want to nestle them in there next

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.630
to each other.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.530
This is exactly what I want to eat for breakfast.

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:57.170
Hahaha I know.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.600
Perfect.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.030
Awesome.

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:01.460
Great.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.970
Alright so we've got these all in here.

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:08.530
Now this is going to go into a 350 degree
oven for about 20 minutes, and they'll rise

00:05:08.530 --> 00:05:09.530
up and puff and be perfect.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.889
And I also like to pop these onto a baking
sheet because there might be a little spillage.

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:17.180
So it's just going to make your life easier.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.180
Yeah!

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:19.780
Alright, so we've got these out of the oven.

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:20.780
They look awesome.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.030
Smells so good!

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:26.510
So we're going to flip these out onto a plate.

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:30.370
And hopefully, if all goes well, all that
stickiness is going to be right on top.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:32.520
So I'm going to need you to pray for me now.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.000
Yes, okay, on it.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.030
And we'll see how this works.

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:42.390
We can do this, I know we can.

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:43.390
Alright.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:45.070
You did it!

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.190
These are amazing looking.

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:52.350
These would be great to serve to a group of
friends at brunch or a big breakfast.

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:53.350
Amazing.

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:55.080
You definitely need to share these with friends.

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:56.670
So there you have it.

00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.290
Easy peanut butter sticky buns.

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:00.250
So now, the best part, taste.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:02.320
Help me pull these out.

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:03.320
Yeah.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:04.320
This looks so good.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.320
Mmmmm.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:07.880
I like tea with my sticky buns.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:09.060
Coffee please.

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:15.090
What do you think is a perfect drink to pair
with sticky buns?
