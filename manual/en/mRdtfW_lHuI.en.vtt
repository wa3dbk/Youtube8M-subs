Hah! Look, yes! Yes! Score!

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:13.800
It's Spring! The snow is gone! Now you can
see the disaster that is our front lawn again!

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:17.650
It's beautiful out. I can even like take my
hoodie off. You can even take your hoodie

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.390
off. It's very exciting. We're gonna go have
lunch at Smash Burger, with the Princess of

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:24.849
Artichokia. Then we're going to ze Walmart.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.300
It's been so long since I did this, it's like
I can't even remember how to tie my hoodie

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.300
around my waist. Yay!

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.420
Here at the Walmart. The Artichoke is with
us. Hey. And uh... Some people are just so

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:43.760
extreme... We had Smash Burger. We're talking
about insane fan reactions, like when Mommy

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.890
met Barbara Eden or the PooPourri lady and
made an idiot out of herself. Alright, here

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:51.620
we go. Walmart, running. Slow down. Okay.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:58.330
They're having buy one 50 percent -- why can
I not say that sentence? You know what I mean.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:04.559
It's buy one get one 50 percent off at Target,
so we should go to Target, but wait, I wanna

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.310
see... They have a lot of Shopkins Blind Baskets.
Oh they do? Well let's go show everyone the

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:14.990
Shopkins Blind Baskets. Also I found an Ariel.
Oh. Are you April Fooling us? Are you April

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:20.710
Fooling us? Oh my gosh, look at that, they
really do! They have Shopkins here, oh my

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:26.830
gosh! They have Shopkins! And they have LPS...
wow. Wowzers.

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.240
Oh wow, oh no, she does not have rooted eyelashes,
I am safe. I don't have to buy her.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:36.950
I want a superhero outfit for Ma Nikki.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:43.789
So much creepy baby... Oh look, Lego Elves...
They just got everything smushed together

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:46.020
in this Walmart, it's like all in one isle.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.770
See I think she's cute, but I just can't go
that way. Oh, oh, oh, and she's falling into

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.530
my hand. Oh look, they're like falling on
me now. Ah! I'm so dangerous. Wait wait wait,

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.979
I don't think we should get these dolls because
they're not on sale. Right. We'll go to Target.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.549
But Gracie seems to want to get those dolls
that are in our cart. Yeah. Okay.

00:02:04.549 --> 00:02:08.800
Oh, you're getting an outfit for your dolls
too? This is all coming out of Gracie money?

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.440
Oh yeah. And this outfit. Okay.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.920
Oh my gosh, they have Brats here, they have
Brats here, oh my God! These are the -- yeah,

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.000
these are the Fairy Tale High ones. We were
notans, but look at that, $17 for the Brats.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Oh my God, and they don't sell Brats anymore
-- no, but they're getting a reboot, so yeah.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:39.000
There's more clearance over here guys! There's
a Twilight -- Oh there's more Fairy Tale High

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:47.100
dolls. Mhmm. There's an Abbey for $15. It's
good to have a doll hunter as a friend, isn't

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:54.100
it? $19.97, that's not really... I know, she
never gets to go shopping, the Artichoke. You know.

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.260
Oh, they have the, what do you call
it. For $11, that's not bad.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:10.340
Oh, they have Mittens Fluff n Stuff for $15.
Hmm. What else is goin' on? Oh, the little

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:17.340
cheering Minnie. Wow, these Fairy Tale High
Dolls, really. 5 bucks. Wait, this one's 5

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.200
bucks and this one's 10 bucks. I'm very confused.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.680
Look at how many times this has been clearance'd.
I know, and there's one on the other side

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:28.100
that's 5 dollars. I don't get the difference.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:34.280
They have the Gazillion Bubbles gun. Oh, the
Little Live Pets. I still have to review my

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.830
Owl and Mommy. I got the Owl and the Mommy
but I forgot to review it. I have to do that.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.520
Oh, oh, do they have the Monster High hamper?
Look it, there's Monster High baskets. Look

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.810
at it, it's a little bell for your bike!

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.670
[bell noises]

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:58.670
How cute is that! I know, cause you fall.
We never really mastered the bike thing. No,

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:02.350
we learned that. Scooters, though. Scooters,
though. I like that Y Volution Scooter. So

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.920
we found these two, and then at Target they've
got like - oh wait, there were -- They had

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.610
a Holly and Poppy dolls at like -- I found
that back there. Look at you, you're like

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:14.040
a real doll hunter! I know. She's rockin'
it.

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:19.389
Oh look, it's Princess Celestia, only $13.
That's Freddy. That's Freddy. That's Freddy?

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:22.159
We call her Freddy now? Freddy even has a
guitar now. Oh my goodness.

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:26.669
While we're in here we have to see if they
stocked the Elektrokidz yet. Please? Elektrokidz?

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:27.300
Please?

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:33.340
No, they'll have it. They'll have it. Have
faith. Have faith. Have courage, and be kind.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.819
Do we have any Elektrokidz, while I'm - I'm
getting frustrated because I can't find a

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:44.819
superhero costume to put on Nikki. It's really
annoying me right now. There's some pony stuff...

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:55.849
DigiBirds, toys from my youth... There's that
MiP who's missing a wheel... Ah! Look! Yes!

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.810
Yes! Score!

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:11.710
Look what I finally found! Yes! Yes! Yes!
We got Dub and Melody! Yes! I found Dub and Melody!

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:18.710
All the home toys... there's the giant Elsa.
We be gettin' giant Barbies I think. Really?

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.519
Yeah.

00:05:21.999 --> 00:05:29.999
Olaf, Olaf's a lot... everything looks, all
the Ken dolls look like Chad Allen. Sheriff

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:34.080
Kelly - oh, they have some Sheriff Kelly blind
bags. I definitely wanna get these. I'm gonna

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.849
add these for blind baggage, which we didn't
get a chance to film this week because I was

00:05:39.849 --> 00:05:40.659
sicky.

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:47.999
Look at this, an outfit! Oh my gosh! That
would be perfect for Mom Nikki. It's really

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:55.880
just a coat, but that's okay! It's really
cute. I'm not gonna enable you, I'm not gonna

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.309
be that person, just got her. In the show
I would get the Fashionista guys and use them,

00:06:00.309 --> 00:06:06.249
because these are gonna be the only guys that
-- Fashionistas. This is a really cute outfit

00:06:06.249 --> 00:06:13.049
though. This looks perfect for Freddy. I'm
actually gonna get Eric and make him Jason.

00:06:13.049 --> 00:06:21.479
There you go. I just need a superhero outfit
for Ma Nikki. Darn it. And this is painted

00:06:21.479 --> 00:06:23.699
on too... I'm very annoyed.

00:06:23.699 --> 00:06:30.699
Oh, there's the new Barbie Styling Heads.
Wow. Those are fancy. Fancy styling heads!

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:36.099
I feel like I didn't really look at these,
cause I was busy helping ladies shop, so.

00:06:36.099 --> 00:06:38.240
Spring Unsprung Cerise is still my fave.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:45.820
See, now there's Penny, that is yet another
one with the whitish hair, but Pearl is the

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:54.120
one... See, I really love this wardrobe. I
do not... Oh, oh, they have the car! They

00:06:54.129 --> 00:07:00.129
have the car! Look, they have the car! Oh
my gosh. Oh my gosh, so much Our Generation

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:08.009
cuteness. I have no room for the horse, none.
No room. No room for the horse at all. Nope.

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:11.680
She's so, look how pretty this horse is!

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:16.759
That's Pinkie Pie being just crazy! Crazy!

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:22.419
This is on sale. Did you really just choke
on your own spit? I have it when I do that.

00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:26.860
Wow. Oh that's where that outfit came from.
That, yes, that is an Our Generation outfit.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:33.870
Are you the one that is exclusive to Target?
Is it you? Somebody is exclusive, and I think

00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:40.860
it is you. But I'm not sure. I could be wrong.
