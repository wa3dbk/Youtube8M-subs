00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.870
I'm holding the crash cymbal right here and
I took it off the stand first to show you

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.110
how to actually place it on the stand.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.690
Typically a crash cymbal is going to be off
to your left side if you have one.

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.470
Drum sets generally have a couple of crashes,
they range in different sizes, and they start

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.250
normally, again, off to your left and you
might see one off to your right, a couple

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.980
maybe even between the drums here, or on the
left side.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.270
Drummers often change their crash cymbal set
up, depending on how big their set is and

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.980
also what type of music you're playing.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.840
The cymbal, a normal cymbal, has a hole right
in the center and that's gonna go right on

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.020
your stand.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.280
You basically take off the wingnut and take
off the first felt here.

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:54.900
The cymbal goes between the two felts and
hopefully has a little bit of protection device

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.970
here, so it's not rubbing against the metal.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:03.760
Then the felt goes on top of it and the wingnut
goes directly on top here.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:07.930
Now I have, like, a pinched wingnut, which
you would pinch the sides and it goes right

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.360
over the top and normally you have, like,
just sort of a screw wingnut.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.100
And you wanna make sure the cymbal has a little
bit of play in it so that it doesn't crack

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.720
or get into a position where you have a little
bit of breakage along the hole here.

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.240
When you hit the crash cymbal, you're basically
gonna hit on the edge of the cymbal and you're

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:30.640
gonna swipe through it, either directly down
through it, or off to the side, depending

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:31.710
on the sound you want.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:41.650
A big crash sound is gonna sound something
like this.

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:45.920
And if you swipe at it a little bit more,
it'll have a little more of a whispered tone,

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.090
like this.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:56.460
Now, depending on the size of the cymbal,
the sound that you're gonna get is going to

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.920
be different, depending on the range of what
you wanna play.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.830
This is an 18 inch crash right here, which
is normally a larger crash.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:12.920
And crashes range anywhere from about 13 or
14 inches up to about 22 inches or so.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.040
And generally, you're going to pick out a
crash depending on what type of music you're

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.040
playing.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.779
So, a smaller crash, or a darker crash, is
gonna be more for jazz and a brighter crash,

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:30.189
such as this by the Paste company, the full
line, or the signature line, or a larger crash

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:33.290
with the same type of sound is gonna be more
for your rock style.
