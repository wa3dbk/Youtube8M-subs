00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.230
well I'm very interested in quantum,
computers what they can do,

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.080
how we'll build them, how we'll make them
work, but actually my background

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.359
is in theoretical particle physics it's a
subject I still love

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:32.450
but back in the nineteen nineties I got
very excited

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.880
when I first learned about
quantum computing and the idea that

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.350
we would be able to solve problems with
quantum computers that we really

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.200
couldn't ever hope to solve with ordinary
digital computers and

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.329
I eventually changed the direction my
research because I got so interested in

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.129
that subject

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:53.800
I think I got interested because we often

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:58.600
are a bit baffled and fascinated in
physics by

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.550
the difference between classical physics
and quantum physics

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.040
and I felt that looking at physics

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.200
from the point of view of how information
gets stored and processed

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.240
gave us new insights into the difference
between systems that are classical

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.380
and systems that are quantum and I think

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.500
those insights although part of the
reason they're interesting is because

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.700
they may lead the way

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.860
to new technologies they're also useful
because they give us new perspective on

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.900
problems that physicists are interested in

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.500
and for fundamental reasons really
important differences between

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.300
information that's carried by ordinary
systems like

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.350
in digital computers today and
information carried by

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:46.500
quantum systems and probably the most

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.700
important distinction between classical
and quantum has to do with

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.350
the nature the correlations among the
parts of a system when

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.670
quantum systems are correlated with one
another with we say they're entangled

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:05.670
and entanglement is different from the
correlations that we normally encounter

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.900
in our everyday lives imagine we have a
book it's a hundred pages long

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.660
and if it were an ordinary classical
book you could read one of the pages and

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.600
then you'd know one percent of

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.800
the content of the book and if you read
another page you know another one

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:23.120
percent of the content

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.379
but if it's a quantum book if it's encoded in

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:32.300
a state a quantum system a typical
highly entangled quantum book

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.900
would have the property that if you look
at the page is one at a time you learn

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.110
almost nothing about the content of the
book

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:42.600
on each page you would just see random
gibberishand that's because the information

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:44.600
that's carried in that

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.810
quantum system that quantum book it's
not

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.650
encoded in the individual pages it's
almost entirely carried

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:55.900
in the correlations among the pages
so if you wanted to read that book

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.920
you would have to make a collective
observation

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.000
on many pages at once that's
completely different from information in

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.950
the classical world

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:09.670
so even if we have all the information
that it's possible to have about the content

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:10.610
of the book

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.480
if we look at just part of it but we see
is just random junk

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.900
classical systems we have a complete
description of the whole system then we

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.280
also have a complete description of its
parts because if you tried to

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.700
characterize

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.100
or describe all those correlations among
the parts

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.100
of a quantum system using ordinary
classical data

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.900
you would need an enormous amount 
classical information to completely

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:37.980
describe all at the correlations
you would need

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.200
many more numbers than the number of
atoms in the visible universe

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:47.709
so you'll never be able to write down the
content of a relatively short quantum

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:48.099
book

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:51.239
in terms of ordinary classical
information

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.300
it's kind of an amazing thing so there's this
quantum world out there and it somehow

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:56.300
has these

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.810
extraordinary resources that it carries

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:04.200
which are much different from many
resources we encounter and

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.310
ordinary experience and would like to
learn how to harness that

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:15.300
and to use it to our advantage.
