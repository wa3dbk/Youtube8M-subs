On behalf of Expert Village my name is Jim
Dufresne, I'm here to tell you about the ebow.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.820
It's kind of cool, it has a blue light right
there and it takes a 9 volt battery inside

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:58.960
hand held. This one has two position switches,
one for the fundamental tone and for for a

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:07.899
harmonic. See how it isolates the upper harmonic
and here's the lower one and you can drive

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:49.310
low strings or you can drive high strings.
(playing) And it works against the pick up

00:01:49.310 --> 00:02:03.919
see how it drives against the magnets of the
pick up. And you can arpeggio with it, now

00:02:03.919 --> 00:02:31.600
you'll notice that the attack is not as immediate
as a pick but the function is cool. And for

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:36.690
125 bucks I think it's pretty cheap they don't
pay me to do this.
