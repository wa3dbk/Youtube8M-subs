Hi, I’m Francis, 

00:00:07.674 --> 00:00:10.325
the host of this show "Cooking with Dog."

00:00:20.787 --> 00:00:25.368
First, let’s prepare the bitter melon also known as goya.

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.439
Cut the goya in half lengthwise 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.940
and run a spoon along the inside of the rind.

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:40.373
Then, scrape off the seeds and pith.

00:00:42.803 --> 00:00:46.469
Make sure to remove any of the remaining pith.

00:00:48.272 --> 00:00:51.925
Slice the goya into 3mm (0.1”) pieces.

00:00:52.814 --> 00:00:55.407
If you are not a fan of bitter melons, 

00:00:55.407 --> 00:01:00.126
try lettuce, spring onion leaves or bell peppers instead.

00:01:02.514 --> 00:01:04.494
Place them into a bowl.

00:01:05.775 --> 00:01:07.698
Sprinkle on the salt.

00:01:10.978 --> 00:01:12.800
And toss to coat.

00:01:13.832 --> 00:01:16.868
Let the goya sit for 5 minutes.

00:01:19.687 --> 00:01:23.222
Now, rinse the goya in a bowl of water.

00:01:27.953 --> 00:01:32.426
Then, remove the goya and pour fresh water over it.

00:01:34.336 --> 00:01:36.323
Strain the goya thoroughly 

00:01:36.323 --> 00:01:38.591
and place it onto a tray.

00:01:39.543 --> 00:01:41.661
Thoroughly remove the excess moisture 

00:01:41.661 --> 00:01:43.578
with a paper towel.

00:01:43.994 --> 00:01:47.962
This process will help to reduce the bitterness of the goya.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:54.865
Next, boil a generous amount of water in a pot 

00:01:54.865 --> 00:01:56.567
and cook the somen noodles 

00:01:56.567 --> 00:02:00.718
for slightly less cooking time than shown on the package.

00:02:00.958 --> 00:02:02.766
The noodles should be firm 

00:02:02.766 --> 00:02:06.457
since they will also be cooked in a pan later.

00:02:11.436 --> 00:02:14.534
Strain the noodles with a mesh strainer.

00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:20.663
And pour water over it to reduce the temperature.

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:27.096
Then, rinse the somen in a bowl of ice water.

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:31.949
Make sure to remove the gooey texture on the surface.

00:02:34.183 --> 00:02:36.985
Remove the excess water thoroughly.

00:02:37.235 --> 00:02:40.139
And place the noodles onto a plate.

00:02:40.454 --> 00:02:43.440
Add a small amount of olive oil.

00:02:46.656 --> 00:02:48.424
And toss to coat.

00:02:50.277 --> 00:02:53.132
Now, let’s make the somen chanpuru.

00:02:53.898 --> 00:02:57.097
Combine the chicken stock powder, sake 

00:02:58.316 --> 00:03:00.100
and soy sauce.

00:03:01.185 --> 00:03:03.168
Stir to mix.

00:03:05.252 --> 00:03:07.988
Next, season the egg with salt 

00:03:09.087 --> 00:03:11.022
and pepper.

00:03:13.756 --> 00:03:15.791
Beat the egg in a bowl.

00:03:17.825 --> 00:03:21.093
And now, heat the olive oil in a pan.

00:03:23.431 --> 00:03:25.932
Add the chopped garlic clove, 

00:03:26.432 --> 00:03:28.080
bitter melon 

00:03:29.621 --> 00:03:31.255
and carrot.

00:03:34.507 --> 00:03:37.765
Stir-fry the vegetables on medium heat.

00:03:39.878 --> 00:03:41.745
When the carrot softens, 

00:03:41.745 --> 00:03:43.457
add the tuna 

00:03:45.575 --> 00:03:48.086
and moyashi bean sprouts.  

00:03:49.987 --> 00:03:52.238
Continue to stir-fry.

00:03:53.372 --> 00:03:56.657
Then, gather the vegetables over to one side, 

00:03:56.657 --> 00:03:59.159
making a space for the egg.

00:04:00.775 --> 00:04:03.127
Pour in the beaten egg.

00:04:05.227 --> 00:04:07.343
Cook the egg halfway through 

00:04:07.343 --> 00:04:10.213
and combine it with the ingredients.

00:04:16.017 --> 00:04:18.384
Now, reduce the heat to low 

00:04:18.384 --> 00:04:20.701
and add the somen noodles.

00:04:24.686 --> 00:04:26.858
Pour over the seasoning.

00:04:27.492 --> 00:04:30.295
To avoid over-cooking the somen noodles, 

00:04:30.295 --> 00:04:33.347
distribute the seasoning as quickly as possible 

00:04:33.347 --> 00:04:35.581
and turn off the burner.

00:04:37.984 --> 00:04:41.001
Let the ingredients absorb the seasoning.

00:04:46.702 --> 00:04:50.155
And place the somen chanpuru onto a plate.

00:04:56.658 --> 00:04:59.094
Sprinkle on the black pepper.

00:05:00.377 --> 00:05:03.745
Finally, top with the bonito flakes.

00:05:05.865 --> 00:05:07.484
Adding the moyashi bean sprouts 

00:05:07.484 --> 00:05:10.237
will help to loosen up the somen noodles 

00:05:10.237 --> 00:05:14.041
and also give the dish a pleasant texture.

00:05:27.197 --> 00:05:28.965
You can also add tofu 

00:05:28.965 --> 00:05:32.287
to make the dish more filling and nutritious.

00:05:32.287 --> 00:05:34.166
Good luck in the kitchen!
