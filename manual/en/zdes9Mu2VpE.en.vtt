00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:05.000
So we're setting yourselves up to make a
million units in the next couple months

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.780
and of course we want to ramp up production
as quickly as we can beyond that

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.260
What's your target?

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.880
We don't have any particular target, I mean,
for a new device like this

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:16.379
our goal is to make as many as we can
but it's a

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.499
new production process 

00:00:17.499 --> 00:00:20.039
 it is in fact a very complex

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.680
new production process that takes almost
40 hours

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.399
takes almost 40 hours to make one of these devices so we have to ramp up over time

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:28.239
it takes a bit of time

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.809
Now you launched the Mi 3 in India just recently

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:35.030
and it looks as though you're targeting
emerging markets

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:36.590
Why is that? What's the strategy? 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.180
Yeah so, 
purely out of coincidence

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.980
we actually launched Mi 3 in India today

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:42.210
today was our first

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.430
sale day over there and obviously very excited about that market

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.100
 Our goal is to bring

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.579
all of our products to some of these really
really key strategic markets like India

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:53.259
Indonesia which is coming next 

00:00:53.259 --> 00:00:55.539
Latin America and so on and so forth

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.470
so we're just getting ourselves ready to
to really really ramp up and be able to

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:01.910
get to these market as quickly as we can
with our new products 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.520
But why the emerging markets?

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.680
The reason why I'm
asking is because your competitors

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:07.240
Samsung or Apple

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.799
targeted the developed markets
first and then after that they went in to

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.700
the emerging markets - it seems as though your
strategy's in reverse?

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.040
So, Why?

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.200
So first thing about these markets is that
they're very very large markets

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.429
where people are experiencing the internet
for the first time in the mobile phone

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.449
So there's a huge demand for
smartphones across the entire range

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.159
and secondly because of how we build our products and how we

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.619
think about them and how we price them 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.280
we think that
this 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.529
really is a special combination of high
specification high-performance devices

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:38.679
that are sold at really
aggressive prices

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:42.009
makes the most sense in these markets

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:45.799
plus we're a small company, we're a start only four years old so we can't go

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:47.519
to the entire world at once

00:01:47.519 --> 00:01:49.999
So we're going one market at a time and we're being pretty thoughtful

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.329
about picking the next target 

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.329
We started in
Singapore, a small market, 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:54.479
then we went to Malaysia

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.849
and so forth - now we're finally
working ourselves up to

00:01:58.849 --> 00:01:59.569
launch in India 

00:01:59.569 --> 00:02:01.669
So do you see yourselves in the US some day?

00:02:01.669 --> 00:02:03.130
We do see ourselves in the 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.800
West someday, we don't know when

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.829
I'd like to ask, when?

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.099
we're going to work to that day

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.299
there's a lot to do 

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:12.299
there's a lot of
work to happen before we're ready

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.200
for market as large as competitive as
the United States
