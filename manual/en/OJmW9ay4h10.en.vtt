00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:06.890
Today on this 2002 BMW x5 we are going to
install part number 75492 from Draw-Tite.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.070
This also applies to part number 87405 from
Hidden Hitch.&nbsp;

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.570
It is all going to mount up behind here and
to this cross member here.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.280
Okay take off the bumper cover and there are
two main bolts that are right behind this

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:26.990
plastic piece here again this part is also
removable so we can just pop that out and

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:31.340
there is a bolt with a torque setting here
that we will have to remove to take off the

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:32.340
bumper.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.739
Then one above each exhaust pipe.

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:44.499
Next we are going to off those screws that
go to the fender well and bumper also.

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:45.929
Now go ahead and take the bumper bolts off.

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:49.329
We will use a torque spit and the torque spit
size is actually T55.

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.809
Now we have to undo the fasteners here these
just kinda snap into place so you can just

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.089
pop them down and pull them out.

00:00:57.089 --> 00:00:59.280
This whole assembly should just pop right
off.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.200
The next thing we need to do is remove these
bolts all along here.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.719
Again, they use a special torque spit and
this time it is a different size.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:12.920
It is a T50.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.840
Next we will need to make a mark on our cross
member right here.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.320
What we are going to do is measure from this
edge forward about and inch and 1/ 8th.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:20.850
We will make a line going across.

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.090
It will not be centered on the beam it will
be over towards the front of the vehicle.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:02:22.470
What that is going to do is make sure when
we put our hitch up temporarily 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:55.180
that 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:20.880
it is in 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:52.370
the 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:14.230
right spot.
