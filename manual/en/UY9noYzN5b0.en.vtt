00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:05.640
Okay, so today we're going to make a tomahawk from an old piece of saw blade.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.020
I used three types of wood for the handle, it is very sharp and it works very well

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.260
So first we're going to draw the design on a piece of paper.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.600
Then cut it out using scissors

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.100
I use spray paint  to transfer the design onto the steel

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:24.820
Okay, so now we're going to grind it out using an angle grinder.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:40.660
Make sure you use proper safety equipment like glasses and a dust mask because the sparks are very dangerous to inhale or get into your eyes. They are also very hot so please be careful.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:52.280
Okay, so this is what it looks like after it's ground out. Now we're going to use a thick wheel on the angle grinder to grind it to it's final profile.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:02.600
Here I'm using a round file, to file the insides where I can't reach with my angle grinder.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.200
You can also use a disk grinder like this one. This is a home made one.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.960
Remove the rust with a sander

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:34.520
Punch the holes for the handles

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.800
Drill the holes through the tang with a metal drill

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:53.320
Okay, now we're going to grind the bevels, make sure everything is even and grind it with an angle grinder or if you have one a belt sander like this one.
