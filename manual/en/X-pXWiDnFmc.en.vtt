00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
The Land of Peace

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
You know it's not easy to write, to record,
but tell me how can I find God in these lyrics?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in an alley... I feel my heart surrendering
seven heart attacks in one ventricle!

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
I can talk without moving my lips, ventriloquist

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I feel the anger in my gut, the memory of my mother
At four o'clock in the morning the world is made of sand

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
while the Castles in the air are falling... Down!

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Men tearing each other to pieces,3013, go read Asimov!
We colonize the universe as we spread acid

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Cancers spread on the grounds, the Niger Delta
Caronte rules over that river, like the Stige

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
In front of Lampedusa  looking for life
the hope of a breakthrough while the sinks, it's already over

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
You see the coast, you reach out and you think you can grab it,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
but it slips away! You feel like choking
in the cowardice of those who don't know how to help
And tell me ....

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000
You're looking down, keep your eyes on the ground
to avoid hearing the footsteps of those who

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
trample on the land of peace

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
they throw their stones at Jesus Christ
who landed without a visa

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And what do you do? Which cross you will carry?
don't tell me now that you can't sleep

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:21.000
because you know that there's a whole world that
lives underground,  there is a war!

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Can't you see there is a war for you too!

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I feel confused, like an immigrant in the middle of the sea
How far is the coast? How long did he sail?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
From Morocco to Sicily, how much does he miss his daughter?
And every wave that shatters consumes the keel

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Thirsty above water, unable to drink
the irony of this life is always cruel

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
no wind in the sails, you need to paddle
but you don't know the right direction, you must rely on hope

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The hypocrisy of a nation that knows how to help

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
When death raises the audience of the tv news

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Ridiculous people hidden behind their explicit judgments,
hundred miles away... we are not Libyans!

00:01:52.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You're looking down, keep your eyes on the ground
to avoid hearing the footsteps of those who

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
trample on the land of peace

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.000
they throw their stones at Jesus Christ
who landed without a visa

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:17.000
And what do you do? Which cross you will carry?
don't tell me now that you can't sleep

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:26.000
because you know that there's a whole world that
lives underground,  there is a war!

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Can't you see there is a war for you too!

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:48.000
There are those who shoot and there are those who hope
And those who are not afraid to take another step
One more step!

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:56.000
And what do you do? Which cross you will carry?
don't tell me now that you can't sleep

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:05.000
because you know that there's a whole world that
lives underground,  there is a war!

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Can't you see there is a war for you too!
