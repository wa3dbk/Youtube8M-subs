00:00:00.093 --> 00:00:02.618
(happy guitar music)

00:00:08.521 --> 00:00:09.543
- Hi everyone.

00:00:09.543 --> 00:00:11.516
Thank you so much for tuning
in to Cook With April.

00:00:11.516 --> 00:00:13.931
Today we're gonna learn
how to make Pad See Yew.

00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:16.648
I learned how to make this
Thai dish while in Thailand

00:00:16.648 --> 00:00:18.087
on my honeymoon.

00:00:18.087 --> 00:00:20.340
I took a class and I
learned how to make it

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.708
and it tasted delicious
so I wanna teach you all

00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:23.823
how to make it, too.

00:00:23.823 --> 00:00:26.609
So stay tuned and it tastes so amazing

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.397
with a little bit of lime squeeze.

00:00:28.397 --> 00:00:30.951
Start out by placing
two to three tablespoons

00:00:30.951 --> 00:00:34.016
of vegetable oil onto the pan.

00:00:34.016 --> 00:00:36.477
Then you're going to want
to distribute the oil

00:00:36.477 --> 00:00:39.054
evenly onto the pan.

00:00:39.054 --> 00:00:41.394
Or the wok, which is what I'm using.

00:00:41.678 --> 00:00:45.852
Then turn it on to medium
heat and let the oil heat up.

00:00:46.647 --> 00:00:49.753
Then add four minced garlic onto the oil.

00:00:51.964 --> 00:00:54.413
And while that garlic is heating up,

00:00:54.413 --> 00:00:59.226
add about three chicken
breasts, sliced and chopped.

00:01:07.326 --> 00:01:09.713
Then add three beaten eggs
onto the chicken and garlic.

00:01:14.199 --> 00:01:17.728
Now we're going to add a
packet of fresh rice noodles

00:01:17.728 --> 00:01:19.511
that are thick and flat.

00:01:26.877 --> 00:01:28.354
Then mix everything together.

00:01:28.354 --> 00:01:32.273
Then add two cups of carrots,
that have been sliced.

00:01:33.091 --> 00:01:36.406
Add four cups of chinese broccoli as well.

00:01:37.595 --> 00:01:40.028
Then add half a can of baby carrots.

00:01:42.355 --> 00:01:44.532
And let this cook for a while, and stir.

00:01:45.699 --> 00:01:48.781
Using tongs, I like to
mix everything together.

00:01:49.251 --> 00:01:51.007
It's so much easier that way.

00:01:51.007 --> 00:01:54.066
Add one tablespoon of oyster sauce.

00:01:58.414 --> 00:02:01.061
Then I'm going to add one tablespoon

00:02:01.061 --> 00:02:03.957
of regular black soy sauce.

00:02:09.303 --> 00:02:13.088
Then add one and a half
tablespoons of white soy sauce,

00:02:13.088 --> 00:02:15.010
also known as thin soy sauce.

00:02:22.608 --> 00:02:24.019
And proceed to mix.

00:02:27.577 --> 00:02:29.800
Then add a teaspoon of sugar

00:02:32.453 --> 00:02:33.512
and mix it together.

00:02:33.512 --> 00:02:35.495
Then add a pinch of salt.

00:02:38.588 --> 00:02:39.721
And mix.

00:02:40.771 --> 00:02:42.321
Sprinkle a bit of pepper.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:46.947
Once everything is
almost completely cooked

00:02:46.947 --> 00:02:50.216
add one more teaspoon of oyster sauce.

00:02:51.382 --> 00:02:53.936
It just gives it a little
bit of a kick of flavor

00:02:53.936 --> 00:02:56.160
and a little bit of background coloring.

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:03.892
And mix.

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.310
So, the Ped See Yew is ready

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.809
and my husband is going to try it.

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:15.917
- Alright, I'm very excited.

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:19.527
Thai food is one of my
favorite cuisines, alright.

00:03:27.217 --> 00:03:28.025
Mmm.

00:03:31.281 --> 00:03:32.320
Oh, that is so good.

00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:36.310
That is really good, honey.

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.464
- Thank you, we've made
it like a zillion times.

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:41.070
- No, it's every time you make
it though, it's even better.

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.926
I love it with a little
bit of Sriracha on it

00:03:43.926 --> 00:03:47.061
and Thai cooking is one
of my favorite cusines,

00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:49.749
it's amazing how good you can make it.

00:03:50.484 --> 00:03:51.171
Mmm.

00:03:51.171 --> 00:03:51.910
- Thank you.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.031
- This is just as good as the Thai chef

00:03:54.031 --> 00:03:54.983
in Thailand on our honeymoon.

00:03:54.983 --> 00:03:55.703
- Chef Tui?

00:03:55.703 --> 00:03:56.632
- Chef Tui.

00:03:56.632 --> 00:03:59.592
- Chef Tui taught us how to
make it in our honeymoon.

00:03:59.592 --> 00:04:02.866
- Ooh, this is so so
good, thank you so much.

00:04:02.866 --> 00:04:03.563
- You're welcome.

00:04:03.563 --> 00:04:05.653
Thank you friends so much for watching.

00:04:05.653 --> 00:04:08.532
I hope you subscribe to my cooking channel

00:04:08.532 --> 00:04:10.273

00:04:13.222 --> 00:04:14.406
Thanks for watching!

00:04:14.406 --> 00:04:17.378

00:04:17.378 --> 00:04:18.511
- Bye.
- Bye.

00:04:18.771 --> 00:04:22.876
