00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.060
All right, today on this 2008 Ford F250 we&amp;#39;re
going to install part number HM47210.

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:10.519
This is Hopkins Endurance quick install 7
way trailer connector with universal pigtail

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:11.519
harness.

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.269
First thing we need to do is actually remove
the original connector that&amp;#39;s on our truck.

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.960
In this case the connector was damaged, it
was no longer usable.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.550
What we&amp;#39;re going to do is basically cut
off the end and start with fresh wire.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.410
Now before we install our wiring one thing
we&amp;#39;re going to do to the Hopkins part

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.020
is go ahead and cut off the ring terminal
for the white wire and our application here

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:50.400
is simply not going to be long enough to attach
it 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:01:11.810
to 
the frame so we&amp;#39;ll be using 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:28.110
the factory 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:02:07.590
ground wire that&amp;#39;s in 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.809
the wiring harness.
