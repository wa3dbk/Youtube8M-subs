00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:05.779
Now you can see that we have our proof, and
I think there's a couple areas that could

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.679
use a little more work. I'd like the side
of this bridge, this abstract form here, to

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:18.140
stand out a little bit more, so I can go back
in and cut. What's nice now, at this point,

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:28.789
too, is you can actually see on the block
the dark versus the light. So, there's two

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.130
things you can do here. Go ahead and begin
to cut the block with the ink on it, and you

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:43.800
can see your marks, as well. Maybe taking
a piece of paper to hold the block in place,

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.530
or using another block, you can hold it so
you don't get ink on your hands. You can see

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.030
that, I'll probably reveal this. This is why
it's a proof. I'll go back in here. I'd really

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:03.730
like this street light to reveal itself, and
I think I'm actually going to cut some marks

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:11.659
across, as well, to kind of show the light
from the street pole, the street lamp, itself.

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.479
And maybe rough up the background a little
bit more to create a gray so that this dominant

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:22.729
shape here stands out as well. So, alls I
need to do is reinvestigate the block with

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:39.049
my tools. So, you can see, I'm reinforcing
some contrast in my image,

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:47.119
making sure that this nice, bigger shape shows
up. And I'm also going back through and defining

00:01:47.119 --> 00:02:06.310
my horizon line here. So, now that I've made
my corrections, I'm going to proof this wood

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:48.090
block again, which, I believe, will be my
finished, complete image. Voila! As you can

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:55.960
see, here are the two proofs that I've pulled
off my wood block. This is the first state,

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.890
and here we have the second state of this
wood block. In the first state, all of the

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:07.750
bottom information primarily remained the
same. It's up here in the sky, so to speak,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:14.390
is where I've changed the image. I really
enjoyed this light pole coming up in the initial

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:21.391
photograph, so I wanted to reinforce the fact
that that was a light pole. So, you can see

00:03:21.391 --> 00:03:30.130
here that it barely was legible. And what
I did over here was take my C, or my V-gouge,

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:37.880
I'm sorry, and cut marks that were like rays
of light coming from the street lamp. And

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.260
I added a couple more marks in the sky, as
well as took that wire brush over the sky

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:51.560
again, and made that gray value in the background.
We can also see these little knots in the

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.150
wood a little bit better than we can over
here because I've roughed up the wood grain.

00:03:56.150 --> 00:04:00.790
One thing to notice, as well, is, in both
of these, we can really see the tool that

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:07.710
created the mark. Here we have that screwdriver
that I pounded into the block, and here we

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:15.240
have these fine lines made from a V-gouge.
And then we have these larger cuts that were

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:24.039
made from the C-gouge, and the wire brush
effect, as well. You can really tell the mark

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:28.830
in the tool on the surface of the wood, or
the linoleum, when you make the cut.
