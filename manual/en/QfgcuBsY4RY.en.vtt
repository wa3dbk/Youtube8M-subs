00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:09.010
2014 Jeep Cherokee Trailhawk -- Video Review:The
Trailhawk is Jeep's most capable version of

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.849
their all-new midsize Cherokee.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:18.289
It's equipped with a Selec-Terrain traction
control system with up to 5 customized settings.

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:20.949
Guess which one I used most often this week?

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:26.050
Indeed, it's been a cold, snowy winter and
the Cherokee arrived just in time to get me

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.599
though a storm that added another 2 feet.

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:34.909
So while Auto is the standard drive mode,
automatically detecting the need for four-wheel

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:41.040
engagement, it was mostly snow mode time for
me -- a setting that starts off in 2nd gear,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.850
keeps the 4-wheel drive in full-time operation
and biases the power to the front wheels.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.370
But no matter which terrain you find yourself
on, the Trailhawk has a setting that's been

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.309
customized to handle it.

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:59.159
That said, it's not bullet-proof as we managed
to get the Trailhawk temporarily stuck in

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:02.280
rather unspectacular conditions more than
once.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.940
An e-locker on the rear axle for severe conditions,
4-low range, hill descent and ascent mode,

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:16.800
and a crawl mode with a gutsy 47.8:1 ratio
round out the Trailhawk's standard Active

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:20.100
Drive Lock 4-wheel drive system.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.820
Of course, the Trailhawk gets the Trail-Rated
badge and because of that it needs the appropriate

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:35.170
rubber; here, 17" Firestone Destination All-Terrain
tires.For an extra $1,500 my tester has come

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.930
equipped with Chrysler Group's first application
of their new 3.2-liter Pentastar V6.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:48.640
It makes 271 horsepower and is capable of
towing up to 4,500 pounds.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:54.310
Mated to a new 9-speed automatic with a trick
4X4 system that disconnects the rear axle

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:01.890
when it's not needed, this Trailhawk is rated
at 18mpg city/25mpg highway, significantly

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.920
besting the old Liberty which had 5 fewer
gears.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:12.670
And if you don't need the added grunt of the
V6, you can stick with the Fiat-derived 2.4-liter

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.510
4-cylinder which returns slightly better mileage.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:27.400
With an as-tested price of $36,120, the Trailhawk
gives you a lot of bang for your buck.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:34.209
It's thoroughly modern with a number of clever
features and an everyday-friendly ride quality;

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.860
not to the level of the Grand Cherokee mind
you, but certainly agreeable.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.570
There were occasions when I felt like I had
to frequently stomp the gas pedal to get the

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.990
Cherokee to kick-down to a more useable gear,
but in general the power delivery is robust

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.760
and very smooth.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.880
Jeep went way out there on the Cherokee's
design and I love it.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:03:02.290
The optional black hood decal just adds to
this SUV's concept-car allure, completely

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.599
distancing itself from the Liberty's boxy
body.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:12.930
But don't worry -- though it's not on my tester
the SkySlider open-air sunroof lives on.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.090
Trailhawk models come with unique front and
rear fascias which improve approach and departure

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.090
angles.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.180
You can also distinguish these models by their
unique red recovery hooks.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.020
There's also an off-road, fully independent
suspension jacked up to 8.7", and the underbody

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.489
protection of skid plates.

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:40.000
With the optional comfort/convenience group,
leather interior and Uconnect with navi the

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.800
Cherokee's cabin is an amenity-laden, high-tech,
clever space.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:50.120
The brilliant electronics alone are enough
to make you say wow and the attention to detail

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.270
like these little bits is impressive.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.620
It's not particularly large inside but with
a recline function on the rear seats 2 more

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.610
adults can get comfortable.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:06.830
The seats also easily fold flat and the cargo
area with its power rear hatch has these hooks

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:08.739
for grocery bags.

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:15.050
High-end luxury features, notable quality
and thoughtful touches make it a huge winner.

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:21.769
Sure, there are other Cherokee models -- starting
with a 2-wheel drive Sport for under $25,000.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:31.039
But for the full Trail Rated Jeep Cherokee
experience, the Trailhawk is where it's at.
