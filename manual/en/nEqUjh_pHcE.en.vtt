00:00:02.954 --> 00:00:07.412
With the Skin modifier applied, it's time to fine-tune the solution.

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:14.680
Since you'll be concentrating on the left leg, you may want to readjust the animation timing to focus on its motion.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.160
Leg motion is taking place between frames 0 and 640.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.390
You can use the Time Configuration dialog to re-focus on that time.

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.800
You can also use shortcuts, by pressing Ctrl+Alt and then left-click and drag or right-click and drag the timeline,

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.700
depending on whether you want to reset the first frame or the last frame of the animation.

00:00:36.148 --> 00:00:42.542
With the foot selected, make sure you are in Edit Envelopes mode and that Vertices mode is enabled.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:45.070
Scrub the animation to view the problems.

00:00:45.572 --> 00:00:51.840
The worst is happening at the heel and ankle levels, but even the toe joint needs some adjustment.

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:56.010
Usually, at this point you want to "block out" the skinning.

00:00:56.337 --> 00:01:00.982
This means you want to manually select and assign vertices to their closest bone.

00:01:01.345 --> 00:01:05.462
Once this is done, you can go back and adjust the blending.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.380
To select a set of vertices, you can rely on region selection.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.600
However, the rectangular marquee may not necessarily be the best option for vertex selection.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:24.148
One universal favorite for this kind of selection is the Lasso tool, although others can be equally practical.

00:01:28.458 --> 00:01:33.305
Another selection method you'll be using extensively is the Ring/Loop combination.

00:01:33.928 --> 00:01:41.358
If you select two adjoining vertices, you can use Ring or Loop to select other vertices on that loop edge.

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:48.110
This is an incredibly powerful selection tool but it only works if the character was modeled properly.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:55.940
Even if it was, the Ring/Loop selection method is not perfect as it fails when the triangulation inevitably is not perfect.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.090
A good example is around the ankle, where you can see the five-edged vertex.

00:02:01.821 --> 00:02:09.091
Trying a loop selection there will fail, which means you still need to rely on conventional selection methods sometimes.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:15.100
In some situations, you may even need to revert to a vertex-by-vertex selection,

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.840
using Ctrl or Alt to add or remove from the selection.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.790
For now, and using the lasso tool, select the front part of the foot.

00:02:26.391 --> 00:02:29.496
The selected vertices appear as white boxes.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.500
Here's a bit of a quick tip:

00:02:31.961 --> 00:02:38.529
Notice that if you orbit around, the selected vertices are not necessarily acting as a rotation center.

00:02:38.966 --> 00:02:47.174
Even with the Orbit tool set to orbit around a sub-selection, this doesn't seem to work with skin vertices the way it does with mesh vertices.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:55.740
The trick here is to set the Transform Center to work around a Selection Center to get the Orbit to work as expected.

00:02:56.641 --> 00:03:03.051
With the toe vertices selected, what you need to do now is to fully assign them to follow the toe bone.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:10.560
Select the toe bone, since it's named properly you can select it from the list or simply by clicking it in the viewport.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:19.170
Notice the Absolute Effect value. It may already be set to 1 which means this bone is affecting the selected vertices 100%.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.390
Just the same, set this value to 1 and press enter to confirm it.

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:33.370
Next select the rest of the vertices on the foot and heel but leave out the top vertex loop near the ankle.

00:03:37.217 --> 00:03:42.957
Now select the foot bone. Notice this time that the Absolute Value doesn't actually show any numbers.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.665
This is the indication that the selected bone (foot bone) affects the selected vertices by various amounts.

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:56.500
Again set the value to 1 to ensure all selected vertices follow the selected bone.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.120
Finally, select the vertex ring at the top and assign that to the knee bone.

00:04:07.252 --> 00:04:12.457
Test the animation. There are fewer problems now but you still need adjustments.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.610
This is where you start fine-tuning the joints.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.030
Go to frame 20 and take a look at this loop, 

00:04:24.053 --> 00:04:28.653
and how it's sort of crashing into the foot as the toe springs up.

00:04:32.838 --> 00:04:39.403
Similarly at frame 60, the same loop is rotating a bit too much with the toe.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:47.350
This loop should be slightly affected by the foot bone, the same way the adjoining loop, which is currently following the foot,

00:04:47.748 --> 00:04:50.435
should be made to bend slightly with the toe.

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:53.120
You can do this in a couple of different ways:

00:04:53.551 --> 00:05:02.848
One way is to continue using the Abs. Effect value, by selecting a loop of vertices, then a bone that should affect the selection,

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:08.520
and finding the right value by clicking and dragging the spinner in the Command panel.

00:05:10.865 --> 00:05:14.678
Another way is to use the Weights Tool dialog.

00:05:16.795 --> 00:05:19.105
Make a vertex selection, 

00:05:23.046 --> 00:05:26.243
and also select the bone you want to affect the vertices.

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:37.086
Here, instead of a click and drag, you can click a preset percentage button, such as .5 for 50% or .25 for 25%.

00:05:37.708 --> 00:05:42.810
This dialog shows you how many bones are affecting the selected vertices and by what percentages.

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.760
You are not restricted to presets, you can force a custom value,

00:05:52.033 --> 00:05:57.303
or you can scale the weight up or down to increase or decrease percentages.

00:05:57.818 --> 00:06:05.306
Ultimately, whether you use the Weight Tool or the Abs. Effect value, you're still relying on a visual medium.

00:06:05.961 --> 00:06:10.733
It basically has to look right in the viewport as you run through the bone's range of motion.

00:06:11.483 --> 00:06:15.883
The rest of the foot is pretty rigid except for this area around the ankle.

00:06:16.583 --> 00:06:25.226
Here you probably need to make a selection using a conventional approach, as the loop option will fail as discussed earlier.

00:06:33.186 --> 00:06:42.511
At this point these vertices are affected 100% by the foot bone, but they should be made to react to the knee bone by a small amount.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:46.530
Select the knee bone and adjust the weight value. 

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.870
About 30% should do fine.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:57.220
If you feel some vertices need a little more or less weight, adjust them as well.

00:06:57.613 --> 00:07:03.153
Always test the weights in relation to the animation of the joints by scrubbing the animation slider bar.

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.620
When you're done, exit Edit Envelopes mode.

00:07:08.838 --> 00:07:12.488
Go down the stack to Editable Poly &gt; 

00:07:14.240 --> 00:07:17.130
Polygon sub-object mode, 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:24.410
and click Unhide All to bring back the mesh into view.

00:07:24.938 --> 00:07:28.368
Exit Polygon mode when done and save your file.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.280
In the next movie, you adjust the bottom of the leg and the knee joint.
