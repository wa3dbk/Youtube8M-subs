Vegan Fried Catfish Sandwich Recipe - Vegetarian Fish

00:00:01.091 --> 00:00:05.108
Hey my Sweet Vs, it's The Sweetest Vegan here. Today on 
 the show we will be making a vegan catfish sandwich

00:00:05.457 --> 00:00:11.645
So, I have been wanting to replace fish for a long time in a vegan 
 sort of way, and I was inspired the other day when we went

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:17.276
to Long John Silver, I went with my Grandmother, and 
 she got this plank, this fish plank thing.

00:00:17.276 --> 00:00:22.523
And, I was like if that is just a plank of fish, then 
 I can just make a plank of something into fish 

00:00:22.523 --> 00:00:27.191
And so you know we baked the zucchini the other day, and I 
 was like if I just left that long and cut 

00:00:27.191 --> 00:00:34.368
it in half, season it up, battered it, and fried it. It could probably 
 make a good catfish. So that is exactly what we are doing

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:38.605
today. I am so excited for this recipe and I 
 hope you are too. Here we go. 

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:43.537
Vegan Fried Catfish Sandwich Recipe - Vegetarian Fish

00:00:43.607 --> 00:00:48.515
So we are going to start this recipe by heating some 
 canola oil in a frying pan on the stove.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:53.754
Just leave that at about a medium high heat, and watch it 
 in case is smokes while we prepare our other ingredients.

00:00:53.754 --> 00:01:00.027
So first we are going to prep our zucchini. your going to cut off 
 the ends, then you are going to cut the zucchini straight down

00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:04.231
the middle lengthwise. You want it to be long. You 
 just want it cut in half the long way.

00:01:04.231 --> 00:01:09.195
And then you want to sprinkle a little bit of salt and a 
 little bit of pepper and let it go ahead and get all

00:01:09.195 --> 00:01:16.231
marinated and stuff. Then we are going to make our batter. 
 In a shallow bowl, we are going to whisk together

00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:21.214
all purpose flour, even though I use whole wheat flour, you can 
 use whole wheat flour if you would like to or 

00:01:21.214 --> 00:01:25.819
you can use all purpose flour like me, or you can 
 use whatever "fish fry" batter you would like to use,

00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:31.672
but I just used whole wheat flour and old bay seasoning. 
 I just used about 2 tablespoons, whisk that together,

00:01:31.672 --> 00:01:37.831
sat it aside. In a separate bowl, your going to stir 
 together mustard and water. Stir that together until 

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:43.270
until it is well combined. And then, a little flour back 
 to the mustard and water so that it can get

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:50.980
thick and stick to the zucchini. So now we are ready to dredge 
 our zucchini. You want to coat it in the mustard-water mixture,

00:01:50.978 --> 00:01:57.380
I had a difficult time with this, so if you make 
 more than six of these planks like I am making

00:01:57.377 --> 00:02:05.320
then you can use like a shallow bowl, or something different 
 to help coat the zucchini in the mustard stuff.

00:02:05.318 --> 00:02:13.380
But get it on there the best way you can like I did. And then 
 put it into your flour mixture. Cover it in flour, and then you 

00:02:13.375 --> 00:02:21.240
can drop it into the oil. Do this for about 3 planks, about 3 halves, 
 at a time, because that is how much space I had in my

00:02:21.241 --> 00:02:26.940
frying pan. But hey, if you have a bigger frying pan 
 or something, do however many you want at a time.

00:02:26.936 --> 00:02:32.420
And once those are done, you can take them out and put them on 
 a paper towel. But just like I said for the oven fried zucchini

00:02:26.936 --> 00:02:32.420
And once those are done, you can take them out and put them on 
 a paper towel. But just like I said for the oven fried zucchini

00:02:32.416 --> 00:02:37.710
and the oven fried green tomatoes, in fact, I can 
 put annotations to those videos here, you can check

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:47.070
those out, but eat these immediately. The crust will not be crispy if 
 you wait too long. Eat them fresh out of the hot oil.

00:02:47.068 --> 00:02:53.200
Don't burn yourself. *Do not burn yourself, people don't sue me because I said 
 eat it out of the hot oil* but eat it  

00:02:53.198 --> 00:02:58.610
as fresh as you can. It is so delicious. It adds 
 so much to it when you eat it fresh.

00:02:58.608 --> 00:03:04.370
But it is going to be crispy and crunchy. Then it is going to 
 be juicy on the inside. And I just plated it up just like

00:03:04.366 --> 00:03:10.380
we would any time in the south. You have, like 
 on Saturday, the have Catfish Sandwiches. People sell them.

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:18.880
for fundraisers or just a come up or whatever. And you 
 put the bread into like a foam carry away box.

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:24.370
And the catfish is always bigger than the bread but you slap it 
 on there any way. And it is all crispy and crunchy.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:29.580
And then you put hot sauce on it or malt 
 vinegar, we don't have no malt vinegar right now,

00:03:29.576 --> 00:03:35.550
so you put hot sauce on it, then you put mustard on it. You 
 put the other piece of bread on it and you eat it

00:03:35.551 --> 00:03:45.350
It is so delicious. Its so juicy. And this has been sitting around 
 for a little minute and the extra crispy parts are still 

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:50.600
crispy. So it will last some time, but the not so crispy parts, 
 it is still crispy but it is not crunchy.  

00:03:50.597 --> 00:03:54.750
I guess that is how you say it. That is it for today. Bye.
