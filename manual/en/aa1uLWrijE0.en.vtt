00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:20.186
Hi. I'm Justin Bailey.

00:00:21.479 --> 00:00:24.399
I like two things in this world. They're quite simple.

00:00:24.482 --> 00:00:26.276
I really don't think they're out of line.

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:28.903
First, I'm a completionist.

00:00:29.237 --> 00:00:33.616
I like to complete things to 100% of the complete task.

00:00:34.153 --> 00:00:36.104
For instance, when I'm sweeping the floors

00:00:36.305 --> 00:00:41.022
I gotta shampoo the carpet as well because we both know that that's not gonna get rid of everything by just sweeping, right?

00:00:41.112 --> 00:00:43.638
So afterward, I'm gonna get on my knees with a toothbrush

00:00:43.727 --> 00:00:47.886
and I'm gonna scrub every tiny, tinsy, winsy bit of thing that is on the carpet. 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.995
Like I said 100% completion.

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.646
Now when I'm collecting, I'm gonna collect every tiny little bit

00:00:55.847 --> 00:00:57.032
even if it's a bad one.

00:00:57.144 --> 00:00:58.531
De jabba no badda.

00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:01.035
Meesa Jar Jar Binks!

00:01:01.147 --> 00:01:03.539
I used to know Justin Bailey back in middle school.

00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:06.961
He used to always get A's all year and I used to think

00:01:07.117 --> 00:01:11.365
what's the point? I get 95s, some 85s. No big deal.

00:01:11.566 --> 00:01:12.706
Guy's an exceller

00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:16.374
Not everyone shoots for 100% all the time, but Justin Bailey

00:01:16.576 --> 00:01:19.460
he goes all out. 100%. All the time.

00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:21.002
I respect that.

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:25.071
Now the second thing I like, and this goes without saying

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.039
*Laughing*

00:01:28.224 --> 00:01:30.012
Girls in bikinis.

00:01:31.577 --> 00:01:32.577
Oh yeah.

00:01:34.388 --> 00:01:36.321
Seriously. 100% again?

00:01:37.081 --> 00:01:39.809
Updated my taxes. Sold my stock. 100%.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.396
You really don't deserve girls in bikinis.

00:01:41.485 --> 00:01:42.485
Uh, spin.

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:46.806
I mean, come on. I'm sitting here completing everything to 100%.

00:01:47.008 --> 00:01:49.132
What's wrong with me wanting to see girls in skimpy bikinis?

00:01:49.243 --> 00:01:52.239
It's totally valid. Expected. I earned it, right?

00:01:52.396 --> 00:01:55.483
- So this Justin Bieber guy...
- Bailey.

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:56.645
Bailey. Whatever.

00:01:56.757 --> 00:01:59.955
Everytime he gets 100%, we have to show up in our bikinis. 

00:02:00.022 --> 00:02:01.833
I don't even know what 100% is.

00:02:02.034 --> 00:02:04.494
Yeah, it's so weird. And they have to be matching bikinis.

00:02:04.561 --> 00:02:05.561
So weird.

00:02:05.762 --> 00:02:07.066
Excuse me, weird!

00:02:07.155 --> 00:02:09.168
Enough 100% guy. We are here to shoot!

00:02:09.257 --> 00:02:12.544
On your marks. You are a puffer fish. You are a mailman. Okay, go!

00:02:12.655 --> 00:02:14.198
Now you have a high mailbox!

00:02:14.287 --> 00:02:16.300
Yes! Oh my God! With the face! I like it!

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.022
Now you have your bag. You have your bag.

00:02:18.111 --> 00:02:20.370
And you are delivering mail to the puffer fish!

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:21.603
You do that one! Okay!

00:02:21.755 --> 00:02:24.666
He's a smart man because when he gets 100%

00:02:25.154 --> 00:02:27.375
he gets a hot girl in a bikini. And...

00:02:27.998 --> 00:02:30.500
frankly, a hot girl in a bikini is pretty cool.

00:02:30.668 --> 00:02:33.478
Speakin of which, wouldn't the world be a lot better place with

00:02:33.647 --> 00:02:36.408
hot girls in bikinis all the time for a job well done?

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.350
It would.

00:02:39.024 --> 00:02:41.356
Justin Bailey. You're my hero.

00:02:41.827 --> 00:02:45.608
Justin Bailey, I hate you. Plain and simple. You suck.

00:02:46.635 --> 00:02:49.361
This is what 100% completion is all about.

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:54.779
*Lazer Gun Firing*

00:02:55.082 --> 00:02:56.082
What the hell?

00:02:56.234 --> 00:02:57.727
Wow, that's some reward!

00:02:57.811 --> 00:02:59.645
Are you a moron? Get down!

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:02.422
*Alien Sounds*
*Lazer Gun Firing*

00:03:04.458 --> 00:03:06.051
That was awesome!

00:03:06.926 --> 00:03:08.866
I've been tracking Space Pirates here on Earth.

00:03:08.984 --> 00:03:11.390
They've been hiding Metroid nests deep in the Earth's core.

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:16.367
Since the climate and geography here on Earth mirrors that on Brinstar and Norfair on Zebes.

00:03:16.763 --> 00:03:18.896
I have no idea what you just said.

00:03:19.503 --> 00:03:21.149
But I think I'm in love with you.

00:03:21.387 --> 00:03:24.187
If I finish my mom's basement later to 100% completion,

00:03:24.345 --> 00:03:28.914
would it be possible if you came back home and stripped for me? Maybe?

00:03:29.337 --> 00:03:31.001
*Lazer Stun*

00:03:36.072 --> 00:03:37.998
*Extreme Pain*

00:03:38.685 --> 00:03:39.685
Pervert!

00:03:42.062 --> 00:03:43.862
Totally worth it!

00:03:53.027 --> 00:03:54.744
Mr. 100% Justin Bailey!

00:03:54.903 --> 00:03:57.200
I work very hard. He steals my models! No!

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.710
No! Okay. I spend a fortune in security! He is not cheap!

00:04:00.404 --> 00:04:00.993
That's right.

00:04:01.051 --> 00:04:01.714
Yes!

00:04:03.098 --> 00:04:03.732
That's right.

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:07.560
You think for so much money, I could a friend I could talk to. He says one thing.
