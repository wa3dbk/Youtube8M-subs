00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:08.180
Hi I'm Binky from Made in Chelsea and welcome
to Binky's Boutique where each week I show

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:10.260
you my beauty secrets.

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.600
This week were going to show you a really
simple 5 minute make up look.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:19.190
I really love this Dior BB creme, its FPS
30 which is very rare and awesome because

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.940
you don't want winkles when you're older.

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.731
You don't have to use any brushes to apply
it.

00:00:22.731 --> 00:00:26.410
It gives your skin a really even finish.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.420
Also, always good to experiment, I always
put a little on the lips, because I like the

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.070
faded out look.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:36.710
But all in all I think its a really amazing
product.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.070
Good for an everyday put in your bag purchase.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.220
To get a bit more depth into my eyes, I'm
using Too Faced eyeliner.

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:47.920
I really like it because its really easy to
apply, its really smooth when you put it on.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:50.050
You don't even need to use a brush for it.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.310
You got a little smugger.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.130
So you don't have to be too perfect when applying.

00:00:54.130 --> 00:01:01.800
So literally just rolls on really easily.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.600
And the you've got your smugger, and blend
it into the roots of your eyelashes.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.289
So you get a smokey eye effect which I love,
its very sexy.

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:19.280
So now that I have finished my eyeliner I
am going to use the Daniel Sandler Babyjet

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.240
mascara, this is a really cool little product
because, as you can see the wand is really

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:31.209
small, which means you can get into little
corners and to get to the bottom lashes and

00:01:31.209 --> 00:01:38.040
make each one extend and thicken a little
bit.

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:49.179
I think this product is perfect So as you
can see, its got to every little lash.

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:52.319
Its a really good product.

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:58.039
The next think I will be doing is putting
this clarions skin illusion on my T zone to

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:59.079
blot out any shine.

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:03.619
Not only is it really pretty packaging, I
do like a matte finish.

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:07.549
You don't want to be shinny, that's really
off putting.

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:08.970
Just sweep it across your forehead.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.340
And down your nose, and the obvious shiney
bits on your face.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:26.021
So now I am using the Daniel Sandler watercolour
blush, the easiest way to apply this, well

00:02:26.021 --> 00:02:29.950
actually firstly you have to shake it quite
vigourously, because you need to get it all

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.590
mixed up in the little bottle.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:36.870
And it comes out really quickly and easily
so be careful when you put it on your hands.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.110
So a couple of drops, as you can see its really
thin.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:50.040
And you can either apply this with your fingers,
but here I've got a special brush, that's

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.620
supposed to, literally dab it on your hands,
and smile to get the apple of your cheeks,

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:56.620
there and there.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:04.180
Then smooth it in really gently , this brush
is perfect for blending it on your face.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:15.880
So you get a really pretty, almost doll esque
finish to the skin.

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.560
Bit of colour, always a bit of colour.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:18.560
If not bronzer then blusher.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.930
Now I am going to perfect my eyebrows, with
my special eyebrow tool, its got a brush and

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:23.930
a comb.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.340
So what we are going to do, is we are going
to literally just brush up your eyebrows.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:31.660
We don't want the geordie scouse brows.

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.290
We are just going to have a Chelsea brow,
which is obviously much better.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:40.310
Then we are literally going to comb them along
like that.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.900
I think bigger the brows the better.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:49.400
For my lips I am going to use the Stila liquid
lipstick and its the colour dolce.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.700
To be honest its just a normal lip gloss.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:56.270
But we are going to do a quick appliance,
just put it on your hands.

00:03:56.270 --> 00:04:03.530
This is easier and quicker and more natural
if you just dab it with your finger, over

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.530
your lips.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.870
Then we just have a simple nude lip which
I think looks very elegant.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.740
And here you have it a really quick 5 minute
make up look.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:18.180
All the product I used to day you can buy
on escentual.com

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.400
