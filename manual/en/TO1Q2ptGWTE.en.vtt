00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.950
Apparently James Bond movies do not come out
fast enough for the video game industry.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.830
They were tired of having to wait a couple
years for a new movie to come out so that

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:36.630
they could make the game to go along with
it.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.070
Instead, they decided to make their own James
Bond story using the same characters.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:52.500
What was created was Agent Under Fire, a completely
new and original Bond story.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.790
For being original, the story still feels
very Bond like.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.040
It is apparent that they actually spent some
time crafting a tale worthy of the famous

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.420
secret agent.

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.390
The game starts with James in Hong Kong having
to rescue a CIA operative, Zoe Nightshade.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.750
After he does and gets his just reward, they
are thrown into a mission were they trying

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:23.570
to bring down Adrian Malprave, head of Identicon
which is a ruse for a weapons smuggling ring.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:31.190
The story has all the elements that go into
a great Bond story.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.960
Evil boss bent on world domination, check.

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:40.140
Great moments that make Bond seem like the
coolest guy in the world, again check.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:46.170
Female protagonist that keeps Bond’s attention
throughout the mission, final check.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.030
The game is played from first person.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:53.810
Bond games seem to be in an eternal struggle
of first vs third person.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.550
But there are plenty of scenes where you will
see James himself.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.130
You will have your guns and will shoot plenty
of henchmen.

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.810
You will use a good amount of weapons from
pistols to assault rifles and rocket launchers.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:10.531
The shooting feels good but a little shallow,
with the auto-locking and dumb enemies, you

00:02:10.531 --> 00:02:12.690
can just mow right through them.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:17.440
But the game also has a big focus on using
Bond gadgets to accomplish your mission.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.260
Just like modern days, you will use your cellphone
for everything.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.340
But instead of just a camera phone with internet,
Bond’s has a grappling hook, a laser for

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.370
cutting metal, and a device for hacking.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.530
And when you do things not in the obvious
way but instead the awesome climactic way,

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.870
you will hear the Bond theme which makes you
feel even cooler.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.590
The game is also filled with driving scenes
and rail shooting, which break up the action

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.310
nicely and give a good change of pace.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.720
If you are going to be Bond, you want to do
all Bond does.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.860
You are also graded on every level, where
earning top marks can reward you with new

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.310
special weapons and cheats like infinite ammo.

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.530
Agent Under Fire is a good game.

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.590
With a completely original story that packs
in everything great about being the MI6 secret

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.370
agent, you can’t go wrong.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:29.730
It may not be the deepest game, but it is
fast and fun and a great time.
