First you have to go harvest the corn

00:00:32.618 --> 00:00:34.618
You throw it in your bag/back pack/motete and 
 then you bring it to the house.

00:00:36.328 --> 00:00:38.328
Then you take off the hairs and remove the cobb.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:44.880
Then you start to cut it.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.840
You cut it like this.

00:00:53.057 --> 00:00:55.057
Afterwards, you have to grind it up with the grinder.

00:00:59.287 --> 00:01:01.287
After, you add a pinch of salt and get ready the 
 casing which we will stuff with the ground corn.

00:01:06.522 --> 00:01:08.522
Next, you tie them up and toss them in boiling water 
 in a pot and thats how we cook them.

00:01:38.043 --> 00:01:40.040
Time to grind.

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:38.900
Let me try it to see if there is enough salt.

00:02:44.127 --> 00:02:46.130
sometimes we make it with fish, fresh fish and then we 
 add some other ingredients. yeah, we make it with fish.
