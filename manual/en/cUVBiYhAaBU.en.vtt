00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.500
Now you're going to measure the amount of
relief in the neck.

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:08.820
That's the amount of bow that's in it.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.590
Now on a guitar you want it to be as straight
as possible, usually.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:17.420
On a bass, there are a few basses out there
that can be dead straight, but generally they

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.110
play a little better with a little bit of
a bow, or relief, in them.

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:27.400
What I like to do is take a straight edge
and put it on the neck itself.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.070
You want to look at the gap between the straight
edge and the bass neck or the frets.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:36.850
This neck has a little more relief in it than
you want, so what you're going to want to

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.620
do is tighten the truss rod.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.809
If there was not enough relief in it and it
was too straight you would loosen the truss

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:45.809
rod.

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.129
In order to do that you have to loosen the
strings.

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.100
Some, even Fender basses, more modern ones,
have truss rod access at the top of the neck.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.070
This one has it at the bottom, which means
you have to take the neck off in order to

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.329
do this.

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:09.970
You want to take your driver, throw it in
reverse.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.620
I like to not take the screws all the way
out.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:15.170
They need to be all the way out of the neck
itself, but you can leave them in the guitar.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.600
It's a little bit easier to put it back on.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:25.920
I'm going to lay it down, pop the neck out.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:31.220
Take a nice flat-head screwdriver, a big one,
and tighten it up a little bit.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:48.850
You want to go, unless it's really loose,
a quarter turn.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.160
Then tighten it back up.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.460
You can only tell what the neck relief is
when it's tuned at the pitch, so every time

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.372
you make an adjustment, you're more likely
going to have the guitar need tuning, so you'll

00:02:03.372 --> 00:02:06.480
need to tune it back up to see what you did.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:08.310
Some guys like it to be really straight.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.530
If you have a really straight neck you're
going to need higher action for it to play

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.130
right.

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:33.180
I'll tune it up now.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.790
G.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.519
You want to take your straight edge, put it
down the middle of the neck, look at it, and

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.180
it's still got a little bit of bow but not
too much and that's really what you want.

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.439
This is really a matter of personal preference.

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:50.909
Some guys like a lot of relief in the neck.

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:53.999
I find that they play a little better when
there is just the perfect amount.
