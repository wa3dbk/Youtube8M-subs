00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
Narrator: The Orbital Sciences Corporation test

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:05.950
flight of the Antares rocket will be carrying a

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.270
very small secondary payload into space.

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.580
Onboard are three nanosatellites that were

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.260
designed and built at NASA Ames Research Center,

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.490
the lead center for small spacecraft development.

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:20.160
Two of the cubesats are called "PhoneSat-1" and

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:23.080
one of them is a "PhoneSat-2 Beta."

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.780
Jim Cockrell:  Someone here asked the question

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:28.650
"Can we fly a cell phone as the avionics for a satellite?

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:30.990
And have something that's very capable but really,

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.910
really inexpensive?"

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.960
So, PhoneSat was launched to try

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.570
to answer that question.

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:38.610
Narrator: Measuring only 4 inches on each side

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.670
and weighing less than four pounds,

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:42.970
each miniaturized satellite was built for only

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:46.090
3500 dollars each and will showcase the ability

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.380
to launch the lowest-cost, easiest-to-build satellite

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.850
ever flown in space.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.720
The design makes extensive use of

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:55.430
commercial-off-the-shelf components,

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.330
including a consumer-grade smartphone.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.720
Out-of-the-box smartphones offer capabilities

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.870
needed for satellites, including fast processors,

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.440
versatile operating systems, multiple miniature

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.170
sensors, high-resolution cameras, GPS receivers

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.380
and several radios.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.360
Jim Cockrell: The smartphone vendors have put a

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.470
lot of R &amp; D money into making very, very capable

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.910
microprocessors.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.210
They have a lot of processing power and speed

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.820
in a package that's very rugged. 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.830
And we intend to fly it as a microprocessor

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.690
for a satellite.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.020
Narrator: NASA's PhoneSat 1.0 is built around the

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.850
Nexus One smartphone while PhoneSat 2.0 Beta has

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:37.500
improved software and more sensors.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.180
Upon deployment into space, each satellite will

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.890
broadcast a signal every 30 seconds on the amateur

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.350
UHF band at 437.425 megahertz.

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.050
The PhoneSat Project will be a success if NASA

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.060
confirms reception of signals from the cubesats,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.450
however anyone around the world can listen for

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.830
this signal and upload what they hear to

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.780
www.phonesat.org.
