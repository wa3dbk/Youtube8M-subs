00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:07.509
[Music]

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.840
Roy is usually a man on a mission, but today
there is extra fire burning in those eyes.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:18.010
The reason, he has only got a few days sport
left before he goes under the knife for operation

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:20.830
number 25 on his hips.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:23.170
It could mean he is out of action for some
time.

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:26.430
So let's not waste any more time and head
off after fallow.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.529
Well we have got a bit of a cold snap in the
air this morning.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:34.090
It is about half past five and all we are
doing today really is getting on the ground

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:37.410
and having a survey of the fallow bucks which
hopefully will be coming in.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.489
So the ground we are stalking this morning
doesn't really hold any mature bucks until

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:44.900
the start of the rut.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.079
But they start to filter in at the end of
September, beginning of October.

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.729
That is smack on where we are and hopefully
we will see a few boys running around and

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:58.399
we might be able to catch up with a pricker
or two, but this morning's main exercise is

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.070
to see if there are any bucks running around.

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.729
What sort of quality they are and give us
some sort of indication of what we are going

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:06.190
to be taking out this year.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.140
Roy has a few hotspots on this ground and
is after a young spiker.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.660
The bottom of the valley is a common haunt
and we get our first glimpse.

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:17.320
But do we bump these animals in order to get
to where we really want to be.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:22.570
Just giving her a couple of barks to let her
know, so that she know that we are here.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.640
Obviously that might disturb the other deer,
but I just want to give it 10, 15 minutes.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.070
Looking through this corridor we have got
a lovely vista out through the opening in

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.300
the woods here.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:43.730
This time of year is normally very good for
deer just coming out of the wood and feeding

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:45.380
on the edge here.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:49.150
So hopefully it is worth another 15 minutes
or so and see if anything comes out to play

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.150
with us.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.150
If not we will move on.

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.210
As it gets lighter we spot a number of fallow,
but there are no males in the group.

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.780
The wind is behind us and the next minute
it is in our face.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.040
It is so difficult to stalk up on deer like
this.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:08.600
Especially with fallow when you have got so
many of them you have got a lot of eyes, a

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.070
lot of ears, a lot of noses watching what
you are doing.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:14.819
With Roy feeling we have had our chance on
this side of the ground he has a bash at a

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.530
bit of fox calling.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.849
We did say he has a lot to get out of his
system before the op.

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:26.159
For a change Roy positions David with a camera
behind a tree and not over his shoulder as

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:27.159
usual.

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.689
He is hoping that if a fox comes in it will
be so focussed on the source of the call it

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:36.900
won't spot the camera and we will get some
different film shots.

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.989
The plan works brilliantly apart from the
breakdown in communication.

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:45.300
That was absolutely unbelievable.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.310
I didn't want to shoot because I wasn't sure
that David had the camera on it.

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.150
I was trying to gesture to him, David was
trying to gesture to me because from the way

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.299
I was looking at the camera in David's hands
it didn't look like it was on the fox at all

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.499
and then with our hand gestures and jumping
up and down and trying to communicate between

00:03:00.499 --> 00:03:04.319
eachother the fox hightailed it and exited
stage left.

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.300
So unfortunate on that occasion, but definitely
worth a go, because you could see the fox

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.689
came in, just coming up, that was a really
slow one, just creeping in and just sat down

00:03:14.689 --> 00:03:16.489
trying to work out what was going on.

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:22.919
A beautiful, beautiful shot, but due to miscommunication
another one for another day.

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:26.359
Right let's go on and see what we can do.

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:30.040
Oh well if you don't at first succeed, blah,
blah, blah.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.610
On the other side of the estate we see signs
that mean yet again stupid dog walkers are

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.900
unwittingly coursing deer.

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.499
It is astonishing how many ignorant Fenton
owners there are out there.

00:03:40.499 --> 00:03:44.340
You would have thought something might have
sunk in by now.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.499
That is a dog.

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:54.750
There is a dog screaming, chasing.

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:55.870
We continue our morning.

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:58.029
We spot deer moving through the wood.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:04:00.169
Roy opts to leave them to cool down.

00:04:00.169 --> 00:04:03.760
He thinks they could be the spooked lot from
before.

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.549
We crawl into another of Roy's hot spots,
but nothing.

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.489
We try a bit more fox calling, but nothing.

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.329
We head after the deer, but Roy thinks our
morning may be over.

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:32.570
So time for one last squeak 
and we get a fantastic response.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:36.710
David waits for Roy to take the shot, Roy
is waiting for the fox to give him a clear

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:37.710
shot.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:41.270
Roy doesn't want to move and neither does
David and as the fox goes behind the tree,

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:42.270
oh bugger.

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.270
Did I get it.

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:44.520
You are joking.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:53.690
Just at the start of the squeak the fox bolted
out of the brambles and it was working absolutely

00:04:53.690 --> 00:04:59.560
superbly, but as he came tripping down here,
we knew we had him on camera, but he was in

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.530
front of me, but unfortunately I couldn't
take the shot because of a tree then I was

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.350
trying to work him round a little bit more
for a shot.

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:10.720
What he wanted to do was get into a position
where he could come in to the wind and find

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:14.830
out where I was, because where I was hidden
behind the branches, behind the bows of the

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.150
trees here, he couldn't make out what was
going on.

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.050
He couldn't pin point the sound with the wind
as well.

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:24.770
So he was working his way round and as soon
as he got up wind he would have been off.

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:29.120
So I didn't have long and unfortunately took
the shot just as he went out of camera view.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.570
Unfortunately that is the way it can go.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.370
We might have missed the shot, but Roy didn't
and we will endeavour to get some more foxy

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:38.310
footage as soon as Roy is on the mend.

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.580
