 Hi I'm Diane Wallace welcome to Adorama TV

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.400
today I have something really exciting to
share with you the brand new

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.540
Leica T and if you are wondering why it's
still in the box

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.170
well let me show you. We all know the
Leica name for their amazing

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.130
engineering and quality

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.029
but on this new camera they really have
a focus

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:29.099
on craftsmanship and design and if
you've seen my videos before you know I

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:30.699
am a big sucker for

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.079
great packaging and great design, and Leica's

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.570
new camera starts right with the box let
me show you

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.629
when you open the package you get

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:44.870
this and this was very exciting for me
because

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.020
it's a beautiful elegant simple design

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.460
its really so well crafted you pull it
out

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.610
this camera the T is made with

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:59.289
solid aluminum now they actually had
Italian aluminum

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:02.379
bricks which they showed us that was
really cool to see

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:06.610
and they polish and handcraft them down
to

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.060
a really lightweight solid body

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.900
so the design is a one-piece
construction and it's really beautiful

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.659
to look at and they're very selective
about the materials that they use

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.350
they told us that ninety percent of
those blocks get thrown out

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.159
for imperfections so they're very picky we
expect that from Leica

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.200
but it's a beautiful elegant design they
did have help from

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.939
Audi but I have to tell you between the way
that looks in the box

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.470
and the cleanness and I'll show you how
the back works

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.750
the back of the Leica T is entirely

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.970
a 3.7 inch touchscreen and what that
means is you really again have no

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.590
distractions as you're trying to operate
the camera

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.259
all you simply do is touch on it and
it gives you all these options

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:56.360
you simply scroll through kinda like the
way you would with your iPhone

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.460
it's really intuitive it's very easy to
find

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:03.380
everything and one of the great things
you can find in this camera

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:07.619
is wifi . Leica's very first camera that
has it built

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:13.129
in so it's really nice upgrade for Leica and for us to have in this camera

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.319
it really is reminiscent of the way
apple designs

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.489
things it's very intuitive it's very
easy to use

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:22.970
and there are no distractions what they
really focused on

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.430
is giving us a camera that doesn't
distract from the actual photography

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.280
so all you have to think about is shooting
your images the Leica T has a 16

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:33.090
megapixel

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.300
APS-C sensor and it shoots both Jpeg

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.700
and raw files so you have lots of
flexibility it's got a great

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:43.690
ISO range and lots of lenses now right
now

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.000
there are two out this one is the 23
millimeter

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.099
it's actually the equivalent to the
thirty five-millimeter

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.440
on thirty five-millimeter format and it's
a great street shooter

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.360
it's an F2 so you're gonna have
awesome shallow depth of focus

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.510
and beautiful Boca it's really has
really nice results

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.940
there's also a telephoto lens out right
now I have the right here it's the 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.780
18-56 millimeter lens

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.159
again beautiful results with these and
later this year there will also be

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:14.459
a telephoto zoom lens and the wide angle
zoom lens

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:19.760
so you'll have four options right away but
there's an adapter available so

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.840
if you love to use the M-lenses

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:26.220
check out this adapter because it a live
connection

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.190
you'll be able to use more than twenty
of those M-lenses with this adapter

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.440
on this camera and they'll talk to the
camera because at that live connection

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:34.900
so

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.170
you'll get the same functionality you'll get beautiful results

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.360
and lots of flexibility even though this
is a brand new camera

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.310
one more great design feature I really
wanna point out is that they paid 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.640
attention to everything

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.620
including the strap now this is
something we sort of take for granted

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.989
but the strap for this camera doesn't
look or feel like

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.500
any other strap that I've ever seen on a
camera and also attach's is differently

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:02.340
there's a nice clean design and all you
do is pop in

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.900
this rod into the hole inside the
camera so there's nothing hanging there

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:07.310
are none of

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:10.970
those extraneous rings that usually you
see on cameras

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:14.890
this way it doesn't interfere with this
beautiful elegant design

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.630
there are additional accessories as
well one of them

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.870
is the visoflex viewfinder

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.620
it sits right on top in the hot shoe and
that gives you again more great ways to

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.610
use the camera

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.120
there's an additional hot shoe flash
lots of great things about

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.389
the camera that you can add that really
enhance the elegant design of this camera

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:38.380
