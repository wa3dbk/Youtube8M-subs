00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:09.230
to change the receiver and there is some deliberate
hearing instrument

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:12.320
start by opening the battery door

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.029
pushed the long end of the alert school up
into a small compartment on the inside Wall

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.789
of the microphone cover

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:22.189
and angle that school out and away from the
hearing instrument

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:25.089
to unlock the microphone cover

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:26.079
was unlocked

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:28.990
the cover will lift right off

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.110
simply pull the whole receiver out

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:33.300
and it certainly will receive her

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.110
it is not properly seated

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.840
until that is fully answered

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.730
before replacing the microphone cover you
may wish to change the microphone filters

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:43.619
to do this

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:46.820
he will first have to remove the old filters

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.910
use the letter a tool to lift up one side
of the installed filter

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.890
and the filter will come right out

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.850
replacement voters are packaged in a convenient
cartridge

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:03.130
aline the cartridge with the hearing instrument
has demonstrated in the illustration

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.160
once properly aligned

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.939
applying pressure against the cartridge will
be spends and install the replacement filters

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.549
because the microphone cover side panels and
battery door on the lehrer hearing instrument

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.570
or all field replaceable

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.540
the color of the American be changed in the
field

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.259
since we've already removed the microphone
cover

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.840
but it's also demonstrate how to replace the
side panels and every door

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.960
so I decided handles off by using your fingers

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:38.290
to squeeze against the panel's while simultaneously
polling in the direction of the arrows in

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.299
this illustration

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:43.270
keep in mind that the panel's cannot be removed

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.820
unless the microphone cover is removed first

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.350
to remove the battery door ally in the short
end of the letter to a lot with a huge fan

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.640
of the door

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.850
applying pressure against the pin on one side
of the instrument

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.100
will allow it to slide out on the other side
of the instrument

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.270
after sliding the pain out of position the
door can be remote

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.329
a line of replacement or with the hearing
instrument

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:12.579
and reposition the pen to secure the door
in place

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:13.629
then the slide the news

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.619
side panels into place

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:19.189
and snap the microphone covering complex

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:21.900
take a little unsure the tip of the microphone
cover

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.999
is flush with the body of the hearing instrument

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:30.399
this can most easily be accomplished by inserting
this and of the microphone cover into place

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:33.379
before snapping the rest of the cover into
place

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:35.790
close the battery door to complete the process
