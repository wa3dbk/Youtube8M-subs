00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:04.700
My name is Chris Jones and I was an insurance broker for 10 years. I

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:07.990
decided to make a career transition to
computers because I've always had a

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:09.380
passion for computers

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.910
I chose my computer career dot com

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.410
mainly because of the instructors and the
small classroom size

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.930
the instruction that you receive at my
computer career dot com

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.090
is really unmatched. it was on my pace

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.590
it allowed me to work one-on-one with
the instructors

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.800
to absorb the material, learn the
material and be able to apply it.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.610
you can come in early, you can stay late, and come in on an off-day

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.730
and the instructors will always be there
to help

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.809
even after you graduate. the other thing that appealed to me about my computer

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:45.190
career dot com was the career
counseling

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.000
that they do by local contacts with
companies around this

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.699
area, they get you the interview ahead of
somebody that may have just

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:56.090
submitted their resume online. currently I

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.870
am a Help Desk Technician at slido
dot net. the career services

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.040
contact with my particular company

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.210
was invaluable in order for me to get the job.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.070
the interview process involved some technical questions which my studies

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.540
here

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.750
and all the labs and lessons and classroom activities prepared me to answer those

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:16.240
questions.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.270
nowadays I am doing several

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.150
things that we learned through class.
personally for me

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.210
changing careers was a scary
proposition

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.710
Ibut now I actually love what I do

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.040
I like getting up every morning
facing new challenges

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.560
helping people every day and i cant say
that

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.180
you know I'm more excited than the
day that I graduated high school.

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.070
I really believe that you know over the
course of the next three to five years

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.070
the economy rebounds, salaries will
continue to rise

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.320
our skills will be even more in demand

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.600
based on all the new technologies
that are coming out

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:59.920
all the initiatives in health care

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.130
in the IT industry and government

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.929
making IT a more integral part of

00:02:06.929 --> 00:02:11.260
how they do business every day. So I
think the IT industry has a

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.319
tremendous upside and I think that

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:18.250
long-term success I'll surpass what I
used to make

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.030
being an insurance broker. I think
you won't find anybody better

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.660
than the folks at my computer career dot com

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.920
they really are like a family

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.270
it's not so much a school where you're a
number

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.980
they really take an interest in your
life, your situation and really craft

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.510
the program around you that will make
you a success.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.150
And I really wouldn't have gone anywhere else

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.880
in terms of the financial commitment to
come to school

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.560
it's a small price to pay when you think
long-term

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.860
and what kind of job you'll be working at

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.940
you'll be happier and I think you'll be more
successful

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.340
if you come to school here.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.590
