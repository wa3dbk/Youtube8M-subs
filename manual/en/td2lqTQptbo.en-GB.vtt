00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:09.460
Hey guys. This is Game On, I'm Grace and today
I'm going to be bringing you the gaming news.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:15.549
For starters, DayZ is about to get a lot harder.
Developer Dean Hall has let people know the

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:21.289
open world survival horror game's difficulty
is about to increase a whole bunch once new

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.480
vehicles and weapons are introduced. Apparently
vehicles in the game will be similar to the

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.930
architecture of items and weapons as in attachments
plus throwing and improvised weapons, hunting

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.900
and bow and arrow will all be coming online.
If you're one of the one million early access

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.760
adopters you're going to love this news and
if you've never played it before you might

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.080
want to give it a go it's absolutely great.
And hold tight because Hall says wait a month

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:56.210
if you're on the fence and he wants 80% more
put into the game before it's even complete.

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.199
Next up, The Witcher 3 Wild Hunt is a game
eagerly anticipated for 2014 but it looks

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.850
like it won't be coming to PS3 or Xbox 360.
In an interview with developer CD Projekt

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.480
RED CEO Martin Iwinscki it was revealed that
making the game for these consoles would be

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.900
impossible. Wild Hunt looks to be 30 times
the size of the old Witcher games so you can

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.160
look forward to some big style playing.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.610
And finally, Yoshi's New Island the upcoming
game from Nintendo that will have you carrying

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:31.430
little babies to safety such as Baby Mario
will be coming to Europe on March 14th. The

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.030
date reveal means it will be coming out the
same day as the American release so us Europeans

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.390
can get in on the fun. It's a follow up to
Yoshi's Island on the DS and will come out

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.080
on the 3DS with a similar art style.

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.470
Are you looking forward to it or would you
rather an up to date style rather than a remake?

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:51.860
