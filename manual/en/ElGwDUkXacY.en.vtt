Hey there, this is Matt. We are at part six of the SEO Exciter series. And this is going to be the last video that I'm going to talk a little bit about: the on page SEO strategies.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Then we're going to start talking a little bit more about the off-page stuff as well as a little bit more about social marketing and SEO

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:38.000
But the only thing I want to kind of cover a little bit in this video is the fact that we were talking a little bit about spiders in the last engine, about how the way that SEO works is that you're going to have major search engines like Google or Yahoo and they're going to send, electronically, visitors to your Web site.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
And those visitors are going to go and they're going to strip away a lot of the stuff on your Web site.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Now, the only thing that it's going to be able to determine are really things that are in your text.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Now, you've got to understand this and you've got to think about it a little bit more on the way that's structured.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:01:02.000
So if you have images on your Web site, remember that Google is not going to know what's on that image. It's going to know that there is an image there, it's going to know its name.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And then there's things, for example, if you were to go inóand again I'm getting technical on you, I'm sorryóbut I'm sure you've heard of the term in some of your content management systems, you know, things like ALT text.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000
And if I have an image Ö that I have, what I want to do is I want to be sure to identify some type of alternative text.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:50.000
And here's why: So, here is the; this is how you would code it. &lt;img src Ö and this is kind of the file name, you know, whatever: filename.jpg, but you want to make sure that we also add this ALT =, and maybe in this case I'm going to call it "StomperNet review image."

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Now, what actually happens here, and why this was created, was the fact that if a search engine or browser cannot find the file that you have, this is what you want to be printed there instead.
 
0:02:03.000,0:02:14.000
But the search engines and the search bots are going to use this information a little bit differently. It's going to use this information for relevancy to the page, as text that could appear on that page.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:26.000
So, you see what I'm kind of getting at here is this is another great place for you to put keywords and your LSI type of keywords into that even the public's not even going to see.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Using things on, like, your link bar that are full imagesóyou're playing a little bit of a risky game here, and we'll talk a little bit more about that when it comes to off page SEO and anchor text.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
But, again, use images as little as possible, and if you do use images be sure that you're going to include this ALT type of text there.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Now, a few of the other things that you want to keep in mind, too, is that Google can't read things like Java script.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:13.000
So if you have any weird little banners or weird text things that are written on your page, that are in the formóand you can go and look at the source of your pageóthat have the word "script" in it, in a tag here, and something else here, it can not read what's going on with this script that you've included on that page.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:24.000
So, some of the old-fashioned content management systems use things like Javascript to write a lot of the content on the page. And that, from an SEO standpoint, is complete disaster.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:38.000
So, you want to keep it basic. The more text that's on your page, the more that the search engines are going to find, and everything that is in that text that a viewer can be able to see, Google's gonna know it. And that's a very important thing.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Now, the other thing to keep in mind about these search engines, when they're coming out is, how often are they going to come out? Why are they gonna come out?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:57.000
This is going to be something that we're going to talk a little bit more about when we talk about off page, because we want Google to find our Web site. But once they find it, we want to give them a reason to continue coming back.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:13.000
And one of the main reasons why I always suggest for people who are just starting off, to start a blog, because a blog is a way to not only generate content easily and get a Web site up, but you can start writing it almost instantaneously and you can start building on it incrementally.

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And if Google starts noticing that you're writing in it three times a day, or three times a week or three times a month, it's going to start recognizing that, and it's going to record that pattern and it's going to start visiting your site more often.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
So the more that you write in it and the more that Google realizes this, the more that they're going to go back.

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:39.000
You know, there are Web sites out there like, let's just talk about Digg.com, which is a social bookmarking site.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:52.000
I hear that Google is on Digg.com thousands of times, probably even more, per day just to kind of find out what's going on, because it's just so dynamic and it's changing on a minute-by-minute basis.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000
Whereas maybe my blog that I post on maybe three to four times a week, it will come and visit about once a week right now.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:10.000
But it took some time for it to even go once a week, and remember, the Internet's an extremely big place and Google needs to determine where it wants to put its resources and which places it wants to go.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:23.000
So, if you're not producing new content, fresh content, consistent content, the search engines are not going to come to your Web site very often. If they're not coming, they're not going to be able to index you. If you're not indexed, you're not going to be in the search engines.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:30.000
OK, I'm going to continue on in a little bit. I'm going to talk a little bit more about off page optimization. Take it easy.
