How to Determine Which Catch Basin to Use
Hey, Dr. Drainage here to help you select

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.370
the right catch basin for your project.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.750
The first step to fixing any drainage problem
is to determine how much water needs to be

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:15.750
managed.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.210
I provide step by step instructions on how
to calculate runoff in my “How to Calculate

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.480
Runoff” video.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.739
You need to know how much water will be draining
to your catch basin in order to select the

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:26.990
right catch basin for your project.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.990
Let’s begin.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.319
How to Determine What Size Catch Basin You
Need

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:34.800
Catch basins are an effective way to collect
surface water that is draining to one specific

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.460
area, like a low spot in the yard or below
a rain gutter downspout.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.320
Surface water flows through the grate on the
catch basin then exits through a drain pipe

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.800
connected to the basin.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.330
There are several sizes of catch basins.

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:53.760
To determine which catch basin is needed,
you need to check the flow capacity of both

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.120
the grate and the outlet where the drain pipe
connects to the basin.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.030
Flow capacity tables have been created for
each catch basin.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:09.229
These tables show the grates that fit each
basin and their corresponding flow capacities.

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.509
The outlet flow capacities are also shown
for each basin.

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:18.869
To determine if a particular catch basin will
work for your situation, follow the following

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.869
steps:
1.

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.469
Calculate the runoff draining to the location
of the basin

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:26.829
2.

00:01:26.829 --> 00:01:29.659
Find the table for the catch basin you want
to install

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.350
3.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.700
Compare the runoff calculated in step 1 to
the Flow Rate for both the grate and the outlet.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.759
These Flow Rates must be larger than the calculated
runoff.

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:49.090
If these rates are greater than the calculated
runoff, then this basin will work for your

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:50.390
project.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.909
If either of these values is less than the
calculated runoff, then you must use a larger

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:56.909
basin.
