How to Create Flatter Seams when Pressing
Your Quilt Blocks

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:13.000
When following many quilting patterns we are
frequently told to press seams to one side

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.640
-- which is easy to do, but can leave a lot
of bulk that makes the top more difficult

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.500
to quilt.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.190
Or alternatively we are told to press the
seams open.

00:00:24.190 --> 00:00:30.410
If the quilt is heavily used, the threads
on an open seam are more conducive to breakage

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.600
This is also more time consuming and can result
in burnt fingers

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.149
One successful compromise is using a "twisted
seam".

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:45.679
This actually results in breaking a few threads
in the center (where a lot of bulk is) and

00:00:45.679 --> 00:00:51.069
allowing the seams to naturally fan out around
a center point.

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:56.659
To employ this technique effectively, it is
helpful to use 100% cotton thread for piecing

00:00:56.659 --> 00:00:58.019
your blocks.

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:03.579
I personally prefer Aurifill (a 50 weight
high quality cotton thread).

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.930
Hold the two opposing seams between your thumb
and forefinger.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.180
Push one side away from you and the other
toward you.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.900
If you are wondering which side to push away,
look to see that a consistent rotation of

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:18.360
the seams is created.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.570
This should cause the center to pop open -- creating
a little four patch.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.270
If it doesn't open up, you can use your seam
ripper to break a few of the center threads

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.800
that are in the seam allowance.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:36.800
You can now press the seams in a rotating
direction, creating a much flatter quilt block.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.710
One added feature of this technique is that
this will also allow your blocks to nest together

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:46.170
-- allowing for perfectly matching points
with minimal bulk.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.750
Here I have joined the two blocks together
using the same pressing technique.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:57.090
If you are interested in purchasing a pattern
for Tad, Ted and Theodore which uses the blocks

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:07.570
demonstrated in this video or in additional

Thanks for watching.
