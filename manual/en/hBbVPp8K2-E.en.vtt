Hello everyone it's Janelle!

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.421
and today's video will be a

00:00:05.451 --> 00:00:06.921
Paris inspired nail tutorial

00:00:16.671 --> 00:00:17.896
For this look you'll need a red white

00:00:17.896 --> 00:00:19.183
and blue for the French flag

00:00:19.967 --> 00:00:20.756
A dark pink and a black polish

00:00:22.295 --> 00:00:24.116
A pink glitter polish for the accent nail

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:25.795
Yeah I couldn't resist

00:00:26.016 --> 00:00:27.295
It is the city of light after all

00:00:28.235 --> 00:00:30.267
I also used striping tape to make clean lines

00:00:30.267 --> 00:00:32.491
but you can use regular scotch tape instead

00:00:33.083 --> 00:00:34.736
Or make your stripes using a striping brush

00:00:35.423 --> 00:00:36.136
As for the tools

00:00:36.136 --> 00:00:37.483
I used a thin striping brush

00:00:37.483 --> 00:00:38.471
for the detailed work

00:00:38.471 --> 00:00:40.551
and a thicker brush for the bigger shapes

00:00:41.236 --> 00:00:42.315
Both of these are from the same set

00:00:43.244 --> 00:00:44.964
and you will also need a base and topcoat

00:00:45.195 --> 00:00:46.591
to prep and finish your nails

00:00:54.875 --> 00:00:56.495
First prep your nails with base coat

00:01:04.248 --> 00:01:05.876
For the base of the French flag

00:01:05.876 --> 00:01:07.035
apply white polish

00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:11.287
Make sure the polish is dry

00:01:11.287 --> 00:01:12.740
and then apply striping tape or

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.936
scotch tape like so

00:01:15.255 --> 00:01:17.016
create a band of red polish on top

00:01:23.348 --> 00:01:24.176
remove your tape

00:01:26.744 --> 00:01:27.948
and then create one more band

00:01:27.948 --> 00:01:29.075
of blue polish on the bottom

00:01:34.187 --> 00:01:35.144
This is optional but

00:01:35.144 --> 00:01:36.180
you can use a thin brush

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.776
dipped in black to write the word "Paris"

00:01:57.504 --> 00:01:58.772
For the pointer you're going to apply

00:01:58.772 --> 00:02:00.097
another base color in white

00:02:01.137 --> 00:02:02.808
I used quite a lot of white in this look

00:02:05.732 --> 00:02:06.357
and to make some stripes

00:02:06.357 --> 00:02:08.008
I applied striping tape like so

00:02:09.748 --> 00:02:11.508
and I filled in the stripes with pink

00:02:23.213 --> 00:02:24.237
with the thicker nail art brush

00:02:24.237 --> 00:02:24.997
and black polish

00:02:25.121 --> 00:02:26.657
make an oval shape for the beret

00:02:32.265 --> 00:02:33.745
and then add a little line on the top

00:02:33.745 --> 00:02:35.004
and on the bottom edges

00:02:38.461 --> 00:02:39.145
to make the mustache

00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:39.937
make two dots

00:02:43.393 --> 00:02:44.736
then sweep outwards in a curve

00:02:44.736 --> 00:02:45.877
to finish off the mustache

00:02:58.345 --> 00:03:00.597
for the middle finger apply white once again

00:03:04.224 --> 00:03:05.917
then with your striping brush

00:03:05.917 --> 00:03:06.757
dipped in black

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:07.934
make two curved lines

00:03:07.934 --> 00:03:09.889
to start creating the eiffel tower shape

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.001
 I added a thicker line to the top

00:03:18.291 --> 00:03:19.683
and a small half circle to the bottom

00:03:23.131 --> 00:03:23.823
add another platform

00:03:23.823 --> 00:03:25.078
two thirds of the way up

00:03:25.078 --> 00:03:25.734
to the top

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:29.999
and another one right above

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:30.962
your half circle

00:03:34.378 --> 00:03:35.751
finish off the base with two lines

00:03:37.719 --> 00:03:38.539
then add an upside down

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:39.819
V shape in the center

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.924
now just fill in tower shape

00:03:43.924 --> 00:03:45.179
with a crosshatch pattern

00:03:58.171 --> 00:03:58.903
to make a little heart

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:00.072
add two dots with pink

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:03.260
then drag down in a V shape

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.499
for the ring finger apply pink

00:04:13.785 --> 00:04:14.733
let that dry and then

00:04:14.733 --> 00:04:16.965
apply your pink glitter polish on top

00:04:27.677 --> 00:04:29.482
The Red Balloon is a timless short film

00:04:29.482 --> 00:04:31.081
that was made in the 1950's

00:04:31.657 --> 00:04:33.030
It's about a little boy and his friend

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:33.925
the red balloon

00:04:34.322 --> 00:04:35.702
and it was shot in Paris, France

00:04:36.402 --> 00:04:36.891
If you want to watch it

00:04:36.891 --> 00:04:38.063
It's only thirty minutes long

00:04:38.063 --> 00:04:38.964
and it's on YouTube

00:04:39.287 --> 00:04:40.635
I'll provide a video link below

00:04:42.683 --> 00:04:44.044
Apply a white polish to the pinky

00:04:46.564 --> 00:04:47.583
And with your thicker nail art brush

00:04:47.583 --> 00:04:49.664
and red polish make a balloon shape

00:04:56.039 --> 00:04:56.811
Then make the balloon string

00:04:56.811 --> 00:04:58.295
using black and your thin brush

00:05:03.536 --> 00:05:04.871
Make sure all of your nails are dry

00:05:04.871 --> 00:05:06.655
and then seal your designs with topcoat

00:05:09.576 --> 00:05:10.700
And now you're finished!
