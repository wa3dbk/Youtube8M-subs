your first step is to use locking pliers
or a fuel line clamp to close the fuel

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:45.210
line

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.390

fuel line off

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.710
be aware some gasoline may spill out

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:59.710
next use a socket to remove the nut
securing the air filter housing

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:05.220
detach the breather tube and pull the
housing off

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.910
slide the old carburetor and gaskets off
the mounting bolts and rotate the

linkages to the new carburetor

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:36.860
slide the carburetor onto the bolts and
position the front gasket

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:42.549
reposition the air filter housing and
insert the breather tube into the rocker

reconnect the fuel line

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.460
secure the clamp

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.920
and remove the locking pliers or fuel
