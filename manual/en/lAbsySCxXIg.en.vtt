00:00:06.322 --> 00:00:10.322
&nbsp;      We’ve been here in Barcelona now 
for the last 24 hours

00:00:10.322 --> 00:00:17.872
&nbsp;      and had a number of meetings with the 
GSMA board, and CEO round tables.

00:00:17.872 --> 00:00:21.558
&nbsp;      And we had a big event this morning 
where a few CEO’s and I

00:00:21.558 --> 00:00:26.957
&nbsp;      made a presentation about the status 
of the world of mobility.

00:00:26.957 --> 00:00:31.605
&nbsp;      And I think what you’ve heard was 
there is nothing but general enthusiasm

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:36.753
&nbsp;      about mobility, that we are coming off 
a high of the last 5 years

00:00:36.753 --> 00:00:42.008
&nbsp;      where the smart phone revolution has 
seen this unbelievable amount of traffic

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:45.197
&nbsp;      and new innovation and 
new advancement and new devices.

00:00:45.197 --> 00:00:48.095
&nbsp;      But what’s really intriguing 
and what’s really exciting

00:00:48.095 --> 00:00:50.968
&nbsp;      is we’ve now entered the world 
of LTE and the Cloud

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:53.047
&nbsp;      and we’re calling 
it the Cloud Era.

00:00:53.047 --> 00:00:57.348
&nbsp;      And what we’re basically anticipating 
is while the last five years

00:00:57.348 --> 00:00:59.057
&nbsp;      may have been exciting, 
the next five years

00:00:59.057 --> 00:01:01.695
&nbsp;      we think is going 
to be even more exciting.

00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:05.783
&nbsp;      In fact I am standing right here 
in front of one of our booths here

00:01:05.783 --> 00:01:08.448
&nbsp;      at the Mobile World Congress where 
we’re showing what this new world

00:01:08.448 --> 00:01:10.532
&nbsp;      looks like 
with LTE and the Cloud.

00:01:10.532 --> 00:01:12.018
&nbsp;      You see the automobiles?

00:01:12.018 --> 00:01:14.895
&nbsp;      We’re going to have automobiles 
connected to our network.

00:01:14.895 --> 00:01:18.812
&nbsp;      In fact, we announced this morning, 
a big deal with General Motors

00:01:18.812 --> 00:01:22.122
&nbsp;      where the beginning of 2014, 
the General Motors automobiles

00:01:22.122 --> 00:01:24.967
&nbsp;      are going to be connected 
to the AT&amp;T network.

00:01:24.967 --> 00:01:27.622
&nbsp;      Glen Lurie says it best, 
“We’re about to have a world

00:01:27.622 --> 00:01:30.592
&nbsp;      where the smart phone 
is going to be on wheels”.

00:01:30.592 --> 00:01:31.835
&nbsp;      It’s a connected car.

00:01:31.835 --> 00:01:34.608
&nbsp;      This is an exciting time 
as automobile manufactures

00:01:34.608 --> 00:01:38.097
&nbsp;      begin to think about a world 
of connectivity in the automobile.

00:01:38.097 --> 00:01:39.733
&nbsp;      There is also behind 
us here

00:01:39.733 --> 00:01:42.380
&nbsp;      a demonstration 
of our Digital Life platform.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.262
&nbsp;      Not only are we connecting the car, 
but in the world of wireless

00:01:45.262 --> 00:01:47.482
&nbsp;      we’re now connecting 
the home as well.

00:01:47.482 --> 00:01:50.503
&nbsp;      And so this is really exciting 
because now more and more people

00:01:50.503 --> 00:01:53.320
&nbsp;      are going to be able to take 
advantage of this world of mobility,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.298
&nbsp;      and 
high speed internet access.

00:01:55.298 --> 00:01:59.633
&nbsp;      The last five years has been five years 
where its changed the telecom industry

00:01:59.633 --> 00:02:01.880
&nbsp;      like never before, 
it’s been exciting.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.858
&nbsp;      LTE and the Cloud takes us to a place 
where it will change every industry.

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:07.690
&nbsp;      There will be 
no industry untouched.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.687
&nbsp;      Again, think about what’s behind me, 
the automobile industry.

00:02:10.687 --> 00:02:14.742
&nbsp;      The experience behind the wheel 
is not going to be the same again.

00:02:14.742 --> 00:02:18.273
&nbsp;      The experience within the home, 
as you begin to connect the home

00:02:18.273 --> 00:02:20.830
&nbsp;      and automate the home; 
how we think about the home

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.277
&nbsp;      and home automation 
will never be the same again.

00:02:23.277 --> 00:02:26.458
&nbsp;      The healthcare industry is not going 
to be the same again

00:02:26.458 --> 00:02:30.917
&nbsp;      after the world of mobility and LTE and 
Cloud begin to transform that industry.

00:02:30.917 --> 00:02:34.422
&nbsp;      Financial services and how 
the consumer conducts commerce

00:02:34.422 --> 00:02:38.785
&nbsp;      using their device to buy goods 
and to coupon and so forth.

00:02:38.785 --> 00:02:42.175
&nbsp;      The Financial services industry we 
don’t believe will be the same again

00:02:42.175 --> 00:02:45.982
&nbsp;      so every industry is going to experience 
radical change over the next 5 years.

00:02:45.982 --> 00:02:47.838
&nbsp;      This is fun. 
This is the best industry.

00:02:47.838 --> 00:02:49.820
&nbsp;      If anybody wants to work 
in a different industry,

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.428
&nbsp;      I can’t imagine why because there 
is nothing quite like this one.

00:02:52.428 --> 00:02:55.002
