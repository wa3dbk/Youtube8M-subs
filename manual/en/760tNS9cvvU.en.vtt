00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.900
- There boy, there.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:26.840
Malmberget, November.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.920
Lars Öderyd and his two year old hunting dog Astok go moose-hunting.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:40.160
The wind is weak.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.360
The hunter will find it difficult to get close to any wildlife.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.740
If the Jämthund will find any moose today.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.980
In the world, it is only in Sweden and Scandinavia, that moose hunters hunt in this way with the moose hounds.

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:59.540
A collaboration between man and animal with a very long tradition.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.880
Later in the day the wind picks up.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:07.620
It helps to hide the footsteps in the snow.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.340
- In weather like this, it is not too difficult. Because the wind is blowing so hard,

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.100
but of course one always takes into account that you are walking hidden behind firs and so on.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.340
So that the moose can not see you.

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.320
Despite the strong wind, they can of course see you.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:25.540
- They are very sensitive to movement, particularly lateral movement,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.060
so you have to take care to come from the right direction when you move in on the dog's barking.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.080
The female moose is considerably annoyed.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.020
Although it is allowed to shoot the calves,

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.900
Lasse thinks that sometimes it can be just as rewarding

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.160
to just study how Astok and the moose interact.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.840
- We must let them live too occasionally, sometimes it is enough just to look at them.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.060
- I'd rather hunt on bare ground than snow, I do.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.380
Sometimes the strangest things happen in the forest.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.909
- Let's move in and scare it away.

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.020
An apparently motherless calf is chased away.

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.880
Astok feels a faint favorite scent.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.860
Soon, you hear the barking.

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.960
Some hunters believe that the moose hound is ruined, if you do not always shoot the moose at the barking.

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.980
A theory that Lasse does not believe in.

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:52.640
"Predators're accustomed to that hunts sometimes fail," he says.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.840
Astok barks nearly 100 times per minute.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.620
Sometimes the 6.5 will speak.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.720
- That one was good.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:37.300
Despite a perfect shot, the moose ran 150 meters before it fell.

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:51.540
Food is prepared for the winter.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:57.540
A new hunt awaits.

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:13.640
