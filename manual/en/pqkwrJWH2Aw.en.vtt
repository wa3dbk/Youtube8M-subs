00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.900
When you're looking at static-control
flooring, make sure that you view

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.200
an end-user environment completely different than you 
look at a manufacturing production environment.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.400
These are very different spaces.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.900
If you're looking at the use of static-control
flooring in an end-user environment–

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:33.800
maybe it's a 9-1-1 call center, maybe it's a server room,
a computer room, a data center, or war room–

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.800
then you should be looking at flooring
from the perspective of

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.733
will it prevent static on people 
wearing regular shoes

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.200
If it's an ESD-protected environment
where components are handled ,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.000
you're going to be looking at it as a grounding 
mechanism using static-control shoes.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.400
Second distinction in an end-user environment:
you need to worry about safety.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.500
The reason you need to worry about safety is there 
are no monitors used to determine

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.000
whether people's shoes are too conductive.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.100
There are actually grounding standards that 
we can utilize and that we can require

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:13.600
in some cases our contractors, our general 
contractors and our installers to follow.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.000
So the three main standards: 
one is put up by a group called ATIS

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.299
which is the Association of 
Telecommunications People,

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.700
so it's going to be people like 
Lucent, Alcatel, Cisco–

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:29.500
anyone building product that is used 
in the communications world.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.490
The second group is Motorola themselves,

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.300
the people who make the wireless
communication devices,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.900
and then the last standard that 
we refer to is put out by the FAA,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.300
and what's interesting, these three 
standards are all basically unrelated

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.800
and yet when it comes to flooring they all agree on what 
type of electrical properties the flooring should have.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.900
So we've got three documents out.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:55.800
We have FAA019e.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.000
We have Motorola r56

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.800
We have ATIS 0600321.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.300
All these documents are all 
available on ESDtile.com

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.600
Now let's get into safety a little 
bit, just so everybody understands

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.100
why we should even be thinking about it.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.800
In electricity there's a number of laws, just like Newton's 
Law and whatever other law you want to refer to.

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:22.200
In electricity we have one called Ohm's Law

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.000
and Ohm's Law is basically an equation 
that uses three variables:

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.900
voltage,  current and resistance.

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:36.810
When we talk about protecting ourselves from short 
circuits of electricity–in other words

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.400
from being part of a circuit 
that's very dangerous–

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.800
one of the things that can protect us is resistance.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.500
Maybe a good analogy 
for you to think about is

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.800
if we were going to be pulling the
charge away very rapidly

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.500
that would be the equivalent of standing 
in a couple of inches of water

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.000
as you walk up to the circuit breaker in your house

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.900
Obviously everyone knows you don't do that.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.400
With the other end, we don't want the floor
to drain static electricity so slowly that

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.600
it behaves like the carpet 
in your living room

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.300
because obviously we all know the carpet
 in our living rooms charges us up.

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.400
So when we look at floors what 
we're actually trying to do

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:17.000
is find a floor that somewhere  is in between two 
inches of water and the carpet and your living room.

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.200
Something in the middle there–

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.600
in our industry, we call
that the sweet spot–

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.900
and fortunately, we have these documents–

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.500
the ATIS document, the Motorola 
document, the FAA document–

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.600
to guide us and if you look 
at all these documents

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:38.200
they tell you specifically what that ohms rating is 
supposed to be and what it's not supposed to be.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.800
So we have three options right 
now in the world of carpet.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.000
We have what's called 
computer grade carpet,

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.400
we have what's called 
ESD grade carpet tile,

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.600
and then we have what's called 
operational equipment grade.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.800
ESD grade carpet tile has been in 
use for probably 20 years

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.200
and these three standards that I mentioned 
before–ATIS, Motorola and FAA–

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.200
have recently revised their
electrical specifications

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.600
and they no longer approve ESD grade 
carpet tile because it's too conductive

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.800
and by too conductive I mean that the ohms rating 
of the ESD grade carpet tile starts out too low.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.000
It starts out of 25,000 ohms and
goes up to a million ohms.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.000
What we're looking for is something 
that starts out at a million ohms

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.570
and goes up to about a 
hundred million ohms.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.800
We don't like computer grade
carpet tile for these spaces

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:35.400
because we've discovered it only prevents 
people from getting static shocks.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:43.200
It does not prevent circuit boards inside of servers 
from being disrupted by static charges

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.100
and that's because when you eliminate 
a shock hazard using the floor,

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:53.500
all you're doing is preventing the floor from 
generating charges over 3,500 volts.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:59.800
Computer equipment is sensitive to 20, 40, 
50, very low numbers of volts.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.900
That brings us to the third type of carpet,

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:04.900
what we're calling operational 
equipment grade carpet,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:10.600
and what this carpet is made to do is to drain static 
electricity but to do it at a controlled rate

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:18.400
and to do it with an ohms rating that allows you 
the possibility of touching voltage

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:24.600
and the floor not being so conductive that it's going 
to become a harmful path to ground.

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.729
So you'll read some of these 
documents that I mentioned

00:05:27.729 --> 00:05:33.200
and they'll say "safe for use around
energized equipment."

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.000
All they mean when they say energized equipment 
is something that's plugged into the wall.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.600
Could be a printer, could be your
computer, could be a console in a call center.

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.159
Anything that's plugged into the
wall, if its operating it's energized.

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.000
What we're trying to do is find flooring 
that eliminates static electricity

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.800
but can be used around energized equipment

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.300
So criteria for end-user:

00:05:54.600 --> 00:06:00.600
we want a static dissipative floor,
we want the floor to prevent static electricity,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.100
regardless of footwear.

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:05.800
In an electronics handling environment,
we want a conductive floor,

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:12.800
we want that floor to work in conjunction with some 
kind of conductive or static dissipative footwear.
