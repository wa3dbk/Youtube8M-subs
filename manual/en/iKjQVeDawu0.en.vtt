My name is Madeline Franco and I am here to
talk about birds, specifically about parrots

00:00:03.811 --> 00:00:07.860
and more specifically in this segment about
where parrots get their food. Well if you

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:11.610
are talking about my parrots they get their
food from me but if you are talking about

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.079
parrots in the wild generally a lot of them
are seed eaters, fruit eaters, the ones that

00:00:18.079 --> 00:00:25.519
are in the tropics of course have a wide variety
a virtual smorgisbord available to them. Molokins

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:30.630
like coconut. They like particularly young
coconut. They are the big, the Molokin is

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.090
the large peach colored parrot that is native
to the islands of Molokas. They are somewhat

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.470
endangered or highly endangered actually.
But they do like coconut. They do like fruits

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:50.440
and vegetables. They do like nuts. Some of
the South American birds and many of the birds

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:57.230
will eat palm nuts. There seems to be something
in the palm nut as far as their immune system

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.570
but when we have them living among us we like
to feed them a pelleted diet which has been

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.670
researched heavily and formulated to balance
their diet. Also we like to give them fruits

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.580
and vegetables, rice, beans, got to go easy
on the soybeans though because they do contain

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:19.590
a fair amount of protein and that could cause
some stress to your bird's system and we just

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.649
try to give them as balanced diet as much
as we can, trying to replicate as much as

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.780
we can what they can get in the wild. A lot
of people like to feed their birds and the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.909
birds do really love it, they like to feed
them pomegranates which are a very good antioxidant

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:38.389
but just be aware that if you feed them something
like that that is somewhat colorful and messy

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:44.689
you may have to redecorate. You probably want
to exercise caution or put that in an area

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:49.259
where you can definitely do some cleaning
afterwards. Wear a raincoat if you are going

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.609
to feed pomegranate, that would be my advice.
They really do get into their food. Parrots

00:01:54.609 --> 00:02:00.310
will very often pick at something if they
have access to bananas and things like that.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:06.859
What I'll do is I'll give them little pieces
of fruit because they will tend to waist a

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:12.630
lot if give them an entire apple they may
just take one or two bites. One of the great

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.240
things about corn on the cob I like to give
my birds sometimes every once in a while I

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.490
will give them a cob of corn with the leaves
still on it and have them open the corn and

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.750
therefore it becomes a foraging item and also
a toy so use your imagination when feeding

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.680
your birds. Remember they need a balanced
diet like you do and you'll have a lot of

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.200
fun discovering new things that they like
to eat. Again go easy on nuts of all kinds.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.180
Many of the larger birds some of the Macaws,
the Hyacinths can have a diet consisting primarily

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.620
of nuts but for the other birds you want to
limit their intake of nuts.
