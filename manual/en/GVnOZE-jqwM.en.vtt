00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:04.060
In this fashion video I am going to show you
two different winter outfits that I like very

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:11.060
much. One is more of a day look and the other
for a night out. I hope you enjoy.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:00.120
The first look is quite elegant but the jacket
and the boots give it a bit of this rock vibe.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.869
I think this outfit is perfect for a concert,
party or an evening out with your friends.

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:09.709
Now, since I live in Norway, it is still a
bit cold for me to wear this as it is freezing

00:01:09.709 --> 00:01:14.409
cold here. But if you live somewhere where
the climate is milder you can easily wear

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:21.409
this throughout the winter.

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:51.389
I purchased this black faux leather jacket at H&amp;M. I really like how it's fitted; it's
a bit shorter style which makes it look a

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:56.419
bit edgy. A leather jacket like this one is
a great transitional piece which you can wear

00:01:56.419 --> 00:02:03.419
all year round. It looks great with dresses,
jeans, casual as well as elegant outfits.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.610
Under the jacket I am just wearing this grey
dress or a tank top or whatever you want to

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:27.610
call it. It is quite plain and it has this
ruffle detailing which I love.

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.750
Then I put on these black tights that look
like jeans and also have this faux leather

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.090
stripe on the sides.
For the shoes I am wearing the black riding

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.090
boots, they are super comfy and warm.
As for the accessories I kept it quite simple,

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.970
I'm wearing the black &amp; grey long necklace,
a ring and a black sparkly headband.

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.600
Almost forgot a scarf! It's essential in
the winter to keep you warm. I wear this

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:12.600
one literally almost every day, it goes with
everything and it's super soft.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:21.260
Lastly I added this little black bag which
I bought in Mango.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.240
I think this next outfit it's just so adorable
and I am wearing it loads this year. I am

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:38.500
a total comfort freak when it comes to clothes
and this one is a perfect combination of warm,

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:45.500
comfy and cute which is a bingo for me.
I am wearing this gorgeous sweater which I

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:12.930
I am wearing this gorgeous sweater which I purchased on sale in H&amp;M. it is quite long which I like as I can wear it with tights.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:19.109
But it is still nicely fitted and so cozy
and soft. And the best part is of course this

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:25.960
adorable giant Bambi on the front. How cute
is he?! And I don't care how old I am because

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.960
I can still love Bambi, you know :P. It was one of my favorite
fairytales when I was little by the way.

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:37.150
As for accessorizes, I am wearing this brown
stone bracelet as well as a bracelet which

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:42.689
you can also wear as a necklace and is made
of tiny tan colored stones. And then I am

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:47.490
also wearing this long gold necklace with
stones and charms which goes perfectly with

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:51.919
the outfit, I think.
I also put on some blue tights that

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:58.389
look like jeans and leg warmers to keep me
warm on this cold day.

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.319
And for the shoes I am wearing these brown ankle

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:07.319
booties with a bit of a heel, but they are
still very comfortable to walk in.

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:11.680
And then I also have this little bag in the
same brown color as the shoes. I love the

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:15.729
faux fur detailing on it and I think it just goes
perfectly with this outfit.

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:21.960
Lastly I put on some gloves to keep
my hands warm.

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.180
And this is the complete outfit! It's great
for the days when you want something very

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:33.180
comfortable and warm but still want to look
a bit dressy and cute.

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:40.759
I hope you liked my two winter looks or maybe
got some inspiration for yourself, but remember

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:51.430
its still winter, so keep warm guys!

00:05:57.819 --> 00:05:58.259
