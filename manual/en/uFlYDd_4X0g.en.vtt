00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.000
In one month you recycle over 200 tonnes of glass

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and a 100 tonnes of plastic bottles. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
We can all help reduce Westminster's carbon footprint. 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So let's start by taking a look at what you can and can't recycle.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Newspapers and magazines, junk mail, computer paper and cardboard are all recyclable.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.500
We can't currently take Tetrapaks in our doorstep collections.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.500
We'll tell you what to do with those a little later. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Glass jars and bottles can all be recycled.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
But remember to remove the lids.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Please dont recycle Pyrex, broken windows, lightbulbs or glass cookware.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.500
Most plastic bottles are suitable for recycling. 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:58.000
But we can't take plastic packaging

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
such as yoghurt pots, cling film, carrier bags and polystyrene.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The vast majority of tins and cans we use are recyclable,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
as are empty aerosol cans.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.500
We can't take tin foil, takeaway containers or crisp packets.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
To recap: you can recycle mixed paper and card, glass bottles and jars,

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
plastic bottles, and food and drinks cans.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.500
And if you're still unsure, check the A to Z on our website www.westminster.gov.uk/recyclingatoz.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.500
Many houses and small mansion blocks have a weekly doorstep collection. 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.500
Find out what day and time yours is on our website www.westminster.gov.uk/recycling.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000
You can also go online to order more blue recycling bags and baskets.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Or simply give us a call on the number onscreen 020 7641 2000.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.500
All of Westminster's estates and many larger mansion blocks

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.500
have their own dedicated recycling bins for 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.500
paper and card, glass, plastic bottles and tins.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
For those that don't. There are more than 140 micro-recycling centres dotted across the borough.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000
Some of these sites have Scope charity bins, for unwanted clothes,

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.500
fabrics and shoes.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.500
We've also introduced a scheme at 13 sites to recycle Tetrapak cartons.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Before you put your recycling out, there are a couple of things to do first.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Please rinse out anything contaminated with food or liquid,

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.500
as these can attract vermin.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Flattening carboard boxes, cans and plastic bottles,

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.500
allows you to fit more in your recycling.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Please don't leave any other rubbish at our recycling sites,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
and please be careful to put the right item in the right bin

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
as mixed loads may be rejected.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.500
All of Westminster's recycling is sent to a local sorting facility,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.000
where the different materials are separated.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.500
The materials are then reprocessed mostly here in the UK

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
back into all sorts of useful things.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:54.000
Glass is used in a road surfacing product.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.000
Some of it has even been used in Westminster's streets.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.500
Paper and cardboard is cleaned, pulped and made into huge rolls of new paper or packaging.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.500
Food and drinks cans are melted down and can become anything

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.000
from new drinks cans to household appliances.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.500
Plastic bottles are made into all sorts of products,

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.500
from plastic pellets to new drinks bottles.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
