Have you ever seen a combination of numbers and letters on the side of library items and wondered what they were?

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.700
These are call numbers and they tell you where to find an item. The first section refers to the subject area of the item. 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.433
Read the first part in alphabetical order and the second part as a whole number.

00:00:22.433 --> 00:00:27.933
The next section is a combination of a letter and a number which refers to the item's author.

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:31.633
Read the letter alphabetically and read the number as a decimal.

00:00:31.633 --> 00:00:38.366
The final section refers to the year of  publication.This is important to note since newer editions of the same item will have  

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:44.799
the same call number except the publications year will be updated. These are organized in chronological order.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.900
There might be a volume number at the end  too if the item is part of the series or multivolume set.

00:00:50.900 --> 00:01:00.100
Items are put on the shelf in the library according to call numbers so items with  similar subjects will be close to each other.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:08.666
Use the library catalogue to determine in which library the item is located. If you click on the location you get more information about 

00:01:08.666 --> 00:01:15.232
where to find the item. For example, DBW stack use the book is in the stacks in the D.B. Weldon Library.

00:01:15.233 --> 00:01:18.833
TAY stack is in the stacks at the Taylor library.

00:01:18.833 --> 00:01:25.166

00:01:25.166 --> 00:01:31.166
The catalogue might also include information about how long the item can be borrowed for. 

00:01:31.166 --> 00:01:35.466

00:01:35.466 --> 00:01:42.566

00:01:47.333 --> 00:01:54.699
For example, in Taylor you'll have to find the correct floor location based on the type of material and the call number.  Use the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:02.933
call number ranges at the top of each shelf to find which shelf your item is on.Then follow the call number sequence to get your book.

00:02:02.933 --> 00:02:07.566

00:02:07.566 --> 00:02:13.632
the library.  You can always ask the staff at the Service Desk for more help if you need it.
