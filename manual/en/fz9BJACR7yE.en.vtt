00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.279
Metro ExpressLanes give LA County drivers
the option to choose faster travel times,

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.769
help ease traffic congestion, and earn rewards
through the Carpool Loyalty Program.

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:11.730
Here’s how it works.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.680
Eligible carpools, vanpools, and motorcycles
can use the Metro ExpressLanes toll-free,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.609
24 hours a day, with the required FasTrak
mounted on the inside of the windshield in

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.250
this location or this location.

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:31.599
On the I-110 Freeway – between the 91 freeway
and Adams Bl in downtown Los Angeles, carpools

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:34.930
with two occupants should set the FasTrak
to “2”.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.500
When they do, their 2-person carpool trip
is automatically enrolled in the Loyalty Program

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.320
to earn gift card rewards.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.940
The more carpool trips, the more chances to
win every month.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:52.050
On the I-10 Freeway– between I-605 and Alameda
St in downtown Los Angeles – 3 people are

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.600
required to be a carpool at peak commute times.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:01.030
Monday through Friday, 5am-9am and 4pm to
7pm.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:05.280
The FasTrak must be set to “3” for a free
carpool.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:12.960
During non-peak commute times Monday through
Friday, 9am-4pm and all day Saturday and Sunday,

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.030
the FasTrak must be set to “2” or “3”
for a toll-free carpool trip.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:24.570
By doing so, your carpool trip is automatically
entered in the Loyalty Program, and when traveling

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.350
as a 3-or-more person carpool, you are entered
to win higher value gift card rewards.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:36.180
Remember, motorcycles should set their FasTrak
to “3” at all times to ensure toll-free

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.180
travel.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.890
With the Metro ExpressLanes Carpool Loyalty
Program, you’re always on the move and earning

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:42.890
rewards.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.369
It’s about time.
