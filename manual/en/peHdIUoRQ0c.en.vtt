00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:04.740
Okay, so now I'm going to talk a little bit
more about your brushes. And sort of, how

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:10.120
you're going to use them and what you're going
to use them for. The little brushes are great

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:16.509
for detail. So, save those for the end. You're
going to start with your bigger brushes, then

00:00:16.509 --> 00:00:21.200
your medium brushes. And you're going to end
up with the little brushes. So don't start

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.590
with these. These are for details. Make sure
that you have really clean ends on these,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:32.550
because, and this one's a little bit bent,
your line is going to be bent. So be careful

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.680
with that. Make sure that your brushes, especially
the detail, the small ones are really nice

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.710
and straight like that one is. Then the middle
size brushes are great and especially if you

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:53.239
have these ones that are little angles at
the top, because it’s really great for doing

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.470
lines. Just sort of pushing the paint and
I'll show you more about this when I actually

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.960
start painting. But these are really nice
to have for that sort of middle size line,

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:12.110
and for really controlling the shape of the
line, as opposed to the flatter brush. You

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.280
just don't have quite as much control. They're
good for coverage but not as much control.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:26.799
And then the larger brushes, you really want
to, these are great obviously to start with

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:33.310
and for the most coverage. What you want to
be aware of is when you're painting you're

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:42.390
going to see some of the brush marks. So don't,
don't get really hard bristle brushes, cause

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.410
you'll see more brush marks with those. You
want to try to get the softer brushes and

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:56.170
then when you're doing a large surface area,
make sure that you’re going over, like the

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:03.500
area. You're sort of going in a circular motion
so that the paint isn't drying with the brush

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.929
marks in it. So that's pretty much you want,
what you want to look out for, in terms of

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:14.719
your brush sizes and you know, what you're
going to be using them for basically. And

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:21.670
how often do you replace brushes? I've had
some of these brushes for so many years, I

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.700
can't even remember. If you have good brushes
and you take care of them, and I know these

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.829
have paint on them and whatever. But the point
is you need to clean them right away. You

00:02:30.829 --> 00:02:35.510
always need to make sure that you don't let
the paint dry in your brushes. And if you

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.309
take care of them they will last a long time.
So, make sure you do that.
