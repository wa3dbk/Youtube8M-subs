How to make a Washing Machine and/or Tumble Dryer

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:14.660
I have a few different designs for you.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:26.760
Some look and function more like a washing machine while others like tumble dryers..

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:55.940
If you use a cauldron, you can actually wash dyes out of your armor, making it function more like a washing machine!

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:47.420
You can of course take parts of one design and add it to another.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:05.020
Please, don't click on the chest..
