00:00:06.055 --> 00:00:07.930
SPEAKER 1: We're in the
Bargello in Florence,

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:09.770
in an enormous vaulted room.

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:12.650
This is a building that was
used for judicial purposes.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.990
Now it's a museum.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:16.300
And it holds
Donatello's David, one

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:18.970
of the most important sculptures
of the early Renaissance

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:20.730
SPEAKER 2: Important
because it was

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.440
the first free-standing
nude sculpture

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.350
since classical antiquity.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.070
Quite an achievement.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.800
SPEAKER 1: So for 1,000
years, the Christian West

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.479
had looked to the soul
as the place to focus.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:35.260
The body was seen as
a path to corruption,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.950
and so it was not
to be celebrated.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.040
What we're seeing
here is a return

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:42.530
to Ancient Greece and Rome's
love of the body, its respect

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.350
for the body, which
is so evident.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:45.350
SPEAKER 2: It really is.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:47.433
Donatello's looked back
in ancient Greek and Roman

00:00:47.433 --> 00:00:51.150
sculpture also for the position
that David is standing in,

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:55.220
the position of contrapposto
which is a very relaxed pose,

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.390
where the weight is placed on
one leg, the other leg is bent.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.120
And the figure has--
because of contrapposto--

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.080
has a sense of movement.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.790
In the Renaissance, this
figure looked remarkably alive,

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.560
given the way that
medieval sculpture

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.519
had looked for so long.

00:01:09.519 --> 00:01:11.809
SPEAKER 1: It's detached from
any kind of figural group

00:01:11.809 --> 00:01:13.040
or any kind of architecture.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.150
And so there really is
a sense of autonomy,

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.930
as if this figure could move
forward of its own accord.

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.600
The figure is
referencing the classical

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.850
in another way, as well in
its very material nature.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.970
This is bronze, largely copper
with a little bit of tin

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.730
added to it to give it strength.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:28.994
And it's actually
hollow, it's created

00:01:28.994 --> 00:01:30.410
through a technique
which is known

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.090
as lost-wax casting, which the
ancient Romans and the ancient

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.719
Greeks before them had employed.

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:38.010
And which had been used
throughout the medieval period,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:39.090
but not at this scale.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.130
And it was just in
the early Renaissance

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.320
that artists are
beginning to re-explore

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.190
how to create bronze
sculptures that are this large.

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.650
SPEAKER 2: David is very
young, and it's hard

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:53.690
not to see a kind of
sensuality in the way

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:57.380
that David puts his hand
on his hip and looks down.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.620
And the fact that he's
wearing boots and a hat

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:05.454
and is otherwise nude, there's
a kind of eroticism here.

00:02:05.454 --> 00:02:08.120
SPEAKER 1: And that's especially
evident if you look at the fact

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:12.360
that David is standing on the
now severed head of Goliath.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.570
In fact, in his right hand he's
holding Goliath's own sword

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:17.190
which David has used.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.980
But because he's standing
on that head that

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.380
pushes his leg up, one of
the wings of the helmet

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.230
is just riding up the inner
thigh, perhaps a little

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.550
too high, In fact.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.340
So there really is a kind
of overt sexuality here.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.900
And it's so interesting
because it's

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.391
at odds with the civic
symbolism of this sculpture.

00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:37.890
This was a sculpture
that was really

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.930
important to the
city of Florence.

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.210
And yet, it has this very
intimate quality to it.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:47.110
SPEAKER 2: It was the seen in
the 1460s in the Medici garden.

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.570
Although we're not exactly
sure who commissioned it,

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:51.670
it's likely that
it was a Medici.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.246
SPEAKER 1: So the Medici palace
had a large entrance way,

00:02:54.246 --> 00:02:55.620
and there was a
kind of axes that

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.500
allowed you see directly
into the garden.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.390
And this would have been
visible in the center of it.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.390
SPEAKER 2: That's right.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.150
It's really important for us to
remember that to the Florentine

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.110
people, this wasn't just
King David from the Bible.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:08.370
There were all sorts
of associations.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.170
First of all, David
in the biblical story

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.010
defeats his enemy--
even though he's

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:16.510
the underdog-- he defeats
his enemy with God's help.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.780
The Florentine people felt
very much identified with David

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.420
because like David, they
had defeated their enemy

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.170
or they-- this is
how they saw it--

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.510
they had defeated their
enemy, the Duke of Milan

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.980
in this early 15th century,
with the help of God.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.580
In fact, they felt
blessed and chosen

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.580
by God, and the heirs of
the ancient Roman Republic.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:39.720
And so the subject
of David represented

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.034
Florence, the
Florentine Republic.

00:03:42.034 --> 00:03:43.450
SPEAKER 1: So
Goliath, in a sense,

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.730
takes on the role of
the Duke of Milan.

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:48.590
Milan was significantly
stronger than Florence,

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.280
which was a mercantile culture,
as opposed to a military power.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.330
And Florence was, of
course, a republic

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:56.800
whereas Milan was an autocracy.

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:58.505
That is, it had a single ruler.

00:03:58.505 --> 00:04:00.130
SPEAKER 2: And so
David became a symbol

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.290
of the Florentine Republic.

00:04:02.290 --> 00:04:05.260
Anyone looking at this
sculpture in the Medici garden

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.720
in the 15th century would have
understood David as a reference

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:11.710
to the liberties and
the freedoms that

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.390
were so cherished by
the Florentine people,

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:16.834
and had been threatened
by the Duke of Milan.

00:04:16.834 --> 00:04:18.209
SPEAKER 1: On the
other hand, you

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:21.019
could say that the Medici we
usurping this civic symbolism

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.420
for themselves in some ways.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.930
And in fact, when the
Medici were run out of town,

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.680
this sculpture
was actually taken

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.690
to the signoria, that
is to the town hall,

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.280
and made a public sculpture.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:33.590
And so there is really the
sense of the investment

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:35.772
of this culture in this story.

00:04:35.772 --> 00:04:36.480
SPEAKER 2: Right.

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.850
And so by having it
in the Medici garden,

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:43.130
appropriating this symbol
of the city and all

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:45.290
that was great about
the city, Medici

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:47.660
were appropriating
that for themselves.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.440
SPEAKER 1: So here
in this sculpture

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.460
is this embodiment of the
promise of a long rule.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.080
David will grow up to be king,
to have been enormously wise.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.430
And in a sense, it was a perfect
kind of story for the Medici

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.970
to put forward as a
representation, not only

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.722
the city, but specifically of
their own rule within the city.

00:05:04.722 --> 00:05:05.430
SPEAKER 2: Right.

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:07.450
So they're sort of
identifying themselves

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:08.970
as the city of Florence.

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.470
Identifying themselves with
youthfulness, with King David,

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.120
and with all that's great
about the Florentine Republic.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:17.830
SPEAKER 1: And although this is
a sculpture that's about war,

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:20.910
the symbols are clearly
about David and peace,

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:22.290
and the Medici and peace.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.970
David wears a soft hat as
opposed to the helmet of war

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:26.480
that Goliath wears.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:30.120
David has severed Goliath's
head with Goliath's

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:32.560
own battle-hardened sword.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.046
If you look at
that sword closely,

00:05:34.046 --> 00:05:35.920
you can see that there
are notches out of it.

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.010
It's been in many, many battles.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.180
David needs to borrow it in
order to sever that head.

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.770
But in David's other hand, in
his left hand, he holds a rock.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:47.719
Presumably the rock that
he used in the slingshot to

00:05:47.719 --> 00:05:49.510
actually fell the giant
in the first place.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:53.390
But I think it's interesting
that Donatello here,

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:56.320
a sculptor, is actually
portraying that rock as,

00:05:56.320 --> 00:05:59.850
in a sense, the opposing
weapon to the sword.

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:02.150
That is a material that
Donatello, as a sculptor,

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:03.300
often carves.

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:06.530
He works in marble as often as
he does in bronze, perhaps more

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:07.400
often.

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.850
And so are these, in a
sense, the two weapons

00:06:09.850 --> 00:06:11.130
of the two cities?

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.640
Either the violence of Milan
versus the culture of Florence?

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.640
SPEAKER 2: The iconography, all
of the meanings, David and what

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.660
that meant to the
city of Florence.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:25.240
That eroticism, or even the
homo-eroticism, art historians

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:28.150
are not really sure
about all of those

00:06:28.150 --> 00:06:30.950
meanings for the 15th
century Florentine people.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.760
And some art
historians have even

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:34.480
suggested that
the identification

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:38.360
of this figure as David is
not even completely secure.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.240
That it could also have
been read as Mercury.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.220
And so we see it in
a complicated way,

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.590
and it's quite likely that
the people of Florence,

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:48.560
in the 15th century, saw
it in a complicated way

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:50.980
and had multiple readings of it.

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:53.240
SPEAKER 1: It's an important
reminder that art history

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:57.790
itself is a process of trying to
restore meaning and understand

00:06:57.790 --> 00:06:59.520
meaning through
the lens of time.

00:06:59.520 --> 00:07:00.020
And--

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.910
SPEAKER 2: It is, after
all, 600 years old.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:02.910
SPEAKER 1: That's right.

00:07:02.910 --> 00:07:06.430
But nevertheless, it is one
of the great sculptures that

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:09.020
really embodies so many
of the ideals and so many

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:12.700
of the concerns of
the 15th century.
