00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:11.759
&gt;&gt;WELCOME BACK TO THE FIVE METER DIVING NCAA
NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP.

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.580
OUR FINALISTS&lt;em&gt; ARE BRYAN LANCE AND JASON GRAY.
SHANNON, WHAT WILL THE JUDGES BE LOOKING&lt;/em&gt;

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:20.640
&lt;em&gt;FOR?
&gt;&gt;PERFECTION MATT.&lt;/em&gt;

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.890
&lt;em&gt;WHEN YOU HAVE MADE IT THIS
FAR, EVERY MISTAKE WILL BE&lt;/em&gt;

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:26.760
&lt;em&gt;PENALIZED BY THE JUDGES.
&gt;&gt;BRYAN IS GOING FIRST.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.890
&lt;em&gt;YOU CAN SEE THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS MOMENT
WEIGHING ON HIM.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.920
&lt;em&gt;BRIAN AND HIS COACH HAVE BEEN
WORKING ON THIS

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.260
&lt;em&gt;DIVE FOR A LONG TIME.
I BELIEVE THE TWO OF THEM HAVE BEEN TOGETHER

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.219
&lt;em&gt;SINCE BRIAN WAS SIX.
&gt;&gt;UH, YES, BEFORE THAT BRIAN HAD A CHILDHOOD.

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.460
[SPLASH]&lt;em&gt; WELL IT'S CERTAINLY
WASN'T PERFECT, BUT NOT A TERRIBLE

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.339
&lt;em&gt;WAY TO START.
YOU SEE HE DOES A GOOD ATTEMPT AT A FRONT ARM

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:48.600
&lt;em&gt;STAND SOMERSAULT, BUT HE DIDN'T HOLD HIS

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.289
&lt;em&gt;ARM STAND AS LONG AS HE SHOULD HAVE.
AND NOT TO MENTION HE SPLASHED ABOUT FIVE

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.469
&lt;em&gt;DROPS OF WATER,
THERE CRAIG, NOT GOING TO CUT IT.

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.709
&lt;em&gt;&gt;&gt;AS EXPECTED THE JUDGES WERE NOT IMPRESSED.
*DECENT, BUT IS IT GOOD ENOUGH TO WIN?

00:00:59.709 --> 00:01:04.070
&lt;em&gt;&gt;&gt;AND HERE GOES JASON GRAY.
*NOT THE FAVORITE BUT DEFINITELY A STRONG

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:07.340
&lt;em&gt;CHALLENGER.
OH AND THERE GOES THE TOWEL.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:18.100
&lt;em&gt;HE'S USED IT AS A GRENADE.&lt;/em&gt;
[SPLASH] &gt;&gt; &lt;em&gt;THAT WAS AMAZING.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.650
&lt;em&gt;&gt;&gt;THAT WAS LIKE WATCHING AN ANGEL GLIDE INTO
A POOL OF COOL WHIP.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.810
[CHEERS] &lt;em&gt;&gt;&gt;FANTASTIC SCORES CRAIG.
&gt;&gt;BRYAN SEEMS TO BE CONFUSED WITH HOW HE'S

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.000
&lt;em&gt;GOING TO COMPETE WITH THE
FLAWLESSNESS THAT IS JASON GRAY.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.600
&lt;em&gt;&gt;&gt;WELL THERE ARE STILL FIVE
DIVES TO GO THERE, CRAIG.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.500
♪♪
[SPLASH]

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.210
&lt;em&gt;&gt;&gt;BRIAN'S BACKWARD ROTATION,
I'VE SEEN BETTER.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.340
&lt;em&gt;&gt;&gt;JASON GRAY ATTEMPTING THE CANNON BALL.&lt;/em&gt;
[SPLASH] &lt;em&gt;I HAVE NEVER SEEN BETTER!

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.050
[CHEERS] [SPLASH]
&lt;em&gt;&gt;&gt;A LOT OF FLIPS.

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.720
&lt;em&gt;A LOT OF FLIPS.
&gt;&gt;NOT ONE FOR VARIETY THERE.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.610
&lt;em&gt;&gt;&gt;NO.
OH, THE FLOATY!

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.730
&lt;em&gt;I HAVEN'T SEEN THAT USED SINCE '86.
&gt;&gt;PERFECT CALL BACK.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:02:00.300
&lt;em&gt;&gt;HM.
&gt;&gt;[SIGH] &gt;&gt;OH THE PIRATE

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:04.600
&lt;eM&gt;WALKING THE PLANK!
&gt;&gt;BRINGS TEARS TO MY EYES, THIS HOWEVER BRINGS

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.930
&lt;em&gt;YAWNS TO MY MOUTH.
&gt;&gt;INDEED.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:10.000
&lt;em&gt;WHAT DOES HE HAVE THIS TIME?
&gt;&gt;OH-OH!

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.700
&lt;em&gt;HE'S ATTEMPTING THE WRIGGLE.
&gt;&gt;OH WE ARE ALL WITNESSES!

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.739
[CHEERS] &lt;em&gt;FLAWLESS ENTRY.
WELL THIS LAST DIVE IS JUST A FORMALITY FOR

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.310
&lt;em&gt;JASON GRAY.
HE IS SO FAR AHEAD IN POINTS HE CAN LITERALLY

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.469
&lt;em&gt;DO NO WRONG.
&gt;&gt;UNLESS HE TRIES A BACK ONE AND A HALF

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:28.530
&lt;em&gt;SOMERSAULT HALF TWIST
LIKE THAT FOOL BRYAN LANCE.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.620
[LAUGHTER] &gt;&gt;GOOD POINT,
BUT IS ANYONE THAT STUPID?

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.209
&gt;&gt;OH, UH- SORRY TO CUT YOU OFF CRAIG,
BUT WE HAVE JUST HEARD &lt;em&gt;THAT JASON GRAY IS

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.900
&lt;em&gt;GOING TO ATTEMPT THE BELLY FLOP.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.359
&lt;em&gt;&gt;&gt;FROM THAT HEIGHT?
THAT'S SUICIDE.

00:02:41.359 --> 00:02:45.150
&gt;&gt;YES IT IS.
&lt;em&gt;BUT IF HE PULLS IT OFF, HIS COLLEGIATE LEGACY

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:48.209
&lt;em&gt;WILL BE COMPLETE.
&gt;&gt;I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN WATCH THIS SHANNON.

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.040
&lt;em&gt;&gt;&gt;YOU HAVE TO CRAIG.
YOU'RE COMMENTATING.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.600
&lt;em&gt;&gt;&gt;OH YEAH.
&gt;&gt;HE LOOKS LIKE HE'S GOING THROUGH WITH IT.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.700
&lt;em&gt;&gt;&gt;SHAKING IT OFF.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.540
&lt;em&gt;OH, PERFECT APPROACH.
THE CROWD HOLDS THEIR BREATH.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:05.000
[SPLASH]

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.500
&lt;em&gt;&gt;&gt;IS HE ALIVE?
&gt;&gt;THE BELLY FLOP.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.840
THE MOST RESPECTED &lt;em&gt;AND FEARED DIVE OF ALL TIME.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.400
&lt;em&gt;HAS TAKEN A NATIONAL TREASURE.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.100
&lt;em&gt;&gt;&gt;WAIT. WAIT!
I SEE HIM MOVING!

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.200
&lt;em&gt;HE'S ALIVE!
MICHAEL PHELPS MOVE OVER, THERE IS A NEW

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:33.529
KING OF THE POOL!
[CHEERING] &lt;em&gt;&gt;&gt;OH MY BOTOX IS

00:03:33.529 --> 00:03:38.969
&lt;em&gt;ALMOST LETTING ME CRY!
[LAUGHTER]&lt;em&gt; &gt;&gt;THERE HE IS, JASON GRAY

00:03:38.969 --> 00:03:44.000
&lt;em&gt;THE NEW NCAA FIVE METER DIVING CHAMPION!
STAY TUNED FOR WOMEN'S BOWLING.
