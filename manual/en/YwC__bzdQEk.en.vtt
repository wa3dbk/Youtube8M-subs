Hi, I'm Bobby crispy

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:07.350
This video is part of my guitar lesson series

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:10.169
today, I'll show how to warm up properly I

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.809
Was a guitar player the last thing you want to do is to pick up a guitar and just start playing

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:18.539
especially if you're going to Seoul

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.170
Just like in a sport. You don't just step onto the field and start running around you need to warm up

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.980
It helps you become more focused when you play

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.308
Okay, so first thing you need to do is to stretch your fingers like so

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.899
Okay, you don't have to strain yourself. It's not medieval torture and

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.729
like that yeah and like this

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.079
Okay, you'll notice that your fingers will feel a lot more flexible

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.039
Okay the first thing you do to

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:00.910
Warm up

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.769
Is to play all the notes in the first position from?

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.369
first

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.369
the fourth frets

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.479
All the strings

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.800
That's their position

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.259
The fourth positioned and up and up and up I see the way to warm up

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.620
You can also play the blues scale in that first position ascending in thirds

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.250
And descending at the second position

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
And

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:08.169
Ascending in the third position sending in the fourth position. I don't know and all the way at the front work

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.079
Nothing you do is hammer ons and pull offs

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.040
First string the second string third string

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:45.489
Okay if you can read music you should read about two pages of music to help warm up that helps you get more

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.590
focused

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.690
You also play some chords

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.060
I'm just changing from quarter to quarter

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.259
And you can pick some arpeggios to run off as well plays chord like C chord

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:27.710
So I okay, I hope this lesson has been helpful and thanks for watching
