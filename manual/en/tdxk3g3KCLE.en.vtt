00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.710
With big budget triple A titles out there,
I think that people tend to overlook browser

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.460
based games and you know what?

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.950
THEY’RE @#$!-ING WRONG!

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:12.280
Ooh, reindeer!

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.849
Browser games used to be all the rage back
in the day.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.880
Bloons, Kitten Cannon, you know?

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:17.880
The classics!

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.270
Yet there’s one game that makes me come
back for more all day every day…

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:23.270
COOKIE CLICKER!

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:24.370
I mean look at this game!

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.660
You’re clicking a big cookie to make more
cookies!

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.570
D-doesn’t that sound exciting?

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:33.390
Alright, I’ll admit that it doesn’t seem
like much at first, but trust me when I say

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.170
that this game gets intense.

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.630
You use your cookies as currency in order
to buy new things and upgrades such as extra

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.870
cursors to click the big cookie for you, alchemy
labs that turn gold into cookies…

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:49.370
I’m serious about that and you can even
BUY AND ENSLAVE GRANDMOTHERS!

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.249
I want you to think about that.

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:54.140
Every time that you purchase one of theses
old ladies, you are talking them away from

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.769
their families and forcing them to work in
your cookie factories.

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.149
Oh and by the way, you can buy more factories
too.

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:03.730
Pretty soon, you’ll have a nice little cookie
empire all to yourself.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.040
There’s even a news bulletin at the top
of the screen that reports on your exploits.

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.100
“Doctors warn against chocolate chip snorting
teen fad.”

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.210
“There are now museums dedicated to your
cookies.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.210
“

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.650
“Your cookies bring all the boys to the
yard.”

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.470
Where are the boys?

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.290
Once you bake enough cookies, you’re going
to have to restart your game.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.730
I know that seems weird, but you get a bonus
for restarting in the form of heavenly CHIPS!

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.040
Oh god, now I have to clean that up.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.180
These suckers give you a two percent increase
in CPS that’s cookies per second for you

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.740
scrubs out there, per chip you have!

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.100
When you first start playing the Cookie Clicker,
it’s pretty laid back and relaxed.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.580
You can click the cookie a few dozen times,
let the game run idle for a bit, and come

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.760
back again and purchase more buildings and
upgrades, reset the game to get some heavenly

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.850
chips and everything’s fine.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.430
But everything changes when you buy the “One
Mind” upgrade.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.030
With this, you unleash the Grandmaocalypse!

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:03.240
The game twists into this demonic state, Wrinklers
that drain your total CPS appear, and by this

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.830
point, the game has you HOOKED!

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:10.070
I can’t even explain it, but it’s impossible
for me to stop playing Cookie Clicker.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.530
No longer am I satisfied with hundreds and
even MILLIONS of cookies!

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.530
No!

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.950
I am stuck in the quadrillions and even then,
it’s not enough.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.819
I need more.

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:22.530
I must consume.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.450
I crave…

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.550
I CRAVE COOKIES!

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:37.060
I must please the Grandmatriarchs!
