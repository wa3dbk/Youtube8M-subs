Hey, this is John from FreeCodes.me, and I'm
going to be showing you how to get free Microsoft

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:14.549
Points, free Runescape Cards, and all that
good stuff, at FreeCodes.me.

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.790
So your first step, you're going to need to
head over to FreeCodes.me, and once you're

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:26.140
there, click on codes. Once you're here on
the codes menu, you'll see there's a table

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.390
view of six different games, software, and
online currecy programs. For example, let's

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.590
go to Microsoft Points, simply click on the
image. Once you're here, you'll see that

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.800
it says, "To get your 1600 Microsoft Points
Code, click 'Get Code' below." And below this

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.070
it says, "Send this referral link to your
friends to decrease the chances of

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.630
getting a survey!" Since I have sent this
referral link to probably a thousand people,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:57.380
I'm not going to get a survey, well, it's
highly unlikely that I would. So let's try.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:02.030
So I got Get Code, and now I'm down here,
it shows the download, msp, Microsoft Points.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:09.030
So, now let's test out and see if this works.
I'm in my account, and from here,

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.630
let's add some points, redeem code. Now let's
open up this document, and here's the code

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:25.950
I got from the website. Copy that code, and
paste it in here.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.950
Double-check that that is all correct, seems
to match up. Redeem Code. Alright, so the

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:42.689
1600 Microsoft Points were successfully added.
So that means that that worked, and

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:48.400
that is really cool. Sweet, so now let's try
this actually for one other thing, or two

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.650
other things, just to make sure that this
is all working legitimately. Alright, now

00:01:54.650 --> 00:02:01.650
let's try RuneScape. So let's head over to
RuneScape.com, go to "Be a Member", and I'll

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.650
login here. So, now that I'm here, you can
see that is says, "Extend Membership", I

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.230
have a free trial going on right now, so I
already have 14 days of membership. But, I

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.980
can extend my membership and put it into like
a real, legitimate membership by

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:36.980
entering in a code. So, let me re-enter my
information. Once you're here, here's the

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:46.110
regular payment menu, but we're going to go
to "Redeem Game Card". Alright, now let's

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:53.110
see if this works, "Get Code", and here's
the RuneScape document, and let's copy this

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:01.510
information over. And that worked as well.
So, I just got 30 days of free RuneScape

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.780
Membership. Now, lastly, I'm going to try
this on the game, League of Legends. We're

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:21.910
going to see if Riot Points work. So now,
now that we're here back at the website,

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:28.910
let's go to League of Legends. "Get Code",
now let's open up the League of Legends Menu,

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:36.730
we're in the store here, so you're going to
want to go to "Purchase RP", and then

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:43.730
"Prepaid Cards", and now here's the document
that I just downloaded from the website. Let's

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:51.430
copy this, put it in the League of Legends
thing. So I'm not sure what that

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:08.879
original error was for, but as you can see
here, I've just redeemed 1380 Riot Points.

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:12.530
And those Riot Points have been added to my
account. And that card would usually

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.389
cost $10, but I got it absolutely free, which
is really cool. So, basically, that's how

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.069
this website works, it's pretty simple, and
if there's a code that isn't on the

00:04:22.069 --> 00:04:28.409
website, feel free to request it at "info@freecodes.me",
which can be seen here. And, if you go back

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:33.860
to home page, this is where we were originally,
just go to codes,

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.520
click on the code you want, and click "Get
Code". Like I said, you could be directed

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.719
to a survey, if you haven't referred enough
members. So, just fill out the survey and

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:45.999
you'll get the download as well, it just may
take a little bit longer. But, you'll get

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:49.599
those free codes no matter what game you're
looking for, no matter what software

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:55.110
key it is. So, yeah, I hope this helped, this
is John from FreeCodes.me, and have a great

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:55.509
day.
