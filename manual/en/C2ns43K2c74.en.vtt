00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.580
The great kick that sent your kids' team to
the finals also sent the tomato sauce and

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:08.149
cola flying onto your carpet and couch.

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.120
Go ahead and keep cheering ...

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.820
The BISSELL SpotClean™ portable deep cleaner
can take care of the spills, spots and stains...

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:20.330
Even if you don't find them until the season
is over.

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:26.090
The BISSELL SpotClean uses water, formula
and powerful suction to permanently remove

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:30.509
spots and stains -- even the ones that have
been around for a while.

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:32.029
To get started, fill the removable...

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:33.861
...easy-grip, flat-bottomed tank with water...

00:00:33.861 --> 00:00:37.390
...BISSELL 2X Spot &amp; Stain Formula and BISSELL
Oxygen Boost, which boosts cleaning performance

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:44.200
through permanent stain removal.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.870
The light-weight SpotClean comes with hand-held
cleaning attachments, such as the Deep Reach

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.730
tool, which targets and removes deeply embedded
spots and stains from carpets and rugs.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.940
Here's how it works: First, rubber needles
inject water and BISSELL formula into your

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.190
carpets to loosen the stain. Then, powerful
suction lifts the stain away, leaving your

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.850
carpets clean and refreshed.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:13.810
In addition to a Deep Reach tool, the BISSELL
SpotClean also comes with a Tough Stain tool

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:20.100
that attaches to reach spots and stains anywhere
-- from carpet to stairs to upholstery and

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.080
car interiors.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.420
The HeatWave Technology™ built into the
SpotClean helps maintain the temperature of

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.620
water and formula in the tank throughout the
cleaning process.

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:34.420
When you are done cleaning, the easy-grip,
flat-bottomed dirty water tank is a cinch

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.799
to remove, and empty at any sink.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:43.321
Next simply wind up the cord and hose... the
compact design of the SpotClean makes it easy

00:01:43.321 --> 00:01:44.351
to stow in small spaces.

00:01:44.351 --> 00:01:50.600
Your home is a place for celebration... and
with the help of the Bissell SpotClean, it

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.720
can also be a place for relaxation.
