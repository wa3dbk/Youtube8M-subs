Should A Young Man Buy A Suit For $1000 Video
Style Advice For Young Men Buying First Suits

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.840
Hi!

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:04.029
I'm Antonio Centeno, the founder of Real Men
Real Style.

00:00:04.029 --> 00:00:09.450
Today, I have a question sent to me by a reader
and he's asking, "Should I spend $1000 on

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:10.850
my graduation suit?"

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.760
So I'm going to be answering him and giving
him a bit of guidance on that.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.760

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.790
I love hearing from you all.

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:28.520
I try to get down there and engage in the
comments.

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.300
If it's an older video, it's a little hard
for me to come find this, but I will try.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.030
Also, if you haven't already, also grab our
free 47-page e-book.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:38.030
It's down there somewhere.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.460
I know it is.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.850
Once you grab this e-book, you're going to
find it's chock-full of great information

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:44.850
about men's style.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.390
And to get you started down the path, I'm
going to link to some other great websites.

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:49.390
Okay.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.010
This is the question that came in.

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.379
"Hi, Antonio!

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.620
I'm a young man about to graduate secondary
school.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.100
There's a graduation and prom coming up, and
my parents have agreed to lend me almost a

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.880
thousand dollars to buy a suit.

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:05.789
Is it possible to buy a good full suit with
that amount?

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:08.450
It seems that you recommend charcoal grey.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.280
I personally like dark grey or near black.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.090
I feel it gives me a feeling of simplicity
and I really like it."

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.499
"I'm also having trouble finding shoes and
shirts, and I'm considerably tall.

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:22.229
At the end of the day though, I want to look
good because there are going to be girls at

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.350
the prom and I want to use this for interviews,
for scholarship interviews, just for everything.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.200
Can you help me out here?"

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.810
Okay, first off, let me be clear.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.319
I'm a custom clothier.

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:40.529
I sell $1500 suits every single day.

00:01:40.529 --> 00:01:47.039
A young man at the age of 16 to 21, they do
not need to be buying suits in my price range.

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:49.499
You do not need to be spending $1000.

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:53.569
If you're spending $500, I think it's almost
too much.

00:01:53.569 --> 00:02:00.679
At this point, you need to focus on learning
and experimentation because your body is growing.

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.179
And if you put a lot of money into a suit,
a year later, you're going to find you can't

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.879
fit into this and that to me is a bad investment.

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:15.610
It's at this point in your life when men like
me, older men, we don't expect you to be wearing

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.830
a $2000 suit or a $1000 suit.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.569
What we expect is for you to be open and ambitious
and open to learning.

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:31.560
The suit, I would say focus on the fit then
focus on the style.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.870
Make sure it's classic, conservative, simple,
and last, focus on the quality for the fabric

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.340
and this is where at this point in your life
you can compromise.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.990
When you're a 25, 30-year-old lawyer and you're
making good money then you want to upgrade

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:49.959
the fabric, but at this point, again, focus
on the fit.

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.900
And to focus on fit, you don't have to focus
on the fabric.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.500
You can instead go out there and here are
going to be my tips.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.739
First of all, I would look and I would ask
around your immediate family and friends.

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:02.329
I mean, talk to your father.

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:06.430
Find if he's got anything in the closet, anything
that he hasn't worn, and you check out the

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:14.140
style and make sure it's not from 1970s or
1960s kind of stuff here, but try to be thrifty.

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:17.092
Your parents sound like they think it's a
good investment and that's great that your

00:03:17.092 --> 00:03:22.250
parents are standing behind you, but I can
tell you $1000 is a lot of money and there's

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.640
a lot of grown men out there looking for work
who don't have that kind of money to spend

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.310
on a suit or men with three or four kids.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:35.500
Again, at this point, I think it's going to
create a bad habit because all money does

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.370
is -- the big thing money does -- I don't
know why I keep putting my thumb up there

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.120
-- but the big thing money does is it speeds
things up.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.170
It helps you get things faster.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.370
At this point in your life, you don't need
that extra speed.

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.560
What you need is to learn and to understand
what styles suit your body.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.420
The only way you're going to do that -- you
know, you can read and you can learn about

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.029
this stuff, but you need to go out there and
practice.

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:03.120
You need to go out there and try different
things on and find what suits you.

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:08.790
I do recommend charcoal grey as a first suit
for a young man, but you may find that navy

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.499
really suits you, especially you said that
you've got a lighter complexion, lighter colored

00:04:13.499 --> 00:04:14.499
hair.

00:04:14.499 --> 00:04:19.519
Well, in that case, a blue to a navy blue,
that's probably going to perhaps suit you

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.419
better than a charcoal grey or a black, which
is going to probably be too stark of a contrast

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:27.740
for your colors, although you do want to go
with a dark-colored suit.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.750
You don't want to go with anything light if
you want to be able to use it, so that would

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.889
be my advice.

00:04:31.889 --> 00:04:37.979
Go with something dark, but if it's 50% polyester
or even a little bit more, at the end of the

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:42.200
day, if it fits you really well, if you can
get a great deal, perhaps you could find one

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:47.740
used for $20 in a thrift store and it fits
you reasonably well, and you spend $50 or

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.740
$70 to get it altered, wow!

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.270
You only spent $100 and then pocket that $800.

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.280
Actually, save it up for college because you're
going to need money at later points.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:03.729
I think it's going to say a lot to your father
and your mother that you're the kind of person

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.280
that you're thrifty and you realize it's their
money.

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.500
I made a mistake, I think, at a younger age.

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:13.780
I borrowed a lot of money when I went to undergrad
and I'm still paying off those damn student

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:14.780
loans.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:17.199
You can't escape from those things.

00:05:17.199 --> 00:05:22.289
I would advise a young man at this point not
to spend that kind of money on clothing which

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.070
he's going to grow out of, so that would be
my advice.

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.169
I think you've got some other questions and
I'll address those in another video, but I

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.720
really want to hammer home that a young man
should not be spending this kind of money

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.629
especially when his body is growing, when
his personal style is changing, and he's discovering

00:05:38.629 --> 00:05:42.630
who he is and he's becoming the man who he's
going to be.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:46.479
So yeah, if you're younger than age 21, I
would advise against this.

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:50.610
Once you're a 22 or 23-year-old college graduate
especially if you're going into a field like

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:56.560
consulting, law, well then I see that this
can become an investment and you start to

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:57.889
become super busy.

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:02.050
But again, at your age, at this point, spend
less.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:04.110
Go to thrift stores.

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:05.960
Ask around from family.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.611
Go into a department store and perhaps get
a less expensive, cheaper quality suit, but

00:06:11.611 --> 00:06:15.150
at the end of the day, focus on that fit.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:19.771
Make sure the style isn't too bad and compromise
-- at this point, I hate to say that, but

00:06:19.771 --> 00:06:22.030
compromise on fabric at your age.

00:06:22.030 --> 00:06:23.030
Okay.

00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:24.030
Hopefully you found this video useful.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:27.280
And if you've got something to add, which
I know you probably do, we'd love to hear

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.280
from you.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.190
Otherwise, I'll see you in the next video.

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:30.230
Bye-bye.
