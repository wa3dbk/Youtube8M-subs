Welcome back to Expert Village. You're watching
"Arts and Crafts, and Everything Fun", and

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:13.350
we're learning about embellishing our scrapbooks,
with my guest Sonya Shepherd. "How're you

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.630
doing"? "I'm well, thanks." Alright, let's
keep rolling with the embellishments. So,

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:23.250
eyelets are something that are really scary
to people because they look so cool, but really

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.910
they are very easy to use, so I'm going to
go through a really simple way to do them.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.559
First of all, you want to get something like
a, you do need a tool for this, so a Silent

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:38.460
Setter, the Crop-a-Dile, the Hammer Set from
Making Memories, any of those will do. I love

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:46.570
the Silent Setter, it's a great package, you've
got your tool here, you can see that? It comes

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:52.010
with a little mat which you really need to
use, again, to protect your work surface.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.649
These are magnetic inserts, and so you're
choosing the punching tool that you need.

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.319
Then we have a little jar of eyelets here,
and I'm going to pick out a couple colors.

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:11.469
And what you do, is you take your tag like
this, you put it down here on your mat, and

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:17.329
you just give it a little bit of pressure,
as well as twisting, and you've now cut a

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:24.570
hole through that. The hole is where your
eyelet is going to go. The eyelet is really

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.020
like a little grommet, in all sorts of fun
little colors, I don't know if you can see

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:37.750
that there. So we're going to put this down
now, kind of backwards I suppose, the eyelet

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:45.210
is face down and you have the back exposed.
We take out our cutting tip. "Oops, I messed

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:53.030
it up. That's okay. You do it. Alright." We
took out our cutting tip and now we're placing

00:01:53.030 --> 00:02:04.310
our setting tip in the setter. You're going
to smash this down. It's called the Silent

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:10.340
Setter because it makes absolutely no noise,
and now we have completely set our eyelet.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:16.830
The front is great, it's lots of fun. The
back is completely smashed and is fastened,

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.280
and it's just a nice little decorative element.
It's something to add to your scrapbook. "Definitely.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:29.190
So that's what we learning on the segment.
That's what we're doing. We're learning how

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:35.780
to de-mystify the embellishment process. Great,
so here's the eyelet, and here's the, what

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.330
is it called? This is the Silent Setter. The
Silent Setter. And you can get it at your

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.610
store, right? You can get it at the Crop Circle.
You can ship it to them. So, get this because

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.790
this is a lot of fun. That was fun to watch.
Lot's of fun, very easy, not scary at all.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.890
Great! And what is our next segment? Well,
next segment we're going to learn how to use

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.580
ribbon in your scrapbook. Fun! So stay tuned
for that."
