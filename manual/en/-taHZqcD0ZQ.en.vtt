00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:05.510
Now we're going to move into a trick called
the revolving door. The revolving door is

00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:10.960
a really great trick. It also seems like you're
stepping, well you are, stepping through the

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:16.960
hoop. You can act like you are stepping through
a tunnel or a tube, keeping the hoop nice

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:26.230
and close to your body. Or, you can point
your toes stretching the hoop out away from

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:34.110
your body. Let's go into how to do that move.
Take the hoop out to your right and with your

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:40.790
first hand hold the hoop. Start to bend your
wrist and elbow bringing it in. Then, you're

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:45.691
going to take your second hand and grab, palm
facing in thumb facing out. Bring the hoop

00:00:45.691 --> 00:00:51.010
nice and tight to the core of your body, like
that. You're going to start to swing it. You're

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.370
going to step up with your left leg and through
the hoop. It'll revolve around the back of

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:03.670
your body. Step up with the right leg and
you're out, bringing it back up into lasso.

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:10.540
So from here, take the hoop out to your side,
bend the right arm bringing it in close to

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.700
the core of your body. Lift up with the left
leg, step through, right leg through, and

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:25.320
up into lasso. So, now lets try to with pointing
your toes. Bringing the hoop in, point the

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:32.460
toe, lift the foot up, step through. As you
bring this foot out point the toe. Up into

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:42.310
lasso, switch the hands. You can do that again.
So out to the side, bring it in, step, step,

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:53.200
and back up into lasso. Once again, out to
the side, bring the hoop in, grab, step 1,

00:01:53.200 --> 00:02:01.170
rotate, step out, and back up. So you can
make this look really smooth and continual

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:22.439
by just keeping that flow going. Out, step
1, 2, back up. Out, 1, 2, back up. Starting

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:30.859
with the right hand, step 1, 2, and back up.
It really doesn't matter if you use your first

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:35.879
or second hand in this move. You can just
think about as right or left because it's

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:45.040
an off the body trick. So out, in, step 1,
2, and up. You can do that on your other side

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:49.980
as, well bringing the hoop. Step 1, 2, and
up.
