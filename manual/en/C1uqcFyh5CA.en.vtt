00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:09.950
Helen McMahon, here for Expert Village. We
have our batter going here and it is beating

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:17.110
along and the next thing we need to do is
to add our leavening agents. For this you

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:27.570
will need a teaspoon of baking soda and this
is a very nice container because you can flatten

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:34.649
out the top as you are taking it out of the
packet. Be sure to put it down well into your

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:43.140
mixture there and we will give that a little
mix at the moment but first I want to get

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:53.219
the sides scraped down. It is a continual
process of scraping down the sides and scraping

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:06.140
some of the mixture off of the beater. You
can see how the dough is shaping up now.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:14.920
This recipe also calls for baking powder;
a teaspoon of baking powder. Again, I’ve

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:25.570
got a nice flat edge so that I can scoop in
and automatically get the right measurement.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:33.140
I am going to stop the machine because as
you add this I want to make sure it gets into

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:42.560
the body of the mixture and doesn’t go flying
out into the air. Some people recommend that

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:50.060
you add these with the flour. I prefer to
add them beforehand because I think they are

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.979
easier to incorporate and you can make sure
that the mixture is actually working the way

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:04.149
it should be. This is responsible for the
cookies rising, so you want to be sure you

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:12.810
don’t loose any of that 1 teaspoon in the
batter. We will just turn that back on and

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.060
let that mix in until it is thoroughly blended.
