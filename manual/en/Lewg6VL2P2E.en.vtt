00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.920
Today on our 2008 Honda Element we&amp;#39;re
going to be installing the Tow Ready T1 vehicle

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.320
wiring harness with a 4-pole flat trailer
connector, part number 118465.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.099
Now this particular wiring kit is a two part
kit.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.500
This right here is the half that goes up underneath
the driver side dash.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.789
It plugs into a 10-pin connector, has a couple
fuse holders in it that have little 5-amp

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:23.789
fuses in it.

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.640
Now we&amp;#39;ll be installing this first.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.580
Now normally there would be a panel right
here that you would remove, but on this car

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.500
it&amp;#39;s already removed for some reason so
we will not have to take that off.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:45.950
Now the other half of 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:01:12.609
the plug 

00:01:12.609 --> 00:01:56.979
that we&amp;#39;re looking 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:15.650
for 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:29.810
is 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:03:09.390
actually 
up 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:04:04.079
in here.
