Hello and welcome to Todd's kitchen. Recently i have made a number of peanut butter

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:04.000
recipes

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.549
people love them but they keep asking me
how to make peanut butter itself

00:00:07.549 --> 00:00:14.549
So join me today as i make my version of peanut butter.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.759
So to make peanut butter is
incredibly simple and we are going to

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:30.490
start off with the main ingredient and
that's our peanuts

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.190
These peanuts are shelled and they they are also unsalted peanuts

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.329
So place those into a blender. So thats about two cups worth of peanuts

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.150
Now to that add in about 2 tablespoons
of olive oil

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.839
Now you can use vegetable oil if you like but i prefer olive oil.

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:51.559
And of course you can make it as oily as you like. Now with your blender all you have to do is

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:52.949
just pulse it a few times

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:59.949
Then out it on low for about two to three minutes until we get a nice

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.000
buttery paste.

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.030
okay so its out of the blender and look at that

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.570
that is lovely lovely peanut butter

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.259
okay so this is slightly chunky but of
course you like it smooth

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.530
just simply leave it in the blender  longer
just till you get that

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.640
smooth texture and of course you can
make it was oily as you like or as dry as

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:27.189
you like

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:34.189
but lets give this a try now

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.829
oh that is spot on. You know what?

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.299
That tastes exactly like peanut butter and you know why? Because it is peanut butter.

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.340
This is exactly how they make the stuff you buy from the shops

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.630
the only difference is you know exactly
what's in it. So there are no artificial

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.549
flavors preservatives additives or
colors

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:55.780
It is just one hundred percent peanut butter. And all i have added is just a bit of olive oil

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:56.250
 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.340
You really do need to add oil to is other wise it is just to dry and doesn't

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:01.280
turn out very well.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.700
but no matter how much olive oil you add to this its still going to taste

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.709
simply delicious.

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:09.959
So for some homemade all-natural
peanut butter give this a go because I

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.660
know if you love peanut butter you will love this recipe.
