00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:06.207
(piano music)

00:00:06.207 --> 00:00:08.718
Female: If it seem a painting
of a woman being rescued

00:00:08.718 --> 00:00:12.031
from a shipwreck by a
courageous man, whose risking

00:00:12.031 --> 00:00:15.600
his life would be filled
with sentiment and emotion.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:19.197
What's so wonderful to me
about Winslow Homer is the lack

00:00:19.197 --> 00:00:23.863
of that sentiment. We
have this dramatic moment.

00:00:23.863 --> 00:00:28.009
Homer has not exploited it emotionally.

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:30.561
Male: In fact he's even
hidden the face of the hero.

00:00:30.561 --> 00:00:32.231
Female: That's a remarkable
decision when you

00:00:32.231 --> 00:00:35.145
think about it. The man
whose saving this womans

00:00:35.145 --> 00:00:37.544
life, his face is
completely obscured by this

00:00:37.544 --> 00:00:40.342
scarf that just happens
at this moment to have

00:00:40.342 --> 00:00:43.698
[whipped] in front of his face. Of
course, this isn't a photograph.

00:00:43.698 --> 00:00:46.145
Male: This incredible
sense of kind of selfless

00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:48.653
heroism. These paintings
by Homer were recognizes

00:00:48.653 --> 00:00:51.870
inherently American.
Their themes, I think,

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.399
still resonate with us.
When you listen to somebody

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.593
whose performed a dramatic
rescue, perhaps on

00:00:56.593 --> 00:00:59.674
the nightly news, they
also push the camera away.

00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:01.927
There is a way in which
we want to be selfless

00:01:01.927 --> 00:01:03.343
in these moments.

00:01:03.343 --> 00:01:07.514
Female: We have a real feeling
of watching this drama unfold.

00:01:07.514 --> 00:01:09.802
Male: The emphasis is
almost on the mechanics

00:01:09.802 --> 00:01:11.833
of the rescue. This was
a new technology that

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:14.848
allowed for the rescue
of people from ships near

00:01:14.848 --> 00:01:17.345
the shore. You can just
make out the loose sail

00:01:17.345 --> 00:01:19.848
billowing in the upper
left corner. You can see

00:01:19.848 --> 00:01:21.798
people who are watching
the rescue on rocks

00:01:21.798 --> 00:01:24.988
at the upper right. In
fact, that rope bows down

00:01:24.988 --> 00:01:27.133
and we can feel the
weight of these figures as

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:30.258
they skirt with their
feet, this terrifying surf.

00:01:30.258 --> 00:01:32.843
The colors and the tones their so subdued

00:01:32.843 --> 00:01:35.011
and they create the sense of the freezing

00:01:35.011 --> 00:01:36.958
menace of the water. It's
not just that they're

00:01:36.958 --> 00:01:39.225
soaked through. They don't have much time.

00:01:39.225 --> 00:01:41.634
That woman is unconscious
and close to freezing

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:44.570
to death. There is this
real sense of urgency.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:47.560
Female: So, we look at
the water we see grey's,

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.764
pale blues, and tones of white. Lots of

00:01:51.764 --> 00:01:54.170
different kinds of brush
strokes from little

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.181
dabs of paint that suggest
the water is spraying

00:01:57.181 --> 00:02:01.437
upward, to longer strokes that
suggest the force of the waves.

00:02:01.437 --> 00:02:04.224
Male: I actually love that
area just at the cliffs

00:02:04.224 --> 00:02:07.096
on the upper right. You can
see the spray dissolving

00:02:07.096 --> 00:02:10.016
even the solid blacks.
If you look at the waves

00:02:10.016 --> 00:02:12.130
immediately below the
cliffs, you can see the

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.513
translucently where the
wave is very thin and

00:02:14.513 --> 00:02:15.858
light moves through it.

00:02:15.858 --> 00:02:18.106
Female: Look at mans
right foot in the water.

00:02:18.106 --> 00:02:21.522
You feel it dragging in
the way that it's slowing

00:02:21.522 --> 00:02:24.360
them down as they move along this pulley.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.560
Male: There's a real
sense of the particulars

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.567
that make this seem so
immediate, and I love

00:02:29.567 --> 00:02:32.526
the way the water drips from that cord.

00:02:32.526 --> 00:02:35.109
Female: Somehow, the
paint seems wet as though

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:38.299
there were water spraying
up from below that the

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.056
clothes the figures are
wearing is soaked through.

00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:43.776
Male: In fact, in someways
this painting is a nude.

00:02:43.776 --> 00:02:46.164
The woman is wearing a
dress that is absolutely

00:02:46.164 --> 00:02:48.968
proper, but her outfit
is so laden with water

00:02:48.968 --> 00:02:50.996
that it follows the contours of her body.

00:02:50.996 --> 00:02:53.705
Female: Look at the drops of
water from her right hand.

00:02:53.705 --> 00:02:55.416
He could really paint.

00:02:55.416 --> 00:02:57.892
Male: If you follow her
hips down there's just

00:02:57.892 --> 00:03:00.206
a little bit of skin
that's exposed just above

00:03:00.206 --> 00:03:03.032
her knee. You see that
perhaps her petticoat

00:03:03.032 --> 00:03:05.585
below her dress. I can
almost imagine a 19th century

00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:08.955
viewer wanting to pull that
down to retrieve her modesty.

00:03:08.955 --> 00:03:10.919
Female: This really
typical of the subject that

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:13.589
Homer painted later in
his career when he lived

00:03:13.589 --> 00:03:17.590
in Maine. This idea of man
and the forces of nature,

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.030
and the futility of mans
efforts in the face of nature.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.058
Although in this case we do
have a successful struggle.

00:03:24.058 --> 00:03:26.486
Male: Obviously, Homer
didn't paint this on a

00:03:26.486 --> 00:03:29.224
beach watching a rescue.
The painting is based

00:03:29.224 --> 00:03:31.923
loosely on a fairly
recent rescue of the coast

00:03:31.923 --> 00:03:34.785
in New Jersey, but was actually posed in

00:03:34.785 --> 00:03:36.962
New York City in where
he kept his studio even

00:03:36.962 --> 00:03:39.315
after he had moved to
Prouts Neck. This was

00:03:39.315 --> 00:03:42.483
a studio building on West
10th Street. Imagine then

00:03:42.483 --> 00:03:45.623
his models up on the
roof and him drenching

00:03:45.623 --> 00:03:48.313
them with water to make
the effect just right.

00:03:48.313 --> 00:03:51.520
He recognized as a brilliant
painter in his own day.

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.126
He was honored as the
foremost American painter.

00:03:54.126 --> 00:04:04.588
