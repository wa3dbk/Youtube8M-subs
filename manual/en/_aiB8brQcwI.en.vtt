Hey everybody!  This is Randy Santel, "Atlas" with Atlas &amp; Zeus Promotions and proud owner

00:00:12.374 --> 00:00:15.894
of FoodChallenges.com.  Very very excited tonight!

00:00:17.562 --> 00:00:20.762
I'm going for win #35 of my 2015 UK &amp; Ireland Tour.

00:00:21.881 --> 00:00:26.761
I've done a lot of eating!  Another burger challenge but it looks awesome!

00:00:29.459 --> 00:00:35.619
I'm at Black's Burgers in Purley area of London, taking on their Big Daddy Burger Challenge!

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:46.400
It's actually a well presented burger challenge!!  We've got five 5oz burgers, about 1.5 lbs of meat

00:00:51.416 --> 00:00:57.496
along with bacon, cheese, veggies.  Sides of coleslaw, double portions of french fries and

00:00:57.496 --> 00:01:02.289
a double portion of onion rings, along with a triple thick strawberry milkshake, which I got to choose!

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:08.891
we've got 20 minutes to finish this entire challenge!  It's 30 quid if I lose but if I win I'll get the meal

00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:16.875
free and be up on their Wall of Fame.  Hundreds have tried this food challenge but only a few have

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:26.259
been able to win.  A girl has the record with 17 minutes.  Lets get this food eating challenge started!

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.180
Last challenge night I did that 2.5 kilo of shepherd's pie in under 11 minutes so we'll see

00:01:47.754 --> 00:01:54.154
what we can do with this one.  Burger first, coleslaw, pickles, fries and onions, then the shake.

00:01:56.918 --> 00:01:58.038
One, two, three!

00:03:36.455 --> 00:03:41.895
3:30 - Burger is done.  The burger was perfect! Juicy just like you saw on the plate.

00:03:41.895 --> 00:03:44.923
Lets get the coleslaw, then we'll move on to the chips and the onion rings!

00:04:02.294 --> 00:04:05.254
I think we're going to the onion rings first!

00:04:31.299 --> 00:04:35.539
There's still more onion rings, but lets try to beat 10 minutes!

00:05:23.792 --> 00:05:24.352
9:25 in!

00:05:50.318 --> 00:05:55.918
9:41 - the new record!  I got the 30 quid meal for free, it was fun to watch them watch me!

00:05:55.918 --> 00:06:00.741
I will be up on their Wall of Fame with the elite individuals that have beaten this challenge!

00:06:01.307 --> 00:06:06.427
Best of all win #35 of my trip!  Thank you to Black's Burgers.  Loved the burger!

00:06:09.659 --> 00:06:15.419
Awesome burger!  Definitely the thickest milkshake I've ever had during a challenge!

00:06:16.454 --> 00:06:22.934
Very glad I did it while I was in London!  Thanks to Black's Burgers and thank you guys for watching!
