00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:07.370
How to Pick the Right Clothes If You're Top
-Heavy.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:08.370
Congratulations!

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.470
You have the potential for a killer hourglass
figure, if you know how to work it.

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:19.490
You will need A well-fitting bra Dark, plain,
fitted tops Flared skirts Collarless, belted

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.440
jackets Clothing containing Lycra Medium-size
purses and good posture.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:26.470
Step 1.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:28.970
Start with a well-fitting, high-quality bra.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:31.330
A bad one can make you look heavy and saggy.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:36.060
Go to a shop with a professional fitter who
can measure you correctly.

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:37.060
Step 2.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.910
Choose fabrics that hug your body but are
not constricting; too tight and you'll be

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.389
busting out all over, but baggy will make
you look bigger, too.

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:48.600
Material that includes between 1 and 5 percent
Lycra is a good choice.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.600
Step 3.

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.379
Wear a darker shade on top for a slimming
appearance.

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.399
Avoid shirts and sweaters with any kind of
detail on or near the bust, like beading or

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:58.399
pockets.

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:01.920
They'll just add bulk, as will shoulder pads
and poufy sleeves.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.970
Flattering necklines include sweetheart and
V-neck because they lengthen the vertical

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.979
line of your upper half.

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.420
Avoid baby-doll tops, high or round necklines,
smock dresses, and spaghetti straps, which

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.940
can make you look heavier.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:15.940
Step 4.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:21.090
Select bottoms that balance your tops â€“ like
a flared skirt with a fitted blouse or jacket.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.939
If you're wearing a two-piece bathing suit,
make sure the bottom isn't skimpy.

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:25.939
Step 5.

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:31.540
Pick collarless jackets and ones with a belted
waist; both de-emphasize your top half.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.520
Avoid double-breasted jackets, cropped ones,
and wide lapels, which call attention to your

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.520
bust.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.359
A camisole under a well-tailored jacket is
a flattering look.

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:42.420
Step 6.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.299
Don't schlep a huge purse.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:48.920
Anything larger than about 10 by 13 inches
will make a top-heavy woman look even more

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:49.920
out of proportion.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.369
Step 7.

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:52.899
Stand up straight.

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.399
It will make whatever you're wearing look
better.

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:04.149
Did you know The average bra size for American
women has gone from a 34B in 1991 to a 36C

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.189
in 2006.
