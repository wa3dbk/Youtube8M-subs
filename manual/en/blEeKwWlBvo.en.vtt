00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:09.180
The previous house the garage was about 420
square feet. This one is about 330. 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.990
Now that may not sound like a big difference but when
you put it in terms of vertical space

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.210
as well as flour space, it adds up. So my solution
was to eliminate some of the things that 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.529
I normally would store in the garage. The bicycles,
the lawn equipment and the garden supplies

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.009
all went into a shed that I built in the back
yard. 

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:36.140
That was good, but it still wasn't good enough I still have a lot of things sitting
on the flour that have no place to go.

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.580
I felt like I did a pretty good job at utilizing
the vertical space at the other garage

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.320
and one of the ways that I did that was by building these two cabinets.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:52.600
These are made out of peg board both front and back, and I did that because
at the time I thought peg board was really

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:59.040
cool and you can never get enough of it. But
hey, we all have things in our past that we are not proud of.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.280
 I thought that this would
be a really good idea because I could just

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.020
come get what I wanted and put it back just
as easily. But what I found was that these

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.630
hooks tend to fall to the ground and then
I never wanted to go look for them and put

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.500
them back to where it was so what ended up
happening was this right here. 

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.200
I just stopped hanging things all together and started stacking them here.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:28.860
So on this side you can see I gave up the hooks all together and I just stuck some shelves in here. I always found

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:35.319
this to be a lot better, than this. Like a
lot of things in life you learn about yourself

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:38.819
when you build things like this that don't
exactly live up to expectations. 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:44.600
What I learned about me was that I am more of a box on the wall kind of guy. 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:53.000
So I have this space back here between the cabinets and the wall and I thought how can I best utilize this space?

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:01.240
Box on a wall. So I'll take me some measurements, you know, after changing clothes, of course.

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:06.289
Ok, not really this was the previous day.
Ahh, the magic of video and continuity issues

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:11.250
but I digress. Set the table saw up to cut
the side panels. I've got some very poor quality

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.420
ply I've had sitting around the shop since
I built the shed I mentioned earlier so this

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.560
will be a good way to use it up. I want to
account for the swing of the existing cabinet

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.600
and the depth behind the molding of the door. So I am going to size my cabinets according to the space available.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.680
Readjust for the tops and bottoms.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.880
Then adjust a third time for the shelves.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.300
I want my shelves to be adjustable if needed so I'm not going to cut daddos to

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.540
install them. I am also not going to spend
the money to go get shelf pins either so I

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:31.040
am not going to bother drilling shelf pin
holes. Some scrap wood screwed into the sides is a much cheaper option.

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.280
Alright done with that. 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.780
Now I'll run some rabbets along the back panels to accept the sides. 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:08.300
You know in hind sight I probably should have tested my measurement on a piece of scrap, but I got lucky.

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.420
Alright so, some glue.

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.960
I don't get a lot of use out of these right angle clamps. I find them to be clumsy and hard to set up.

00:04:22.969 --> 00:04:26.939
I always feel like I need a third hand to use these things, but this plywood

00:04:26.939 --> 00:04:32.859
I'm using is so bent and warped, I need something to hold these sides static until I can tack everything together.

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.260
The top and bottom pieces just get some glue  

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.880
and brads.

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.600
You won't see me paint my shop projects all that often but this plywood, I have to admit, 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.820
really needs a face lift.
