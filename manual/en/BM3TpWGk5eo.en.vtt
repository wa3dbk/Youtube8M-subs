00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:04.250
Well welcome back, the intention of this
next lecture

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.480
is to give you an overview the
biological diversity of

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:12.320
tropical coastal ecosystems and
introduce the major types of organisms.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.710
Now given that the biological diversity of
tropical coastal ecosystems

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:21.670
probably stretches beyond a million
species our treatment here

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.350
will be more a brief introduction to the
major types of organisms

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.369
as opposed to an in-depth treatment. If
you're interested in learning more

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.760
there are a large number of universities
and organisations which

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:38.210
offer courses and other opportunities to
learn about these organisms that will be

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:39.170
introduced here.

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.270
Well let's start with a very simple
question,

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.440
how many species are there in tropical
coastal ecosystems?

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.640
The answer to this question is not
actually known,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.149
however biodiversity experts have
estimated that 25% of

00:00:55.149 --> 00:01:00.030
all known marine species are found in and around tropical coastal ecosystems,

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.470
and the number may exceed a million when
bacteria and microbes and the full range

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.420
of organisms is taken into account.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.960
The rate of discovery of new species is
very informative

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.250
with over 100 fish species for example
being described each year.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.610
Our knowledge is particularly poor in
some environments such as mesophotic

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:21.270
areas

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.159
where the depth makes it hard for
scientists to become

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.000
regular visitors. Mesophotic reefs stretch from

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.020
around 30 meters down to 150 meters

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.810
and are fascinating regions which
are poorly known to science.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.450
Let's now take a brief look at the
organisms one can find on tropical

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:42.840
coastal ecosystems.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.250
Here is a broad overview of the
categories

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.320
of organisms that you're likely to find on
tropical coastal ecosystems.

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.509
One of the simplest organisms that are
found on

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.890
tropical coastal ecosystems are the
nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.960
Despite their simplicity, cyanobacteria are
incredibly important to the

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.770
nutrient budget of tropical coastal ecosystems. Here

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:12.050
they're able to fix nitrogen from the
atmosphere using an enzyme known as

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:16.420
nitrogenase, which is found in many
cyanobacterial species

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.000
and in large cells known as heterocysts.
Every so often

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.730
water-borne cyanobacteria can bloom
around places like coral reefs

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.690
providing dense concentrations of brown
species known as

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.530
Trichodesmium which is often
referred to a 'sea sawdust'.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.140
Cyanobacteria are important components of
the surface layers of sediments

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.730
and rocks and may fix an enormous amount
of nitrogen as part of their daily

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:44.650
activities.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.849
Cyanobacteria often appear as

00:02:47.849 --> 00:02:51.879
discoloration of dead coral and
sediment surfaces,

00:02:51.879 --> 00:02:56.400
even intertidal beach rock shown here in
this picture from Heron Island.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.030
Experiments done by Professor Michael
Kühl from the University of Copenhagen

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.580
have shown that beach rock releases
oxygen when it's exposed to sunlight

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:12.000
and after it's been moistened by sea water
again. This is due to cynobacteria

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.650
having established a presence

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.790
in the outer layers of the beach rock. If you're
interested

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:19.730
you might consider having a look at the
papers by Professor Kühl and his

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:20.440
colleagues.

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:25.390
Part of the diversity of life on coral
reefs is taken up by huge numbers of

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.670
single-celled photosynthetic plant-like
organisms

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:34.290
which are collectively known as micro-algae. These tiny plants have a range

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.280
of different photosynthetic pigments

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.950
and include organisms such as green
micro algae,

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.269
diatoms and other single celled, eukaryotic,

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.299
photosynthetic organisms. Some of these
organisms have beautiful shells

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.989
which make magnificent photographs under
the microscope.

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.519
Micro-algae also provide enormous
amounts of primary production

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:00.689
within tropical coastal ecosystems as
part of assembleges such as

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:03.860
benthic-micro-algal communities
which cover

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.799
many sub-tidal rocks and surfaces.There are
three types of

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:11.980
macro algae or seaweeds that occur
worldwide within tropical coastal

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.019
ecosystems.

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.709
Each group is distinct from the others
in terms of the types of pigments that

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:19.109
they have in their tissues.

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:22.460
Whereas all of them have chlorophyll,

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.840
each of the different groups tends to
have pigments that colour their tissues in

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:28.380
various ways described:

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:35.009
red, brown and green. One of the most important ecological

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:39.020
interactions within some tropical
coastal ecosystems

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.710
is the competition between macro-algae and
other organisms.

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:48.979
For example on coral reefs macro-algae and
corals are usually engaged in a fierce

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:50.020
competition

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:54.740
for space which is modulated by the presence
or absence of other organisms such as

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.750
grazers.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:05:00.580
While coral reef macro-algae show high rates
the primary production

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.940
and provide habitat and food for many
species,

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.500
they can also become a threat to coral
reefs under certain conditions.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.910
Algae, by competing for space using toxins
and by abrading corals with their fronds,

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:18.600
cause damage to corals. Under increased
nutrients and reduced grazing

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.720
macro-algae can become the dominant benthic organisms in tropical coastal

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:24.340
ecosystems.

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:28.009
We will be coming back to this theme in the next couple weeks when you begin to hear from

00:05:28.009 --> 00:05:31.039
Professor Peter Mumby and other colleagues.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:34.710
Many macro-algae on coral reefs deposit
calcium carbonate

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:39.810
like other organisms such as corals. In
some cases much of the sand can be

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:45.050
produced by calcifying green algae, such as
Halimeda.

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.680
Some red macro-algae also calcify

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.830
encrusting rocks, surfaces, mangrove roots
and stones,

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.680
and in the case of coral reefs, coral
fragments are essentially glued together

00:05:56.680 --> 00:05:57.639
by

00:05:57.639 --> 00:06:02.090
red coralline algae to make a framework,
that consists of the reef.

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:07.020
These ecological relationships will be
revisited in later parts of the course.

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:10.660
The last group of plant-like organisms
associated with tropical coastal

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:11.819
ecosystems

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:15.410
are the marine angiosperms or flowering
plants,

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:19.400
which comprise principally of the sea
grasses and mangroves.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:24.210
These two groups represent land plants that
have re-evolved for life in the ocean.

00:06:24.210 --> 00:06:28.740
We'll be hearing a lot more about these
organisms from Professor Cath Lovelock,

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:32.380
who spent most of her career studying
them.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.020
They're fascinating organisms in that
they represent multiple lines of

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:37.199
evolution

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.229
that have ended in a very similar set of
adaptations

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:43.580
for life in the ocean. Marine angiosperms

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.630
like mangroves are also extremely
important to tropical coastlines

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:51.520
by stabilising sediments and providing
habitat for fisheries

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.690
and by protecting coastlines from storms
and waves.

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.550
Now take a moment to consider the
concept of competition between

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:03.110
macro-algae and corals. Read the paper by

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:06.500
Terry Hughes and coworkers on phase
shifts,

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:10.099
herbivory and the resilience of coral
reefs to climate change,

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:13.630
and explore your understanding the
interaction between macro-algae,

00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.139
corals, and grazing fish. After that

00:07:17.139 --> 00:07:21.800
test your knowledge and understanding of
the interaction between seaweeds, fish

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.050
and climate change using the provided
quiz.
