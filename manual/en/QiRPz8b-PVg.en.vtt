00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This is Emil.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
And this is Clara.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.500
Yes, we are on a CISV Camp.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.100
A Village.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.100
A Village!

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:28.600
Where we meet new people from a lot of different countries.

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.000
And you get to know their culture,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.700
and the things they do in their countries.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.300
It can be all sorts of different stuff.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.900
Yeah!

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.000
Friendship

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:44.900
I have gotten friends from

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.900
Korea,

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:46.900
the US,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:47.900
Peru,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:48.900
Holland,

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:49.900
and Norway.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.420
There is actually someone, who has got a girlfriend here at camp.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.400
yes...

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Democracy

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.000
There are a lot of fun games.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.549
At a time we were separated into two teams,

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.500
and everybody had one water balloon!

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.000
Yeah!

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And then...!

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Sustainability

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.600
War time!

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.600
Conflict Resolution

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.780
Stop war time! It's time for peace!

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.130
Build up and repair your own villages!

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.300
We are going to...

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.360
..to a galla night!

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.630
Where we will dress-up, and have to act nicely.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.300
And eat nicely.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.700
And then afterwards there are Casino Night.

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.600
* lullaby sounds behind the soundtrack *

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.459
I've learned to say - in Chinese - how to say "goodnight":

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.000
晚安

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.500
Goodnight, champ!

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Goodnight!

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.300
