00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.980
Scouting out, your eyes see

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.580
The soul and they see it bared

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.100
Please stop this aching!

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.660
Jump, take your heart deeper

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:16.180
Big bang, the fire so laid out the sun

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.280
It will combine with darkness,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.420
What’cha worse for!?

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.960
Satellites are falling into a darkness of feeling

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:31.420
Did you think I ever should have fallen for you?

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:36.960
Let me take your heart, see if it goes in better when it’s sewn together

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.260
Rock and Roll and Rocking to Die

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.220
Get up and meet up with me emotionally

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.140
Shine on and shine on, light your life forever

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.660
She’s possibly a nightmare, a made up lie

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.820
It will combine with darkness

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.980
What’cha worse for!?

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.400
Satellites are falling into a darkness of feeling

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.060
Did you think I ever should have fallen for you?

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.520
Let me take your heart, see if it goes in better when it’s sewn together

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.320
Rock and Roll and Rocking to Die

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.660
Satellites are falling into a darkness of feeling

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.080
Did you think -you- ever should have fallen for you?

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:47.720
Let me take your heart, see if it goes in better when it’s sewn together

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.040
Rock and Rolling to Lie

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:02.040
And you always tell me the same

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:12.660
I can’t say what that means…

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.340
Sometimes your heart sees

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.020
The soul and they see it bared

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:20.460
Please stop this aching!

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:23.120
Jump, take your heart deeper

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:27.600
Big bang, the fire so laid out the sun

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:30.760
It will combine with sadness

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.000
What’cha worse for!?

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:58.560
Satellites are falling into a darkness of feeling

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.020
Did you think I ever should have fallen for you?

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:08.500
Let me take your heart, see if it goes in better when it’s sewn together

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.040
Rock and Roll and Rocking to Die

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.760
Satellites are falling into a darkness of feeling

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.120
Did you think -you- ever should have fallen for you?

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.760
Let me take your heart, see if it goes in better when it’s sewn together

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.080
Rock and Rolling to Lie

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.920
It’s you…
