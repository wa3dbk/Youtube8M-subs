00:00:00.208 --> 00:00:03.072
(howling)

00:00:03.072 --> 00:00:08.072
(mildly scary music)

00:00:19.025 --> 00:00:21.581
Hi guys, so today is the first of my

00:00:21.581 --> 00:00:25.238
Halloween DIYs for the
year, I say as I stand here

00:00:25.238 --> 00:00:28.387
sweating in Los Angeles
100 degree weather.

00:00:28.387 --> 00:00:29.708
This might seem a little bit early,

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:32.450
but it's a really fun
project that is great

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.662
just for fall in general
or even into Thanksgiving.

00:00:35.662 --> 00:00:38.261
And the project is these really cute

00:00:38.261 --> 00:00:41.410
spray-painted miniature pumpkins.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.581
So when like last year, when
I decorated real pumpkins,

00:00:44.581 --> 00:00:47.140
these are plastic and
I got them at Michaels

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:49.110
for just a couple of dollars.

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.692
However, the colors and
patterns that they came with

00:00:51.692 --> 00:00:54.841
are really cheesy and I think
I can make it look better

00:00:54.841 --> 00:00:57.380
with just a few cans of spray paint.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.163
So the first thing I'm going
to do is tape off the stems

00:01:00.163 --> 00:01:01.647
with painters tape.

00:01:01.647 --> 00:01:04.248
This isn't completely necessary
and I actually ended up

00:01:04.248 --> 00:01:07.721
painting the stems later anyway,
but once that was all done

00:01:07.721 --> 00:01:11.479
I took them outside and I gave
them a base coat in white.

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:14.508
Again, not completely necessary,
but I wanted to make sure

00:01:14.508 --> 00:01:17.697
that none of the ugly patterns
were going to show through.

00:01:17.697 --> 00:01:19.342
So once the white paint was dry,

00:01:19.342 --> 00:01:21.597
I painted them each a solid color.

00:01:21.597 --> 00:01:23.568
And I painted them all
within the same kind

00:01:23.568 --> 00:01:26.880
of fall color scheme,
using golds and silvers,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.521
and this ridiculously bright orange.

00:01:29.521 --> 00:01:31.431
So once those were completely dry,

00:01:31.431 --> 00:01:33.625
it was time to start planning
what kind of patterns

00:01:33.625 --> 00:01:35.434
I wanted to paint on them.

00:01:35.434 --> 00:01:38.745
I actually really like how
they look as just solid colors,

00:01:38.745 --> 00:01:41.914
especially the gold and
the bright shiny orange,

00:01:41.914 --> 00:01:44.149
so you could stop here if you wanted to,

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.197
but I have a few more ideas up my sleeve.

00:01:47.197 --> 00:01:49.939
So for the first one I'm going
to use this piece of lace

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.809
to mask off the pumpkin.

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:53.881
I cut a small hole for the stem,

00:01:53.881 --> 00:01:57.275
and then used a rubber
band to hold it in place.

00:01:57.275 --> 00:01:59.043
And then I'm hoping the
pattern from the lace

00:01:59.043 --> 00:02:01.948
will transfer on to the
pumpkin when I paint it.

00:02:01.948 --> 00:02:03.674
For the next one, I actually got this idea

00:02:03.674 --> 00:02:06.560
from one of Mr. Kate's recent DIY videos,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.460
which is to use fishnet
tights to mask off a pattern.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.649
I cut off a piece of these
tights, which I never wear,

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:17.205
stretched it over the pumpkin,
and again used a rubber band

00:02:17.205 --> 00:02:19.094
on the bottom to keep it in place.

00:02:19.094 --> 00:02:21.329
Then I did the same
thing on this orange one,

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.849
so I could try out different
color combinations.

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:26.348
For the next one, I decided
to used painter's tape

00:02:26.348 --> 00:02:28.928
to mask off the bottom of the pumpkin

00:02:28.928 --> 00:02:31.224
for a cool color blocked look.

00:02:31.224 --> 00:02:34.508
I used thin tape to get the
line perfectly straight,

00:02:34.508 --> 00:02:37.604
and then the thicker tape to
cover the rest of the bottom.

00:02:37.604 --> 00:02:40.590
And then for this gourd, which
is kind of a funny shape,

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.454
I used this really thin artist's tape

00:02:43.454 --> 00:02:46.746
to mask off a random
pattern wrapping around it

00:02:46.746 --> 00:02:49.001
with just one long piece of tape.

00:02:49.001 --> 00:02:51.684
So to paint these, they weren't
going to stand up straight

00:02:51.684 --> 00:02:53.961
with a big ball of fabric underneath,

00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:56.031
so I grabbed some plastic cups,

00:02:56.031 --> 00:02:57.941
weighted them down with marbles,

00:02:57.941 --> 00:02:59.932
and then placed the pumpkin on top

00:02:59.932 --> 00:03:01.639
and it worked out really well.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:03.020
So once I got them all in place,

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.538
it was time to start painting.

00:03:05.538 --> 00:03:10.538
(mildly scary music)

00:03:12.733 --> 00:03:15.433
So once I did all of the ones
that I prepared beforehand,

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:17.668
I brought out this plain gold one,

00:03:17.668 --> 00:03:20.493
which I didn't add
anything to, instead I did

00:03:20.493 --> 00:03:23.033
what the spray paint
bottles tell you not to do,

00:03:23.033 --> 00:03:25.531
and pointed it straight
at the top of the pumpkin

00:03:25.531 --> 00:03:28.639
to let the paint pool up
and drip down the sides.

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.220
So I let those dry to the
touch, and brought them inside

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.845
to start taking off the tape.

00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:35.772
I love how this color
blocked one turned out,

00:03:35.772 --> 00:03:37.681
and it was so easy to make.

00:03:37.681 --> 00:03:40.241
I was so nervous taking
off the first fishnet,

00:03:40.241 --> 00:03:42.618
but the pattern actually did transfer

00:03:42.618 --> 00:03:44.243
and I think it looks really cool.

00:03:44.243 --> 00:03:46.823
Same with the other one,
which brings a bit of orange

00:03:46.823 --> 00:03:50.116
into the mix without it being
really gaudy and in your face.

00:03:50.116 --> 00:03:52.696
The lace one was what I
was most worried about,

00:03:52.696 --> 00:03:55.783
but the pattern actually
looks kind of amazing.

00:03:55.783 --> 00:03:57.591
It gets kind of blurry on the curves

00:03:57.591 --> 00:03:59.928
but then it's clear up top, I love it.

00:03:59.928 --> 00:04:02.042
And the drip one looks
really cool as well,

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:04.926
like black blood dripping down the sides.

00:04:04.926 --> 00:04:07.811
The only one I wasn't too
thrilled about was this gourd.

00:04:07.811 --> 00:04:11.061
So after the first layer, I
covered it with tape again,

00:04:11.061 --> 00:04:14.293
spray-painted it again,
covered it with tape again,

00:04:14.293 --> 00:04:17.193
spray-painted it again,
and then I think it looks

00:04:17.193 --> 00:04:19.391
so awesome now with all
these different colors

00:04:19.391 --> 00:04:21.423
in such a weird pattern.

00:04:21.423 --> 00:04:24.494
So the only thing left
to finish was the stems.

00:04:24.494 --> 00:04:27.762
Taking off the tape, I
wasn't too thrilled with the

00:04:27.762 --> 00:04:30.769
original color of the
stems, so for some of them

00:04:30.769 --> 00:04:33.695
I used black acrylic paint
to just darken them up.

00:04:33.695 --> 00:04:36.823
And for the others, I cut a
hole in a piece of cardstock

00:04:36.823 --> 00:04:40.419
to use as a shield, and then
spray-painted just the stems.

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:41.890
And when I took off the paper,

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:43.548
the stems looked so much better.

00:04:43.548 --> 00:04:45.539
But it would have saved
me a lot of trouble

00:04:45.539 --> 00:04:47.124
to just paint them at the same time

00:04:47.124 --> 00:04:48.729
that I did the rest of the colors,

00:04:48.729 --> 00:04:52.624
so that's what I would recommend
if you do this project.

00:04:52.624 --> 00:04:57.624
(mildly scary music)

00:05:03.045 --> 00:05:04.698
And that's the result of my

00:05:04.698 --> 00:05:08.254
spray-painted pumpkin
project slash experiment.

00:05:08.254 --> 00:05:10.956
I love how these came out
and I'm so happy I did them

00:05:10.956 --> 00:05:13.800
on fake pumpkins this
year so I can keep them

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:15.954
and display them year after year.

00:05:15.954 --> 00:05:19.700
Tell me in the comments
which one was your favorite

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:22.151
or do you have any
other ideas on cool ways

00:05:22.151 --> 00:05:24.284
to mask off different patterns,

00:05:24.284 --> 00:05:27.555
or maybe you really just
liked the solid color look,

00:05:27.555 --> 00:05:28.794
or maybe you want to try this

00:05:28.794 --> 00:05:30.968
on something that's not even a pumpkin.

00:05:30.968 --> 00:05:32.187
Just tell me what you're thinking

00:05:32.187 --> 00:05:34.138
in the comments down below.

00:05:34.138 --> 00:05:36.880
So that's going to be it
for me, but don't worry,

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:39.997
I have plenty more
Halloween DIYs coming up,

00:05:39.997 --> 00:05:41.561
but in the meantime, if you want to see

00:05:41.561 --> 00:05:44.113
how I decorated some pumpkins last year,

00:05:44.113 --> 00:05:46.104
you can watch that video right here.

00:05:46.104 --> 00:05:49.904
Or if you want to watch a
Halloween DIY collab video

00:05:49.904 --> 00:05:52.545
that I did with Tyler
Oakley two years ago,

00:05:52.545 --> 00:05:54.617
you can check that one out right here.

00:05:54.617 --> 00:05:56.425
And then I'm also going to have a playlist

00:05:56.425 --> 00:05:59.676
right down below of all
of my Halloween videos

00:05:59.676 --> 00:06:01.085
from over the years in case you want

00:06:01.085 --> 00:06:02.825
to start getting in the spirit.

00:06:02.825 --> 00:06:04.349
So that's going to be it for me,

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:07.234
I am literally melting in this heat,

00:06:07.234 --> 00:06:09.449
I should be like the
Wicked Witch of the West

00:06:09.449 --> 00:06:12.008
for Halloween or something,
that's not my costume,

00:06:12.008 --> 00:06:17.008
feel free to keep guessing,
but um, yeah ok, bye everyone.
