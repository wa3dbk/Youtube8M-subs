00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Hello everyone, I’m Jake, the Geek Out Tech.

00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.100
Today, I’m going to show you how to move everything

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.200
from an old Mac to a new Mac using a Time Machine Backup.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.200
I’m going to be moving everything including all files,

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.300
applications, and settings from my

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.500
old 2010 Macbook Pro

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.100
to my new refurbished 2013 Macbook Pro.

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.900
To do this, I’ll be using a Time Machine backup

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.900
which brings us to the first thing we need to do.

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.300
On the old computer, 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.300
let’s run a backup by clicking the 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.500
Time Machine icon in the Menu Bar 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.500
and select Back Up Now. When this is done,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.400
eject and disconnect the Time Machine drive 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.400
and we’re done with the older computer.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.600
Now boot up the new Mac like normal. 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.200
In order to move all this information,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.500
we’re going to use Migration Assistant.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.800
Open Finder.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.500
Go to Applications.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.700
Utilities

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:04.100
Double click on Migration Assistant.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.700
and Continue.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.800
Enter your Administrator password and click OK.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.300
Select the first Option to use a

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.400
Time Machine Backup and Continue.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.900
Migration Assistant will start looking for a

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.400
Time Machine Backup

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.800
so now we’ll connect the backup drive.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.100
Once it shows up,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.700
click on the drive to select it and Continue.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.100
Select the latest backup

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.300
and Continue.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.000
Here you can select the what you want to 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.700
transfer to the new computer. 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.200
Applications, Documents and Data, 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.300
and Computer and Network Settings.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.000
With the Documents and Data,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.200
you can further refine what you want transfer. 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.500
Click on Edit

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.500
and then click on the triangle next to the User Account. 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.700
Here you can uncheck anything you don’t want transferred.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.400
Click Okay and Continue with the Transfer.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.000
Now you can select whether or not you want to

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
keep any user accounts that are on the new Mac.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I’m going to replace the user account 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.900
that’s on the new Mac and not keep a copy of it. 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.100
This is okay for me because the new 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.600
computer does not have any information on it

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.100
that I want to keep.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.900
I’m going to Continue and the actual

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.900
transfer of files will begin.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.500
Depending on your computer,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.600
the backup drive, and how much information

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.000
is on the backup drive,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.200
this could take from around a half an hour

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.100
to several hours to complete.

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.000
When it’s done transferring files,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.800
it will let you know if it found any

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.700
incompatible software.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.400
Continue and the Migration is complete.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.900
Restart the Mac

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:41.000
and now there are a few final things to do.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.100
Enter your Apple ID password and Continue.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:48.900
Setup iCloud Keychain if you wish and Continue.

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:50.400
Here’s a final setup

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.100
and it will boot into the Operating System.

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.200
After it boots, I’m going to eject

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.800
the Time Machine Backup

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:58.600
so it doesn’t do a backup.

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.600
I’ll do that later after testing the Migration

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.500
 and everything is okay.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.100
There will be a few things wrap up

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.300
which will vary depending on what programs you have. 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.500
First, Mail needed to go through an import of messages. 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.500
Then you’ll need to enter your iCloud password.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.100
For some reason, it asked me to do this twice.

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.000
Also, I had to reenter my Dropbox information.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.300
So that’s it. I’ve successfully moved 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.000
everything from my old Mac to my new Mac.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.100
