Nov.8th Inspiration Gala Day

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
How you doing? Good to see you.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000
How you doing Larry?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.280
We learned of your dream of having an inspirational gala evening for young woman. 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.880
We’ve got a whole team of volunteers together,

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.230
to help make today matter.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.280
We’re not going to wait for the future to make this happen, we’re going to do it now. 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:24.680
Sound good?  

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Is this real?

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.920
It’s absolutely real. Come here. 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.120
I have two boys and one girl. Larry has three kids of his own. 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.660
10 years ago I adopted 2 girls.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:43.520
Children that are in foster care they are fighters but they never get that boost of people making them feel better about themselves.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:50.420
They’re on their own, they’re alone, they want to just feel like they belong. These kids they can’t be forgotten. 

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:59.200
It’s going to be a ball extravaganza for foster girls. A gala in one day. Yes!

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.040
Candace! Guess what? They’re allowing me to do a ball event for girls. 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.140
Stop lying to me. 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.140
I’m not lying.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:09.300
Oh my god. So awesome. 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.400
Ok girl I’ll be seeing you. 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:15.960
Oh wow.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.200
That is so sweet. 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.040
You like those daisies?

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.040
Ya I do.  

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.520
That’s beautiful.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.220
It’s going to build their confidence. Encourage them that they’re special. That they’re beautiful inside and out. 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.580
Hi Guys. I was asked what would you do if you had the opportunity to do something great.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:45.280
I said I’m going to host a big event, in a beautiful venue, and these girls are going have dresses, makeovers, their hair done. Today! 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.060
Today!

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.060
Common guys!

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
Well, I didn’t expect all of this. They just told us we were going to a banquet. 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.340
I feel like I’m a superstar!

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
When I got here I started crying because I never experienced anything like this before. 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
When you’re dealing with youth that have nothing and they come from nowhere, just to say I love you can change their whole world

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:12.820
Good evening everybody. Welcome to the inspiration gala. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.000
These beautiful young ladies who are growing up in the system, ladies you are phenomenal. 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
Girls. You’re not alone. And I’m never going to quit, and I’m never going to stop because you matter.

It’s going to build their confidence. Encourage them that they’re special. That they’re beautiful inside and out. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
I feel so grateful for being here. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
This was really nice. Wasn’t this nice?

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:43.000
I just want to say I love her. I love them. They are two great strong, inspirational woman that I just really look up to. 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.000
This is something that they will never ever ever forget. 24 hours. 24 hours! But it happened. 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000
Make today Matter!

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
#MakeTodayMatter

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000
When you #MakeTodayMatter you make tomorrow brighter.
