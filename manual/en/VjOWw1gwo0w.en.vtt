Each time you take a look at our demo site, you would see a nice image slideshow which is called Kuler CSS3 Slideshow.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This module is built based on CSS3 technique which provides the same effect as jQuery version while increasing performance.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Now we're going to show you how to create and configure it.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Login to your back-end, choose Extensions &gt;&gt; Modules &gt;&gt; Edit.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
On the first screen, choose "add module" to create a new one.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Then type in module Title and choose all necessary options.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:24.000
There are 2 options in Image Source, the first one is to take all images from built-in Opencart Banners

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Second option is to choose image for your slideshow manually.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Then you will have to type in width and height value of this module, choose Transition type.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Next is Split value, we will discuss about it later in this video

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:06.000
The last part is to choose all images that you want to be displayed in your image slideshow.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:46.000
You can type in your image Title and Link if you want, users will be redirected to this link whenever they click to appropriate image.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
All sets! Now click Save and go to your front-end to see the result.

This image slideshow works flawlessly with tablet / mobile devices while loading faster than the build-in OpenCart slideshow module.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000
You can choose from 1 to 4 transition types and disable Auto Start if you want.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
Auto start is no longer run...

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
...and the transition effect has been changed as well.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Now back to the Split option, you'll see that by default the slideshow has been divided into 10 parts.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Let's change this value to see how it works.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000
So the slideshow is now divided into 20 parts and it looks nice with the new transition type.
