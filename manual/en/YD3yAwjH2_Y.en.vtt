00:00:01.209 --> 00:00:04.970
Woah!! wow!

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.990
Holy Bible!

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.020
Alright...,

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:12.290
...let's see what we got here.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.600
Ooo, this one is the

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.060
King James Version of the Bible, dates
back to...

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.020
...let's say early sixteen hundreds, right?

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.720
What do we got here? The New Revised
Standard Version

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.400
1989,

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:34.340
this one was donated by Mrs Edith Cromwell. Thank you Edith.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.800
That's nice.

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.950
Ooo, this one is colorful, The
Contemporary

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.000
English version.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.160
Wow!

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.520
I could go on and on and on and on and on.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.760
The Bible and all its different
translations, how does one decide?

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:52.570
Well...

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.160
...eeny meeny miney.. meeny

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.680
miney eeny miney meeny moe?

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:57.180
Nope?

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.980
That does not work well. Uh the Bibles could roshambo for it,

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.420
you know, play a little rock paper scissors.
Of course

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.300
it would always be a tie since they're all
paper. [giggles behind camera] thank you..

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.450
Alright, how many Bibles are there

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.710
and how do we decide which one to pick
up? Well,

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.920
that's why we are talking about the
Bible translations

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.840
on this episode of Chuck Knows Church.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:26.880
[Intro music begins]

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:46.460
The entire Bible has been translated
into over five hundred languages

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.270
from its original writings in Greek Aramaic and Hebrew. And there are at least some

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.420
portions of the Bible

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.560
in over 2,500 languages. No wonder there are numerable translations.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.770
A Latin version of the Bible dominated
Western Christianity through the Middle

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:01.770
Ages called

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.470
the "vulgate" or "common version." Not to be confused

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.190
with toothpaste for vultures...

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:11.100
Volgate.
[giggles off camera]

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.160
The volgate was a late fourth century
translation largely the work of a man

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.280
named Jerome.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.769
Just Jerome, I don't know if that was his
first or last name,

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:25.349
around here we just call him Jerome. 
Jerome was commissioned by Pope Damasus

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:27.580
the 1st in 382AD

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.980
Now the Hebrew Bible, the Tanakh

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.239
was only mostly written in Hebrew. Some
portions were

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.829
actually in Aramaic and while the New
Testament was written in Greek

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:41.959
the original Greek writings written by
the original authors of the New Testament

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:45.910
have not survived, but copies have. 
Transmitted and preserved

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.569
in a number of different versions. Now, scholars have been trying to classify their

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:54.190
relative reliability for centuries. Ancient
scribes

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.370
would copy the earlier books and sometimes
put notes in the margin

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:03.150
to correct or comment about the text and then when later scribes were, you know,

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.000
copying the copy, they were sometimes
confused by the note.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.769
Is it corrected text or just a comment

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.459
or reminder to buy milk? Now over time

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:20.040
different regions, different versions, new omissions

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.250
various additions, again no surprise,

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.100
another version of the bible. Now a 2012 survey

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.540
from the christian booksellers
association lists the most popular

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.799
versions of the Bible sold by their members

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:39.109
in the United States. The top three, based
on both dollar and unit sales

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:42.609
are [drum roll sound], the New Living Translation

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:48.329
[again with the drum roll sound?] the King James Version and 
[drum roll again] the New International Version

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.600
That's right give them, sure yeah, let's give them
[claps all around]

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:55.579
round of applause. Alright, but, uh..

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:59.959
hey folks a let's not forget the
American Standard Version

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:03.389
the Revised Standard Version, the New 
International Version

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:08.100
[in fast forward] English Standard Version, New Century Version, International Readers Version, The Message [many names really fast]

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.280
[deep breath]

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.160
I'm sure I left a few out there, uh,

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:19.530
in the United Methodist Church

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:22.800
the most often use translation is the

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:27.370
New Revised Standard Version. However

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:32.090
I don't think it matters as much
which one you pick up

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.870
as long as you do pick one up. In all
its translations

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.500
the Bible remains the best-selling book
of all time.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.260
Not only God's interaction with people
throughout history but

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.410
a way to better understand what God is
saying to us today.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.970
To learn more ask your Pastor

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.400
tell them Chuck sent ya.
