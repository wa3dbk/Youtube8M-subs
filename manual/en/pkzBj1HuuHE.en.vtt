00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:07.209
Simple, convenient and easy to set up, the
Eagles Nest Outfitters ProFly rain tarp pro-vides

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:14.230
excellent protection for hammock camping from
wet weather and wind and rain.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.110
The big story here is that this is really
easy to set up.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:26.960
You have got 100 percent nylon rip stop fabric
that is PU coated so it is completely waterproof

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.001
and there is only one seam there on the top
and that seam is completely taped so you have

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:34.480
got waterproof protection here.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.730
And it even protects against sun.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:41.720
So if you just need a nice shady spot, you
can set this up and protect from sun as well.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.620
We have got this positioned between two trees.

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.010
We have our Eagles Nest Outfitters hammock
set up underneath of it.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:54.900
And I like to set up the rain tarp high enough
above my hammock that I don’t feel claustrophobic,

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.680
but close enough that if you have got some
wind and rain, the rain isn’t going to come

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.990
inside of the rain tarp.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.960
You have got a couple attachment points here.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:07.939
So it is basically a four cornered tarp.

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:10.569
And the two attachment points at the top are
really easy.

00:01:10.569 --> 00:01:15.479
You just attach those cords to the trees that
your hammock is attached to.

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:24.090
And then down here on the corners you can
at-tach these lines to logs, rocks, tree branches,

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.090
trees.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.939
Right now we have got the lines at-tached
around logs.

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:32.630
So you can use stakes if you need to stake
this out.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.560
The stakes are not included so you have to
bring those or purchase them separately.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:42.439
But, again, they set up really well around
other things in the forest.

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.240
So if you don’t have things like sticks
and logs, you definitely want to bring some

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.009
stakes along with you.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.159
Again, set up is really simple.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:56.880
What I normally do is set it up really lose
to begin with so I attach it to the two trees

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.929
pretty loose and then the four corners down
at the bottom.

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:06.509
And then when I have everything kind of in
its place, I will go around to the four corners

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.450
and just really cinch them down.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.670
So the attachment points here remind of me
guy out lines for tents where you can go up

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.590
and make minor adjustments.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.829
So they are really easy to use and the lines
of this tarp are a little bit different than

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:28.030
just a regular four sided tarp that you can
buy anywhere.

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.340
They are ergonomic lines.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.200
So when it is raining really hard, those lines
they are kind of drip lines.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.040
So the water is going to run off and it is
not going to go underneath of your hammock

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.420
and drip on you.

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.970
So it is a really convenient design.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.860
Again, with those four corners and really
easy to set up and provides really great protection

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.890
for your hammock.

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:54.300
The size of this rain tarp is really nice.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:01.829
It is 10 feet six inches long and six feet
four inches wide when it is laid out flat.

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.890
So that definitely provides ample coverage.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.459
This does pack down to be pretty small and
it is mean to be a little bit lighter weight

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:11.519
than some of the bigger tarps by Eagles Nest
Outfitters.

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.840
So you can definitely pack it away, put it
in your backpack, you know, take it on multi

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.840
day trips.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.800
And they include a stuff sack.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.629
So it packs down into here, again, really
small, nice pack size.

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.549
And with the ProFly rain tarp, you can be
confident of a great night’s sleep while

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:30.549
you are hammock camping.

00:03:30.549 --> 00:03:37.150
You are going got be protected from rain,
from wind and it is even great as a sun shade.
