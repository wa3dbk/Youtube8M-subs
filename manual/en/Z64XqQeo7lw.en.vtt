00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.459
Tae-yeon: Namsan!

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:59.798
Tiffany: Tae-yeon says Namsan

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:08.180
Soo-young: It’s little bit far, but if you go to Namyang-joo, there’s a bike path, it’s really pretty.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:16.420
Tourists usually don’t go there because they don’t have enough time to go there

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.440
but I recommend you to go there and enjoy the view if your schedule allows

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:28.100
Tiffany: It’s summer in Korea and also season for “Bingsoo(A bowl of shaved ice)”

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.660
so there’re many different delicious Bingsoo in Korea

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.260
I think it will be very fun to tour around just for Bingsoo. It’s very interesting!

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.500
Tae-yeon: Which area has good Bingsoo?

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.700
I recommend “Samcheong-dong”!

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.760
Tiffany: Samcheong-dong, Insa-dong. Yes, I recommend these areas for Bingsoo!
