00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:39.000
If it's that light that had started to fade

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.300
It's right there, just lift your head up

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:53.980
If you look forward, you'll see something

00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:03.980
I'm sure there's something there you'll want

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.920
Looking back, and then looking forward again

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:16.240
Doing the same things over and over again

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:24.040
I've come this far. Even if it's only a little

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.800
I feel I've moved forward. Probably, I mean

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.560
I'm still incomplete. Even now repeating

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.880
Encounters over and over, tiring out

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:50.140
But if I'm tired all I have to do is sleep

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:59.200
No matter what day it is, it's one I can be in

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:07.520
Before I knew it the sun had set

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:15.020
Before I knew it the rain had stopped

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.500
Right now I'll walk forward

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:30.020
Right now I'll start looking ahead

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:37.400
The sun rises, yet again

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:44.920
I'm talking about trivial things

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:52.280
Everything repeating over and over again

00:03:52.880 --> 00:04:02.380
That is you and that is me
