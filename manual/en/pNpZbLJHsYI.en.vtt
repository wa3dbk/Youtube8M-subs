00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:08.220
Hey guys!

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:09.389
Thank you so much for tuning in to my channel!

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.260
Today I'm doing a Summer shoe haul!

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:14.830
I actually didn't even mean to go shoe shopping.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:19.630
I was with a friend, helping her find a shoe
for a wedding, and then, somewhere in there,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:20.810
I realized, "Wait a minute.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.670
I'm the maid of honor in that wedding, and
I don't have shoes yet.." so then I decided

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:26.800
to do try to find that one single shoe.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:32.770
But, for me, I can never just buy one shoe;
I always have to buy, like, two to five shoes,

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.270
at a time.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:38.820
One thing that I love about shoes, and it's
also same thing that really love about makeup,

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.890
is I feel like those are the two things that
are going to fit you, no matter what size

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:44.890
you are.

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.290
Like I am down to go shoe shopping, even if
I feel bloated.

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.170
LIke I'm not going to go bikini shopping,
if I'm not feeling alright to look in the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.920
mirror -- and, I mean, the lighting in the
dressing rooms are a nightmare in itself.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.720
So, I'm looking forward to wearing these shoes
this summer, and you'll probably still see

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:04.890
them next summer and the summer after that
and the summer after that.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.840
And luckily I did find some good sales, and
I also found some gift cards in my purse,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.960
so I would say this was a successful trip.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:20.400
And also let me know which pair of shoes of
are these -- HA-- which one of these pairs

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.460
of shoes is your favorite!

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.160
You have a few to choose from.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.920
So let's start with the whole reason I was
convinced to go shopping in the first place,

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.870
which was I needed to buy shoes for a wedding.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.520
I'm in a wedding, so the bride has asked for
us to wear some strappy tan heels.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.290
But, since I've been in a few weddings, I
know that you definitely don't want high heels,

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.880
so I got these strappy lovelies from Brass
Plum, which is otherwise known as the junior

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.950
department at Nordstrom.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.420
What I love about these is that the heels
are really low -- actually, that's the part

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.090
that I don't love; these are probably the
lowest heels that I own.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.380
But, because they're low, they're really comfortable.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.720
And, also, the strap along the toe is a lot
thicker than what I saw, so it's not pinching

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.120
at my toes at the bones, where I want to be
comfortable and be able to dance for the whole

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:07.120
night.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.229
Doo Doo Doo.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.120
Just in case those get uncomfortable, I did
get a pair of nude sandals that are a little

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.349
blinged out.

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:16.700
I didn't get these specifically for the wedding
- in fact, I feel like the bride would think

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.340
these are a little too much for the wedding
-- but these are something that maybe once

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.700
we get to the reception, I could change into
for the sake of dancing.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.770
I did need a new pair of just everyday but
kind of nice sandals or even dressy sandals,

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.990
I could say, but usually if I'm gonna dress
up I go all the way and put heels on.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.550
These are Sam Edelman's.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.900
And I realized that I don't know the formal
names of any of these shoes, so I will find

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.840
out and make sure that I include them in the
description box below.

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.130
I got another pair of flats, these ones were
on sale, by Steve Madden.

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:52.890
It's a blue python print, with some gold metal
detail and also some sexy gold zippers in

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:53.920
the back.

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:59.330
One thing that I really don't like about these
and also the Sam Edelman's -- and summer sandals,

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:06.010
in general, nowadays -- is the really hard,
flat soles, because I have arches that aren't

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.950
in the best shape, so sometimes wearing shoes
like this can kind of be a pain throughout

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.610
the day, which is probably why I prefer to
wear wedges and heels, in general, not just

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:18.599
because they look pretty but just because
they're actually easier on my feet, which

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:23.629
probably doesn't make sense to a lot of people,
but that's just me.

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:30.630
Also by Steve Madden, I had to buy a heel,
this one is a fun summer spring statement

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:38.550
heel, and I love how there's this cutout right
here, on both sides.

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.980
It's pointy, which -- I feel like pointies
are kinda starting to work their way back

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.849
out, but they always come back, which I love.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.349
And the heel is a shiny glossy black - Love!

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:58.739
Now, I thought after a stop at Nordstrom and
Bloomie's that I was done....

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.580
I was wrong.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:08.510
So we stopped over at ALDO and I got another
pair of strappy tan heels, fun ones this time,

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:09.989
with a full heel!

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:15.310
I'm sure that those conservative ones will
get some wear, but I feel like these ones

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.489
are where it's at.

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.579
And these ones are the ones that I'll actually
want to wear.

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:24.470
What I love about this one is it's not your
typical toe strap / ankle strap or even criss-cross

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.470
strap.

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:29.690
It has this little swirl detail that makes
it look like it's going all the way up the

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:36.260
shoe, like a little sundae - yayyyyyy! we'll
see how comfortable they actually are because

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:43.220
it doesn't feel like there's a lot of abortion
- absorption... absorption happening.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:44.750
Moving on!

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:50.150
I definitely felt like I needed a summer wedge,
and I don't have a lot of white, when it comes

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:57.060
to shoes -- I feel like I'm just not someone
who can keep whites white -- I got these white

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.720
wedges -- super chunky, really comfy.

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:06.720
These ones, I actually was kind of between
sizes, so I got some little gel inserts to

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.530
put into the toes, and those boost me up just
enough.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:10.710
These are what they look like!

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:17.610
And, lastly, and I would say these are probably
the only ones from my shopping spree that

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.009
I'm thinking about returning, so please let
me know what you think about them.

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:26.520
I always try to buy a little something something
when I go shopping that's not my style to

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.490
force me to take a little risk and jump out
of my comfort zone, but...

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.560
I don't know about these ones.

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:36.090
These might be one of those ones that I buy,
hoping to take a risk, and then they just

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:37.370
end up camping out in my closet.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:40.240
They were on sale, so I think that's probably
why they were a little tempting.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.180
Here they are.

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:47.360
Also another python pattern, these ones are
gladiators that lace up.

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.460
And, they also have a gold heel detail, which
I really like, a zipper in the bag -- which

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.830
doesn't really work, at least not when I tried
it -- and I guess that part that I'm particularly

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.300
iffie about is this long lace that we have
here.

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:05.611
You definitely can't just tie it in a bow,
that'll just drag and get dirty and yucky.

00:06:05.611 --> 00:06:11.790
I tied it around my ankle, which kinda looked
a little bulky, so I don't know if I would

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:15.360
maybe just like cut the lace, but part of
what I like about it is that they have these

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.020
little gold knobs at the bottom.

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:18.020
I don't know!

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:19.020
Let me know what you think.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:21.650
Or if you just think I should burn them and
return them.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:23.690
So that was my shoe haul.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:30.310
I am now off to go clean out my shoe closet,
so that I can make room for these guys.

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:34.210
I'm basically pretty much set for summer.

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.600
But, then again, I don't think anyone can
ever have too many shoes.

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.009
Thank you so much for watching this video
and tuning in to my channel.

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:45.960
Please let me know if you want to see more
hauls or what you would like to see cuz I

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.840
guess I can only really do a haul if I go
shopping, and I really don't shop that much.

00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.320
Also, I am on Snapchat.

00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.069
I do post some fun behind the scenes stuff
there cuz it is really easy to get distracted

00:06:58.069 --> 00:06:59.980
when I have all these lights out...

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.240
Everybody.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:05.039
rock your body.

00:07:05.039 --> 00:07:09.060
Oh, I think he just farted.

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.730
But of course, the best way to see more is
to subscribe.

00:07:11.730 --> 00:07:14.860
Give this video a thumbs up and share it!

00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.259
So thank you so much for tuning in.

00:07:17.259 --> 00:07:19.599
I will see you next time!
