00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:15.630
that's a a half-ton pickup truck full a
5x8 trailer full I mean I got a way

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:24.539
maxed out you know the fenders are
almost touching the tires and I got this

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.160
it's solid oak and what these are is
railroad tie cut offs found a factory

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.640
about twelve miles from where I lived
that makes railroad ties and the cut

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.120
offs they put in a four by four by eight
foot box each box is a cord of wood and

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.550
they stack them up nice and neat so what
I got here is one cord to oak for 20

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.260
bucks and you got to load it yourself
and you know you're right in the middle

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.460
of their plant and sawdust everywhere
and yard dogs trying to get you to feed

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.399
them but anyway 20 bucks for an entire
cord of wood now the hard part is

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:16.770
convincing my wife to unload it not even
for 20 bucks okay I'll take the 20 man

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.860
this is some slow going here there's my
8 foot from the stakes the metal stakes

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:32.070
there to that 1 by 4 right here that's 8
foot long and it's 4 feet deep so if I

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.560
stack this up four feet tall that'll be
one whole cord of wood for 20 bucks I'm

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.630
still working on it
it sure I sure was able to load it

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:48.509
quicker than I'm able to unload it and
you know I know two people who don't

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.720
have a job and haven't had a job in a
while and I offered them both 20 bucks

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.350
to come over and help me stack this and
neither one would they're not my friends

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.090
or nothing but actually one of them was
my next-door neighbor that hasn't had a

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.960
job and so long I don't remember who
wouldn't want to make 20 bucks in one

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.020
hour took me an hour to load it by
myself and

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:18.790
yeah 20 bucks an hour is pretty good pay
huh oh well nobody wants to work all

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.670
right there's a full cord of wood
actually a little bit more it's a 4 by 4

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.370
by 8 plus a little bit and then I got
all that that I didn't bother stacking

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.480
because it's just small enough where I
could basically just throw it right in

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.280
the stove the way it is then I've
already got back with my second cord of

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:51.720
wood and it's about three o'clock 3:30 I
think I'm uh throw this off of my truck

00:02:51.720 --> 00:03:00.250
drop this trailer and get back on this
tomorrow huh forty bucks for two gourds

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:06.840
of wood solid oak some of its even red
oak pretty good find
