00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.270
Salutations celestial sight seers!

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.310
I'm David Fuller, welcome to Eyes on the Sky;
what's up this week?

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.931
On December 12-st at 17:11 Universal Time,
the winter solstice occurs for the Northern

00:00:34.931 --> 00:00:36.160
Hemisphere.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.230
So what can we expect to see in the sky for
the coming season?

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.230
In the north around 9 pm, the circumpolar
stars for many of us well north of the equator

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.480
rotate 90 degrees or so from December to March.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.780
Cassiopeia begins the season high to the northwest,
with the easily-seen Big Dipper or Plough

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.890
low to the north east.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.100
Directly north, Kocab hangs directly below
Polaris, with the seemingly blank Camelopardalis

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.530
and Lynx sections of the sky above the north
star.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.140
Fast forwarding three months, Cassiopeia drops,
Ursa Major rises, and Kocab is now towards

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.140
the east.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.240
This is direct evidence of our planet having
revolved 90 degrees over those three months,

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.130
with its axis still pointing the same direction.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:24.330
To the west, many autumn favorites are visible
early, such as Pegasus and Andromeda -- so

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.670
look for the sights within their borders in
early winter.

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.939
As the season progresses, many of the dimmer
water constellations like Pisces, Cetus and

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.450
Eridanus replace them, but a fair number of
the prominent winter constellations aren't

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.450
far behind.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.330
We'll look at constellations to the south
next.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.520
Dark Sky Fact: Giving any gifts this holiday
season?

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.979
Why not get some silver crown bulbs for post
lamps, or some shields for floodlights?

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.950
Many of us buy ourselves a gift or two, so
consider giving yourself -- and others - the

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.060
gift of slightly darker skies, along with
being an example for friends, family and neighbors.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.869
Orion, perhaps the most easily recognized
pattern in the sky, graces the southeast.

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.090
Orange-appearing Betelgeuse is the bright
star at the hunter's shoulder on the left,

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.760
and blue-white Rigel is at his knee to our
right.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.670
The nearly straight and similarly bright belt
stars help us locate several winter constellations

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.329
nearby to Orion.

00:02:24.329 --> 00:02:28.970
Up and to the right of the belt is Aldebaran,
the red-giant symbolizing the eye of Taurus.

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.540
The Bull appears to protect the Seven Sisters
of the Pleiades from the hunter, although

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:35.910
this does not entirely follow the mythology
of these characters.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.660
Down and to the left of the belt is the brightest
night-time star in the sky, Sirius, punctuating

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.450
the hunter's dog Canis Major.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:48.250
25 degrees up from Sirius and away from Orion
is first magnitude Procyon, one of two stars

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.140
that mark the unremarkable Canis Minor.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.600
But swinging up and over Orion from there
is Gemini, the twins.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:58.520
Normally we would be excited about the similarities
and differences of Castor and Pollux, but

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:03.450
a brighter visitor graces the twins all season
long: Jupiter slides it's way through here

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.620
during winter.

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.040
As if rounding out a circle, 4-th brightest
northern hemisphere star Capella helps us

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.560
find Auriga.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:14.620
This constellation appears to share a star
with Taurus, with Alnath often forming not

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.750
only a horn of the bull, but completing the
shape of Auriga -- though the reality is the

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.160
star is Beta Tauri, so Auriga technically
loses out there.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.920
All of these stars move quickly across the
sky in winter, so look for objects within

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.299
them as the cross or are near the meridian,
and they will arrive there earlier in the

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:33.560
evening as the season grows later.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:37.669
Towards the east, the stars of spring are
making their way up from the horizon, the

00:03:37.669 --> 00:03:42.300
ones of most interest to us being Cancer,
Leo, Canes Venatici and Coma Berenices.

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:56.199
Along The Ecliptic: On Tuesday, the Moon is
both full, but also a few days before apogee,

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:59.590
giving us the smallest full Moon of 2013,
or mini-Moon.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:05.450
In the evening, Venus goes on an extreme diet,
slimming down from 17% to 11% illumination,

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:11.440
yet growing in angular diameter from 48 arc
seconds to 53 arc seconds; use a small telescope

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:13.010
to see that change.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.571
An hour before sunrise, Spica splits the distance
between Saturn closer to the horizon, and

00:04:18.571 --> 00:04:21.020
Mars further west along the ecliptic.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:26.160
And for outer gas giant stargazers, Uranus
crosses the border of Cetus into Pisces near

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.960
the 5-th magnitude star 44 Piscium.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.660
Neptune sets earlier in the evening three
and a half degrees from Theta Aquarii.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.620
That's all for this week.

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:39.210
Keep your eyes on the sky and your outdoor
lights aimed down, so we can all see, what's

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.210
up.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.570
I'm David Fuller, wishing you clear and dark
skies.
