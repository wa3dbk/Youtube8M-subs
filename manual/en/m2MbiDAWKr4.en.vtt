Check out this video for Lasagna, if
you're looking for a good wholesome

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.380
Italian recipe. Firstly,

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.960
take your Onion. You need to cut it in half, peel it, then finely chop it.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.490
Then take your 2 Garlic Cloves,

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:28.490
peel them and finely chop them as well.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.520
Finally, take your 4 Bacon Rashes and slice them into 1cm square pieces.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:42.520
Now you need to heat some Oil in a pan

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:46.080
and once that's heated up, add the Onion, Garlic and Bacon

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:52.850
and then stir it for about 5 minutes. Once the Onions have started to become clear,

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.850
break the mince up into the pan.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:02.870
Whilst that's cooking away, you might as well

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.820
prepare the Carrots, so you need to chop the ends off, peel them then finely dice them.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.820
Now add these to the mince

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:22.400
along with the two tins of chopped
tomatoes then add the 150ml of Red Wine,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:29.420
a crumbled up Stock Cube and  pinch of Nutmeg,

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.160
2 tablespoons of Oregano and a good squirt of

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.780
of Tomato Puree. You then need to add your 150ml of Milk 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:42.770
and then season with some Salt and Pepper. You then need to thoroughly mix

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.160
everything together and then bring the
pan to the boil. You then want to leave it to simmer

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:49.789
for about 40 to 50 minutes or until the
mixture becomes nice

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:54.520
and thick. Whilst that's simmering away, you can great some Cheese for topping the Lasagna.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.289
Be sure to stir the Bolognese now-and-again whilst it's simmering

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.820
and then when it is nice and thick, take it off the heat and then you're ready to make

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:13.100
the lasagna. Before you start, you need
to preheat the oven to 180 degrees.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.250
Now it's time to layer.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.110
You need to start of with sheets of Pasta, followed by Bolognese then White Sauce.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.630
You can usually get about two layers of the Bolognese out of it. And you want to make sure

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.170
you finish the Lasagna off

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.329
with Pasta, White Sauce then Cheese. Just be carefull when you're doing it to make

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:32.870
sure you've got enough White Sauce

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.870
so you can top it off at the end.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:44.260
When you've got enough Cheese on top, stick it in the oven for about 25-30 minutes.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:50.550
Keep an eye on it to make sure nothing
burns on top.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:54.240
After about 25 to 30 minutes, the
the Lasagna is ready to serve and always

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.250
goes great with a fresh leaf salad.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:02.100
This recipe is also really easy to
freeze

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.310
and if you've got any Bolognese left over, why not boil some Spaghetti

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.310
and then you've got yourself a Spaghetti
bolognese.
