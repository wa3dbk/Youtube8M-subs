00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.520
one, two, three, four!

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.840
Rev up your engines!

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.680
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:24.290
today I'm going show you how to find
leaks in your car using smoke, now

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.849
mechanics have been used in smoke
machines for years, I got one here, hiding

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:33.950
under all this junk, but it's got one
major disadvantage that sucker cost over

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.680
a thousand dollars, but I found a smoke
machine by custom smoke that costs just

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.390
a little over a hundred dollars, and
that's why my thousand dollar machine is

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:48.739
sitting down here, the hundred dollar one
works just as well, it's actually easier

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.409
to use, as you can see, it's made out of a
paint, can has a heating element in it,

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:58.089
makes smoke which you can blow around to
find where there's leaks in your car,

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:03.350
that's what I call American ingenuity,
make a better mousetrap, hey you're going to

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.790
make a lot of people happy, it's a very
simple device, there's a heating element

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:12.500
inside, and you just go to the drugstore
get some mineral oil and pour it in a

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:16.250
little bottle that comes with the kit,
then you just sprinkle a little bit of

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:21.080
the mineral oil on the covering of the
heating element, then just put the top on

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.990
and seal it, like any paint can, and then you
hook the positive cable to the battery,

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:32.330
and the negative cable to the battery, to
generate the smoke, and the smoke comes

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.990
out the other end, so you can stick it in
place us to see where there's a leak, the

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:41.240
smoke will come out where stuff is
leaking, now I'm a mechanic, so I use the

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.110
pressure regulator that comes with, hook
it up to my air supply, and that pumps

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:48.500
the air through, but you could take it
off and just blow in it with your mouth

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.970
to push the smoke through, or you can get
a bicycle pump and use a bicycle pump to

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.240
pump the air through the system, so the
smoke will show where the leaks are, you

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.920
don't have to have an air compressor, now
let's say your vehicles running lean, you

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.909
can go to the brake booster and you can
take off the hose there, and then just

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.700
inject the smoke inside there, and check
where the smoke coming up, and in this case

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.739
it's way down here, the mass airflow
sensor is leaking, so it needs replacing,

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.810
talked about quick way to find something
that's wrong,

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.830
now I showed this to other mechanics and the
first thing some guy said was, oh that

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.220
thing looks dangerous, but really it's
got a fuse on it, so you'd have to worry

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:29.150
about the wirings going bad, it's fused,
it's got a pressure regulator that

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.860
regulates the pressure to like
half a PSI, so it doesn't damage anything

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.840
by blowing the smoke too fast, and of
course it has a very basic safety valve

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:42.160
the top of the paint can if it did for
some reason build up too much pressure,

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.780
the top of the can would just snap off,
but I've never had that happen, because

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.840
hey the smoke is coming out of here where
the pressure is just going to come out of

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:53.590
this hole if it builds up too much
pressure, and it never has for me anyway,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.130
now as with any smoke machine, it's
best to use them outside like I am

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.030
in a driveway, because if you're inside a
garage that's sealed up, if you use a

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:05.440
smoke machine and you say working on an
evap system that has gas fumes, the gas

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.739
fumes could get blown up and you could
cause an explosion somewhere, but if

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:11.410
you're working outside like me you don't
have to worry about that, they would just

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:16.690
dissipate into the air, you can use it to
find leaks in exhaust systems, just stick

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.070
it in the pipe and put a towel there, and
wherever the leak is the smoke will come

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.750
out, I've even used it to find leaks
in the sewer system of my old house, it's

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:30.790
so crooked the pipes are always breaking,
finds them real fast, now really the only

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.570
thing I have against this smoke machine is,
this guy is so small the only we can get

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:40.209
all of them is by his email, and there it is
custom smoke at yahoo.com, you have any

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:44.590
questions about him, just email it to him,
hey Bill Gates started out of a garage and

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:49.870
who knows how big this guy will get,
because if you build a better mousetrap,

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.459
people will come knocking to your door,
and remember if you have any car

00:03:54.459 --> 00:03:58.860
questions, just visit the Scotty Kilmer
channel

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:04.810
and I'll answer them as soon as I get
done talking with this dolphin
