00:00:04.059 --> 00:00:06.320
So we're moving along with
my top 10 favorite games

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:07.250
of all time.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.100
Next up, my favorite multiplayer
game, which is "Portal 2."

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.590
And then there's a brief aside
about "Sonic 2," the number.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.494
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.460
So I have two big gripes
with most multiplayer games

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.030
these days.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.000
The first is that you
can't be in the same room

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.930
with someone playing at the
same time on the same screen.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.590
And the second is
that a lot of games

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:33.136
expect you to be on roughly
the same skill level.

00:00:33.136 --> 00:00:33.802
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:33.802 --> 00:00:34.302
Boom!

00:00:34.302 --> 00:00:34.837
Head shot!

00:00:34.837 --> 00:00:35.670
I can dance all day!

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.545
I can dance all day!

00:00:36.545 --> 00:00:37.170
Try and hit me.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:37.450
Try and hit me!

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.905
Come on!

00:00:37.905 --> 00:00:38.488
[END PLAYBACK]

00:00:38.488 --> 00:00:40.580
"Portal 2" was an
amazing exception.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.090
Not only could you play at the
same time on the same screen,

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.640
one person could be really good
at the mechanics of "Portal"

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.598
and really good timing.

00:00:47.598 --> 00:00:49.732
And the other person could
just be really smart.

00:00:49.732 --> 00:00:50.940
You'd figure it out together.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.000
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.330
PLAYER 1: Well, how do I--

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.050
PLAYER 2: You gotta do the
other portal right there.

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.667
Right there, see?

00:00:55.667 --> 00:00:56.750
PLAYER 1: No, I don't see.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.350
PLAYER 2: Just do it
on my portal because--

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:58.930
PLAYER 1: On your portal?

00:00:58.930 --> 00:00:59.700
PLAYER 2: I can't get rid of it.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.980
There you go.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:00.940
PLAYER 1: Oh, I see.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:01.950
OK.

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.020
PLAYER 2: Sweet, OK.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.635
PLAYER 1: I'm still confused.

00:01:03.635 --> 00:01:03.930
[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.388
There's a particular
moment in one

00:01:05.388 --> 00:01:07.840
of the puzzles where you had
the time it so both of you

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.600
dropped into a portal
at the same time.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.366
And then you hit each other
in midair simultaneously.

00:01:12.366 --> 00:01:13.740
I solved it with
my friend Jordi.

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.930
And when we did, we just
stared at each other

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.800
in awestruck silence.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.600
It was amazing.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.811
And a brief aside about
the "Sonic the Hedgehog 2."

00:01:20.811 --> 00:01:23.310
I know that both people don't
play exactly at the same time.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.240
One person's Sonic.

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.692
And the other person
"plays" as Tails.

00:01:26.692 --> 00:01:28.150
But here's what's
really important.

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.920
As a kid, being able to give the
controller to a little brother,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.220
a little sister-- or a
parent, for that matter--

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:36.390
and have them play along and
not be at your skill level

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.600
is super important.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.110
We've talked about
this in the past.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:40.649
It's called parallel play.

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:43.190
And it's part of the reason why
"Minecraft" is so successful.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.500
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.326
PLAYER: What do you
do with the kitty?

00:01:45.326 --> 00:01:46.595
[SCREAMS]

00:01:46.595 --> 00:01:47.094
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:47.094 --> 00:01:47.540
[END PLAYBACK]

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.456
So what do you think?

00:01:48.456 --> 00:01:50.650
What are your favorite
multiplayer games?

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.910
