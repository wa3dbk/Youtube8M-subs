Welcome to Ahmet's kitchen, today we make puff pastry with spinach and soft cheese

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.849
we need from you:

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:10.730
200g spinach

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.709
150g soft cheese

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:19.709
Thyme, white pepper, sweet pepper and a little salt, because the soft cheese already

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.360
was in a position salt in it

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.750
let's get started

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.870
I've already cut the spinach thin and washed

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:35.870
we cut the rest still in there and

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:42.230
the soft cheese to

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:49.230
I make small hand

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:59.679
Pepper

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:02.170
Thyme

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.530
sweet peppers

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.270
pinch of salt

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:13.689
Stir everything

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:20.689
a little olive oil pure

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.520
then tastes better

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:26.799
and stir

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:33.799
nor 50g cheese with (previously added)

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:53.020
stir

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.020
we have 150g cheese and spinach 200g

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:11.820
ok, now that we let rest for 5 minutes then you continue

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:23.200
I have now rolled the pastry that I share now in 5 parts

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.819
I cut so now, 1,2,3,4

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.510
and completely cut

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.870
and through the center

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:52.870
finished, now comes protein on the edge

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:09.819
once again

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.689
done

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:17.299
filling it

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:19.170
centrally

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:24.780
the side

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.780
and

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.510
the top of it

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:51.760
press the sides of it

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:58.219
which must stick

00:03:58.219 --> 00:04:00.849
the next

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.620
I can take already gone

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:11.620
onto here

00:04:13.659 --> 00:04:20.659
and everywhere press with a fork on it

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:52.300
in the oven at 200 Â° C purely for 10-15 minutes

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:28.460
we get them from the oven, ok

00:05:35.330 --> 00:05:40.430
if you want you can also make egg yolk before it, I have now without

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.789
made

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:47.789
we do it on a plate

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.630
so you can serve them

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.179
I wish you a good appetite with puff pastry, until next time, Ahmet, bye

00:06:10.179 --> 00:06:10.429
