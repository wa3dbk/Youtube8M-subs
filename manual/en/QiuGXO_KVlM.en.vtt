00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:09.589
Now we’re going to glue the glass onto the
base. On this backer board, I’m going to

00:00:09.589 --> 00:00:17.040
use a wood glue. It’s an interior/exterior
wood glue. I put some glue out on a piece

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:34.570
of plastic and I use a popsicle stick to butter
the glass. And make sure you get plenty on

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:55.380
there. And then I place that on the mosaic
and press down very firmly. Ok? Now, what

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:06.040
I want to do is add some smaller pieces around
it. so what I’m going to do is butter sections

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:14.790
of the baseboard instead of buttering the
glass. I butter the baseboard and press the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:40.540
small sections of glass into it. So we’re
going to use these little pieces to go around

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:49.030
it. And you want- it’s good to spread a
handful of cut glass out so you can get the

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:57.789
right shapes that you want. And I’m going
to use squares. And when you place them you

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:11.650
want to have at least a minimum of a popsicle
apart and you press it down into the glue.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:30.580
Ok, and then you want to use a tool or stick
to- the glass will move around a little bit

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:40.480
until it starts to set up and you want to
make sure that you have it accurately placed.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:48.739
You go back around and you move it until you
get it just like you want it.
