00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.440
Here we will focus on hydrogen ion concentration gradients.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.720
Hydrogen ions, are also known as protons.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:43.020
A gradient exists when there is a higher concentration of a molecule in one compartment

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.200
compared to a neighboring compartment.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.820
This animation will demonstrate how the potential energy that results from a hydrogen ion gradient

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.680
uses ADP and inorganic phosphate,

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.340
also known as Pi, to synthesize ATP.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.800
This process involves an enzyme complex called ATP synthase.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.040
Gradients and the potential energy they create

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.960
are key aspects of the biological world.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.540
A good example of the use of a gradient

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.100
occurs in the mitochondria when ATP is synthesized.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.300
ATP is synthesized by ATP synthase,

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.280
a large complex of membrane-bound protein.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.460
Here we see ATP synthase,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:28.100
along with other membrane-bound proteins.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:33.740
Notice the large difference in the number of hydrogen ions on the two sides of the membrane.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.060
This difference is a hydrogen ion, or proton,

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.840
concentration gradient.

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:41.360
The energy associated with this gradient

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.400
is used to synthesize ATP from ADP and Pi.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.500
This occurs at the ATP synthase complex.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:53.780
One hydrogen ion enters the ATP synthase complex from the intermembrane space

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.580
and a second hydrogen ion leaves it on the matrix space.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.620
The upper part of the ATP synthase complex rotates when a new hydrogen ion enters.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.680
Once three protons have entered the matrix space,

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.740
there is enough energy in the ATP synthase complex

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.140
to synthesize one ATP.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:18.060
In this way, the energy in the hydrogen ion gradient is used to make ATP.

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.220
Now let's watch the process again...

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.620
Notice how the proton enters the ATP synthase and exits into the matrix space.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.780
Once three more hydrogen ions have crossed the membrane,

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.460
another molecule of ATP will be made.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.360
In this example,

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.240
the hydrogen ion gradient is large enough to produce six ATP molecules.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.100
Please watch as the remaining ATP molecules are synthesized...

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.420
The process has now completed,

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.500
and the result is an equal number of protons on each side of the inner membrane.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.740
Without a gradient, there is no more energy available to make ATP.

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:11.980
In biological systems, however, a gradient is always maintained.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.380
The mitochondrial hydrogen ion gradient

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:18.540
is generated as electrons pass through three membrane complexes.

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:24.100
That process can be seen in the mitochondrial electron transport chain animation.
