00:00:00.218 --> 00:00:01.314
- So it's Trevor James here today

00:00:01.314 --> 00:00:03.457
and today we're actually
at one of the four

00:00:03.457 --> 00:00:05.348
largest Buddhist temples in Chengdu.

00:00:05.348 --> 00:00:07.371
And this place is a hub
for delicious snacks

00:00:07.371 --> 00:00:08.554
and good meals.

00:00:08.554 --> 00:00:10.566
We came here with no plans today

00:00:10.566 --> 00:00:12.623
except to walk around
and try some good stuff.

00:00:12.623 --> 00:00:14.122
Lets go for a walk and check it out.

00:00:14.122 --> 00:00:16.705
(upbeat music)

00:00:31.426 --> 00:00:35.338
Oh, yeah, look at that steam.

00:00:35.338 --> 00:00:37.272
Look at this, I just ordered three

00:00:37.272 --> 00:00:39.689
with, I ordered the red bean.

00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:46.527
Okay.

00:00:48.894 --> 00:00:50.696
Oh it's hot, steaming hot.

00:00:50.696 --> 00:00:51.529
Okay.

00:00:54.687 --> 00:00:56.702
Okay, I've got a beautiful snack here

00:00:56.702 --> 00:00:59.450
oh it's really, take a look at this.

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.201
Oh it's breaking apart

00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:03.678
and it's burning,

00:01:03.678 --> 00:01:04.885
it's really burning.

00:01:04.885 --> 00:01:06.802
Okay, let's try a bite.

00:01:10.175 --> 00:01:13.748
Oh, oh, oh yeah.

00:01:13.748 --> 00:01:14.941
Okay it's got a,

00:01:14.941 --> 00:01:17.647
it's got a red bean flavor to it.

00:01:17.647 --> 00:01:20.133
And It's actually a little pasty.

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:21.833
It's actually a little pasty,

00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:24.389
it feels like it might
not be cooked thoroughly.

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:28.123
But they just like that
rice flour really dry.

00:01:28.123 --> 00:01:31.140
But it's really sweet and
that's what I like about this.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.994
Okay so actually right up here

00:01:32.994 --> 00:01:34.845
is a little Yung fair place,

00:01:34.845 --> 00:01:37.778
little cold steamed mung bean noodles

00:01:37.778 --> 00:01:39.544
and there's a hug line out.

00:01:39.544 --> 00:01:41.212
So lets go try it out.

00:01:41.212 --> 00:01:43.716
Long line up here.

00:01:43.716 --> 00:01:46.392
Apparently there's no where to sit.

00:01:46.392 --> 00:01:47.630
But that's good.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.422
We want that, we want to
eat at places where there's

00:01:50.422 --> 00:01:51.476
no place to sit.

00:01:51.476 --> 00:01:53.095
This is the huangliangfen,

00:01:53.095 --> 00:01:55.676
so it's the yellow one.

00:01:55.676 --> 00:01:57.777
It looks like its got
some good stuff in there.

00:01:57.777 --> 00:02:00.110
I want to get the flavor
in there mix it up.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.527
Ah.

00:02:03.727 --> 00:02:05.938
Actually it's pretty simple this one.

00:02:05.938 --> 00:02:07.887
It is kind of bean starchy

00:02:07.887 --> 00:02:09.778
because it is from a bean starch.

00:02:09.778 --> 00:02:13.945
And also very numbing, hum.

00:02:16.686 --> 00:02:18.550
So I've got the classic
Tian Shui Mian here.

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:20.800
This one looks really good.

00:02:23.632 --> 00:02:26.045
Um!

00:02:26.045 --> 00:02:28.545
Um!

00:02:30.414 --> 00:02:32.244
- Yeah, it's really good actually!

00:02:32.244 --> 00:02:33.588
What I like about these ones

00:02:33.588 --> 00:02:35.618
is that it's actually a little crunchy.

00:02:35.618 --> 00:02:37.859
The noodles on the outside
are a little crunchy

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:40.169
but the inside is very squishy

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:42.722
and a nice texture.

00:02:42.722 --> 00:02:45.690
But the flavor is actually I taste

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.546
almost like a little bit of plum

00:02:47.546 --> 00:02:49.349
in there or something mixed with spice

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:52.498
and of course the Sichuan
numbing peppercorn.

00:02:52.498 --> 00:02:54.896
So it's kind of funny
because the Tian Shui Mian

00:02:54.896 --> 00:02:56.927
the ones that I didn't line
up for were way better.

00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:57.760
And right across the street,

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:58.593
there's a temple,

00:02:58.593 --> 00:03:00.414
this is what we came here
for to see what we can find

00:03:00.414 --> 00:03:02.203
inside the temple to eat.

00:03:02.203 --> 00:03:03.696
Okay so we're in the temple

00:03:03.696 --> 00:03:05.369
and it's a really quiet feel here.

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:07.329
There's a lot of people praying.

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:09.801
Burning incense, it smells
really good in here.

00:03:09.801 --> 00:03:11.607
But we came for the food.

00:03:11.607 --> 00:03:14.265
So lets go walk around
and see what we can find.

00:03:14.265 --> 00:03:16.682
(slow music)

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:22.920
Ah, this is where they light the incense.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.128
Ah it smells good.

00:03:25.128 --> 00:03:26.753
I should go ask the monk

00:03:26.753 --> 00:03:28.765
where I can eat.

00:03:28.765 --> 00:03:30.432
I should go ask him.

00:04:06.521 --> 00:04:08.461
Okay, so we gotta wait 'till

00:04:08.461 --> 00:04:11.639
five and then we've got
some food right over here.

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.987
So we're at the lineup for the food here

00:04:13.987 --> 00:04:15.837
and I have no clue what it's gonna be

00:04:15.837 --> 00:04:19.324
but lets lineup and
see what it's gonna be.

00:04:19.324 --> 00:04:20.157
Okay.

00:04:20.157 --> 00:04:24.157
(speaking Chinese)

00:04:28.471 --> 00:04:30.142
Oh, awesome.

00:04:30.142 --> 00:04:33.088
I just actually tried to go into the room

00:04:33.088 --> 00:04:36.964
where all the monks are
eating and got kicked out.

00:04:36.964 --> 00:04:38.250
They were very polite.

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.632
I kind knew that I probably
shouldn't go in there.

00:04:40.632 --> 00:04:42.270
But I figured that maybe it's worth

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:43.103
a try right.

00:04:43.103 --> 00:04:45.534
Okay, so right here I've
got a classic Gho here.

00:04:45.534 --> 00:04:46.644
They've got a Gho here.

00:04:46.644 --> 00:04:50.697
And I'm guessing the flavor
is gonna be pretty basic

00:04:50.697 --> 00:04:53.030
but okay lets give it a try.

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.312
Tastes exactly like rice,

00:04:57.312 --> 00:04:58.941
no other flavor than rice.

00:04:58.941 --> 00:05:01.083
Okay, I've got a Manto here.

00:05:01.083 --> 00:05:02.720
Just plain bread okay.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:06.101
Plain brad, nothing else to
it, it's oh, it's steaming

00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:08.753
okay lets see the flavor of that.

00:05:08.753 --> 00:05:11.019
Pretty much no flavor in there.

00:05:11.019 --> 00:05:15.057
Okay now I've got some pao
cai, pickled vegetables.

00:05:15.057 --> 00:05:18.733
This one looks like it's got

00:05:18.733 --> 00:05:21.222
a little flavor lets try it out.

00:05:21.222 --> 00:05:23.775
A little salty, actually it's not,

00:05:23.775 --> 00:05:27.802
I think these are just
boiled, they're not pickled.

00:05:27.802 --> 00:05:29.239
And really nice.

00:05:29.239 --> 00:05:30.682
A little oily, a little salty,

00:05:30.682 --> 00:05:32.702
not much flavor to it as well.

00:05:32.702 --> 00:05:34.575
So thank you so much for watching

00:05:34.575 --> 00:05:35.772
these food and travel videos.

00:05:35.772 --> 00:05:37.100
It really means a lot to me

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.663
and I'm so happy to be able to share them

00:05:38.663 --> 00:05:39.496
with you guys.

00:05:39.496 --> 00:05:40.659
I'm just so happy everyday

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:42.088
to be out here eating good food,

00:05:42.088 --> 00:05:43.889
shooting videos, I'm loving it!

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.589
Stay tuned, I got videos
coming out every week.

00:05:46.589 --> 00:05:48.589
Thanks again!
