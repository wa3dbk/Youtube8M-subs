00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
(Text on screen): Metal Cutting: Plasma vs. the Nibbler

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
The Voice: Hey, Kevin. What are you getting ready to do?

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Kevin Caron: I had an email the other day. The guy's in high school taking welding class, and he said,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.000
"Man, we just got to play with the plasma cutter, and it is so cool! But the instructor said something about a nibbler.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What the heck is a nibbler? And could I compare the two of them."

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Ooh, that sounds like fun! Hang on.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We're winding up.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
So this is a plasma torch, plasma cutter torch.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It runs on electricity and compressed air, and when the air comes up through the gun, there's a little chamber inside here that make the air swirl,

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and then inside this little tip, there's a nozzle. This is the nozzle, and there's a tip inside there, and you get an electric arc going across that.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
And that's what creates the plasma, and then you get the flame coming out.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Great for thicker metals. This one will cut up to a quarter inch.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:29.000
It's very fast. But it's kind of messy. Not like an oxygen acetylene torch messy, but it's kind of messy. You'll see. Look over here.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
I just drew out a little pattern here. I have plasma on one side and nibbler on the other. Watch this.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:51.000
(using plasma cutter)

00:01:51.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Real quick. But this is what you get when you cut it off (besides hot): you get the jagged edges.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.000
So now you have to come back in and grind all that smooth, plus grind on the back side to get the slag off.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
And you get a little distortion from the heat, especially on the thinner metals, and it will cause warpage.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Now, you see, the nibbler (this is an electric one; you can get them air-powered also);

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:36.000
this one's rated 10-gauge, which is just a little bit thicker than an eighth of an inch.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.000
It's got this little cutter inside here that moves back and forth.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000
And this is a die, and you actually work in this slot right here.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:54.000
That thing will come down and you move forward and it'll just take a little chunk out as you go, like nibbles.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Really, really messy. There's a lot of little, sharp pieces that come out of the bottom as you're working along here.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:07.000
And you have to keep this lubricated, so, like, some WD-40 or cutting fluid or something like that,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.000
to not only keep the die and the punch cool, but to make it cut a little easier.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Where, with the plasma cutter, you just go for it.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Here, watch this.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:04:15.000
(lubricating and using nibbler)

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:24.000
See, a lot faster, I think. A lot faster than the plasma cutter as far as getting in there where you want to go.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:35.000
It's a little more controllable, I think, because you can stop and work along real slow and easy right in there and just shave that portion away, just like this.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:52.000
(using nibbler)

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:59.000
It's not like a pair of shears, like a pair of scissors. You can't sit here and just follow the line along.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:10.000
You'll put the die in a bind and snap it off along the base. It's just for coming in from the open edge and just taking your little bits of material off.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.000
It's kind of fun to play with. It's great for little, sharp corners. You can come in like here:

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:35.000
(using nibbler)

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000
They all have their purpose, I guess: the plasma cutter where it's a thicker metal, and the nibbler for thin metal.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:49.000
When I tried this on stainless steel, oh boy, that was bad. I broke these off just left and right.

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:55.000
It was a little too heavy, little too hard for the nibbler to run through. That's the difference.

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000
The Voice: Can you hold up your finished product there so we can see it?

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:12.000
Kevin Caron: Oh, God. It's not finished, but here's where the plasma cutter cut and you can see the heat distortion; you can see the burning that's on there.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:19.000
And here's where the nibbler cut. No difference in the color of the steel at all.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:27.000
Now, if you turn it over and you look at the back side, you see this is all nice and smooth and this is all jaggedy.

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:32.000
So I'd have to come in and grind this all off again and smooth this down to get rid of the slag.

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:42.000
And I'd have to come in and just trace right along the edge of my line to get it right on the line, where with the nibbler you can get a lot closer and get on in there.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:48.000
I guess it depends on what piece of metal you're working with, and whether you have this toy or that toy.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000
I mean this tool or that tool!

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000
Back to work. Bye!

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000
(Text on screen): Plasma: More cleanup. More warpage, discoloration. Handles thicker metal. Better for stainless.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Nibbler: Messy. Takes more time. Needs lubrication. No distortion. More controllable.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:11.000
