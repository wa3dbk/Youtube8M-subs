Hi. It's Mr. Andersen and this
is the third podcast in the Life on Earth

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.889
series. In this one I'm going to talk about
things that aren't really alive. And those

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:18.070
are viruses. In 1982 Richard Skrenta, when
we have a 15 year old high school student

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.880
was sick of people taking his disks and borrowing
his disks. And so we basically wrote a program

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:28.080
called the Elk Cloner that would copy itself
on to the computer. And then it would copy

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.090
itself on to disks that were injected into
the computer. Basically it would boot up the

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.630
50th time it would give you this warning.
This little poem. And it was really highly

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.980
infectious. In fact it was the first really
infectious computer virus that was ever written.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.260
And so the program was able to move from computer
to computer to computer. If there's no computer,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:54.070
then there is no computer virus. And so viruses
work the same way. These right here are bacteriophages.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:59.640
And basically what they do is they inject
their DNA into a bacteria. They use the machinery

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.710
of the bacteria to make copies of themselves.
In other words they're going to make copies

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.750
of the DNA. They're then going to take the
DNA to make messenger RNA. And then make proteins.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.130
And then those proteins are going to enclose
the DNA. And then they're going to disperse.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:21.070
And they're going to move to another bacteria.
And so viruses spread using cells. If there's

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.200
no cell, just like if there's no computer,
then there's no virus. And that's why we don't

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.210
classify them as alive. They definitely have
elements of living things, but they don't

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.390
have metabolism. They don't have reproduction
on their own without a cell to inject it in.

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.950
And so basically it's important to study viruses
because they're one of the main sites of diseases

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:46.049
that we have. In other words millions of people
were killed by the influenza outbreak on the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:52.140
heels of World War I. The 1918 influenza virus.
This is a reproduction of what that virus

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:56.700
looked like. Or herpes virus. Or polio virus.
Or look at all these viruses over here that

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.440
infect us. And so basically if it weren't
for our cells, they couldn't make copies of

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.909
themselves. And so where did viruses come
from? Well, we'll probably never know the

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.909
right answer to this, but here's a few theories.
There's the cellular theory that they used

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:16.189
to be part of the cells. And so a plasmid
for example is given off by bacteria can be

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:20.090
picked up by other bacteria. And so maybe
they started that way. Or maybe they were

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:27.090
full on cells that regress. So chlamydia for
example is a type of cell that's lost the

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:33.329
ability to live on its own. And so now it's
an obligate parasite. Or it could have been

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:38.029
co-evolution that these viruses were evolving
with cells. Just like insects and plants were

00:02:38.029 --> 00:02:42.849
evolving together, this is a little viroid
which is a little bit of RNA plant virus.

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:48.480
And so there's evidence to suggest that any
of these theories could have produced that

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.439
first virus. But nonetheless we eventually
had viruses. So what are some characteristics

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:57.569
in the structure of a virus? Well all viruses
are going to have nucleic acid. So they have

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:04.569
to have some kind of genetic material. Sometimes
that is DNA. And sometimes that is RNA. Sometimes

00:03:05.309 --> 00:03:11.040
that DNA is double stranded. And sometimes
it's single stranded. And sometimes that RNA

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.260
is normal, single stranded. And sometimes
it's double stranded. And so these are all

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.099
different types of genetic material that could
be found inside a virus. But they're all genetic

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:24.829
material. So that's a thing all viruses have.
The other thing that all viruses have is a

00:03:24.829 --> 00:03:29.090
protein coat. In other words they have a coat
that surrounds that virus. One of the first

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.909
viruses really understood and crystalized
and seen was the tobacco mosaic virus. And

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:38.139
you can see here's the two parts of it. It's
got RNA in a coiled pattern. And then it's

00:03:38.139 --> 00:03:42.239
going to have these protein subunits that
go around the outside. So they protect that

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:48.659
DNA. Now a lot of the time that whole protein
is simply two different types of proteins.

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.919
We call those proteins subunits. And you can
see here that just having those two proteins,

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:58.579
it can self assemble into this shape or this
characteristic viral shape. And so all viruses

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:02.739
are going to have these two things. But a
lot of viruses are also going to have an envelope.

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.309
So they're going to have a lipid bilayer.
And so this right here would be human immunodeficiency

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:11.629
virus. Or the virus that causes AIDS. And
you can see here that we've got RNA on the

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:16.479
inside. We've got a capsid or a protein coat
around the outside. But now we've got this

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:21.109
lipid bilayer around the outside with this
envelope. Now why is that important? If we

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:25.349
say this is a typical cell. Let's say this
is a typical cell in your upper respiratory

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:30.819
track. And let's say you're being infected
by a rhinovirus or a virus that causes a common

00:04:30.819 --> 00:04:35.020
cold. Well around the outside of your cell
is going to be an envelope. And so if we have

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:39.550
another virus with a genetic material and
a capsid, but let's say that they have an

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:44.949
envelope around the outside, when it attaches
to your cell, those two envelopes, if it looks

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:49.990
exactly the same is going to fuse with that.
And it makes it easy for that virus to gain

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.120
entry. Likewise when it lysis the cell or
when it explodes, if it takes a little bit

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:01.530
of that envelope with it, it's much more likely
to be able to infect another cell. And so

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:06.530
a lot of these envelopes are gathered from
the cell in which they infected. And which

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:12.569
they are leaving. So how do they reproduce?
How does this actually work? Well the viral

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:18.009
life cycle is two parts. There's the lytic
cycle. Lytic comes from the word lyse or to

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.720
break. And so let's kind of look right here
at a bacteriophage. A bacteriophage remember

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.860
infect bacteria. And so what this one is doing
is injecting it's genetic material, in this

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.439
case DNA, into a bacteria. So it injected
its DNA into a bacteria. As that cell makes

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:39.729
copies of itself you can see it's making copies
of the DNA. Next thing it's doing, so how

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:46.729
did it do that? It's using DNA polymerase.
So it's using the machinery of the cell to

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:53.289
make a copy of the DNA. What's going next?
Well right here you can see it's using that

00:05:53.289 --> 00:05:59.500
DNA to make proteins. And so how does it do
that? Well in this case it's using RNA polymerase.

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:05.289
And it's also using ribosomes. And so it's
using the ribosomes inside the cell to make

00:06:05.289 --> 00:06:09.400
proteins. And so this right here would be
transcription and translation. Eventually

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.840
we have our genetic material. We have the
proteins. And now we're going to lyse the

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:18.889
cell. And so what's happening is these viruses
are actually erupting from the cell. Where

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:23.569
are they headed? They're headed to another
cell to inject their DNA and make copies of

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:28.259
it. And so that's how you can get just a few
viruses and you can get a huge viral outbreak

00:06:28.259 --> 00:06:32.830
where pretty soon exponentially we're going
to have billions and billions of viruses being

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:36.930
created. And so that's one part of the life
cycle. If you look at the second part of the

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:41.819
life cycle, that is called the lysogenic cycle.
In other words it can generate the lytic cycle.

00:06:41.819 --> 00:06:46.030
What happens here? Well basically they inject
their DNA in. It becomes part of the genetic

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.379
material of the cell. And then every time
the cell makes a copy of itself, it's making

00:06:50.379 --> 00:06:55.069
a copy of that virus. And so that's kind of
insidious. It's almost like a stealth mode.

00:06:55.069 --> 00:06:59.530
Where they're injecting their DNA. It's not
actually making viruses. But it's using the

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:04.539
machinery of the cell to copy it over and
over and over again. So quick example in humans.

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:09.530
Because this is in bacteria. So if you've
ever had chicken pox, that's a virus. It's

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:15.840
infecting its DNA into the cells of your body.
It's forming these pox which is releasing

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:22.460
more of the virus to infect more of the cells.
And so it's going through this lytic cycle.

00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:28.169
Eventually your immune system is going to
shut it down. But this cell has injected its

00:07:28.169 --> 00:07:32.930
DNA and it will actually sit in the DNA inside
you. And so it can stay there. It can manifest

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:39.629
itself decades later in another form of chicken
pox called shingles. And so it's this same

00:07:39.629 --> 00:07:44.129
DNA that's just been hitch hiking around waiting
and waiting. And so it's in the lysogenic

00:07:44.129 --> 00:07:48.490
cycle. And a lot of viruses will jump between
the two. And so they'll be in the lysogenic

00:07:48.490 --> 00:07:52.659
cycle. Cold sores on the mouth would be an
example of that. It's just hiding in your

00:07:52.659 --> 00:07:56.830
neural cells. All of a sudden your immune
system gets depleted. They jump into the lytic

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.840
cycle. Make a bunch of copies of that. And
then they can eventually go back. And so those

00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.879
are viruses. Are they alive? No. Are they
important? Yes. And I hope that's helpful.
