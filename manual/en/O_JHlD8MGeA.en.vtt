00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:07.130
Today on this 2010 Chevy Silverado we're going
to install part number KSVS-8.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.130
The K Source Vision System mirror replacement.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:14.380
To start off our install we're going to go
ahead and remove the original mirror.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.190
Theres a small torqued screw underneath the
base of the screw where it attaches to the

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:20.190
windshield.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:31.260
We'll go ahead and remove that screw then
we can go ahead and take off the mirror.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.999
We'll go ahead and disconnect the wiring that
goes to the mirror.

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:38.370
There's a small tab to push down then we can
go ahead and pull it apart.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:47.909
Now with the factory wire harness that's left
over we'll go ahead and tuck it underneath

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:49.100
the headliner.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:01:06.030
We'll 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:02:17.500
pull it down to the edge 
a little then just push it in with our fingers.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:36.159
Now we'll 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:56.680
go 
ahead 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:18.389
and 
install 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:44.450
the new mirror.

00:03:44.450 --> 00:04:25.600
We'll 
slide the mirror into the existing mount and

00:04:25.600 --> 00:06:00.060
then 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:45.850
tighten down the screw.
