Hi! I’m James Adams and I’m here for expertvillage.com
and we’re going to talk about backing up

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.980
your hard drive with Norton Ghost and Norton
Ghost is a program you can buy for about $60

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:16.720
on the internet and it’s worth it. So now
we’re going to talk about backing up hard

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:21.960
drives and for this demonstration we’re
going to use a program called Norton Ghost

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.490
9. It’s the best program you can get to
do this sort of thing and we’re going to

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.860
do a simple kind of back up. You can restore
files or folders, which mean you can backup

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.110
individual files or folders. In this case,
we’re going to do an entire backup, we’re

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.450
going to take the entire C-drive with Windows
XP is reciting it and we’re going to back

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.100
it up. In case I get a virus or something
in the future, I can always take that backup

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.309
that I did in the past and restore it back.
Basically, you’re taking a picture of a

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.469
point in time when the computer worked fine
and in the future if it stops working you

00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:05.540
can always take that picture and restore it
back and it’ll be fine again. So select

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:14.860
backup drives, this popup will come up, you
click next. Notice my computer has two hard

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:22.200
drives; I got two 80 gig hard drives. Since
we’re backing up the C windows hard drive,

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:28.520
we select the C Windows hard drive. Click
that and you have three options to do a backup.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.670
You can back it up to a local file, but it’s
important to know that if I’m backing up

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.659
the C drive I cannot save this file on the
C drive. It needs to be saved to another hard

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:43.240
drive. In my case I have a C and a D. If I’m
backing up C I need to back it up to D, or

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.049
if I’m backing up D I need to save it to
C. Network file, that means if you have a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.409
network of computers you can back it up to
a computer network or CDRW DVD. In this case,

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:03.549
we select local file because I’m going to
back it up to another hard drive. Notice there’s

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:10.500
my C drive. Here’s my D drive, select documents,
click OK, click next. My case is going to

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.610
say I don’t have enough space on the D drive,
but that’s okay because I already made a

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:20.120
backup a while ago and I’m okay so let’s
pretend. When you do this if you have enough

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.730
space on the destination drive this will not
appear and if it appears, it means you need

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.800
to erase some stuff from the hard drive to
make room for the backup. So would you like

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:37.110
to continue, yes, and then you just click
next and then you click next one more time

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.910
and there you go. Now it’s backing up your
hard drive. In my case I’m going to click

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.350
cancel since I’ve already made a backup
and this is backing up hard drives. This takes

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:52.130
a while so this can take like up to 30 minutes
just be aware of that.
