Welcome to Tuesday's Tips from SewVeryEasy,
my name is Laura.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.800
And have you tried these little clips in your sewing

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.860
room? Well, let me show you how they work. They're nice

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.400
little things to have. Will these little clips replace pins in

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.860
the sewing room? Well, I don't think so but they're

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.960
definitely a great addition to the sewing box. The reason

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.000
is because they will not distort your fabric. When you

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.100
have a very thick piece of fabric, you put the pin in and

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.080
then you turn the pin in order for the pin to come back

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.180
out into the top of the fabric. The thicker the fabric the

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.040
pin will actually pivot the fabric as you go back up

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.100
through the fabric, so it can distort it. The other thing is

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.280
with pins, well, you can't use them in leather. Sometimes

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.540
with silks and satins also you don't want to use a pin

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.320
because they can actually put little pin marks in or it can

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:11.140
cause a run. So having the little clips is a great addition

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.900
just for sewing those types of fabrics alone, but you

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.640
could also use them for the lightweight fabrics and

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.020
avoid the pins

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.200
altogether. If you're hand-sewing they're really nice

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.680
because then the pins are not going to poke your hands

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.920
as you're hand-sewing. And instead of putting the pin

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.640
through you just clip them on, keeping the flat surfaces

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.580
all on the same side so that it runs smoothly along the

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.380
bed of the machine. And no different than a pin, when

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.220
you are coming towards it in the sewing machine you

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.920
take the pin out because you do not, obviously, want to

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.200
run that over. And I know it's really hard to see but in the

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.120
center there's actually measurements so you can use

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.900
the clips and have that measurement exactly how you

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.360
want it as you're clipping them.

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.089
And another thing: If you drop your pin on the floor, well,

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:13.360
it's hard to find. If you drop a clip on the floor, it's a

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.420
whole lot easier to see. And it's a lot more pet friendly.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.520
After all, our pets do seem to like our sewing room.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.540
Are they going to replace pins?

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.220
Absolutely not, but they're definitely a nice thing to have

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.960
in your sewing room.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.120
