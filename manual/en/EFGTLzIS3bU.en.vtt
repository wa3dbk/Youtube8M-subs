00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.280
Holy crap, this game has a lot of reading.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.320
I mean, it’s all text.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.200
Dialogue, banter, puns...text.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:40.230
Ugh, this is like reading a book that says,
you know, “Oh, hey...you

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:42.910
should tap the page every once in a while.

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.910
Keeps you awake.”

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.470
It’s NCIS for the 3DS.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:59.970
Evidently, that stands for Nonstop Conversation...Inspires
Sleep.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:06.420
3DS.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.230
This game is based on a television show that
I presume is popular.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.550
Otherwise, this related consumer product would
seem like a bad idea.

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:22.140
Now, I’ve never seen a whole episode of
NCIS, but I do see, like, five seconds of

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.170
it every week when I turn on the USA Network
to watch Monday Night Raw.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:37.299
That means...add six, lowest common denomin...I’ve
seen fifteen minutes of NCIS collectively

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:38.490
in my entire life.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.320
And from that, I’ve arrived at the following
conclusions.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.430
One, CBS is a channel for old people.

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.500
And that’s it.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.880
That’s all.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.759
As for the game, well, it’s pretty much
every detective game you’ve ever played,

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:56.659
then simplified into something that’s so
streamlined, it almost plays itself.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:02.071
You play as some unnamed rookie working alongside
the cast of NCIS.

00:02:02.071 --> 00:02:07.539
There are no voices, of course, because this
game is basically a freaking interactive novel.

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:13.570
So you read, and then you read some more,
and then you get to investigate.

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.650
You do that by looking at the crime scene
and tapping on clues that couldn’t be more

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:18.650
obvious.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:22.550
Once you do that, you might have to analyze
the evidence, which then reveals clues that

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.950
couldn’t be more obvious.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:25.900
Then you read some more.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:40.300
I might need some Caf-Pow myself.

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:46.870
Along this very linear path, you might encounter
various minigames...putting together digital

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.670
images, firing a gun at the shooting range.

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:55.020
Incidentally, these moments are the most enjoyable
NCIS has to offer, along with the “gotcha”

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.020
interrogations.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:02.870
I’m all for detective work, but...unfortunately,
this game doesn’t require much of it.

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.980
And maybe that’s a good thing, given the
audience that would be interested in this

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:06.980
game.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.800
NCIS is your typical detective game only worth
recommending to fans of the show.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.840
Or I guess fans of the show who also like
to read.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:32.920
Holy crap, NCIS.
