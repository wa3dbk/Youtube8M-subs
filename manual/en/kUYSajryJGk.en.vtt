00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
Hunting from an elevated stand offers the
bow hunters some real distinct

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.770
advantages, the most obvious one is
getting up above the line of sight of the

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.490
game that you're hunting like whitetail
deer. If you plan on hunting out of an

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.990
elevated stand you really need to learn
the steps on how to safely and securely

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.990
set that stand up.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.420
If you plan on hunting from a tree stand,
preseason scouting is an important step.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.590
To ensure a successful hunt there are
several things to keep in mind. When

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:33.450
selecting a tree for your treestand,
select a live, straight tree that fits

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.680
within the size limits in your tree
stands user manual. Be sure the tree is

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.880
healthy and not dead or diseased and
never place a tree stand against a

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.360
leaning tree, a tree that's wet, or icy,
or a utility pole. Once an ideal tree is

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.200
selected,

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.860
be sure to review the owners manual and
installation instructions

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.540
always inspect your treestand thoroughly.
Before installation look for any wear in

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:03.390
straps or cables, and all other parts
of the stand, and any accessories when

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.610
installing a treestand. Always wear a
full body harness that meets or exceeds

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.560
the tree stand manufacturers association
standards. Using a lineman's belt

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.550
connected to the harness ensures that
you're connected to the tree at all

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.470
times. During treestand setup if you were
to fall the harness and the lineman's belt

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.540
will save you from potential injury.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:30.160
Climbing sticks are considered to be the
best choice for entering a treestand.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.680
Strap each section of the steps snug to
the tree ensuring the steps are firmly

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.680
gripping the tree trunk.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.540
Next wrap the lineman's belt around

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.540
the tree and fasten it to your full
body harness.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.800
As you continue fixing the climbing
sticks to the tree the belt will save

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.800
you from potential falls to the ground.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.619
Continuing on place the next section of
the steps firmly onto the tree. As you

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.100
climb higher carefully slide the
lineman's belt with you.

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.260
It's important to clear away any
branches or obstruction

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.370
that may interfere with not only your
lineman's belt and harness straps, but

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:34.659
also with your stand once your desired
height is reached.

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:38.530
It's now time to fix your harness strap
that will be fastened to your full body

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.569
harness. The strap shown here works
similar to a vehicle seat belt device.

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.280
There are also numerous tree stand
manufacturers association approved ropes

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.280
and straps that use the basic prusik
knot.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.050
Using the haul rope carefully pull the
tree stand up.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:14.220
It's important to have any excess rope
or straps out of the way so that you or

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.220
the stand won't get tangled up. Using a
new ratchet strap or a chain strap the

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.520
tree stand firmly to the tree and be
certain that it's snug.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.760
The treestand platform should

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:40.980
always be at least 18 inches below your
top step so that you step down onto

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.660
the platform. With the lineman's belt
unstrapped you can now enter the stand.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:50.220
The tree strap that you connect to your
harness should be placed right above you

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.210
on the tree. Check the stand for any
movement and be sure to have a

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.210
comfortable range of motion free of
obstructions.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.560
When getting out of your stand always
keep your full body harness strapped to

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:08.560
the tree.

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.720
Once safely on firm ground disconnect

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:20.940
your safety strap and affix it onto the
bottom step, so it'll be ready next time

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.940
for you to enter the stand.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.160
You know here in Oklahoma the hang-on
type of tree stand is probably the most

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.890
popular use, but we are seeing ladder
stands becoming more and more popular.

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:39.900
As with any stand choose a healthy straight
tree. After leaning your ladder stand

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:43.920
against the tree, strap the ladder to the
tree with a new strap.

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:09.040
With a full body harness climb the tree
using strapon steps. Again, use the new

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.310
ratchet strap to secure the stand snug
to the tree trunk.

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:26.530
Once the stand is secure descend down
the tree and clip your safety strap at

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:29.530
the bottom of the ladder.

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:56.180
What should you wear when installing
removing or using a tree stand?

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.350
Use a full body harness from the time
you leave the ground until you're back

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:16.350
down.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:21.150
Why should you be careful when climbing
into or out of a tree stand?

00:06:32.550 --> 00:06:35.220
Accidents can happen.
