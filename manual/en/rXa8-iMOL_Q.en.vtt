Welcome to Social Viking where we pillage
and scour through the depths of the interwebs

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:09.630
to find you the the social games worth playing,
and those that belong in the trash.

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:22.449
Today we’ll be taking a look at Star Era

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:26.800
Star Era is a collectible card game that was
published this year, the trailer seems very

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.970
promising with its own theme song and animation,
makes it feel like you’re a part of an Anime

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.219
but sadly the game couldn’t live up to in
our eyes.

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.920
The game starts off as you naming your character
in the server you choose, but sadly your characters

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.890
are gender locked with absolutely no customization.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.670
Though the protagonist and assistant you select
don’t affect the gameplay at all, it would’ve

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.879
been nice if you looked a little different
from everyone else you’d run into in PvP.

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.640
That been said, the PvP of the game is pretty
competitive and that’s always something

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:59.670
good to see.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.559
The game revolves around you, the player exploring
a giant ship and fighting infectors and all

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.130
sorts of enemies in the vessel, once you win
you may receive a card, or loot.

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.509
The cards you receive are used to upgrade
your existing cards, fuse, or even to use

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.280
in your deck so that you may become more powerful

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.979
Different cards have different stats, some
being better than the other and there’s

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.320
a really nice variety of them too, however
what was offputting to me was the fact that

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.079
the game mechanics are simply just too bland.

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:31.950
The game plays on autoplay, so that the cards
you gain don’t really give a huge variety

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.119
in battle, we do know that we’ve only been
playing for a few hours and that it may change

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.130
later in game,

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.360
but after a fair bit of research and digging
in we found out that the changes were minimal,

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.399
to stacking the same sort of cards to gain
bonuses and health and attack buffs.

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.090
I guess what I was hoping for was for something
that required a bit more strategy.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.380
Everything being said and done the game is
still pretty nice, if you’re okay with the

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:00.090
auto attacking system that is, you may see
some real animation in the midst of battle,

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.479
and the game does have some good music (let’s
not forget that intro after all).

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:09.220
but other than that it’s not something that
we’d be spending day and night on, although

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.069
the game does have a ton of depth with all
the in built systems and leaderboards.

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.069
so tell us?

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:19.170
