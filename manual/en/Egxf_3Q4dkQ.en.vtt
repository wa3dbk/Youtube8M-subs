00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:12.269
In case we have to take the length of
trousers the most important thing is to

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.680
take the inside leg.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.980
To do this place the
meter in the seam on one leg with the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.260
other and carry the end of the tape to
the length of the trousers.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:36.180
In case of the sleeve we place the meter
at the beginning of the sleeve in the

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.390
seam and following this seam we
continued until the seam with the armpit.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.440
That will give us the length of the
sleeve of a frock-coat

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.559
In the case of taking the size of a
frock-coat it is best to look at the

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.050
label, but if it is not possible we must
do it with the button fastened. Now for

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:07.259
backs both reference points are the
armpits, the inner part of the same. To do

00:01:07.259 --> 00:01:12.149
this we take the meter and take as
reference the seam of the sleeve with

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:18.500
the body and we take the meter to the
other armpit, also on the seam of sleeve

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.780
with the body. In this way we obtain the
measurement of the frock-coat.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:31.560
For the size of the trousers it is best to look at the label, but if it is not possible

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.210
we must measure it with the button
fastened. Stretch it a little, place the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.740
beginning of the meter in a hip and the
other end in the other hip. That will

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.350
give us the approximate size of the
trousers.
