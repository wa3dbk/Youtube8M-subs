00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.330
Hi I'm Tricia an organic gardener I grow 
organically

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.330
for a healthy and safe food supply for
a clean and sustainable environment

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.580
for an enjoyable and rewarding
experience

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.099
Microgreens are packed with nutrition
four to forty times more

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:20.380
vitamin C K E and beta carotene

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.140
than the adult vegetable There easy to
grow and they're delicious

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.660
I'll show you how Microgreens are in
the middle between sprouts

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:32.820
or you're eating the sprouted seed root
and all the baby greens which are

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.969
harvested at about a month of age

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.770
and are typically three to four inches
tall Microgreens are grown with media

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.360
and are eaten when they're about two
inches tall

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.290
and have their first true leaves There's
a wide variety of different plants that

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:48.880
make delicious microgreens

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.890
Check out our blog to find a list of
seeds that make great

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.260
microgreens

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.899
To grow microgreens you'll need seeds and
bulk seeds are a better buy than seed

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:02.460
packs

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.659
A seedling flat a seeding mat like this
baby blanket

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.850
or a soilless seed starting media like
this Quickroot

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:12.960
and a sprayer You can use any kind of
tray

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.020
that's wide and shallow I'm using these
seed starting trays but they must be

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.880
sterilized be sure and clean and
sterilize them

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.530
as well as sterilizing your soil Clean
your flats with water and get all the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:28.200
grime off and then spray them down with
white vinegar and let them air dry

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.899
this way you know there's no nasty
fungus or bacteria on your micro green

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:32.619
flats

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.149
To sterilize your potting soil spread it
into a baking tray

00:01:36.149 --> 00:01:40.080
between two and four inches thick cover it with aluminum foil

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.880
and bake at a hundred and eighty degrees for forty five minutes
Poke in a thermometer to make sure the

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.679
soil reaches a hundred and eighty but doesn't go over two hundred degrees fahrenheit

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:52.409
It's best to see one species per flat
for

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:56.020
even growth There are two methods for
planting microgreens

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.569
one is using a soilless potting mix and
the other is using a baby blanket which

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:02.530
is basically a grass mat

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:07.590
Either line your flat with a damp baby
blanket or add three-quarters to one inch

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.450
have your damp soilless medium like the
Peaceful Valley Quickroot that we

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.269
sterilized

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:17.440
Seed densely but not so dense that the
plants get leggy

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.160
getting the right seeding density takes
some practice

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.160
you can either see diffusely or in rows
After seeding you can cover the seeds

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.760
with a little bit of soil

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:32.010
or unbleached paper towels or a cotton
kitchen towel

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.910
After covering the flat

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.600
you want to spray either the towel

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.930
or the paper towel or the soil with a
little bit of water

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:47.570
Set them in a sheltered place with the
temperature of about sixty to seventy degrees fahrenheit

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:50.630
and then you're going to be ready to
harvest in one to three weeks

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.450
Keep your trays moist and most of the
greens won't need any fertilizer but

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.299
some of the slow-growing greens like
carrots and celery

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.769
could use a little bit of help with some
liquid fish

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:07.799
and that's at half the dilution rate

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:09.250
You can harvest micro greens when

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.690
the first true leaves appear and when
they're about two inches tall

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:16.800
harvest in the morning on the day you plan
to use them They can be harvested

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:21.250
easily with scissors or these long
bladed snips if your micro greens are

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:22.000
indoors

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.650
it's easy to snip them as you need them
If you grew them on a baby blanket you can

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.330
just lift the baby blanket out

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.490
and turn it upside down and then snip off
the greens

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.630
This method is used most often by
commercial farmers

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.830
Just wash the micro greens gently and
then you can enjoy them

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:43.570
on soups salads sandwiches

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:49.310
virtually anything Another great thing
to do with your

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:52.860
microgreens is to juice them with this
Weston

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.860
wheat grass juicer For more information
on microgreens with recipes and tips

check out this book Microgreens how to
grow

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:07.209
nature's own super-food So grow some
nutrition

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:14.209
and grow organic for life

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.090
 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:18.340
