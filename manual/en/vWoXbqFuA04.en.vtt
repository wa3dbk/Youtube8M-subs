00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.520
======================================

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.520
Good afternoon.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.440
This is Barry Gooden with the National Weather
Service here in Peactree City GA with a briefing

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:10.780
on potential wintry weather Late Thursday
into early Friday.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.160
At this point there is much uncertainty as
to how much if any wintry weather will occur

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.610
and with this briefing we basically want to
detail the range of possibilities with this

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.119
evolving winter scenario.

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:24.119
======================================

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.180
So lets take a brief look at the setup and
what we are fairly confident in over the next

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.180
several days.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.120
The current cold front that has been lingering
across the state will shift south through

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.210
Thu with colder air infiltrating the area
in its wake.

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.580
As this occursůlow pressure is expected to
develop over the northern gulf which will

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:48.010
spread moisture back to the north to affect
the remainder of the southeast.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:49.010
======================================

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.890
In addition to the surface low developing
the main feature will be a cold upper level

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.160
storm system that will shift east from Alabama
and move through our Georgia portion Thursday

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.960
night into Friday.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.350
The timing of this feature will be crucial
in determing if there is enough moisture left

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.990
when the cold air arrives to result in winter
precipitation.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.990
======================================

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.310
Here is a snowfall probability map for this
event and really want you to focus on the

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:18.159
most likely areas for accumulating snowfall
as opposed the specific values shown on the

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:19.369
map.

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:23.299
From this map we see the best chances for
accumulating snow will be across portions

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:27.750
of extreme North Gaůespecially across the
Northeast GA mountains.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.310
With other areasůalthough snow or a mix of
snow and rain will be possibleůtemperatures

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.049
well above freezing initially and the recent
warm conditions will allow anything that falls

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:41.939
to melt as it reaches the surface.

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.119
Still too early to talk accumulations mainly
due to the uncertainty in the models which

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.939
we will explore on the next few slides.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:52.939
======================================

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:58.859
Here is a look at one model solution to again
just give you a range of possibilities with

00:01:58.859 --> 00:02:02.869
this event and emphasize the uncertainty involved
at this point.

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:07.929
This particular model shows precip moving
into the area Thu evening and spreading across

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.630
most of north GA as light snow for a period
of 3 to 6 hours.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:17.500
This is the most aggressive of the computer
models we are looking at and it is showing

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.990
storm total snowfall of 2 to 3 inches for
the northeast mountians and light accumulations

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:31.700
as far south as the atlanta metro but againůthis
would be limited by the warm surface temperatures.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.700
======================================

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.750
Contrast this to another model solution which
is very limited on moisture and shows little

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.640
if any accumulating snow across the area with
the exception of light accumulations across

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.140
the northeast mountains.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.290
Howeverůthe teal lines show temperatures
will be falling very quickly during the overnight

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.930
period and it will be possible for black ice
to form Thu night despite the lack of accumulating

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:54.950
snow.

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:01.260
This would create a significant travel impact
for portions of the area through Friday morning.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.260
======================================

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.650
So lets put it all together and show graphically
what the potential is for winter weather thu

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:07.650
night into Friday.

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.790
The NE mountains continue to look like they
have the best shot at accumulating snowfall

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:15.590
but uncertainity exists even here for this
event.

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:21.380
Fro area from Rome to Gainesvilleůlight accumulations
appear possible with this event but the bigger

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.630
threat appears to be black ice during the
overnight period into early Friday morning.

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:33.020
For areas from La Grange to Atlanta little
or no snow accumulation is expected but still

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.319
some potential for black ice and we will be
monitoring conditions closely for potential

00:03:38.319 --> 00:03:43.650
winter storm watch issued tonight or early
wednesday,.

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:44.650
======================================

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.050
Although unceratainity existsůit is always
a good idea to be prepared for what this storm

00:03:49.050 --> 00:04:09.900
could produce over portions of the area.

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:10.900
======================================

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.960
So in summaryůconfidence is low with the
exception of NE GA where higher confidence

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:21.060
exists of accumulating snowfall and treacherous
driving condtions late thu night into Friday.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.460
Along and north of the interstate 85 corridorůwe
will be monitor closely for the potential

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:30.560
for black ice to develop regardless of the
development of any snowfall.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:35.639
As mentionedůwe will monitor for the need
for a winter storm watch and post updated

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:39.810
video and graphics on our website over the
next few days.
