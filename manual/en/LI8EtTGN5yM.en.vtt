00:00:11.739 --> 00:00:15.199
By the way, this coffee table is great. Where did you get it?

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:18.199
I got it off of Amazon Prime. 2-day free shipping!

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.199
Is that also where you got that...family?

00:00:23.069 --> 00:00:25.029
Oh no, Amazon Prime doesn't do that.

00:00:25.029 --> 00:00:26.669
I got them off of FAMAZON.

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.669
Wait, Amazon does entire families now?

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.350
Yeah. I always wanted one like that.

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.990
Seriously, girl. Amazon has really upped their game.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:48.210
They can provide anything.

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:40.210
Like what?

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.850
Well, for one thing, there's GRANDMAZON.

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.910
I made you some cookies!

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:51.830
And, you would love MEOWMAZON.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.400
Ooh! And, don't forget about Amazon Lime.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.630
And, you have to, have to, have to 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:05.630
check out the overnight shipping option on MANAZON.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.770
It's so much faster than going to a bar. 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.770
But what if they send you like a real loser?

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.960
Yeah, sometimes the parts don't function right,

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.590
but the return policy is totally easy!

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.680
I haven't had to leave my house in days!

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.030
But, that's no way to live your life! What about fresh air?

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:32.030
Oh, they have fresh air covered.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.430
But what about real life experiences, like spiritual and emotional fulfillment?

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:43.770
That, my friend,

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.710
is what AMAZON SHRINE is for.

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.620
And, 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.650
my bio-clock is ticking, so I put 3 babies on my wish list at 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.610
THESEBABIESWANTAMAMAZON.

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:55.279
And,

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:58.439
I've even been able to deal with
my debilitating need to seek other people's approval

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.040
with AMAZON EXISTENTIAL CRISIS!

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.260
What was your relationship like with your father?

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:11.260
Oh my god...he never told me that he loved me. 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.260
HE NEVER TOLD ME THAT HE LOVED ME!!

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.459
Molly!!

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:20.739
This is all super weird!

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:24.729
I get using Amazon instead of going to a store, but it cannot solve all your problems!

00:02:24.729 --> 00:02:26.619
Come on, Tori.

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:31.219
I'm sure you have a problem that an
Amazon box could fix!

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:32.040
Get this:

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.790
My boss, the total dick, he grabbed my butt the other day. You know what, that's the last straw!

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:41.649
I want him to die. I want him dead. And I bet you don't have a fancy little Amazon box that can fix that! 

00:02:41.649 --> 00:02:44.959
That is what AMAZON CRIME is for.

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:45.899
Amazon Crime?

00:02:45.899 --> 00:02:49.159
Do you want a hitman, or is this more of a blackmail type of thing?

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:51.159
Wait, for reals?

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.659
Ooh, this guys has 4 stars. That's pretty good.

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:57.219
He specializes in defenestration.

00:02:57.219 --> 00:02:58.879
No, I was thinking more like...

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:02.209
...a Lisbeth Salander slow torture type of thing.

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.489
Overkill! I like it.

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:06.489
Ooh, what about that one!?

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.189
Done.

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.769
May I kill him?

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.769
Good.

00:03:26.469 --> 00:03:29.469
Oh my god! He's gonna die!

00:03:29.469 --> 00:03:31.469
I told you so!

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:38.439
Hi, I have a delivery from, uh...AMAZON AMAZON?

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:41.469
I f**king love Amazon!

00:03:43.469 --> 00:03:45.749
Hey guys, I'm Mad! and I'm Moni, and we're MadMoni!

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:48.139
