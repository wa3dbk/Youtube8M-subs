00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:05.249
Today on our 2008 Nissan Maxima, were gonna
install the Curt T-Connector Wiring Kit part

00:00:05.249 --> 00:00:12.129
number 56022.Now when we got our spare tire
components cleared out, we need to remove

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:17.660
the rear threshold and the plastic fasteners
that secure the carpeting behind both rear

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:27.869
taillights.Now you can see we have the access
to the wiring behind the driver side taillight.

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.800
On the driver side, well take the connector
that has the yellow, red and brown wire running

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.800
to it.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.010
Were gonna plug this in line with the manufacturers
connection.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:41.850
Press on the locking tab, disconnect the two
connection points for the manufacturer, well

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.190
plug our new harness in line with the manufacturers.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:52.180
Next, were gonna take our white wire with
the ring terminal and were gonna ground it

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:53.310
back here to the sheet metal.

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:57.450
Were gonna go back to this sheet metal because
this is where the sheet metal overlaps so

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:02.800
itll be a little bit thicker and give us a
better grounding point.With our ground wire

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.450
installed, well go ahead and add our two-way
adhesive to the back of our converter box.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.430
Simply peel back the paper on one side, well
go ahead and stick to the converter box and

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.219
well peel back the paper on the other side.

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:17.820
What were looking for is a flat, clean surface.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:23.390
Underneath the carpeting behind the taillight
is the perfect location.Now we can take our

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.829
green wiring connector and route it over to
the passenger side and make the same connection

00:01:27.829 --> 00:01:35.249
as we did earlier.With the green wire connector
attached, well go ahead and use some black

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:37.049
zip ties to secure the green wire.

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:39.859
Well just secure it here to the manufacturers
wiring.

00:01:39.859 --> 00:02:15.780
With our connectors to the converter box made,
we need to make 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:03:01.670
the 
connection with 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:04:30.960
the power wire.
