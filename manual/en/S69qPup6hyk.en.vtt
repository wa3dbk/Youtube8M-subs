00:00:00.595 --> 00:00:01.378
Benji, what have you got?

00:00:01.446 --> 00:00:04.098
Uh, well, these hard drive
platters are just fried.

00:00:04.166 --> 00:00:06.067
Yeah.
You know, they m-m-made--
made a mess of them.

00:00:06.135 --> 00:00:07.434
It's just like...
There's holes in them
and stuff.

00:00:07.502 --> 00:00:09.470
And it's got scorched
all the way through.
And then...

00:00:09.537 --> 00:00:11.138
Look, this one's got
a hole in it and stuff.

00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:12.506
I can't believe.
I can't even look at it.

00:00:12.574 --> 00:00:15.076
Benji. Did you recover
anything?
Yes. Yes.

00:00:15.143 --> 00:00:17.812
Despite the aforementioned
conditions of the hard drive
you brought back,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.500
I managed to recover
portions of, uh,
two dozen e-mail files.

00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:24.134
Also made
what I believe to be

00:00:24.202 --> 00:00:27.972
A thoroughly
promotion-worthy breakthrough.

00:00:28.006 --> 00:00:31.108
Your mr. Davian is
going to arrive in rome
the day after tomorrow

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:34.328
And attend a function
at one vatican city.

00:00:34.395 --> 00:00:36.597
What the hell is davian
doing at the vatican?

00:00:36.664 --> 00:00:38.866
It's all got to do
with the "rabbit's foot."

00:00:38.934 --> 00:00:40.117
Rabbit's foot?

00:00:40.185 --> 00:00:41.635
Yeah, well, I'm assuming
it's like a code word

00:00:41.686 --> 00:00:43.938
For something
he's about to sell
to an unspecified buyer,

00:00:44.006 --> 00:00:46.340
For $850 million, by the way.

00:00:46.408 --> 00:00:47.791
Or maybe
it's not a code word.

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:50.561
Maybe it's just a really,
really expensive
bunny appendage.

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:52.046
You have no idea
what it is?

00:00:52.114 --> 00:00:54.849
It's interesting.
I used to have this
professor at oxford, okay?

00:00:54.916 --> 00:00:58.052
Dr. Wickham, his name was,
and he was like
this massive, fat guy.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.520
You know, huge, big guy.
We used to call him...

00:01:00.588 --> 00:01:02.522
You know...
Well, I won't tell you
what we used to call him.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.226
He taught
bimolecular kinetics
and cellular dynamics,

00:01:05.293 --> 00:01:07.361
And he used to sort of
scare the underclassmen

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:10.631
With this story about
how the world would
eventually be eviscerated

00:01:10.699 --> 00:01:12.333
By technology.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.670
You see, it was inevitable
that a--a--a compound
would be created,

00:01:15.737 --> 00:01:18.305
Which he referred to
as the "anti-god."

00:01:18.373 --> 00:01:20.641
It was like
an accelerated mutator,
a sort of, you know,

00:01:20.708 --> 00:01:23.844
Like a-a-a-an unstoppable
force of--of--of
destructive power

00:01:23.912 --> 00:01:25.696
That would just lay waste
to everything.

00:01:25.764 --> 00:01:27.998
To buildings and parks
and streets and children

00:01:28.066 --> 00:01:30.684
And ice cream parlors,
you know?

00:01:30.752 --> 00:01:33.654
So whenever I see, like,
a rogue organization,

00:01:33.722 --> 00:01:37.858
Willing to spend
this amount of money
on a mystery tech,

00:01:37.926 --> 00:01:40.794
I always assume
it's the anti-god.

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:46.767
End-of-the-world
kind of stuff,
you know?

00:01:46.834 --> 00:01:50.137
But, no, I don't have
any idea what it is.
I was just speculating.

00:01:50.205 --> 00:01:52.673
Did you brief musgrave
on this?
Who, me? No, not yet.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.458
Good. Don't.
Benji: What?

00:01:54.525 --> 00:01:56.193
Don't tell anyone about this.
This took me ages.

00:01:56.261 --> 00:01:57.595
If something goes wrong
with the operation,

00:01:57.762 --> 00:02:00.231
I want musgrave
to have deniability.

00:02:00.298 --> 00:02:01.682
That's great work, benji.

00:02:01.817 --> 00:02:02.983
What operation?

00:02:04.186 --> 00:02:06.186
That look in your eye
is a pain in my ass.

00:02:06.254 --> 00:02:09.356
You know that, right?
