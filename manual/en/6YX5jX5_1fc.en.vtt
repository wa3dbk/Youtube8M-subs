00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
SENATOR BARACK OBAMA (D-IL): I want the American people to understand that I opposed this war

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.000
 in 2002, 2003, 4, 5, 6, and 7. 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So you can have confidence that I will be serious about ending this war.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
SENATOR OBAMA: I will promise you this, 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
that if we have not gotten our troops out by the time I am president, it is the first thing I will do. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
I will get our troops home. We will bring an end to this war. You can take that to the bank.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000
SENATOR OBAMA: I promise that we are going to bring this war in Iraq to a close in 2009.  

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
PRESIDENT OBAMA: We will remove our combat brigades from Iraq 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
by the end of next summer, and all of our troops by the end of 2011.   

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
PRESIDENT OBAMA: As Commander-in-Chief, 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
I have determined that it is in our vital national interest 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
RON PAUL: I say a policy of peace is free trade, 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000
stay out of their internal business, donâ€™t get involved in these wars and just bring our troops home. 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000
RON PAUL: We just marched right in, we can just come home! 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
RON PAUL: They're building up this case, just like we did in Iraq! --

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
build up the war propaganda!  There was no al Qaeda in Iraq. (BELL RINGS)

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
And they had nuclear weapons and we had to go in. I'm sure you supported that war, as well.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.000
It's time we quit this. It's trillions of dollars we're spending on these wars!! (APPLAUSE)    

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000
RON PAUL: We should bring our troops home, change our foreign policy, quit these ridiculous wars. 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
We would be safer and richer for it.
