Hello how are you?, I'm TDS, and I bring you a new tutorial, I hope you like it.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:21.550
We will create an original image with an antique effect.

00:00:22.362 --> 00:00:26.950
These effects are made with brushes

00:00:27.125 --> 00:00:30.266
Found in the video info.

00:00:30.564 --> 00:00:33.366
Unlock the principal layer 

00:00:33.478 --> 00:00:34.891
And we do the following

00:00:35.015 --> 00:00:39.163
Click on layer, new adjustment layer, and then.. tone and saturation 

00:00:39.689 --> 00:00:43.859
We will see a window similar to this

00:00:44.509 --> 00:00:48.300
Click on coloring

00:00:48.824 --> 00:00:52.378
And we give a color of your choice.

00:00:53.055 --> 00:00:56.693
Similar to the color we see on screen

00:00:57.125 --> 00:01:01.321
Then close the window

00:01:03.013 --> 00:01:08.602
now go back to layer, new adjustment layer, and choose levels option

00:01:09.716 --> 00:01:15.600
Here can vary the color leveling

00:01:15.926 --> 00:01:18.616
Depends on your taste

00:01:19.506 --> 00:01:25.010
Do it the best possible for the feeling it's an old photo.

00:01:25.998 --> 00:01:31.963
close the window and do the following

00:01:32.877 --> 00:01:35.653
Create a new empty layer

00:01:39.916 --> 00:01:43.191
Fill with black color

00:01:43.836 --> 00:01:53.436
Let's filter option , then to noise option , add noise, put a 6 percent, and uniform dispersal.

00:01:54.281 --> 00:02:02.751
In the layer, select overexpose color, and we  get a little noise in the image

00:02:03.043 --> 00:02:05.288
we gives a good effect

00:02:06.227 --> 00:02:12.734
choose our brush you downloaded.

00:02:15.827 --> 00:02:19.358
We put in a new layer with white color our brush

00:02:20.742 --> 00:02:27.662
And now we can start playing with the imagination

00:02:28.568 --> 00:02:30.219
create many textures

00:02:30.778 --> 00:02:33.168
To produce the effect

00:02:34.444 --> 00:02:35.970
Decrease the opacity

00:02:36.482 --> 00:02:47.569
When we  finished the image, do some imperfections with our tools

00:02:48.361 --> 00:02:50.863
Using overexpose and sub exposing

00:02:51.616 --> 00:02:59.089
We create them  for give a particular effect

00:02:59.672 --> 00:03:05.213
And we  will do in the  most marked  parts of the picture

00:03:07.377 --> 00:03:11.849
First place overexpose and then sub exposing 

00:03:12.195 --> 00:03:21.212
It will give us the feeling that the picture is very worn and is antique

00:03:22.493 --> 00:03:30.139
It isn't very difficult, is achieved in few steps, and is very good.

00:03:32.128 --> 00:03:34.719
And very original

00:03:36.234 --> 00:03:38.493
Untill here, our tutorial

00:03:38.674 --> 00:03:40.997
I hope you enjoyed

00:03:41.784 --> 00:03:45.033
And I pass to comment that this week was very sick

00:03:45.536 --> 00:03:47.582
I was with  flu

00:03:48.196 --> 00:03:52.204
