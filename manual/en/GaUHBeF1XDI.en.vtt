00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.890
A nurse call at this time of night...

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.870
I wonder what's wrong?

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:28.860
He says his temperature is 38.5

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.370
Do I need to go?

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.880
Still, my nurse instincts tell me to go,

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:42.290
I grabbed my bag and went to see him,

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.450
As your fever went down,

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.800
My breath was uneven,

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:54.440
My heart's speeding up,

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.360
And I'm starting to feel sick,

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.060
I couldn't bear the heat

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.730
So I ran out of the room,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.420
What should I do?

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:10.780
For some reason, from then on my heart felt
bad,

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.640
I wonder if it's a oral infection?

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.350
The moment i dragged my feverish body
Into my room

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.410
Pallor!!!

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.230
I'm not a weak person...

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.980
I don't need to be taken care of.

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.180
If you leave me alone, i might die.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:50.140
So please.....
HELP ME!!!

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.580
I'll tolerate the bitter medicine,

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.280
I'll tolerate all the painful needles,

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.140
My tears have smudged my mascara,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:18.140
What should i do now?

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.440
Even if i cry like a lost kitten,

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.730
And wait until the morning,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:25.830
The illness won't go away.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.860
With out you.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.390
It'll never go away.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.270
I thought about it last night,

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.900
And the pain spread through my body,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.710
Moisten the body,

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:45.360
What should I do?

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:08.310
