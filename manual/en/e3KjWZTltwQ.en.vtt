00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:08.250
Now for the case of vampiric lore. In 1922's
"Nosferatu" starring Max Schreck as Count

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.839
Orlok, there was a terrible mistake made.
At the near the very end of the film, a silent

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:20.429
film, the vampire has just bitten the heroine
and stands up and his reflection is clearly

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:26.460
seen in the mirror. Then, a few moments later,
as he stands near a window, the sunlight burns

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.050
him to death. Disintegrates his body. But,
a violation of vampiric lore, that a vampire's

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:39.550
reflection should never be seen in any mirror.
Now, let's fast forward to 1931of course we

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.710
have the famous film "Dracula" starring Bela
Lugosi where Dr. Van Helsing, portrayed by

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:51.410
Edward Van Sloan stressed that vampire images
are never seen in a mirror. But then you must

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:58.840
fast forward to 1948 and the film "Abbot and
Costello Meet Frankenstein" in which Bela

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.610
Lugosi, once again states his rule as Count
Dracula AKA also known as Baron Latose in

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:12.700
that film. In one scene, Lenore Aubert, playing
a doctor who promised to transfer Costello's

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:20.060
brain into the monster's head was refusing
now to do so. So Lugosi, i.e. the vampire,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:26.080
was hypnotizing her in front of a dresser
mirror and we clearly saw his image! Total

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.450
violation of vampiric principle especially
since this was a Universal film and in 1931they

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.620
told us you can't see a vampiric image. Possibly,
they were trying to show his image wasn't

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.869
cast in the mirror but didn't notice at rushes...I
don't know how they would have missed it...that

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:46.840
it was clearly seen. Terrible violation of
vampiric lore. By the way, for that film,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.310
Lugosi's agent, Don Marlowe, had promised
the world to him. Then Universal said they

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.079
wanted somebody else and they didn't want
to give it to Lugosi. So he put them to shame.

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.210
He said "You only paid him $3,500 for the
original Dracula. You made millions on it

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:07.659
and you owe him this role." And he did land
it and he really enjoyed working on it. Others

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.080
in it included Vincent Price playing the Invisible
Man at the very end, Lon Chaney as the Wolf

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:18.920
Man, Glenn Strange as Dracula...as Frankenstein...
and Lon Chaney Jr. as the Wolf Man
