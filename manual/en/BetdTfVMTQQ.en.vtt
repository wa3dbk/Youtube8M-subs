Hi there! On behalf of expertvillage.com my
name is Candace Copeland. The challenges of

00:00:07.499 --> 00:00:17.830
the bead and hole. Come on now. You're going
to go. Well, if you're not going to go now

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:23.420
I'm going to try something different. Put
this other little piece copal in there. I

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:32.500
think I'll just start going ____. Let's try
a little silver bead. This is a pewter hollow

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:40.780
little bead. You don't have to have a bead
board. You don't have to have all the expert

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:47.400
things going on all the time. You can pick
up all kinds of things on the way and just

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.710
start creating. It doesn't have to match.
It doesn't have to be the same. Even though

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:00.150
I really want to use this silver bead. I'll
try it again. See sometimes you just have

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:07.990
to use a little patience and then it's okay
here you go. Then we'll use one of these little

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:15.659
wonderful African tribe beads. What it took
to make this bead, I can't even believe. Look

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:26.100
at all the swirls on that thing. It's just
amazing, amazing. Another piece of red coral

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.789
right now. Then another one of these. You
can see how important these little doodlies

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.880
in the middle. You've got to have those little
silver findings. Actually, I've got some other

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.280
ones here that are copper. You don't find
these all that often, but look how sweet they

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:53.880
are. With this kind of metal, they really
work well. I'm going to throw one of those

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:06.420
in there and we'll start with another small
bead. We're just kind of like creating just

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:15.490
all kinds of color. Goes with everything.
No big sweat of what it is that you're going

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.720
to think of next. You're just kind of ambling
along, doing your bead thing. Then we're got

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.610
to put this great big gorgeous bead from ____
on there with all the hearts and it's just

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:38.240
really yum. So no pendant on this one. This
is all strictly just beads from beads. Pendants

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.500
have their place too. When you get into a
pendant, you have to plan a little one. When

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.510
you're just putting things like this together,
you have a great freedom in it.
