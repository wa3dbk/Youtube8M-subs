00:00:19.697 --> 00:00:21.537
		I've to talk pretty fast

00:00:21.537 --> 00:00:23.937
because I'm risking this introduction to be

00:00:23.937 --> 00:00:27.697
longer than the song I'm gonna show, which is really short.

00:00:27.777 --> 00:00:31.777
This is a story about a picture turning into a song.

00:00:31.777 --> 00:00:36.777
Some day in the morning I was reading the news and I've found a picture

00:00:36.777 --> 00:00:39.417
of birds sitting on electric wires.

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:42.379
The picture was really interesting to me because

00:00:42.485 --> 00:00:45.205
that reminded me a musical notation

00:00:45.891 --> 00:00:49.971
then I've got the idea to cut the picture

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:53.829
and to try playing that the birds was "composing"

00:00:54.563 --> 00:00:56.123
I've got my piano

00:00:56.257 --> 00:01:00.777
and I notice that was a super poetical song, super sweet, almost childish.

00:01:00.857 --> 00:01:04.337
Of course I've to consider time, notes length.

00:01:04.401 --> 00:01:07.601
But I've tried to be the most faithful possible

00:01:07.615 --> 00:01:12.415
to the birds' position regarding to chords and the melody they were forming.

00:01:12.443 --> 00:01:18.923
Then, I did a classical arrangement and send that picture to the photographer, who I've found

00:01:18.941 --> 00:01:23.221
by Google, Paulo Pinto, a photographer for Estadao.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.159
Then he's got touched, speaking: "Man, that's beautiful"

00:01:27.213 --> 00:01:29.813
then he send me the original picture

00:01:29.885 --> 00:01:34.685
which was that picture with more space, because Estadao had cropped the picture

00:01:34.765 --> 00:01:38.285
then I'd taken another 4 notes each side

00:01:38.851 --> 00:01:42.771
Then I get back to my piano, played that again and sounds like that

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:48.879
thing has got closed, those were the notes missing on my melody.

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.929
And then I send back to him and he's send that to a reporter

00:01:53.987 --> 00:01:57.747
and that has became a story on the very Estadao.

00:01:58.081 --> 00:02:01.801
I was very intrigued by the dimension that was taking

00:02:01.908 --> 00:02:08.308
and I've decided to do a video, a little video to illustrate my thinking to understand

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.420
that picture.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.300
I've posted the video two days later

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.460
on Internet and that became a world hit

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.880
a thing hard to realize, the speed and power that could have

00:02:25.286 --> 00:02:34.166
That's made part of sites as Gizmodo, Wired, MSN, in that week I was giving interviews to

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.860
American radio, German radio

00:02:37.186 --> 00:02:44.186
that was shown at TEDx Phoenix, was shown at the Columbia festival in New York.

00:02:44.364 --> 00:02:48.964
That is, that thing has grew millions on views, it's really not possible to realize

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:53.240
how that small initiative would become all this.

00:02:53.748 --> 00:02:59.668
I think the lesson learned by me was that is possible to see poetry anywhere

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:01.880
depending on the way we look at things.

00:03:01.878 --> 00:03:06.878
It's possible to find that, that depends on any initiative taken by us.

00:03:07.136 --> 00:03:10.216
I want to play this song to you

00:03:10.362 --> 00:03:13.362
I did an extended version especially to TED.

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.270
Thank you.
