00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.652
- Hey guys.

00:00:00.652 --> 00:00:03.384
I asked you on Twitter for
some of your burning questions.

00:00:03.384 --> 00:00:05.527
And so I'm going to answer
them for you in a video.

00:00:05.527 --> 00:00:07.865
I'm really sorry if I
pronounce your name wrong.

00:00:07.865 --> 00:00:10.686
Emily Kase asks, "I've
done nothing all summer,

00:00:10.686 --> 00:00:12.776
"what fun things do you recommend to do

00:00:12.776 --> 00:00:15.480
"before dreaded school returns?"

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.205
I would recommend going out to places

00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:19.084
near where you live, like if there's a zoo

00:00:19.084 --> 00:00:20.763
or museums or art galleries.

00:00:20.763 --> 00:00:22.608
Megan Clara asks, "What
do you think is the

00:00:22.608 --> 00:00:26.275
"most important aspect of
a relationship, and why?"

00:00:26.275 --> 00:00:28.437
I think the most
important aspect is trust.

00:00:28.437 --> 00:00:29.529
If there's no trust in a relationship,

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:31.002
then it'll break down pretty easily.

00:00:31.002 --> 00:00:32.545
And it's not going to make for a positive,

00:00:32.545 --> 00:00:33.773
healthy relationship.

00:00:33.773 --> 00:00:35.842
Tom Knapton asks, "Do you watch porn?

00:00:35.842 --> 00:00:38.353
"Do you think it is good,
healthy, or positive?"

00:00:38.353 --> 00:00:41.003
I personally do watch porn, sometimes.

00:00:41.003 --> 00:00:42.786
As for the second part of that question,

00:00:42.786 --> 00:00:44.156
it is so complicated.

00:00:44.156 --> 00:00:46.374
And there's all sorts of
different types of porn out there,

00:00:46.374 --> 00:00:49.821
that this topic deserves
a whole video to itself.

00:00:49.821 --> 00:00:50.460
Let me know in the comments

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.464
if you'd like me to make
a video about pornography.

00:00:52.464 --> 00:00:55.720
Mr. Self-Destruct asks,
"What do you normally do

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.937
"when you're uncomfortable
on a first date?"

00:00:57.937 --> 00:00:59.567
Me, personally on first dates,

00:00:59.567 --> 00:01:01.866
silence makes me very uncomfortable.

00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:04.698
I like there to be a constant
flow of conversation.

00:01:04.698 --> 00:01:07.154
So the way that I make
myself feel more comfortable

00:01:07.154 --> 00:01:09.042
is by talking a lot.

00:01:09.042 --> 00:01:10.372
You have to figure out what would make you

00:01:10.372 --> 00:01:12.636
more comfortable on a first date, and then

00:01:12.636 --> 00:01:15.665
do things in order to get
to that comfortable place.

00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:17.360
Jessica Tidwell asks,
"Would you ever consider

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.405
"making a beauty channel? Why or why not?"

00:01:19.405 --> 00:01:21.562
Probably won't be making a beauty channel,

00:01:21.562 --> 00:01:24.409
mainly because I literally
know nothing about makeup.

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.361
I do not feel qualified at
all to make a beauty channel.

00:01:28.361 --> 00:01:31.693
Iris asks, "How do you deal
with creativity burnout?"

00:01:31.693 --> 00:01:34.750
What I usually like to do
is take a complete break

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.338
from whatever the creative
work is that I'm doing,

00:01:37.338 --> 00:01:39.420
and go and hang out with some friends,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.078
or just go for a run, or
do something that will

00:01:42.078 --> 00:01:44.121
completely take my mind off it.

00:01:44.121 --> 00:01:48.380
Holly Froggatt asks, "Any tips
for future history students?"

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.613
Interests, Conclusions, and maybe

00:01:49.613 --> 00:01:51.877
one relevant chapter in books is enough.

00:01:51.877 --> 00:01:53.931
Timothy Jillette asks,
"What is your opinion

00:01:53.931 --> 00:01:55.950
"on bringing food into the bedroom?"

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.416
I am all for eating in bed,

00:01:58.416 --> 00:02:01.928
but if you mean in a sexual
way, then I don't know.

00:02:01.928 --> 00:02:04.810
I haven't really got an opinion.

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:06.824
If you're into that, awesome.

00:02:07.374 --> 00:02:08.132
Eat away.

00:02:08.132 --> 00:02:08.852
(chuckles)

00:02:08.852 --> 00:02:10.620
Cal asks, "Innie or outie?"

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.155
Innie!

00:02:11.155 --> 00:02:12.803
"What would be your ideal job?"

00:02:12.803 --> 00:02:15.026
I would love to be a presenter,

00:02:15.026 --> 00:02:17.778
work in the online video industry,

00:02:17.778 --> 00:02:20.245
digital media, marketing stuff.

00:02:20.245 --> 00:02:23.549
And then I'd also love
to still be involved

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.759
in the sex, positive sex eductation field.

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:28.603
That's all I've got time for in this Q&amp;A.

00:02:28.603 --> 00:02:30.818
I hope you liked it, please
give it a thumbs up if you did.

00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:32.760
Follow me on Twitter so
that you get notified

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:33.967
when I'm doing another one of these.

00:02:33.967 --> 00:02:35.406
And you can ask me your questions.

00:02:35.406 --> 00:02:37.762
By the time this video goes
up, I will be back in the UK.

00:02:37.762 --> 00:02:39.424
If you didn't know,
I've been in California

00:02:39.424 --> 00:02:40.782
the last two-and-a-half weeks.

00:02:41.412 --> 00:02:42.900
And you should, you've got
to follow me on Instagram

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.465
because there's loads of funny pictures

00:02:44.465 --> 00:02:46.175
and awesome stuff on there from my trip.

00:02:46.175 --> 00:02:47.235
See you guys on Tuesday for the next

00:02:47.235 --> 00:02:49.245
Women on YouTube collab, and then

00:02:49.245 --> 00:02:51.333
next Friday for another vlog thing.

00:02:51.333 --> 00:02:53.797
That's right; I'm doing
two videos a week now.

00:02:54.187 --> 00:02:57.085
(light guitar music)
