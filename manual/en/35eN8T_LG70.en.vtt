00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:21.310
Marie: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hey it’s Marie Forleo
and you are watching MarieTV, the place to

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:27.490
be to create a business and life you love
and today is Q&amp;A Tuesday, but get this, I

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:35.309
have a question for you: does this sound upset
you?

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:46.399
Ah, crickets, the deafening silence that occurs
when someone doesn’t respond to our email,

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:51.880
phone call or text or in some way fails to
acknowledge that we exist.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.570
Maybe it’s after a first date or a job interview
or maybe you’ve reached out to a big shot

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.899
in your industry.

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:06.520
Basically any situation that has you asking,
we've all been there, right?

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.000
Double and triple checking spam, asking our
friend to text us to make sure there's nothing

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.890
wrong with our phone, basically wondering
what's wrong with us?

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:17.610
Why did that person not get back to us?

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.350
Here’s what being blown off really says
about you: nothing.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.509
Absolutely stinking nothing.

00:01:26.509 --> 00:01:30.740
The hard truth you need to hear is this: the
vast majority of the time when someone blows

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:36.600
you off or they fail acknowledge that you
exist, most of the time it’s not about you.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.600
Really.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.040
One of my favorite books of all time is Don
Miguel’s The Four Agreements and agreement

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:46.210
number two is don’t take anything personally.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:48.939
When Don says anything, he actually means
everything.

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:53.770
Don’t take praise personally, don’t take
criticism personally, and don’t take anything

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.840
anyone says or does personally.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.680
Don’t even take anything you say to yourself
personally.

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.969
That’s both deep and confusing, but helpful.

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.280
Let me share a story from my own life as an
example.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.369
There was this team of people that I really
wanted to work with.

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.000
I read articles about them, watched interviews
and totally devoured their website.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.860
So I built them up in my head as THE people
I had to work with, so I sent them an email

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.280
and I was really hoping for a fast response.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.280
What happened?

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.980
You guessed it.

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.040
Finally, a response came back but it wasn’t
exactly what I wanted to hear.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.540
These guys were swamped; they had zero bandwidth
and basically told me I had to wait two to

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:37.540
three months.

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:43.120
Two to three months?!

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:48.890
Immediately I took that as some kind of personal
rejection like I wasn’t big enough or cool

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.300
enough to be worthy of their immediate attention.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.010
Fast forward eight weeks and I could not get
these people out of my mind, but I didn’t

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.310
want to seem like a needy little beotch and
in my head I was saying “If they don’t

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.019
want to talk to me, I don’t want to talk
to them.”

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.400
Thank God the non-egotistical part of myself
piped up and said “Hey Marie, why not reach

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:09.950
back out and check in?

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.700
Maybe they really do want to work with you
but they were just swamped, kind of like you

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.820
often are.”

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:20.269
So I got over myself and sent them a short
email checking back in.

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:22.060
Hot damn, wouldn’t you know it?

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:26.350
They got back to me within 20 minutes and
they were super pumped and really thankful

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.780
that I followed up.

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:33.129
So my point is this: them being nonresponsive
in the beginning had nothing to do with me;

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:36.480
they were really swamped and they had less
than zero bandwidth.

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.980
It was not personal like most things in life
and thank goodness I followed up.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.189
The next time you feel insignificant, ignored
or like nobody likes you, here are three things

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:49.790
you should keep in mind:

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:53.440
#1 - Don’t take anything personally.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:04:01.569
We gots to be down with some Toltec wisdom
and yes, it’s a tweetable:

00:04:01.569 --> 00:04:05.989
“Taking things personally is the maximum
expression of selfishness.

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:13.570
It makes the assumption everything is about
me.”

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.040
Most of the time, people not responding has
nothing to do with you and if you tell the

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:23.070
truth now more than ever, people are drowning
in overwhelm, so don’t make it about you

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.740
and just realize all of us are doing the best
we can at any given time and none of us are

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.080
perfect at it.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:31.960
#2 – Put the shoe on the other foot.

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:35.840
Think about how many times you haven't gotten
back to someone because maybe you straight

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.110
up forgot.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:38.660
You were overwhelmed.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.220
Maybe you didn’t have an answer for them
and it started to take some time and it just

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.170
slipped through the cracks, or maybe you didn’t
answer them for so long and the guilt snowballed

00:04:47.170 --> 00:04:51.260
or what about this: maybe you never got the
communication in the first place.

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:54.830
#3 – Follow up nicely.

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.660
A friendly follow up is often really appreciated.

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.170
Here's the thing: don’t make the person
wrong for not getting back to you in the first

00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:02.170
place.

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.150
Don’t say, “I sent an email but I never
heard back from you.”

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.940
Do say, “Hey there, just a friendly follow
up.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:11.450
I know you're really busy and this email may
have slipped off your radar…”

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:15.910
Being kind and compassionate and understanding
in your follow up really goes a long way.

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:19.990
Now before we wrap this up, I know what some
of you are thinking; “But Marie, sometimes

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.600
it is personal.”

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:27.390
I mean, all of us have gotten long, crazy,
inappropriate and sometimes down right annoying

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:28.830
voicemails and emails.

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:33.970
Now if you suspect that you need to improve
your communication skills, go for it, but

00:05:33.970 --> 00:05:38.490
since you are a smarty pants MarieTV viewer,
I'm going to make the assumption that you

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:40.590
are not sending stuff out like that.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:45.930
So for our purposes, don’t take anything
personally is completely on point.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:49.520
Now I want to turn it over to you and this
week we have a two-part challenge.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:56.320
First up, for the next 48 hours, I want us
all to challenge ourselves not to take anything

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.580
personally, not the good stuff and certainly
not the bad stuff.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.880
I know this is easier said than done but it’s
a really important muscle to build, especially

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:10.810
if you're up to big things in the world.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:15.960
Second, what's one example where you took
something personally only to later find out

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:20.730
that the crazy drama you made up in your head
was totally not true?

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:22.670
