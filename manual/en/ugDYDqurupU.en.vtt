[ Silence ]

00:00:06.576 --> 00:00:10.006
&gt;&gt; We use a number of different approaches
to try to understand prosopagnosia.

00:00:10.006 --> 00:00:15.476
One thing we do is sort of the bread and butter
of what we do is we create tasks that we run

00:00:15.476 --> 00:00:20.296
on computers and say they might look at
how well somebody can recognize faces

00:00:20.296 --> 00:00:21.936
or how well they can recognize objects.

00:00:22.106 --> 00:00:26.036
We can use MRI to try to look at the structure
of the brain in people with prosopagnosia.

00:00:26.366 --> 00:00:28.756
We also use functional magnetic
resonance imaging.

00:00:29.206 --> 00:00:33.096
And there we're looking at activity in the brain
and we can compare whether activity in the brain

00:00:33.096 --> 00:00:36.906
of somebody with prosopagnosia is
the same or different as somebody

00:00:36.906 --> 00:00:38.596
who has got normal face processes.

00:00:38.996 --> 00:00:42.546
We're trying to understand through what
information processing mechanisms are

00:00:42.546 --> 00:00:43.206
not working.

00:00:43.296 --> 00:00:47.056
Sort of, if you can kind of think
how the information is not being sort

00:00:47.056 --> 00:00:51.286
of represented properly in the brain
and then we're interested in trying

00:00:51.286 --> 00:00:55.526
to understand the neurobasis of that and sort
of going all the way back to the beginning,

00:00:55.526 --> 00:00:59.666
try to see if we can find some genetic
correlates of that problem with faces.

00:01:00.086 --> 00:01:04.406
If we can do that maybe somewhere along
the way in these different sort of deficits

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:07.566
that people have with prosopagnosia,
maybe we can do something to help people

00:01:07.566 --> 00:01:10.556
with prosopagnosia and improve
their face processing.

00:01:11.126 --> 00:01:14.016
Then on the other hand, we try
to use prosopagnosia as a means

00:01:14.016 --> 00:01:16.596
to understand how the brain is organized.

00:01:17.226 --> 00:01:21.806
So for example, if we see somebody who's
severely impaired with face processing,

00:01:22.216 --> 00:01:26.866
but they're normal with object processing,
that suggests well, face and object processing,

00:01:27.106 --> 00:01:31.266
that suggests that it's handled by two separate
mechanisms and so that tells us something

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:32.616
about the organization of the brain.

00:01:33.116 --> 00:01:37.856
If we see that there's a particular area
in the brain that's abnormal in people

00:01:37.856 --> 00:01:42.416
with prosopagnosia, that suggests to us as well,
that area must be important for face processing.

00:01:42.416 --> 00:01:46.796
So there's a back and forth between learning
about prosopagnosia and learning about sort

00:01:46.796 --> 00:01:48.746
of normal organization of face processing.

00:01:49.166 --> 00:01:52.876
At the moment, there aren't any
demonstrated sort of cures or therapies

00:01:52.876 --> 00:01:56.426
that improve face recognition
ability in people with prosopagnosia,

00:01:56.856 --> 00:01:58.666
but we haven't been studying
the condition all that long

00:01:58.666 --> 00:02:00.996
so I'm optimistic that these
cures are out there.

00:02:01.586 --> 00:02:04.696
There are -- I don't know -- three or
four labs in the world right now looking

00:02:04.696 --> 00:02:09.806
into this possibility including our lab
and so I think, you know, I hope 10,

00:02:09.896 --> 00:02:12.216
20 years down the road that we've got something

00:02:12.606 --> 00:02:14.806
that can help people with
face processing problems.
