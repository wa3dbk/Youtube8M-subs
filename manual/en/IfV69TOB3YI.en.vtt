David: I want to give you guys one quick story
before we go to your emails and voicemails.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.959
There's a Cincinnati father who was 24 years
old who is dead because he could not afford

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:13.180
dental care. Let me go real quick to the local
news video coverage of this right away.

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:18.530
Sheree Paolello: This is a bizarre story tonight.
A 24-year-old father dies after a toothache.

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:22.760
Tonight his family is telling us there's a
tragic lesson in this story. They're talking

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:26.860
to Stephanie Stone, and she's live at University
Hospital tonight with the story. Steph?

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:32.259
Stephanie Stone: Doctors here at University
Hospital say it's rare, and even they are

00:00:32.259 --> 00:00:36.749
shocked by what happened to Kyle Willis. It
was a problem he ignored for two weeks, but

00:00:36.749 --> 00:00:39.540
no one ever thought that problem would kill
him.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.229
David: All right, so as we can see here, dental
insurance is something that is often just

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:50.429
not in the debate about health insurance,
and this is an incredibly glaring case, which

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:55.199
we know this from every surgeon general's
report about oral health in America, that

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.440
oral dental problems can lead to heart and
lung disease, diabetes, stroke, premature

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.890
birth, which we recently talked about, low
birth weight.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:13.020
Tooth decay and tooth pain is often the starting
point for a lot of serious disease, and instead

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.780
of helping out a lot of the people that don't
have proper access... don't have any access

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.729
to dental care, we're actually cutting programs
that can help.

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.240
So people are being pushed to make choices
like this 24-year-old father had to make.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:33.509
He needs antibiotics, and he is in so much
pain that he needs pain medication, he can

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:38.579
only afford one, so instead of a 10-day course
of antibiotics, he goes with the painkillers,

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.070
and he ends up dying.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.909
This is yet another example of something that
simply should not be happening in a country

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:51.350
at the level of development that the United
States is at. And this is not a unique story.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.990
This happened to a 12-year-old in 2007.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.249
What do people do when they're unemployed
or don't have insurance? Where do they go?

00:01:59.249 --> 00:02:05.030
They go to the emergency room. It costs the
supposed conservatives who don't want national

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.960
health care money anyway. And sometimes they
end up dying.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.910
And you know what? If we want to just look
at the financial side of it, the Social Security

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.500
benefits that his children will now receive
until they turn 18 are going to be much more

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.420
expensive than if we had provided the dental
care to this individual. It's just not even

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.221
close, Louis. It's really not even close.

00:02:26.221 --> 00:02:29.920
Louis: Right. And of course, it's not just
dental care, it's everything. I mean, I've

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.500
met countless people who have had some problems
that really should've been checked out and

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.040
told me that they wouldn't just because they
don't have the proper care. And of course,

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.250
if you don't die, you could end up in the
hospital anyway, and the money that gets spent

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.230
on you will come out of everyone's pocket.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.620
David: There's just no question. Even if we
say this isn't an issue of health and rights

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.480
and we just want to talk about money, it still
does not make sense. And this is just yet

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.760
another sad example of that. When will it
change? I don't know. I don't know.
