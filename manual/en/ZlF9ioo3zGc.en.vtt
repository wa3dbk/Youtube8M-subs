00:00:00.803 --> 00:00:07.652
hello hello, I'm Winghaven and I've a creted a new serie that I'll call it, BFADVICE, like briadvice (spanish program)

00:00:07.902 --> 00:00:09.462
yes, my parents are brothers

00:00:09.743 --> 00:00:14.236
Well, let's start with the first video I've made, will consist about grenades

00:00:14.688 --> 00:00:19.367
Like most of you know the grenade takes 4 seconds to explode and you can not cook them.

00:00:19.697 --> 00:00:32.909
 So we tested something, I threw a fontral grenade to my friend and as you can see he sees the grenade, goes away and I don't even damage him

00:00:33.689 --> 00:00:49.587
what's the optimal way to throw them?  Whenever you can throw them pumped enough, because 1st, it's more difficult to see the grenade and 2nd, they explode right away when they fall.

00:00:50.739 --> 00:01:08.513
The next thing I want to comment you can cancel the nade, the only thing you've to do is change to the primary weapon (M16A3 in my case) when you're throwing it.

00:01:08.513 --> 00:01:14.608
It only works with the primary weapon, if you try it with the pistol por example it just won't work.

00:01:15.295 --> 00:01:20.661
This is really usefull if you want to know if you've already thrown your grenade or not, at least I use it a lot

00:01:21.004 --> 00:01:26.795
because sometimes I don't have a grenade and I look like a retarded, aiming at the sky waiting for a magic grenade going out my hands.

00:01:28.758 --> 00:01:36.482
Also it's really useful when you get a kit from the floor, for example I kill my friend reverde, I'll kill and I don't have any grenades. 

00:01:37.213 --> 00:01:45.344
When you get a kit from the floor, you don't know if he has thrown any grenade or not, so the first thing you've to do is check if he has any. 

00:01:45.778 --> 00:01:55.173
Also, if he had the grenade perk and didn't throw any grenade you'd have his 2 grenades, even though you don't have the grenade perk.

00:01:56.091 --> 00:02:06.047
To sum up the video, I'll teach how to throw the grenade in order to reach more distance.

00:02:06.357 --> 00:02:14.966
I made three test, first I throw a grenade without moving and the I'll jump in the second one.

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:29.101
This is the first one without moving and the second one doing a little jump, as you can see in the marks the second grenades gets a little bit further. 

00:02:29.571 --> 00:02:34.392
So if you want to kill  someone who is a further you've to jump, obviously.

00:02:34.907 --> 00:02:45.142
The 3rd test I made is running + jumping and as you can see it goes a lot further than the other two previous grenades. 

00:02:45.642 --> 00:02:55.470
So if you an enemy at med-long rande you've to run + jump in order to kill him properly.

00:02:56.466 --> 00:03:05.657
Well, that's the end of the fist BFADVICE,  I hope you liked the video, I've plenty ideas about more bfadvices.

00:03:06.107 --> 00:03:18.792
I hope to make a weely video, this was pretty basic, even though I didn't know that you could get the two grenades from a random kit if you weren't carrying grenade perk.

00:03:19.071 --> 00:03:29.461
As always, like, comment the video, any question you've about the video just ask it, I'll answer, so thanks for watching, and cya people! :D
