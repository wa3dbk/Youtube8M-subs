Hi my name is Lauren and on behalf of Expert
Village, I'm here to discuss short straight

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:10.200
hair styles. A nice easy way to actually get
your hair away from your face and prevent

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:17.210
yourself from continuously putting it behind
your ears like I have mine is to do some crisscross

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:21.490
patterns. It's almost like a basket weave
that you form on the top of the head. You

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:26.510
can start by separating the front right by
the hairline, you can start as far back as

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.860
you'd like cause you're going to work your
way forward with this. Now I'm just doing

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:36.649
more or less just the front part. I don't
want to go beyond the back of her ears. Her

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:41.409
ear is right here, so I'm sticking to the
front of her ear over here, so I don't want

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:48.760
to go beyond that. And I'm going to start
by taking pieces of hair, some random. I'm

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.309
going to do some triangular patters and I'm
going to do some rectangular patterns. Some

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:57.659
are going to be a little thicker and some
will be a little thinner. You can kind of

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:03.159
gauge it. The important thing is to create
that crisscrossed look. And I'm simply going

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:10.420
to pull the hair back, twist it a little bit
in order to insert the pin. Which you're going

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.430
to insert going into the twist so that way
you don't see it. And then I'm going to grab

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:31.079
another piece of hair and I'm just going to
away that crisscrossing the first one we did.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:38.890
If you feel like you need to make it a little
smoother, you may want to use some product.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:44.490
You can use a pomade. You don't want to do
anything too greasy or oily. You just want

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.370
to kind of get enough where you get that smoothness.
The smoother you can get those pieces before

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:54.290
you crisscross them, the nicer it's going
to be and the more noticeable your crisscross

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.640
is going to look. So if you feel that spray
can achieve that for you. If your hair is

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.200
a little courser then you're going to want
to use something a little bit heavier in order

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:13.460
to achieve that crisscross pattern. Again
you're going to twist again and insert the

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.680
bobby pin going into it. Now more hairs that
goes in, the more twisting you're going to

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:27.630
have and the more of a weave pattern you're
going to have. It's just something for the

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:34.440
everyday rather than putting your hair just
in a regular headband. It also kind of is

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:42.030
a nice way to get the hair away from your
face. See this one I'm just going to bring

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:54.190
over here.
And that is how you get crisscross patterns

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:54.209
on the top.
