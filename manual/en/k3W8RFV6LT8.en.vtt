Hi, I’m Kate I’m here with Zoar Outdoor
on behalf of Expert Village and we’re going

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.790
to talk about hiking today. When you’re
hiking you’re going to want to stay hydrated.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:16.720
There are several methods to how to stay hydrated.
You’re going to want water bottles, nalgenes

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:22.180
work pretty well, they are hard as a rock,
they don’t break. These creek bottles work

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:29.550
out well because it’s very easy to access
them. You can use a water system, CamelBak

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:36.400
makes them, Deuter makes them, these are pretty
cool they go inside your backpack. This one

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:44.210
is a 2 liter, so you fill it up, seals it
all in very well, I put duct tape on the bottom

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.079
where the hose comes out just so it can’t
leak inside my backpack. There’s usually

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:58.850
a spot on your backpack to hang it from and
then on the other side your hose comes out

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:04.699
for you to drink from. This is easy access
for you to hydrate yourself all day long,

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.060
its right at your shoulder, if you’re on
a really strenuous hike, this is the way to

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:16.770
do it. If you’re doing an overnight, nalgenes
are a good thing to have along with your CamelBak

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.500
because you can have this inside your sleeping
bag, you can’t really put this inside your

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.990
sleeping bag without worrying about getting
yourself all wet. If it’s going to be cold

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.570
or it’s going to be really hot and happen
to like cold water, you can get an insulated

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:39.250
bag, this way to keep your nalgene from freezing
or keeping it nice and cold, these can attach

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.380
to the side of your backpack. When you are
hiking if you should run out of water it’s

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.520
not a good idea to drink water from a stream
that isn’t treated. You’re going to want

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:57.770
to either use a water filter or iodine. Never
drink water untreated, you can get very sick

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:02.289
from it. So make sure you have plenty of water
for you for the day, you’re continuing hydrating

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:03.789
and you should have a pretty good hike.
