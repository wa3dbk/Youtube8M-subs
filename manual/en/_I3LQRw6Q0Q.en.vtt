00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:07.520
Welcome to step number three of the micro
zillion braids I in this that I will be sharing

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:17.340
six of my best tips tricks and advice for
doing your micro braids number one beauty

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:25.740
is not paying preventing hair loss and alopecia
all my life I felt like beauty was pain every

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.800
time I sat in a chair and got my hair braided
or twisted up in that it always hurt it hut

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.010
literally for weeks beauty is not pain because
with pain, a lot of tragedy you want to make

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.310
sure that when you are braiding your hair
your hair is not to try shouldn’t feel sensitive

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:50.040
it shouldn’t feel like your braids are too
heavy and it definitely shouldn't feel uncomfortable

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.590
when you're braiding your hair is simply hurts
loosen your grip you want to keep your hair

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.230
for as long as you can and putting too much
tension on your hair will lead you to hair

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:06.610
loss alopecia is such a problem with women
in their hair because they're simply putting

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.130
too much tension on their scalp if your head
is hurting that is your body alerting you

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.520
and warning you that there's some pain and
tension going on that needs to be relieved

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.850
if your braids in fact feel too tired or uncomfortable
or too heavy make sure you losing your grip

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.369
or simply use less hair for your braids tip
number two braiding close to your roots when

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:36.760
you braiding your hair this is your number
one goal to make sure that your braids extremely

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.659
impressed to be as close to the of your scalp
is the closer you bring to the roots of your

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.120
scalp the more fresher your style look now
this may be an issue if you are new to this

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:53.689
because the braids can sometimes can slide
down the hair follicles because you're getting

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:59.840
used to how grip the certain sections of extensions
and your hair make sure that you retry the

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.960
braid and get to as close to your roots as
possible so that way it looks your hair has

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:12.030
been partially done is looking your braids
were done two weeks ago tip number three brick

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.030
parting with your parting your hair is always
best to part your hair into the fashion that

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:23.630
bricks lay to ensure that you cover up as
much scalp as possible most times when I will

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.525
have issues with their braids are full and
thick but why does feel like but why does

00:02:28.525 --> 00:02:34.290
my scalps show so much to my braids one of
the issues is simply that you probably need

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.310
to add more hair to your braids and since
I have been showing your how you part your

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.060
hair into sections so I have been parting
my hair into brick sections and I will show

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.660
you exactly what that looks like so here on
the side of my head I will show you how your

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.420
parts me to look or your braids need to look
for brick parting is going to remove one of

00:02:54.420 --> 00:03:01.350
the layers here and flip it over to show your
section of braids that directly shows brick

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:09.200
parting so here on one of my layers I have
a braid here and right above that braid I

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.860
have two braids so instead of one braid been
stacked on top of one another I have the braids

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.450
that are shifting even slightly to the left
or the right so that braids fill up empty

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:30.400
space and so here I can show you an example
again I have to braids here and they write

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.620
about this braid I have another braid that
lays directly in that space and that's called

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.739
brick parting and brick layering and as you
can see that covers up any scalp that was

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:49.370
showing which makes more of a fuller braid
look tip number four creating longer braids

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:56.209
this is an extremely easy and quick tip to
do adding length to your braids if you would

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.690
like braids that are extremely long you can
simply leave the back of hair that is all

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.459
cut and braid to the very bottom since we
can't hair and had already predetermined how

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.739
far down your braids going to be when you
make sure that you directly have your hands

00:04:11.739 --> 00:04:16.549
placed in the middle of your section of hair
so that two of the sides are equal this already

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.759
gives you the length that you need or want
so if I pinch this here and put it right at

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:28.139
the root of my hair and stretch the hair downwards
it tells me exactly how far my hair falls

00:04:28.139 --> 00:04:33.169
as you can see my braids are a lot longer
than hair the that I have here so the way

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:39.659
that you add mmoe hair to your braids is to
simply shift the hair to make sure that one

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:45.229
side and the other side are a little bit longer
than what it appears to be so for example

00:04:45.229 --> 00:04:50.059
I will show you as if I'm going to demonstrate
a braid I'm going to divide the third and

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:57.479
two thirds from the hair and this time is
that make sure both sides are pretty much

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:02.990
equal I'm going to shift the side so that
one of the sides are a little bit longer so

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:08.270
if you see this one piece of hair here I'm
pinching the top part where is the left side

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:13.080
shorter than the right side is longer and
I'm going to do the same thing with my second

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.490
piece of hair to make sure that there equal
to one another by having a short side and

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:25.210
a long side so now I'm pitched in this position
to is not entirely equal on all lengths and

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:35.240
want to wrap it around that piece of hair
so with my hair into my sections and I shifting

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.909
both sides of the only of the hair now my
brain will actually be a lot longer than what

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:47.849
so where is that now you can go right your
scalp and hold it there as if it's a braid

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:53.629
stretch your hands-down the hair and now it
matches the length of your braids so that

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:59.289
how you add links to your braids to simply
divide hair to have in is that make sure that

00:05:59.289 --> 00:06:04.199
all of the hair is equal in the bottom shift
both sides so that it actually creates more

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:13.499
length at the bottom tip number five snipping
the frayed ends previously shown you instead

00:06:13.499 --> 00:06:18.460
to make sure to snip your frayed ends and
any hair that sticks out of your braids to

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.159
your frays and you simply want to grab one
of your braids and quickly examined to see

00:06:23.159 --> 00:06:29.479
where any hair stick out there any hair sticking
out the side of your braids or sticking out

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:34.289
the bottom of your braid you are going to
carefully take your scissors is along the

00:06:34.289 --> 00:06:40.639
sides to where the hair sticks out is an extremely
easy and simple by snipping your frayed ends

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:49.849
and this creates more of a uniform and perfect
braid last but not least 10 number six practice

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:55.639

that I have to offer you and it is my most
