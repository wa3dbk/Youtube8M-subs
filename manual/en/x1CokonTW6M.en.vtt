Andy Knowles -- National Sales Manager: "When we speak to customers when they've had
a stairlift installed, they always tell us

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:17.280
what a difference its' made to their lives, Infact
most of them usually say they wished that they had it installed

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.460
sooner."

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:26.460
Daphne-"My partner told me there was a very pretty
place to retire to and I came to see it andlooked

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:33.690
at horror and thought I can't buy this house
because I can't climb stairs and then I saw

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.690
and advert and I thought yes I can, I can
have a Stannah stairlift! Which is exactly

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.690
what I did.
And I still can't climb stairs

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.530
And I sail away up to bed at night and come
down in the morning. I was able to buy this

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.180
pretty little place which I had fallen in
love with. I was very interested that Stannah

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:02.180
of course is a family company. They didn't
force sell the equipment, they gave me a choice

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:09.800
a choice of colour, they said well these are the date
we can give you and they arrived, they were

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.130
very very efficient very little mess, their
staff were very good and very polite

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.209
I am impressed by Stannah I think they're
excellent but don't think you could have a

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:23.330
better company to deal with."

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.470
Marge-"We purchased it for my husband Cyrill due to him
having a stroke about nine years ago

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.880
We thought that we might move but then it
was such a lot of uprising.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.700
The men came around from Stannah to check the
hallway for measurements and it was impossible

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:46.020
to leave it how it was because of Cyrills legs
So they had to take the banister rail out and

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.009
make a new one which they did and it's absolutely
brilliant

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.140
They were really caring, very clean, very clean workers
cleaned up immaculately after.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.890
They knew the colour I was having because
I already got the paper to put up and they

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.489
picked me the chair to match, which I thought
was lovely

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:05.560
absolutely wonderful
Can't fault them

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.450
I do think its classy definitely 
If he is sitting on there I would like to guide it up

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.390
but he says "no I can
do it, I can do it". He guides himself. The

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.000
chair comes in handy when Cyrill gets up
out of bed, he can take his time, get to the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.610
chair and come down on his own. Before I had
Stannah, I was Cyrills chairlift. I would put

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:29.110
my hands under his bottom to literally get
him upstairs. This has made a big big difference

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.910
to my life."

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.580
Mr Pottinger-"The period between being very active and not
being active, it was quite short actually

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:44.660
We were more concerned that we had to turn
a room downstairs into a bedroom because you

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.230
Mrs Pottinger-"know, no longer could we go upstairs."

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:52.180
Mr Pottinger-"Something you always put it in the back
on my mind, because your not prepared to accept the fact

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.830
that your never gonna walk up the stairs again.
I used to go up these stairs in ten seconds

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.240
at one time"
Mrs Pottinger-" Very difficult, with his breathing and

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:08.240
his lungs, being full of fluid and his heart
condition. So I used to walk up the stairs

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:15.819
behind him in case he fell down.
The timing was perfect for me because I was running out of steam

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.230
We had a discussion about it and we decided

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:25.210
to go for a Stannah chairlift. The representative
came along and he brought a sample of the

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:32.210
chair and he fitted it for Dereck to sit on
and he decided that this would be no good for him"

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.230
Mr Pottinger-"The representative said we have got a new

00:03:36.230 --> 00:03:43.230
model coming out and he described it in terms
of semi sitting onto the whole thing 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.750
 where the seat is claps-able"
Mrs Pottinger-" And he then  produced the Sadler and that

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:55.470
we found with a perching position that was very
good for Dereck, very comfortable and safe

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:04.400
and so that's how we decided on the (sadlar)
Comfort, perfect, I couldn't improve it in

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:07.840
any way.
It certainly changed Dereck because he can

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:13.510
go up and down at his own leisure and certainly
for me because I don't have to worry about

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:20.510
him and I know he is safe on it and we are
very pleased with it. We are living again."
