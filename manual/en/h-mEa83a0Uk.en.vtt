00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:07.060
This is a weather briefing on the potential
for severe weather this coming weekend.

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:17.730
This briefing was created on April 24, 2014
and is for thunderstorm potential April 26th

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.730
and 27th.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:20.230
There is a risk of severe thunderstorms this
weekend.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:28.310
Not everyone will be affected, but those that
are will likely see strong to severe thunderstorms.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:38.789
Anyone with outdoor plans should closely monitor
the forecast and conditions for rapidly changing

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:40.989
weather.

00:00:40.989 --> 00:01:11.750
On Saturday, the dry line will be west of
the region across northwest Texas and 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.140
the Big Country.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:40.030
Severe storms are likely to develop along
the dry line in the late afternoon hours,

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.780
tracking east and northeast into north and
central Texas Saturday evening.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.240
These storms will dissipate overnight.

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:56.230
The most likely locations to be impacted by
severe 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:02.420
storms Saturday evening/night is west of a
Sherman to DFW to Killeen line.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:15.190
An isolated tornado 
will be possible during the evening hours

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:25.510
but the 
tornado threat will diminish later into the

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:26.510
night.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:37.610
Sunday should be the more intense day.

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:52.209
Our current thinking 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:03:17.500
is 
the dry line will set up 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:46.650
near the I-35/35E Corridor, and keep most
of 

00:03:46.650 --> 00:04:03.150
the strongest thunderstorms to 
the 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:16.190
east and northeast.

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.750
