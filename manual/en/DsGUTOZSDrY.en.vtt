Hey, guys.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.790
We just completed a day of recording drums
all day, just getting little one-shots for

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.790
this drum library.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.140
And while we're at it, I'm going to give you
a little quick tutorial on how to put together

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.810
some really great drum catchers, different
approaches and things that you can do to get

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:24.810
different sounds.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.090
So, first thing I'm going to show you is a
couple of different outside mic techniques

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.360
and what's important to know is that this
side here is the resonant head and this side

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:34.360
here is the batter head.

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:38.280
The batter head is where the drummer is going
to be playing their foot pedal.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.280
So, this is where the attack is coming from.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.050
This is where the tone in the body is
coming from.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.550
So, when you're doing an outside kick mic,
a lot of the times what you're really trying

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.600
to capture is a very vivid and focused image
of the low end, so the tone, the resonance

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:51.640
of the kick.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.510
So, here's a quick way to do that.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.489
You use a microphone like a good condenser.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:06.090
I like an M147 and you get about level with
the center of the drum and it takes a little

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.500
experiment, but I find that actually pretty
far out.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.500
It's a pretty good space.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.300
This is
maybe about two feet sometimes even further,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.100
but usually about two, two and a half feet
out from the drum.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.360
That's where you're going to get the biggest
low end sound.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.300
Now, when you've got a full kit in, a lot
of times what you need to do is grab moving

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.470
blankets of some sort, packing blankets, and
drape over the kick and the microphone.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.070
What this does is it eliminates the cymbal
sound from getting directly into the mic,

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.580
and this gives you just a focused picture
of the low end.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.580
It's called tunneling.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.340
So, that's a great way to get a good sub out
of a kick.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.810
Now, let's say that you want to get more smack
out of the overall sounds and you don't mind

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.500
getting the cymbals and the snare into the
sound as well like if you're doing like a

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.580
jazz set up or something like that and you're
using a minimal mic technique.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.560
Instead of having the mic here, you might
want to actually raise the mic up a little

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.720
bit higher and have it closer to the kick
and aim down and what's going to happen is

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.560
that the low end is
going to come off access.

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.950
So, relative to the low end you're actually
going to get more smack and more punch from

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:13.950
the tone.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.280
This is a really good technique.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.010
The con of it is that you can't really get
the cymbal sound and snare sound out, but

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.700
if you can get the placement just right where
it sounds good for all of those things it's

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.780
actually going to be a really great technique.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:32.640
Now of course, a tried and true rock technique
for like solid punch is just to get the condenser

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.610
real close right up against the head.

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.230
This is going to give you a good oomph to
the tone.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.590
It's going to be shorter decay, the low end
isn't going to extend as far, but it's going

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.070
to give you a lot of power in the attack.

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:44.380
That's like a classic rock set up.

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.690
All right, so what else can you do?

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:51.790
Well, let's say that you want to get the shell
tone that sort of mid-rangey, I don't want

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:54.900
to say clanky because that makes it sound
bad, but sort of that like...

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:55.900
I don't know.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.970
Jeff, how would you describe the sound that
you get when you put the mic inside and aim

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.020
at the shell?

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.370
I think it's a bare resonant, good picture
of the actual shell sound, the timber of the

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.370
drum.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:08.370
Yeah.

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:09.370
So, okay.

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:10.370
So, that's basically what it is.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.370
It's the shell sound.

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.920
So, what you're going to do is you're going
to take the D112 or something similar, a large

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:15.920
diaphragm dynamic.

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.020
You're going to place it right inside just
up in the front of the cut away here and you're

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:25.260
going to aim it instead of aiming it forward
at the batter head, you're aiming it directly

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.620
to the side or maybe 45 degrees off to the
side.

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:32.750
And the more toward the batter head, the more
attack you're going to get, the more to the

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:35.990
perpendicular line, the more shell tone you're
going to get.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.280
Anywhere in between is going to give you a
mix of those flavors.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:46.420
Now, another way that you can approach miking
a kick drum is to actually mic both the outside

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.230
and the batter head, which is going to give
you an attack.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.680
So there's a couple ways you can do that.

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.810
One way you can do it is you can take your
D112 and point it forward, or even an SM57,

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.700
if you want and go all the way inside the
kick, right near the batter head, and that's

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.260
going to give you a very clickey, punchy attack,
very short duration.

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.349
That's really good for things like metal records,
anything where the kick drum is going to be

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:11.950
hitting very quickly.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:22.539
Another way to do it is to actually go around
the other side and mic this side of the kick.

00:04:22.539 --> 00:04:26.030
So when you're miking up that side of the
kick, the one thing you have to remember is

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:31.750
that you have a phase thing to consider now,
that the distance between the resident head

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.900
and the batter side should be equivalent to
how far any outside kick is going to be.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.020
So, once again, we're going back to this idea
of having the kick out mic actually fairly

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:43.560
far from the drum.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.060
The important thing is that this is your low
end.

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:53.400
This side here is going to give you the punch
and thickness of it.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.060
That's what needs to be in phase.

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.000
The attack is such a short duration, the phase
issues are going to be fairly minimal and

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.340
not something you need to terribly worry about.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:07.250
So remember, it's not the distance from the
batter head to that mic being the same as

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.190
the resident head to this mic.

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:15.370
It's actually the distance from the resident
head to the batter head out, if that makes

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.370
sense.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:17.370
Alright, cool.

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.240
So that's a couple of ways you can mic your
kick drum.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:21.490
I
hoped you learned something.
