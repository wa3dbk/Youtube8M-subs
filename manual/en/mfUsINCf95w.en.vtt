00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.270
Hi.

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:06.620
My name is Victor Sho.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:08.340
And I'm LaShonna.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.290
We are going to teach you how to dance to
dubstep music.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:14.350
I just want to bring clarity to this.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:19.880
Dubstep is more or less a style of music.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.110
It's not really a style of dance.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:27.100
There are a lot of people who play dubstep
music and free style to it.

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:32.570
And in that free style, the majority of the
time you'll see a lot of slow movements and

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.320
isolations.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.749
When you see these free styles, that's why
people try to adapt it to the dubstep as a

00:00:40.749 --> 00:00:43.649
dance but it's more or less just a free style.

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.339
So we're going to show you how you can free
style to dubstep music.

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:52.120
Just a basic foundation.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.870
We like to call if slow, hit, hit, hit.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:00.769
Slow, hit, hit, hit.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:04.670
Slow, hit, hit, hit.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.570
Slow, hit, hit, hit.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:12.250
For the most part, that's a great way to start.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:26.130
Your slow movement can just be very floaty
or it can even be like a wave.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.600
You can take it from there.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.170
This is just a foundation.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:40.049
We're going to show you how we free style
to dubstep music.

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:56.320
Five, six, seven, and...

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.869
And that's how you can start to free style
to dubstep music.
