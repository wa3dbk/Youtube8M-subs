no question about that

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.910

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.930
lou says he sixteen years old and is
from kansas city

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.270
i'm putting this on the show because i
have no way of getting a hold of mark to

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.890
follow up on this

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.140
and again we have we've not been able to
dedicate anyway but it is a disturbing

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.230
voicemail about what is going on

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.200
with teacher of marks on the plate for
you and mark if you're listening

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.870
what's cool is this

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.630
who's the teacher we need more
information 'cause i think we need to

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.260
look into this take a listen

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.350
markham little doubt

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.760
from kansas city and our own calling
because of the uh... an incident that

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.890
occurred at my school today with a
teacher we were discussing the book

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.160
huckleberry finn by mark twain

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.890
and uh...

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.000
end of the main character cannot turn in
a slave

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.840
and uh... she compared that to uh...
uh...

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.210
abortion by saying that

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.360
the what has already had it not
necessarily with morally right saying

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.150
that what society said in that time
period to his please write to us

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.230
turn in this wave when uh... what's
morally right it tomorrow

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.570
and uh... dan maar

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.250
what society has a right to have an
abortion it not morally right i would

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:08.769
like to uh...

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:11.509
and get your thoughts on this and ah...

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:14.949
hike from alright so we we got to find
out more information about this clearly

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:18.529
it is complete if not i don't have any
reason to think that this

00:02:18.529 --> 00:02:23.449
is necessarily illegal in in not kansas
city but we do know is that it's cool

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:26.280
very unethical for a teacher to be
pushing

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.590
the added that the rules of morality
when it comes to abortion onto students

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:34.440
particularly calcheng it is a simple
comparison to something from huckleberry

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.440
finn uses disturbing we know it is is
going on hopefully mark

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.880
can actually service that has uh... at
informa content and a specific case

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.620
clearly this is not an objective
discussion in any way the teacher

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:48.239
you see there reason

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.749
presumably reproduced renault with is
pushing her room

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:55.139
morals on students

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.469
hopefully the time that we can get more
information for market look into this

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:00.599
further i mean this this certainly

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.479
is not what should be happening

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:06.619
now and it seems like mark twain out
probably didn't have that discussion in

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:09.819
mind when you wrote the book realized i
would certainly estimated and

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.290
interestingly enough army what happened
is is a reverse anne mark twain

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.609
a long time ago

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:20.699
yes society changed to write a it may
have been immoral to do that that then

00:03:20.699 --> 00:03:24.339
when in reality was a good thing but now
this is a reversing a long time ago

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:27.979
abortion of course across the board was
considered a moral right now people are

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:31.369
changing their minds here so it's not
even have really good analogy even if

00:03:31.369 --> 00:03:33.610
even if you for put aside the fact that
that

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:35.629
beliefs are being pushed here

00:03:35.629 --> 00:03:37.579
it's not even a good analogy

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:40.779
which really brings up concerns about
how good this teacher is uh... there's a

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.079
number of issues here uh...

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:46.389
but we need we need more info for sure
this is big please mark email me a

00:03:46.389 --> 00:03:49.699
