00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.700
NARRATOR: Throughout history suspicion
has always bred conflict.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:33.000
The real conflict, though, resides in people's hearts.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.400
[Male scream]

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.500
METAL: Oh, no!
GILLIAN: What was that?

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.500
METAL: An analysis of Jean's stomach reveals a major lesion
on the pyloric region of the gastric membrane.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.200
GILLIAN: Jean had an ulcer, huh?

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.700
METAL: Yes. In addition, I read a substantial quantity
of partially digested organic compounds.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.300
Amino acid structure of the proteins suggest
the meat is that of a buffalo.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:08.800
GILLIAN: Buffalo meat?

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.900
METAL: Yes, buffalo meat.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.100
[Warning alert]
I'm reading movement!

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.200
GILLIAN: Snatchers?
We're getting out of here!

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.200
METAL: I am incapable of locomotion!

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.800
GILLIAN: Let's go, it's gonna blow!

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.000
[Explosion]

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.900
KATRINA: I appreciate your feelings, but I was always
ready for the worst with my father.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.000
GILLIAN: Katrina, that's....

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.500
Well, I'm a junker's daughter.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.600
[Videophone ringing]
METAL: It's the emergency line from HQ; I'll connect you.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.300
Gillian, I'm glad I got you. I got a call from Katrina.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.900
MIKA: She seemed really scared...
kept saying that Alice was barking.
[Alice barking]

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.300
[Warning alert]
METAL: I read motion!

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
[Window shattering]

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.200
GILLIAN: It's Alice!

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.700
METAL: The dog is dead.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.200
Gillian, behind you!!

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.900
[Gun blast]

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.700
You're lucky I was here to save your skin.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:26.800
Who are you?

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.500
Me? Random Hajile, bounty hunter.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.900
BENSON: Random Hajile... so, who is this guy, friend or foe?

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.900
GILLIAN: Just where do you think you're going?

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.200
METAL: The turbocycle seems to be out of control!

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.500
RANDOM: Gillian, you gotta jump over to my bike!

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.800
I can't! My timing's off, I....

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.500
Now, Gillian, now!!

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.000
[Loud crash]

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.800
METAL: This apparently leads down to a lower level.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.500
GILLIAN: It looks like Jamie was right.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.600
Good God!!

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.500
METAL: I read four human skeletons in this room.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:20.500
Now performing simulated reconstruction of the head
and facial features of each of the four victims.

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.800
Commencing with victim #1.

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:27.000
RANDOM: We've just nailed four snatchers!

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.800
METAL: Reconstruction of head of final victim completed.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.300
[Gasp] It's....

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:48.900
JEAN-JACK: Snatchers' vampire-like behavior is due
to their desire to avoid exposure to sunlight.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.000
The reason they dislike sunlight is
because of their defective artificial skin.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.900
In other words, what we call simple sunburn is fatal to them.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:10.900
BENSON: This severely limits the places and times
that they can operate to mid-winter - when daylight
hours are their shortest - and of course at night.

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.600
METAL: And this is where the artificial
skin is attached.

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.900
GILLIAN: This is the stuff that gets cancer
if they stay out in the sun too long.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:37.500
'CHIN': That's far enough, Junker!
GILLIAN: It's them!!
RANDOM: Snatchers?!?

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.000
[Laser blast]
Uggh!!

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.000
[Laser blast]
Aggh!!

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:53.700
'CHIN': You two are finished, but our plans move forward.

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:59.900
We are on the verge of developing a perfect artificial skin.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:02.400
Just what do you have in mind?

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.300
RANDOM: I got a big fireworks show ready for 'em.

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.500
It's December.

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.600
GILLIAN: A little late for fireworks.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.700
So, it'll be an off-season show.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:25.100
GILLIAN: Mika!!

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.310
No, Gillian, don't move! It's a trap!

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:31.600
Mika, are you all right?

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.200
GILLIAN: We'll find him! We know he's
somewhere inside headquarters.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.600
METAL: The snatcher has been wounded.
We should look for traces of blood.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.100
GILLIAN: Ah, Harry!!
HARRY: Ohh...

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.600
Oh, Gillian... is that you? I'm getting old....

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.300
We have comrades operating throughout the city!

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:59.000
Your existence is meaningless, as long as
you don't get your memory back!

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.000
Comrades?

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.200
My memory?

00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:20.100
METAL: They will be deciding how to handle Neo-Kobe
at the summit in just three hours.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:25.700
MIKA: There are rumors that they're going to use nukes
on the city to make sure the snatchers are wiped out!

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.500
How about dinner sometime?

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:29.500
GILLIAN: Dinner?

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:35.000
I thought it'd be nice, you know, to kick back, relax...
it's Christmas after all.

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:43.000
JAMIE: We can do it this time, Gillian... not some fake couple
like before, but with love and trust.

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.800
I know, Jamie.

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.300
METAL: Gillian, this is definitely their nest.
We should destroy everything!

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.800
GILLIAN: Metal, how much time do we have left?

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:59.000
The delegates, worried about the snatcher menace, voted
unanimously to allow the use of nuclear weapons on the city.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:01.000
JAMIE: Do they intend to kill everybody?!?

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.100
[Satellite firing]

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.500
[Snatcher firing]

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:13.200
GILLIAN: You egomaniac, do you think you can
'snatch' the entire population?

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:18.900
JAMIE: No matter how hard you try, you won't be
able to 'snatch' the people's heart and soul.

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:22.000
[Heartbeat]

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:28.900
JAMIE: Gillian, I remember everything!

00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:30.400
GILLIAN: So what about us?

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:34.000
JAMIE: It's terrible... what we've done!
