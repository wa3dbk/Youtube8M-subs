Hi, I'm Stuart Shepard. This is Stoplight!

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.250
It's a popular thing on Facebook -- posting
a list of things you remember 

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:13.700
that aren't around anymore.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.500
You know like your first car, rotary phones,
Wham!. That got me thinking about why some

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.590
things once were here and now are gone.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:29.300
Remember the Pontiac Aztec? It took is styling
cues from a dumpster. It ranked # 1 on a list

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:36.300
of the worst cars ever made. It was a car
nobody wanted and now Pontiac is gone.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:42.239
Lehman Brothers invested money in ways that
defied logic that returned nothing of value

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.999
and lost people a gazillion dollars. And now
Lehman Brothers is gone.

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:52.280
Solyndra took a huge loan of our tax dollars
-- went around telling everybody how they

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.999
were creating green jobs and a green economy
and then declared bankruptcy. Solyndra is gone.

00:00:58.889 --> 00:01:02.829
Let's consider for a moment what led to
each of these going away.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:09.120
Number 1: They build something people did
not want. (Obama) "After a historic vote,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:15.020
Health Care Reform is no longer an unmet promise.
It is the law of the land." "It is the

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.210
law of the land."

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.120
2) They were not wise with how they used their
money. (Obama) "This week the House passed

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:27.200
the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan
which will save or create more than 3-million

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.450
jobs over the next few years."

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.630
3) They pushed for green jobs that can
only exist while tax payer money pours in.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.340
(Obama) "The true engine of economic growth
will always be companies like Solyndra."

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.140
"...through the recovery act this company
received a loan that expands its operations."

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.170
"This new factory is the result of those loans."

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.170
Ya' know I really don't miss rotary phones.
(Talking to iPhone) "Call home." (iPhone)  "Calling Stuart Shepard - home."
