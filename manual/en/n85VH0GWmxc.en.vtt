Behind The Scenes
#116: The Month Ahead September

00:00:11.723 --> 00:00:18.880
With Summer coming to a close, Runescape's most energetic face is here to lift the lid on a host of updates coming this September.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:24.132
This Behind the Scenes, I get the privilege of saying something I've wanted to say for ten years: 

00:00:24.167 --> 00:00:26.239
Elf City is out this month. 

00:00:26.274 --> 00:00:29.576
What might be a surprise to you is how much else there is in September. 

00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:32.064
I really can't remember a month this crammed.

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:35.168
But before I let the cat out of the bag, let's talk about Prifddinas.

00:00:36.744 --> 00:00:40.311
So, if you've been keeping up with Mod Elfborne's videos, you'll know a lot about what's coming. 

00:00:40.346 --> 00:00:44.576
You'll know about the new slayer master, with his own boss slayer challenge and Distraction and Diversion.

00:00:44.611 --> 00:00:49.176
You'll know about the Max Guild, with its skill portals, combat portal and completionist throne.

00:00:49.824 --> 00:00:53.473
You'll know about the Seren Stones for resource-free mining and smithing.

00:00:53.508 --> 00:00:57.456
And you'll know about crystal tree farming patches, elder tree farming patches, 

00:00:57.491 --> 00:01:00.551
infuriation-free pickpocketing, two new Grand Exchange locations

00:01:00.586 --> 00:01:05.008
and the Voice of Seren, which randomly makes one of the Elf City families more rewarding.

00:01:06.074 --> 00:01:09.192
What you won't know is how spectacular the final Elf City is looking. 

00:01:09.227 --> 00:01:12.904
It is grand, huge, bustling, beautiful and comprehensive,

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.511
densely packed with all your favourite training methods. 

00:01:15.546 --> 00:01:17.943
We really do think it will change up your RuneScape routines.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.184
It's worth remembering that this is just the first half of the Elf City release. 

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:25.544
The final four families of the Elf City are due to be released in November, 

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:28.848
when things get real and the Elf City becomes the biggest city in the game.

00:01:29.853 --> 00:01:32.783
Next is something else that could change the way you play RuneScape.

00:01:32.818 --> 00:01:34.520
We call it the Grouping System. 

00:01:34.555 --> 00:01:39.268
This is a single
multiplayer lobby that doesn't require you to travel or even give up what you are doing. 

00:01:39.303 --> 00:01:41.432
State a preference for the games you want to play, 

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:44.720
and the system will match-make a suitable group as you get on with the important stuff.

00:01:45.155 --> 00:01:47.568
You'll also be able to invite players across worlds,

00:01:47.603 --> 00:01:50.831
as well as from your clan list, friend list, public chat or by name.

00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:56.104
Chat to them via a new group chat channel, and let the system form a group for you, 100% hassle-free.

00:01:57.188 --> 00:02:00.760
When you're ready to play, the group leader can teleport the entire group to the starting area,

00:02:00.795 --> 00:02:03.864
and we're launching with combat areas, dungeoneering, social slayer, 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.329
various multiplayer minigames and all manner of boss fights.

00:02:07.306 --> 00:02:10.314
Also bringing attention to older content is an update that you voted for. 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.139
In May, you chose to 'Make runes more valuable' and we attempt to do exactly that,

00:02:14.174 --> 00:02:16.690
with a bizarre contraption called the Rune Goldberg Machine.

00:02:17.843 --> 00:02:22.715
This will be a daily D&amp;D, where you can experiment with turning runes into a sticky goo called vis wax. 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.498
This wax will extend the duration of most auras, reroll daily challenges, 

00:02:27.533 --> 00:02:32.363
double the duration and reward of daily challenges, or increase your divination location gathering limit.

00:02:32.998 --> 00:02:37.219
But not everyone is interested in gaining XP. Some are interested in actually losing it. 

00:02:37.254 --> 00:02:42.139
In September, we will be offering two completely free packages to anyone interested in reclaiming their pure accounts: 

00:02:42.174 --> 00:02:48.098
one package resets your Constitution to 10 and Prayer level to 1, the other resets Defence to 1.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.010
While that may be niche, the next update is for everyone.

00:02:52.045 --> 00:02:55.227
From the people who brought you Super September and the RuneScape Roadtrip,

00:02:55.262 --> 00:03:00.707
we will be releasing something that will get you in game every day to win prizes and meet with the occasional JMod.

00:03:00.742 --> 00:03:03.202
More news will come on the 1st of September.

00:03:04.037 --> 00:03:08.010
If that sounds a tame, we've taken inspiration from the 'Ironman Challenges' 

00:03:08.045 --> 00:03:10.067
and are making it an official mode within RuneScape. 

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:15.562
This really is experimental, so we expect lots of feed back from you as we fine tune it.  

00:03:15.797 --> 00:03:20.450
On account setup, you'll be able to choose between Ironman and Hardcore Ironman modes.

00:03:20.485 --> 00:03:23.346
These can be toggled off but never on.

00:03:23.381 --> 00:03:27.027
Ironman mode stops you from trading, so you'll have to be completely self-sufficient.

00:03:27.062 --> 00:03:33.615
Hardcore Ironman adds a twist. If you die, you will not be able log back into that character ever again.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.962
Death is a final, permanent end, so you better think twice before you wander into a hazardous situation.

00:03:37.997 --> 00:03:41.302
So if you think seismic wands are a cinch to get hold of? 

00:03:41.438 --> 00:03:42.459
Try to get one - I double-dare you.

00:03:43.594 --> 00:03:48.779
The ninjas will come to the party with Expert Skillcapes, which give 99ers something new to aim for. 

00:03:48.814 --> 00:03:51.187
These capes represent 99s in a number of tied skills,

00:03:51.222 --> 00:03:54.594
and they can only be gained by finding shard items when skilling at level 99. 

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:58.314
These shards won't be common, so be vigilant for when they might appear in your inventory!

00:03:58.349 --> 00:04:02.709
The Expert Skillcapes are looking cool, and each has a brand new and extravagant emote.

00:04:03.044 --> 00:04:08.518
Finally, on Solomon's Store we welcome back the Bank Boosters, we offer the Zarosian Devotion pack,

00:04:08.553 --> 00:04:14.453
with two sinister Zarosian outfits, and the Prifddinian Riches pack, which offers melee, ranged and magic elf outfits.

00:04:15.288 --> 00:04:19.870
To celebrate Talk Like a Pirate Day, Treasure Hunter and other, pirate-themed ingame actions

00:04:19.905 --> 00:04:22.686
will be dishing out doubloons which can be traded for pirate rewards

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:26.845
there's pirate sheep, a Walk the Plank emote, and swordfish weapons to name a few.

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.413
You really will be the toast of Arrrrrrdougne.

00:04:30.248 --> 00:04:37.181
Next week we return to the Elven city for the final time where we'll be learning all about the last of the Elf families.
