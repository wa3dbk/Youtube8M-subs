00:00:01.059 --> 00:00:07.770
[Joan] On september eleventh on that morning i had
gone down to the Pentagon for a meeting 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.650
the meeting adjourned at nine thirty and
i was at the bus stop the plane hit the

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.589
pentagon

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:16.949
As it turned out the space i was in
seven months earlier was completed

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:22.179
destroyed and seven of my co-workers were killed

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:26.259
i realize that if i had been killed my
partner would've been quite literally the

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:30.059
last to know because i was unable to
put her name in any of my emergency

00:00:30.059 --> 00:00:32.420
contact information

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:35.470
the events of september eleventh made
us realized

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:40.870
we really were making a much bigger
sacrifice because of don't ask don't tell

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:45.790
[Jeremy] living under don't ask don't tell quite literally
she didn't exist

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.820
living under a don't ask don't tell

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.230
is something that 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:55.530
you cant put into words --really, its... you
give up so much of your self

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.400
in order to pursue a job that you love
you're giving up relationships you're

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.900
willing to lie to people it's a landmine

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.740
it's a field full of landmines

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:09.490
[Joan] for example when the Admiral would call me
to his office this little voice in the back

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.300
would always say gee I hope, I hope 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.500
that somehow haven't been outed and that he's

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.950
calling me to tell me my career is over

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.149
[Jeremy] the wording of it is really misleading

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.049
because it makes people think that under
the policy you can be

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.820
gay lesbian bisexual and serve but just not
talk about but it's a lot more than that

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:29.480
[Stacy] don't ask don't tell

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:35.190
also meant I would lead a very empty life by myself 
to be able to follow the law

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.240
[Joan] you basically end up living two lives

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.600
which is awful

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.170
[Dennis] my last assignment was as the commanding 
general of the ninety fourth regional

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:48.729
readiness command e and the principle
function of the ninety-fourth was to

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:53.550
prepare soldiers to deploy to 
Iraq and Afghanistan

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.170
In my professional judgement as
an old straight street bald guy

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:01.380
who spent thirty five years in the
military don't ask don't tell actually

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.610
takes away from military readiness

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.030
we have critical

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.139
very very difficult to fill military
occupation specialties where we 

00:02:12.139 --> 00:02:18.709
discharged fully qualified fully trained
combat veterans who are exactly what the

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:20.069
military wanted

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:21.969
simply because we had

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:25.260
a don't ask don't tell law on the books

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:30.959
which most of the military had thought didn't
make sense

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.879
[Stacey] i was the top recruiter in the Army

00:02:32.879 --> 00:02:35.849
through out the years i've been in the military

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.849
i had been promoted seven times
actually as i was being discharged from the

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:43.909
Army for don't ask don't tell my commander was very

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.549
forthright in his view that i still be
promoted ahead of my peers and that i would

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.479
be an asset to the army even though
i was gay

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:56.589
[Jeremy] as i progressed in my career i moved relatively quickly
and i had to weigh

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.569
whether or not living up to the Navy's core 
values

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:01.629
of honor, courage, and commitment

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.169
and living under dont ask dont tell 
were compatible 

00:03:04.169 --> 00:03:08.279
I wrote a letter to my commanding officer
letting him know what the situation was

00:03:08.279 --> 00:03:10.349
and was discharged

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:14.679
[President Obama] we are not a nation that says "dont
ask dont tell"

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:19.019
we are a nation that says "out of many, we are one"

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:20.670
we are a nation that welcomes the 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.489
service of every patriot
we are a nation that believes 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:30.319
that all men and women are created equal

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:34.619
those are the ideals that generations have fought for

00:03:34.619 --> 00:03:38.439
those are the ideals we uphold today

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:40.760
and now it is my honor to sign this bill into law

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.319
[Joan] the military, the country will be stronger without
dont ask dont tell the best way to have the best military

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:52.219
is to be able to hire the brightest 
most capable people

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:56.079
[Dennis] you have a whole host of organizations and
people who have worked tirelessly

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:01.459
since nineteen ninety-three
this failed law [Joan] a tremendous

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:03.079
number of people

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.439
have done so much from the president of
the united states to the lowliest junior

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:12.799
enlisted person thats somehow managing to
survive under dont ask dont tell

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.269
[Jeremy] from the moment he began campaigning
president obama made it clear

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.569
that if he was president he would work
to try to get dont ask dont tell repealed

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:22.789
[Dennis] the fact of the matter is 

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:24.110
that he delivered that dont ask 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:29.969
dont tell on twenty september two
thousand eleven will no longer be part

00:04:29.969 --> 00:04:34.580
of our military fabric. [President Obama] this is done

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:36.240
[Cheering]

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.229
[Jeremy] as soon as dont ask dont tell is 

00:04:37.229 --> 00:04:38.870
officially off the books 

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.729
[Stacey] I'm going back to finish what i started

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.709
I'm going back in because i want to keep giving back
to country

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:49.820
[Dennis] the soldiers sailors airmen and marines who want

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.210
to return to the military they deserve

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:55.030
a hand shake and a thank you

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.880
from every American because they are
showing courage integrity and a
 
0:05:01.880,0:05:06.730
loyalty to country in their service that's
almost unfathomable

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:09.479
and I would salute

00:05:09.479 --> 00:05:10.800
every one of them

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.330
and be humbled to stand in the same formation with them

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.679
[Stacey] i think that the repeal

00:05:14.679 --> 00:05:16.419
of dont ask dont tell

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:20.080
says that our country

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.710
is truly a country where freedom is respected

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:23.909
[Dennis] it speaks well

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:25.110
of America

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.889
when we react

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:31.749
based on fact and justice and fairness
and equality to the

00:05:31.749 --> 00:05:32.849
benefit

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:34.699
of the country as a whole

00:05:34.699 --> 00:05:38.030
[Joan] we have an american flag out front
it has been flying

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.949
and will continue to fly but on the 20th of
september's it's gonna fly just a little bit higher
