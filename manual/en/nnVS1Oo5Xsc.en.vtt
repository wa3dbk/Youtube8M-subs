00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.949
hi i'm joe Weisenfelder with cars dot
com this is a twenty fourteen jeep

00:00:13.949 --> 00:00:15.079
cherokee

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:20.609
it's an all name brought back for a new
s_u_v_'s that replaces the liberty

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.070
and it looks like this

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.380
everyone calm down

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.640
yes it looks different

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.859
especially for a cheap

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:31.789
some people really love it out no
shortage of unions they're and as they

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:33.980
say it looks a lot like a nissan jew

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.560
uh... companies and japan's running
lights up i like this and headlights

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.280
fellow differences

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.370
uh... in the gym

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:42.360
they're bigger more prominent

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:43.820
there's already been a change

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.130
in development of these were originally

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.220
right from basil's they have been

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.330
smoked out like this to make the upper
ones dominant really gives it the more

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.010
traditional look and i think a better
one

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.960
of the profile is kind of nondescript
but i think that's true of most s_u_v_'s

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.810
a possible exception is the trail hawk
version this one is a limited the trail

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.130
hoc which is intended for offering

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.530
us it's about an inch higher has uh...

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.409
much more prominent break leading down
low and also has

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.609
uh... shade front and rear poppers to
improve the approach and departure angle

00:01:17.609 --> 00:01:22.200
also that is the one to choose if you
want to go offer on it

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.160
the rare and is where things get really
nondescript

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:27.909
up most us cities look more less the
same in the back

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:31.700
uh... this one i think on a plane in the
way it scooped out here in the look of

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.090
the taillights kinda reminds me of the
four to skate uh... not the best angle

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.049
but some people who don't like the front

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.880
might actually say this is the best
thing

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.650
the cherokee has two big chrysler group
hardware introductions one of the nine

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.760
speed automatic transmission yes nine
speeds

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.820
and the other is that he knew three
point two earlier version

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.380
of the pen a star v six engine that's
the upgraded

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.760
the usual tennis stars and a whole bunch
of other

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.930
g chrysler dodge vehicles is for three
point six later

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:01.409
the base engine for this car

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.010
is a two point four leader four cylinder

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.180
the v six kids you two hundred
seventy-one horsepower to thirty-nine

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:08.509
confident torque

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.289
and the four cylinder

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.630
gives you one hundred eighty-four
horsepower

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.239
and one seventy one prompted for

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:18.669
now g points out that

00:02:18.669 --> 00:02:20.800
people in its most efficient form is

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.840
forty five percent

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.860
more efficient

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:24.269
then the liberty

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:26.399
liberty was a pig

00:02:26.399 --> 00:02:30.159
let's be serious about this an actual
numbers the most efficient one

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:31.450
with the porcelain and jim

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.140
disposed to get about thirty one mpg
highway

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.279
which is not bad for off-road vehicles

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:40.769
the cherokee has three different
four-wheel-drive systems there is active

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.110
drive one which is a simple all-wheel
drive

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.929
with no low-rent

00:02:44.929 --> 00:02:46.170
active drive to

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.560
does have all arrange for rock crawling
cetera it lots of front rear axles

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.309
together

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:53.349
then there's active dr lock

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.799
which is that system essentially

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:58.529
he locking rear differential

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:02.289
unlike the old cherokee in which he had
uh... control everything yourself this

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:06.639
vehicle has the jeep select train system
which is and not be able to choose among

00:03:06.639 --> 00:03:08.919
modes like auto snowsports

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.079
said the muck

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:13.419
and that changes your transmission
settings four-wheel-drive settings et

00:03:13.419 --> 00:03:16.959
cetera uh... optimizer certain
conditions

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:22.059
you can actually get in the trail
operation with active dr lock

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:27.449
crawl ratio of fifty-six to one that is
exceptionally

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:30.149
uh... you could probably final not
without ever stepping on the accelerator

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:31.959
pedal

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.069
the interior quality is really good in
the solidity that is nice bright

00:03:35.069 --> 00:03:36.410
teenagers with a

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:39.399
they configurable disc display between
them you can

00:03:39.399 --> 00:03:42.829
but we'd want there in terms of
information you're getting

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.539
two different roof options you can get a
panoramic moonroof like this and you can

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:51.019
also get a tempest top that folds back
upon itself and that actually opens it

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.869
up much farther

00:03:52.869 --> 00:03:55.279
previous cherokees were pretty simple
stripped down

00:03:55.279 --> 00:03:57.989
there's no shortage of features on this
thing

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.389
the optional eight point four inch you
connect screen

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.370
eight inches seems the minimum these
days great to have

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.459
you can even get heated steering wheel
and i'll point out

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.109
and chrysler dodge products heat the
whole thing threat at sixty degrees some

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.879
ledger grants don't do that

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:15.089
here in the back seat

00:04:15.089 --> 00:04:18.489
i notice what i consider to be where the
shortcomings of this new model and that

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:22.689
is ruinous uh... the driver's seat is
all the way back

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:25.560
and that gives you a lot allegro there

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.789
here's what i'm coming to terms of the
group

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.759
this is a sliding backseat typically
they let you give yourself a lot more

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:32.830
room in this

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.020
this is fully back

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:35.300
all you can do

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.050
is get less

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:42.440
federal also is kinda limited i'm six
feet tall but known to slouch

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.190
uh... for sit up straight on candidate
yet carefully back in canada ph here

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.819
why this is a problem well

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:53.110
g party has to compact as t_v_'s the
patriot and the compass

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:56.529
um... this one thousand seem
significantly large

00:04:56.529 --> 00:04:58.319
two-b_ what's

00:04:58.319 --> 00:05:01.349
in mid size a cv and that's what she
calls

00:05:01.349 --> 00:05:06.090
unfortunately that shortcoming expense
of the cargo area with the seats down

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.479
if the preliminary specifications are
correct

00:05:08.479 --> 00:05:12.489
this vehicle has less than fifty cubic
feet a storage volume

00:05:12.489 --> 00:05:13.949
the compass in the patriot

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.190
both have more

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.429
na absolute installing of the charities
challenging

00:05:20.429 --> 00:05:22.830
but you can continue to make boxes

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.419
and grand cherokee long they've got a
mix things up a bit

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:27.389
people who think

00:05:27.389 --> 00:05:30.090
that this is gonna ruin the jeep grand
don't need to work

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:32.519
if the original compass didn't do that

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:33.149
the certainly will
