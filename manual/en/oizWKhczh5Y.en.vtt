Hi again, Rob Mitchell for expert village.
We're moving on now. We have our key light

00:00:04.221 --> 00:00:10.150
set up. We have our reflector here for fill.
We just did the hair light on Nicole creating

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:15.340
a beautiful lighting on her shoulders as well
as in her hair. We're introducing a third

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:20.480
light this time and we're going to do a background
light. Obviously this one will go behind the

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.610
model. We want to make sure that you can't
see the light. We'll put it down low behind

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.940
Nicole and we'll shine it up on the background
and see what effect that gives us. Okay now,

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.030
we've placed the light exactly behind Nicole,
right in the center and we're shining it against

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.300
the background. Let me turn it on here and
you can see the effect that we're getting.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:47.420
There we are. Now you see this round hot spot
that the light creates. I like to place that

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.690
just over her shoulder so it comes across
the shoulders. See what happens. We can bring

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.390
it right up here and it doesn't really look
too attractive so I lower it just so that

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.659
we get a nice highlight, a nice arc right
over the shoulders. You can see what's happening

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:08.700
now, we've added a hair light, a fill reflector,
the key light, and a background light. Here's

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.030
another little trick that you can try. We're
taking our background light and we're turning

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:19.939
it off the background and we're pointing right
towards Nicole. You can see how it's highlighting

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:27.149
just a little bit of light here creating just
a little more depth, a little bit more definition.

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:31.250
One final little trick when you're using a
background light, you may want to throw some

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.490
color in there. Maybe we're just a little
bit tired of that white light. I just got

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.049
a simple blue gel that I'm going to put in
the background here. We'll tape it to the

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:50.369
light, just tape it right across the light
here and you can see how things have changed

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:54.939
once again. We've added a little bit more
drama. One could use red lights if we're using

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:59.899
Christmas cards, any different color lights
you can, just make sure that it doesn't conflict

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:00.990
with what your model is wearing.
