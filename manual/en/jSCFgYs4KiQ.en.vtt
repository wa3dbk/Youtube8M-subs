00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:23.700
Remember Super Dodge Ball?

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.020
Of course, you remember Super Dodge Ball.

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:27.130
It was one of the best sports games on the
NES.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.540
It was also one of the most...culturally insensitive
games, on the NES.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.810
The kind of game you could only get away with
in the 1980s.

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.370
Evidently, Outlaw Volleyball thinks it's the
1980s.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:44.300
What with the stereotypes, and...you know,
the misogyny.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.010
In fact, if you change the sport to volleyball
and replace Cold War issues with...stripper

00:00:51.010 --> 00:01:01.920
issues , 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.309
they're pretty much the same thing.

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:06.729
Outlaw Volleyball is just Super Dodge Ball
with a much nicer rack.

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:12.540
Just ask Shawnee, the Native American princess.

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:22.900
Or hey, how about Natasha?

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:35.789
I guess KGB means knockers getting bouncy.

00:01:35.789 --> 00:01:50.640
It's bare racism, even barer women...and,
um...wait, what else, was there?

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.150
Oh, right.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.409
Volleyball.

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:03.600
And you know, if you're okay with a little
lighthearted cultural insensitivity and are,

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.069
in fact, a 15-year-old boy...that volleyball
is actually pretty decent.

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.920
Outlaw Volleyball is a surprisingly solid
arcade sports game.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.630
It's fun, it plays pretty well...I mean, it's
not an amazing game or anything.

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.450
But...it's not terrible, either.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:22.210
Well, not all the time.

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:29.030
Obviously, the focus of the game is definitely
its characters.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.980
There are men, but...who cares about the men?

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.980
Honestly?

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.560
I'm not even sure why they're there, given
the game's tone.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:40.090
Seems like they were thrown in to claim some
kind of false equivalency.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.819
Just to deflect criticism of its...arguably
offensive portrayal of women.

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:44.819
"See?

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:49.209
We have a couple guys, too."

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:52.519
"So...you know.

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:55.840
It's cool."

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.970
Anyway, the models are actually really well
done.

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.520
They're detailed, they're...jiggly.

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:06.599
So what the environments may be lacking...it's
not really a big deal.

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.310
Clearly, the effort went into the women.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:09.730
And who are we to argue with that?

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.360
That's just...that's prioritizing, you know?

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.920
It's not like anyone who's playing this game
is going to care about the lousy textures

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.489
or the bland environments.

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:18.489
Things jiggle.

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:27.739
And they jiggle good.

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:29.430
And again, the game plays pretty well.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.890
The controls are simple, everything's pretty
intuitive.

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:35.280
And it throws in lots of classic arcade-isms,
right?

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.739
So there's a turbo meter, which can speed
you up.

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:42.489
There are crazy power shots...you can even
fight, just to change the momentum.

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.230
And there's a decent amount of modes, too.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.879
It even had online multiplayer, back in the
day.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.480
And yes, that's Steve Carrell.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.030
Making...godawful jokes.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:03.040
Listen, you probably wouldn't expect very
much from a game like this.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:06.260
And what you would expect, you getâ€”the chicks
are hot.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.519
But it's at least good to know that the game
beneath the boobs is actually pretty solid.

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.049
Whether or not you like the fact that...this
is basically a bunch of porn cliches playing

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:21.400
volleyball, you might like the game.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:36.940
Also, you might not.
