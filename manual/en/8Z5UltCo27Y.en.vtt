00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:08.790
WE WILL TRY TO PINPOINT WHERE WE

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.790
CAN SEE SOME STORMS AND

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:11.200
LIGHTNING COMING UP.

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.190
TURNING TO OUR WILDFIRE

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:20.130
COVERAGE

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:20.430
-- KRISTEN:

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.130
TURNING TO OUR

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.200
WILDFIRE COVERAGE -- MOST OF THE

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.610
FIRES BURNING IN THE NORTHERN

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.130
PART OF THE STATE.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:26.670
ONE OF THE FASTEST MOVING IS THE

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:26.900
ROCKY FIRE BURNING IN LAKE

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.440
COUNTY.

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:28.700
IT GREW TO 46,000 ACRES

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.670
OVERNIGHT.

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:33.240
BRIAN HICKEY JOINS US LIVE NOW

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:34.550
WITH THE LATEST ON THE FIRE.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:39.120
IT WAS A BUSY NIGHT OUT THERE.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.130
BRIAN:

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.860
YES.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:43.330
AND IT'S STILL ONLY 5% CONTAINED

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.750
ON THAT 46,000 ACRES.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.220
YOU CAN SEE THE SMOKE HANGING

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.690
OVER THE MOUNTAINS HERE WHERE

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.490
HIGHWAY 20 IS SHUT DOWN AND

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:54.040
HIGHWAY 16, THE FIRE CONTINUES

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.630
TO BURN THROUGH THAT AREA.

00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:57.380
LOOK AT THIS VIDEO FROM

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.670
OVERNIGHT.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:01.310
EVEN THE COOL NIGHTTIME HOURS,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.710
YOU WOULD EXPECT THE FIRE TO LAY

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.080
DOWN BUT THIS

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.620
FIRE HAS CONTINUED

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:07.050
WAS VERY ERRATIC BEHAVIOR

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.750
THROUGH THE EVENING.

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:11.360
THAT HAS ALLOWED THIS FIRE TO

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:11.710
MORE THROUGH THE HILLSIDES, UP

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.860
TO 46,000 ACRES.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:15.380
24 RESIDENCES DESTROYED AND MANY

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.860
MORE BEING THREATENED.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.420
OVER 5000 HOMES ARE CONSIDERED

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.100
THREATENED BY THIS FIRE AND MORE

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:24.730
THAN 12,000 PEOPLE HAVE BEEN

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.960
EVACUATED AS THE FIRE CONTINUES

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.900
TO GROW.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.810
WE HAVE HAD FIRE CREWS

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.400
ALONG

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.550
HIGHWAY 16 SETTING BACKFIRES.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:35.170
THEY ARE HOPING TO HOLD THE FIRE

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.550
WEST OF HIGHWAY 16 AND SOUTH OF

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.910
HIGHWAY 20 FOUR THE MOST PART.

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:41.620
HIGHWAY 16 RUNNING THROUGH THE

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.210
CASH CREEK AREA.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.860
THEY HAD A VERY SUCCESSFUL

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:48.130
OPERATION WITH ABOUT SEVEN MILES

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.190
OF CAN PAYMENT LINE ALONG THERE.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:55.220
NOW THEY ARE JUST HOPING THAT

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:55.800
WILL HOLD SHOULD THE FIRE SHIFT

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:56.160
DIRECTIONS AND START RACING

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:57.570
TOWARD THE EAST.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:05.230
AND NOT CROSSOVER HIGHWAY 16.

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:06.930
A DEBT -- THAT IS THE SITUATION.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.940
THEY HAVE EVACUATED THE CASH

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:13.270
CREEK AREAS.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.880
AS WE DROVE THROUGH THIS

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:14.050
MORNING, THAT AREA WAS CLEARED

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.480
OUT.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.450
THE FIRE IS ALREADY DOWN IN THE

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:18.950
CANYON CLOSE TO SOME OF THOSE

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:19.420
AREAS.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.250
A VERY ACTIVE FIREFIGHT

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.860
WITH A

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.190
LOT OF FIREFIGHTERS OUT THERE

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.830
THIS MORNING WORKING HARD

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.020
THROUGH THE NIGHT TO HOLD THOSE

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.490
LINES.

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.000
KRISTEN:

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.400
WE HAVE MORE

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.730
PERSPECTIVE ON THE FIRES BURNING

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.000
IN OUR STATE.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.140
BRIAN JUST TOLD US 5000 HOMES

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.580
ARE THREATENED AND A LOT OF

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:44.170
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN EVACUATED.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:44.380
HOW CLOSE IS THE FIRE TO THESE

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.850
HOMES?

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.360
SINCE THIS FIRE IGNITED LAST

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:53.750
WEDNESDAY, IT HAS BEEN BURNING

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.490
HUNDREDS OF HOMES.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:58.060
UNFORTUNATELY, THIS FIRE HAS

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:58.560
ALREADY BEEN ABLE TO DESTROY

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.440
ROUGHLY TWO DOZEN HOMES.

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:05.390
FIREFIGHTERS HAVE BEEN A GREAT

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:05.630
JOB PROTECTING THOUSANDS OF

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.630
OTHERS.

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:08.230
THIS MORNING, ABOUT 6300 HOMES

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:09.170
REMAIN THREATENED.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.200
NEW FIGURES ON THAT FIRE

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.470
-- IT

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.110
HAS ROSE TO 47,000 ACRES, SO IT

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.240
IS A LARGE AND FAST-MOVING FIRE.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:20.440
27,000 ACRES BURNED IN JUST FIVE

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.640
HOURS.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:26.790
THAT'S A RECORD-SETTING NUMBER.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.380
THAT IS NOT A SIZE AND INTENSITY

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:30.890
WE WOULD SEE TYPICALLY IN THE

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.490
BEGINNING OF AUGUST, BUT

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:33.100
CONDITIONS ACROSS THE STATE ARE

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.690
SO DRY BECAUSE OF THE DROUGHT

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:37.340
THAT HIRES LIKE THIS ONE ARE

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.200
ABLE TO IGNITE AND BURN RAPIDLY.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.730
KRISTEN:

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:44.380
WHEN A FIRE IS GROWING

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.670
THAT QUICKLY, HOW DO YOU STAY

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.880
AHEAD OF IT?

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.770
IT DEFINITELY CHALLENGES US.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:52.410
THE FIRST STEP IS WE WANT AND

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:53.910
AGGRESSIVE INITIAL ATTACK AND TO

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:54.090
THROW AS MUCH ON THAT FIRE AS WE

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.560
CAN.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.980
THAT IS FIRE CREWS ON THE GROUND

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:02.630
, AIR TANKERS, HELICOPTERS,

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:03.060
TRYING TO GET THE FIRE CONTAINED

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.100
AT 10 ACRES OR LESS.

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.750
BUT WEATHER CONDITIONS AND

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.130
DROUGHT CONDITIONS, THAT'S WHAT

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:10.660
WE SEE ABOUT 5% OF FIRES BECOME

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.870
LARGE AND DAMAGING FIRES.

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:15.430
WE HAVE TO MOBILIZE RESOURCES

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.700
AND BRING FIREFIGHTERS FROM

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:16.960
ACROSS THE STATE AND REGION TO

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:19.000
THE FIRE.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.170
WE HAVE CREWS FROM SOUTHERN

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.640
CALIFORNIA AND EVEN FROM OUT OF

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:22.110
STATE.

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.940
BEHIND

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.590
ME, ONE OF THE C-130

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:29.640
AIRCRAFT FROM THE NATIONAL GUARD

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:32.460
HAS BEEN ACTIVATED TO HELP US.

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:41.070
KRISTEN: THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:41.330
FIREFIGHTERS ALREADY FIGHTING

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.100
THE FIRE.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:45.930
DO WE RUN THE RISK OF STRETCHING

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:46.340
THE RESOURCES TO THEN?

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:51.110
IT IS ONLY AUGUST.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.200
ONE OF THE LUCKY THINGS

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.810
WE

00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:54.900
HAVE WORKING IN OUR FAVOR THIS

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:55.440
YEAR IS THAT GOVERNOR BROWN

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.270
SIGNED A DROUGHT STATE OF

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.850
EMERGENCY LAST YEAR, GIVING US

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:02.090
ADDITIONAL FIREFIGHTERS AND

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:02.710
RESOURCES TO RESPOND TO THE

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:02.980
INCREASE IN FIRES BECAUSE OF THE

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.980
DROUGHT.

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:08.560
THAT HAS GIVEN US MORE PERSONNEL

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:08.920
TO BE ABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THIS

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.600
DEMANDING PACE.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.130
HISTORICALLY, SEPTEMBER AND

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.370
OCTOBER IS WHEN WE SEE THE

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:16.160
LARGEST DAMAGING WILDFIRES,

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:18.980
THAT'S WHY WE ARE ASKING THE

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.700
PUBLIC TO HELP

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:22.230
PREVENT SPARKING

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:24.700
FIRES IN THE FIRST PLACE.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.200
90% OF FIRES ARE STARTED BY THE

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.240
PUBLIC SPARKING FIRES.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:29.440
ONE LESS SPARK MEANS ONE LESS

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:29.910
FIRE.
