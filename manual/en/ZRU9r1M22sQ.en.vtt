Hello my name is Joanne Gray and I’m the
Associate Dean: Teaching and Learning, here

00:00:09.201 --> 00:00:10.480
in the Faculty of Health.

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.051
I want to talk to you a little bit about our
commitment to simulation in learning, here

00:00:14.051 --> 00:00:18.840
in the faculty, and also about the experiences
you’re going to have as a student here with

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.560
us during your studies in the Bachelor of
Nursing.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.650
In the faculty we’ve been committed to engaging
in simulation in education since around 2006,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.119
and during this period of time we have developed
and invested in state of the art learning

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.030
facilities here at both the Kuring-Gai campus
and also on our city campus.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:41.480
In first year you will be involved in simulations
in both your first and second semester and

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.870
these will vary across those semesters.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.730
These experiences will engage every single
student in their studies at the same time.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.980
So it’s a wonderful opportunity for you
to work not only with your tutors but also

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.809
with your fellow students.

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.110
In second year you will again be engaged in
simulation in learning and that will be around

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:06.869
mental health studies, also with paediatric
nursing and in your medical surgical area

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:11.479
as well, particularly around learning for
example resuscitation of a patient.

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.749
So there are many examples of simulation that
we will be introducing you too during the

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:17.619
three years of your studies.

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:21.350
In the third year of your Bachelor of Nursing
program you will be engaged in a simulation

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.820
around hearing voices in your mental health
subject, and in your perioperative subject

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.399
for example, you will be engaged in preparing
patients for theatre and understanding the

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.070
deteriorating patient.

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.070
So for example when you go out into practice
you will have already started to feel comfortable

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:37.810
about how to communicate with a patient.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.590
You will feel comfortable wearing your uniform
when you go out into practice.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.039
You will have an understanding of the importance
of how you approach a patient and how you

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:47.149
establish that relationship with them.

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:51.310
You’re simulation activities will also enable
you to understand the importance of teamwork

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:53.270
and effective communication.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.279
By working here in the clinical laboratories
and practicing these skills before you go

00:01:57.279 --> 00:02:02.020
out into you clinical practice area, you’ll
understand the importance of communication

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.959
within a team and the importance of communication
also with your patients and the other members

00:02:06.959 --> 00:02:07.750
of the healthcare team.
