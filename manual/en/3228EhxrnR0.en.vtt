00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.550
What’s up Insiders?

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:05.569
Pokemon Insider here back with another Pokemon
Trivia video.

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.160
Since I so horribly forgot about Looker in
my previous trivia video, I am going to be

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.629
covering all of his appearances throughout
the Pokemon series.

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:16.700
Thanks for watching and let’s get started.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.920
Before I continue in this video, I would like
to state that I will be revealing big plot

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.790
points in several Pokemon games, so if you
don’t want to hear them, I would recommend

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:26.040
clicking off.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.250
Now let’s get going.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.720
Looker was first introduced in Pokemon Platinum
version as a member of the international police.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.090
We never get to learn his real name because
Looker is just his code name.

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:42.329
So, in Platinum he is first met in Jubilife
City where he gives the player the VS recorder.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.989
Looker appears basically everywhere Team Galactic
is present in Platinum such as the Valley

00:00:46.989 --> 00:00:51.310
Windworks, the Eterna City base, and the Galactic
base in Veilstone.

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:54.930
Throughout the story, Looker helps the player
out by giving you items and advice to help

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.550
the player advance in the game.

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.130
Looker’s second appearance in the Pokemon
series is in Pokemon Black and White.

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.900
After defeating Ghetsis in the Pokemon League,
when you go downstairs, Looker will be in

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.479
your house with your mother asking you to
help him catch the remaining 7 sages.

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.520
Along with this, Looker will give you a super
rod.

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.500
Probably Looker’s biggest appearance in
the Pokemon games is his role in Pokemon X

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.240
and Y’s Postgame which is named after him.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.709
The Looker Chapters begin when you go to Lumiose
City after upgrading your mega ring when you

00:01:23.709 --> 00:01:26.890
receive a call on the Holo Caster from Looker.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.750
After collecting some tickets throughout Lumiose
City, Looker recruits you as an apprentice,

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.570
and the two of you go on missions for a while.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.100
During this event, you meet a girl named Emma
and her Espurr living in the streets who Looker

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.100
houses.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.579
Emma gets a job because she felt bad about
not paying her way and ends up getting involved

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.969
in the reason why Looker was in Kalos in the
first place.

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:51.990
After capturing Xerosic, Looker leaves Kalos,
and it was a really emotional moment.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.109
In Pokemon Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire,
Looker can be found in the Battle Resort on

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:57.109
the beach.

00:01:57.109 --> 00:02:01.509
He has no memory of who he is, but he is holding
and Audinite which he gives to you.

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.759
This leads into the next appearance, which
is in Pokemon Red and Blue, that’s right

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:06.770
Red and Blue.

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.170
There is a man on the SS Anne who says he
is from the International Police, just like

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.170
Looker.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.540
Now I do not claim to have come up with this.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.909
All credit for this theory goes to my friend
Ovi.

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:22.420
So, Pokemon Red and Blue and Omega Ruby and
Alpha Sapphire occur at roughly the same time.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.490
We never get to see where the SS Anne goes,
and we never get to see it return.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.450
It is more than possible that Looker is the
member of the international police on the

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.540
SS Anne, and he ended up on the beach on the
Battle Resort because the SS Anne either crashed

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:37.099
or he fell off.

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.290
If you want to hear the full theory, you should
check out Ovi’s video on the subject.

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.680
Those are all the appearances of Looker throughout
Pokemon so far.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.750
If you have anything to add, let me know in
the comment section.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.959
