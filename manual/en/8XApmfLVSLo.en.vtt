Welcome to nishamadhulika.com

00:00:06.657 --> 00:00:11.538
Today we will prepare Aloo Puri which is different in taste and soft.

00:00:11.901 --> 00:00:18.706
Let us see what are the ingredients required to prepare Aloo Puri.

00:00:19.424 --> 00:00:20.908
Wheat flour - 2 Cups.

00:00:21.427 --> 00:00:22.935
 Bolied potatoes - 2

00:00:23.563 --> 00:00:25.008
 Salt - 1/2 tsp.

00:00:25.526 --> 00:00:27.613
 Ajjwain(carom seeds) - 1/4 tsp.

00:00:28.227 --> 00:00:35.105
We will prepare the dough  first with the flour and follow by grating the potatoes.

00:00:35.371 --> 00:00:55.174
Peel potatoes and grate. 

00:01:08.286 --> 00:01:30.061
Mix grated potatoes with flour, salt and ajjwain(crushing helps in bringing more flavour).

00:01:36.188 --> 00:01:40.538
Add little water to the mixture accordingly and knead to prepare a hard dough for puri.

00:02:12.162 --> 00:02:27.082
Pour 1 teaspoonful oil to the dough and knead again until it gets soft.

00:02:33.233 --> 00:02:38.984
Then cover it and keep aside for 15-20 mins.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.398
This will ferment the flour and will be ready to cook.

00:02:48.702 --> 00:02:52.329
Knead it some more till it gets smooth.

00:02:55.645 --> 00:02:59.717
Turn on the gas and heat oil in pan.

00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:25.612
Make small balls out of the dough as per the desired size of puri and then flatten.

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:59.329
Roll the dough pieces with the help of a rolling pin and apply some oil on the board.

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:19.675
Puris should not be very thin. Roll them into a circle of diameter 3-4 inches.

00:04:27.314 --> 00:04:45.912
Put the rolled puris into the heated oil. Press these lightly with a frying ladle.

00:04:54.915 --> 00:04:56.462
Repeat with the other Puri also.

00:05:12.592 --> 00:05:18.356
Once the puri turns brown on both sides,take it out of pan.

00:05:45.603 --> 00:05:51.592
Aloo puri is now prepared.  We have made 20 puris out of 2 cups of wheat flour.

00:05:52.174 --> 00:05:57.534
These puris are awesome in taste and do not require a curry along to eat.

00:05:57.615 --> 00:06:00.361
It can be served with chutney and pickle.

00:06:00.937 --> 00:06:07.140
