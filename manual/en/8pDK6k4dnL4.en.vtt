00:00:05.776 --> 00:00:07.065
I'm not gonna dress it up.

00:00:09.484 --> 00:00:10.834
Turkeys are dumb.

00:00:11.547 --> 00:00:12.446
Really dumb.

00:00:12.612 --> 00:00:15.324
You don't get it!
They're fatting us up to eat us!

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:17.117
- Hey! Corn!
- Corn!

00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:19.916
See you later, Reggie.

00:00:20.264 --> 00:00:22.390
From the academy award winning
producer of Shrek

00:00:22.515 --> 00:00:25.501
We came to this farm for my favorite
presidential tradition.

00:00:26.292 --> 00:00:28.295
Pardoning the Thanksgiving turkey.

00:00:28.628 --> 00:00:30.631
And the director
of "Horton Hears A Who!".

00:00:30.797 --> 00:00:32.299
Don't worry, you're safe.

00:00:32.783 --> 00:00:33.983
I'm tired now.

00:00:34.348 --> 00:00:35.886
This is your new home!

00:00:37.053 --> 00:00:37.763
Pizza!

00:00:41.557 --> 00:00:42.768
Does it get any better

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:43.935
than this?

00:00:44.804 --> 00:00:45.771
Hello, soldier.

00:00:47.438 --> 00:00:49.483
Whatever you do, do not make a sound.

00:00:52.191 --> 00:00:55.091
You've been recruited
for a top secret mission.

00:00:55.421 --> 00:00:56.753
What are you talking about?

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.373
We're going back in time
to the first Thanksgiving

00:01:00.498 --> 00:01:02.526
to get turkeys off the menu!

00:01:02.922 --> 00:01:05.249
- Who are you talking to?
- This guy, right here.

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:08.210
He totally gets it.
Look. See how he's nodding?

00:01:10.086 --> 00:01:10.780
A map!

00:01:11.045 --> 00:01:13.261
They aren't gonna just write
"Time machine" on the...

00:01:13.585 --> 00:01:14.716
Of course, they are.

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:19.137
- Control, we have a contaminant.
- Copy that. What type of agent?

00:01:19.991 --> 00:01:21.473
Turkey, sir. How do we address it?

00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:23.392
With cranberry sauce!

00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:26.979
But seriously?

00:01:28.981 --> 00:01:29.797
Let's go!

00:01:31.107 --> 00:01:32.359
Wait, wait, wait!

00:01:32.525 --> 00:01:34.570
Take us to the first Thanksgiving.

00:01:38.156 --> 00:01:40.450
Our mission is not
to save ten turkeys...

00:01:40.616 --> 00:01:42.786
- Welcome to our home.
- ... but all of them.

00:01:44.537 --> 00:01:46.856
She wants you to throw up
some worms into her mouth.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:48.333
What?

00:01:51.335 --> 00:01:53.130
I will get those birds.

00:01:53.296 --> 00:01:54.922
Every last one of them!

00:01:56.653 --> 00:01:57.675
Enemy approaching.

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.469
You must follow me blindly!

00:02:02.472 --> 00:02:03.432
For the flock!

00:02:05.858 --> 00:02:07.305
What's your plan for getting in?

00:02:07.602 --> 00:02:10.564
I'll use my incredibly toned pecks and
buttocks to throw you over the wall.

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:11.398
Go!

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:14.119
Funny, right?

00:02:17.278 --> 00:02:19.364
I'm sick of you throwing me around.
You see this line?

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:21.994
Do not come into my personal space!

00:02:22.745 --> 00:02:25.704
Did you not see the line?
Because I was pretty clear....

00:02:29.732 --> 00:02:32.671
