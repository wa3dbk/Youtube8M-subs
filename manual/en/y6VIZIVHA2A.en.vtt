00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.289
We live in a zombie obsessed world now.

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.160
Everything that can be about zombies, finds
a way to put zombies in it.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:39.850
The biggest tv shows, movies, and of course
videogames are just zombies, zombies, zombies.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.550
And with videogames, some genres make more
sense with zombies than others.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.180
Shooters and horror games, yeah, bring on
the zombies.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.550
But when you are finding strategy games that
are focused on zombies, it might be a little

00:00:53.550 --> 00:01:00.780
too much.

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.210
And that is what you have with Zombie Tycoon
2, a real time strategy game where you command

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:22.400
an army of zombies, because zombies are so
good at following orders besides eat brains.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:28.080
You take control of a gas-mask wearing mad
scientist commander, Brainhov, who reminds

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.330
me a little too much of Psycho Mantis.

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:34.229
And as the title of the game suggests, he
is out for revenge.

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:40.479
He has his formula and his ever growing army
of the undead and with them, he will get it.

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.700
For the most part of the game, you play as
this mad scientist.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.270
You will issue commands to your legions of
zombies, having them attack and defend and

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.310
gather.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:50.600
All for your benefit.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:56.820
The zombies each have different jobs or roles,
and creating zombies of different roles will

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.340
be needed to accomplish some tasks.

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:04.310
Some are better at attacking, like the samurai
zombies, while others are more suited for

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.920
building and puzzles, like the engineers.

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:11.989
Learning the benefits of each class is essential
to success and domination.

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:14.540
The gameplay is that of a modified RTS.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.400
You command the zombies, telling them where
to go and what to accomplish.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.890
Normally you will move as a caravan, until
some obstacle comes in your way and you have

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:26.739
to send out the zombies to fix it and continue.

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:33.030
You need to protect your portable Brainhov,
as zombies will regenerate and be reborn,

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.969
as the undead, if that makes sense.

00:02:37.969 --> 00:02:49.019
You will lose many brave zombies, as the enemies
can do damage.

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.239
While this is basic principles, sometimes
the tasks can feel more mundane than interesting.

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:00.030
You wonï¿½t always understand the task or
the reason, but thankfully there are arrows

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.150
and easy identifies.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.960
But the game makes up for this with a good
sense of humor, which really goes a long way.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.990
It seems the zombie craze is not going anywhere,
and with games like Zombie Tycoon 2, it may

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.459
not be that bad of a thing.

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:18.310
It is not the best or most interesting, but
it is entertaining and fun.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.840
Fair enough.
