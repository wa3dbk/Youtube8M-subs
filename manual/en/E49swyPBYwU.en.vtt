00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.820
Hi guys, here you see a Rex
Rs 450 CDI, a CDI ignition unit that is

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:13.880
the one with the blue cable where you have to
watch out, there are 2 ignition units, that

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:26.650
Here's an original Rex RS450 that needs it
DC and AC, ok, that needs

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.880
DC and AC, but there are also
pure alternating current CDIs. I have one

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:40.539
Plan and the following, the CDI,
as you see it here with the jacks

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:45.809
is connected as follows, the first pin
here is the Absteller, the second is the

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.159
100 to 200 volts coil in the alternator
sitting under the pole, then here is the

00:00:52.159 --> 00:00:57.390
Ignition coil connected, since the pickup, there
12 volts must be applied via the ignition

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.899
be switched and there mass and here lies
Mass at the booth is ground if

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.620
the scooter is out, there must be 12 volts
when he is on. We can do that with us

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:13.920
now measure the multimeter and we
can measure the 100 - 200 volt coil

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.150
from here to mass, we can the
Ignition coil from there to mass and

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:24.070
we can measure the pickup from there
on mass, then this would be the occupancy

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:31.450
from a standard, from a standard CDI,
so if you want to rebuild the CDI here, the

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.420
Scooter with such a CDI on a standard
CDI then you would have to make mass out

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.280
make the plug and the +12 volt out,
it does not need the +12 volt, and the mass

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.909
clasp on the lower and that is then
not proven, if you infect both then

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.900
Does that make a short circuit or when you do
just plugging another CDI does that

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.030
also a short circuit, because the CDI can break
go and mostly the fuse will fly, though

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:03.600
one has then bridged the fuse, yes,
the CDI breaks down. Then here I have the

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:11.610
Circuit again from the Rex RS 450 CDI with
the blue cable, and the first one is the one

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.760
Absteller, and I have here now, that
the ignition would be such that the engine is on

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:24.430
engine is on, the parking is open,
then the +12 volt ignition are closed

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.480
to +12 volts then to the ignition coil, there is
a coil to ground, ok that's still

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.060
over the sidestand switch and such,
then the 100 - 200 volt coil that is the

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.680
here is the pole wheel and the pickup, the
Pickup also coil on earth. And you can

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.480
we simply measure it with the multimeter
we can measure the pickup coil, the 100-200

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:53.159
Volt coil and the ignition coil and then you can
we check if +12 volt is present here

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.110
the ignition is on when the ignition is off
is not the 12 volts when the ignition

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:03.569
is off we can check if the Absteller
is on ground or if the ignition is on

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:08.290
is that the stater is open and not
lies on earth. I start and measure,

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.580
I put all the plugs out and
Mass of mass on pickup, mass on pickup

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:20.519
in the ohm range 2 kilo ohms and there I have
149 ohms, so 150 ohms, that must be something

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.370
so be between 120 and 300 ohms then it is
the pickup ok, if it is much smaller now

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:34.200
than 120 ohms then the pickup is broken, pickup
150 ohms from ground to pickup line. Then

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.560
If it continues, we measure the generator
Winding, the generator winding is from ground

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:50.590
on the second plug ignition coil, that is
top right so from here from the top right

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.609
big plug on top right here,
However, the cable does not measure at the CDI

00:03:56.609 --> 00:04:01.819
but on the cable contacts. Ok, at 100-200
Volt supply there we measure at 2 kilohms

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:10.269
Range 403 ohms, so from here on,
from one plug ground to another plug

00:04:10.269 --> 00:04:15.199
Generator coil, 403 ohms is ok, that can
can be a few hundred ohms, but it can

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:20.640
also be 1 kilo ohms, 403 ohms with a Rex
RS 450 Roller, if I have the second pin

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:26.750
take here then I have 0 ohms because the ignition
Yes, I have to turn on the ignition

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:33.900
set to infinite ohms, ignition
Ohm, ok, turn off again

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:41.040
0 ohm, because the pin is here on earth, ok
now we have measured pickup then

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:53.120
we measured the ignition coil and the circuit breaker
So now we measured the 3 things,

00:04:53.120 --> 00:05:00.410
once the pickup here from here on earth
with ohm measurement then the 100-200 volts coil

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:07.230
on earth and once the breaker on earth,
if the ignition is off then here must be

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.840
So on mass are 0 and if the ignition
On is then that must be open so infinite

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.813
Ohm at the supper. Okay, what's missing now
is the ignition coil we need the side stand

00:05:17.813 --> 00:05:23.661
fold in and then from ignition coil to ground
measure, must also be passage. ok, ignition coil

00:05:23.661 --> 00:05:31.360
on mass we also measure 0 ohms, 1 ohms, 0
Ohm yes ok then the ignition coil, the circuit

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:38.180
also closed, that was now ignition coil
on earth, this was the one here, the pin

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:44.930
here, the ignition coil pin to ground and if
that everything is excluded that all

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:55.251
works, so the high voltage coil
400 ohms, the pickup has 150 ohms, ignition coil

00:05:55.251 --> 00:06:02.710
on earth then really from the ignition coil
is the staffer is on we need

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:08.860
just check if there are 12 volts here,
that means mass to 12 volts, this time in tension

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:17.080
Measuring range so we put to volt measurement
then we go to 20 volts and now have to

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:23.470
we measure from mass to 12 volts. Okay, there
First we do not measure anything because the ignition

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:28.310
is out, we turn the ignition on and off
if the ignition is on then you have to go here

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:34.220
11 12 volts applied when ignition is on,
okay and so they can do that

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.270
Switch off ignition again, then have good
we measured everything and if that's all right

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:45.700
and there is still no spark since then
the CDI is broken, only then. Now attention,

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:51.780
very important and indeed if we have a standard
CDI then we need the ground cable

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:57.590
stake out the top then the bottom cable
stake out here and the cable in here

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:04.530
was stuck in there and the cable was gone
then we can also have a standard

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:10.250
Use CDI as they are in Ebay so without
the cable, then it would work too

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:16.861
because we do not need the +12 volt, so
the +12 volt here, the cable here the 12 volt

00:07:16.861 --> 00:07:22.760
have to go and this must go out there and
there you are put in and out you get

00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:27.060
the whole thing by having a component Beinchen
or so or a long pen in here

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:29.391
go up there, drive in there and then
attracts.
