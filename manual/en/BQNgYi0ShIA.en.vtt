00:00:17.751 --> 00:00:22.480
We're driving the new Peugeot 208,
successor of the Peugeot 207.

00:00:22.481 --> 00:00:27.045
The car might not sound very exciting, but
it may turn out more fun than you imagine.

00:00:27.046 --> 00:00:34.516
Whilst designing this car Peugeot tried to downsize this
car, specifically on terms of his exterior sizes and weight.

00:00:34.517 --> 00:00:39.629
In contrast to all other brands, who make their cars
bigger in order to generate more space,...

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:44.692
... Peugeot wanted to make the car smaller
but still create more interior space.

00:00:44.693 --> 00:00:45.900
They achieved to do so.

00:00:45.901 --> 00:00:54.076
The 208 is much lighter than the 207, it's been reduced by 170 kg's (374 lbs)
with some versions and an average of 110 kg (242 lbs) on all versions.

00:00:54.077 --> 00:01:00.218
The lose in weight is noticeable, the steering
is much more joyful than with the previous version.

00:01:00.219 --> 00:01:05.597
This is also induced by the small steering wheel, something
Peugeot introduced with a reason.

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:11.873
They wanted to place the instruments a little higher, which resulted
in the fact that you can't see them because of the steering wheel.

00:01:11.874 --> 00:01:13.643
That's why they reduced the size of the steering wheel.

00:01:13.644 --> 00:01:20.621
But it also contributes to the fun of driving because the wheel is
smaller, more sporty and the steering is more stern.

00:01:20.622 --> 00:01:27.128
This gives you feeling you can really cut corners
and play with the car.

00:01:27.129 --> 00:01:37.041
The reduction in size therefore enhanced the pleasure of
driving and the feeling of involvement in driving this car.

00:01:37.042 --> 00:01:42.549
My foreign colleagues clearly did the same thing.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:51.118
It has driven just under 3000 km (1900 miles) and
has all sorts of noises and rattles.

00:01:52.053 --> 00:01:56.490
Might be the newness of the car,
but it's rather annoying.

00:01:56.491 --> 00:01:58.309
Let put it at rather French.

00:02:10.098 --> 00:02:13.600
We're driving a 1.6 E HDi, a diesel.

00:02:14.087 --> 00:02:16.572
This is engine is also placed in CitroÃ«ns.

00:02:16.573 --> 00:02:24.386
It's got 115 bhp and with this version, the 208 Allure,
costs 21.250 Euros.

00:02:24.387 --> 00:02:29.268
But pricing of the 208 starts at around 13.000 Euros.

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:32.974
That is a gasoline car with a 1.0 engine, which is a new engine.

00:02:32.975 --> 00:02:39.484
This is a multigrain, tree hugging, environmental engine.

00:02:47.888 --> 00:02:50.988
Peugeot also put some effort into
upgrading the interior.

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.046
On terms of design they achieved this.

00:02:55.047 --> 00:02:57.741
But the usage and combinations of materials isn't quite ideal.

00:02:57.742 --> 00:03:01.096
It's got a leather steering wheel, quite nice.

00:03:02.132 --> 00:03:05.377
But together with this there's cheap plastic over here.

00:03:07.508 --> 00:03:10.352
There's elves living there or something like that.

00:03:10.353 --> 00:03:14.465
It looks ridiculous.

00:03:18.714 --> 00:03:20.577
Should you buy a 208?

00:03:21.336 --> 00:03:22.523
I think it's kind of fun.

00:03:22.524 --> 00:03:29.363
Peugeot's been very busy making the car more fun to drive 
by reducing the weight and what not.

00:03:30.135 --> 00:03:36.752
But an ordinary diesel isn't exciting so let's hope the 155 bhp
gasoline version is more fun.

00:03:37.218 --> 00:03:40.340
Maybe a 208 GTI will be released, that would
be so much fun.

00:03:40.341 --> 00:03:45.515
A 208 GTI, a light steering paradise,
how lovely.

00:03:46.991 --> 00:03:50.370
We need to be quick because we've only got
20 minutes with this car.

00:03:50.371 --> 00:03:52.260
It a new and small 3 cylinder version.

00:03:52.261 --> 00:03:54.017
It's a 1 litre VTi.

00:03:55.026 --> 00:03:58.390
It's a environmental supercar which costs around 13.000 Euros.

00:03:58.391 --> 00:04:00.325
The fun part is that it's a 3 cylinder.

00:04:00.326 --> 00:04:01.926
It's got a boxer-like sound.

00:04:15.499 --> 00:04:20.946
Just imagine you can drive a 3 cylinder gasoline car
for just 13.000 Euros.

00:04:21.477 --> 00:04:24.946
It will give you a lot of fun and produces a
sweet sound too.

00:04:24.947 --> 00:04:29.439
And it's more response to throttle than the 1.4 gasoline,
which we've also driven.

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:37.310
If you need to pick a lease-car of a small second car,
than this car is a good option.

00:04:37.311 --> 00:04:41.529
It gives you a lot of fun for a few bucks.

00:04:45.995 --> 00:04:48.854
This is going to be the ultimate rental.

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:54.616
When you pick up this car at your rental you
might find it boring at first.

00:04:54.617 --> 00:04:56.937
But this will change into fun when
you drive it.

00:04:56.938 --> 00:05:00.600
A fun car, good steering, nice sounds,
just great.
