Hi, my name is Windy, and this is how to play
Skip-Bo. Skip-Bo is a two to six person game,

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:16.590
that is sort of like a competitive solitaire.
Everyone is dealt out thirty cards, from their

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.300
deck. If you have more than four people, you
only deal out twenty. After it's been dealt

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:30.190
out, you put the remainder of the deck in
between the players, and that's the draw.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:35.679
I've placed empty cards here, to show you
where the card playing slots would be, but

00:00:35.679 --> 00:00:41.550
when you play the game, you won't be putting
empty cards out. First, you draw five cards

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:49.899
from the deck. The thirty cards that were
dealt to you, are your stockpile. The goal

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:55.670
of the game, is to get rid of your stockpile
before anyone else, so when you start your

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:06.350
turn, you turn over the first card on your
stockpile. This is a six. Skip-Bo has numbered

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.060
cards from one to twelve, and special Skip-Bo
cards, which are wild cards. There will be

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:21.520
four slots in between the two players, that
are for stockpiling. You can only start a

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:27.240
slot, if it's with a number one, or a Skip-Bo.
When you play the Skip-Bo, you announce what

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.770
number you wish it to be, and then play, as
though you had played that number, so this

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:42.869
is a six, I say. Six, seven, eight, nine,
ten, and so forth, up until twelve. Once you've

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:48.420
reached twelve, either from starting with
a natural one, or with a Skip-Bo, then the

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.180
card pile is taken away, and there's a new
slot open, to start a new stockpile. If you

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:01.319
run out of draw cards, you can just shuffle
in the completed stockpile of cards, and keep

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:07.870
drawing, so you may play, as long as you can
play on one of these four piles, a sequential

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:17.440
number. You can play either out of your hand,
or off the top of your stockpile, or off your

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.070
discard piles, if you have cards that you
can play. If you run out of cards, and you

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:31.310
manage to do successful stockpiles with them,
and your last turn you already played one,

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.860
you can draw. You can keep drawing until you
can no longer place a card, then your turn

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.940
is done. At the end of your turn, you must
discard one card in your hand. It goes into

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:50.470
one of four slots, on your discard table.
Originally, you start with no cards, so you

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:57.180
can have up to four open, and after the fourth
one, you start placing your discards on top

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.690
of other cards, but the only cards that are
available for play, are the ones whose face

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:10.060
is up, so you continue in this manner, and
anyone can play onto the center stockpile

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.960
cards, and you play up until twelve, and then
you remove it, and you keep going, until someone

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:21.500
has run out of their stockpile, so even though
you want to use your discard piles, really,

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:28.300
the strategy is to get rid of your stockpile
card, the most. You're aiming to get the stockpiles

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:35.590
in the middle, to a point where you could
use your stockpile. card. You continue until

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:39.900
you've run out of cards,and then you win,
and that's how you play Skip-Bo.
