00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.010
[President Obama] Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Marlene Riklon.

00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:08.030
Where's Marlene? Right over here. Come on over here.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:12.040
Less then 24 hours after

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.050
the devastating earthquake in Haiti

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.050
she was on the scene helping direct aid and save lives

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.550
in the midst of chaos.  And today we honor her incredible

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:32.630
dedication. [applause]

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.660
These American patriots, all the services that are represented

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.680
up here today. All of you who out there today

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.690
you're the reason why America and our Armed Forces remain

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.690
the greatest force for peace and security that the world has

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.720
ever known. And together you're standing with all of those around the world

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:56.750
who are reaching for the same freedoms and the same

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.770
liberties that we celebrate today. So I just want to close by saying

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.790
thank you. You've done everything we could have asked of you.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.790
Your families have served alongside of you with

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.830
strength and devotion. America is proud of all

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.850
of you. And as long as I have the privilege as serving as your commander-in-chief

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.870
I'm going to make sure that you have the support that you need in the field.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.890
I'm going to make sure you get the care when you come home.

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.900
And with the help of Michelle and Dr. Joe Biden, we will make

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.900
sure America takes care of your families and recognizes the

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.930
extraordinary sacrifices that they are making. This day is possible

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.950
because of your service and so I think it's only appropriate

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.960
that we give you a chance to celebrate it together as well.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:48.970
God bless you. God bless the United States of America and happy Fourth of July everybody.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:02:01.650
Thank you.
