00:00:09.786 --> 00:00:10.552
Hi!

00:00:11.068 --> 00:00:13.374
Today's Inmuno Pill is dedicated

00:00:13.533 --> 00:00:17.050
to the consequences of activating the complement
by any of its routes

00:00:17.558 --> 00:00:20.925
and it is what we call
the lytic or the common lytic route.

00:00:21.486 --> 00:00:24.818
I remind you that the Complement System
can be activated in three ways:

00:00:25.074 --> 00:00:29.560
the Classic, Lectin
or Alternative pathways.

00:00:29.721 --> 00:00:32.706
And I remind you that the only adaptive tool
of these activations

00:00:32.826 --> 00:00:34.632
is the Classic way.

00:00:35.035 --> 00:00:37.473
Both the Lectin pathway
and the Alternative pathway

00:00:37.593 --> 00:00:41.121
are innate elements or tools
of the immune response.

00:00:41.812 --> 00:00:44.537
These three pathways,
however activated,

00:00:44.689 --> 00:00:48.987
had a central and common step,
which was the rupture of the C3 protein.

00:00:49.634 --> 00:00:52.007
And there were a series
of final consequences.

00:00:52.201 --> 00:00:54.138
Today we are going to study in detail
one of them

00:00:54.258 --> 00:00:56.879
which is the perforation
of the membrane of the pathogen

00:00:57.376 --> 00:01:01.700
and which is the one mediated
by this final lytic route or way.

00:01:01.984 --> 00:01:05.899
In addition, inflammatory cells
were attracted to the area

00:01:06.019 --> 00:01:10.203
and the pathogen was coated
by fragments of the complement

00:01:10.508 --> 00:01:14.584
called opsonization,
which is going to favour phagocytosis.

00:01:14.807 --> 00:01:19.974
All this leads to the ultimate purpose
of killing or lysing this pathogen.

00:01:20.407 --> 00:01:24.663
Let's see now, in detail, the lytic pathway
of the Complement System.

00:01:26.744 --> 00:01:31.908
The Lytic pathway, the Complement System,
involves five proteins

00:01:32.048 --> 00:01:35.971
that are called factors
C5, C6, C7, C8 and C9,

00:01:36.091 --> 00:01:40.353
and that, for your luck and mine,
participate in this order,

00:01:40.473 --> 00:01:41.899
not as on other occasions.

00:01:42.596 --> 00:01:44.233
In order for this pathway
to be started,

00:01:44.353 --> 00:01:46.881
a previous enzyme
must have been formed.

00:01:47.001 --> 00:01:49.652
We have seen it
in the other three activation pathways.

00:01:50.007 --> 00:01:53.026
This previous pathway
is called C5 convertase

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.270
and I remind you that there are
two types of C5 convertase:

00:01:56.691 --> 00:02:01.094
one, formed when the complement was activated
by the classical pathway, and the other, by the Lectin

00:02:01.214 --> 00:02:05.440
that has the large fragment of C4,
the C2 and C3

00:02:05.806 --> 00:02:07.829
and the convertase of C5

00:02:07.949 --> 00:02:11.224
that was formed exclusively
by the Alternative pathway

00:02:11.414 --> 00:02:14.987
and that had two doses
of the large fragment of C3

00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:18.471
and one dose of the big fragment of factor B.

00:02:18.613 --> 00:02:21.604
Here, on the bacterial wall,
we have them drawn.

00:02:22.321 --> 00:02:24.582
These convertases,
as their name indicates,

00:02:24.728 --> 00:02:29.255
will act on C5,
and they are going to hydrolyze it in two fragments

00:02:29.436 --> 00:02:32.372
as it has always happened until now
in the Complement waterfall,

00:02:32.561 --> 00:02:36.759
the large fragment will be called B,
the small fragment will be called A.

00:02:37.008 --> 00:02:39.720
I have to tell you at this point
that fragment A, C5A

00:02:39.955 --> 00:02:44.021
is the most potent anaphylotoxin
in the Complement System

00:02:44.156 --> 00:02:46.960
and I want also to tell you
that the large fragment or B,

00:02:47.482 --> 00:02:49.840
when it binds to the membrane,
it does not do it alone:

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.665
in the path of the deposit
on the wall of the pathogen,

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.173
C6 and C7 factors will be joined to it.

00:02:56.532 --> 00:02:58.757
So what is deposited
on the pathogen

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.087
is this trimolecular complex.

00:03:01.418 --> 00:03:05.846
Once deposited,
the following factor is added: C8 factor,

00:03:06.041 --> 00:03:07.482
which is the first protein

00:03:07.582 --> 00:03:10.085
to physically drill the bacterial wall.

00:03:11.127 --> 00:03:15.408
Finally, the C9 factor binds
to these four previous proteins

00:03:15.638 --> 00:03:20.101
and also polymerizes on itself
an indeterminate number of times

00:03:20.423 --> 00:03:24.538
to form this structure in barrel,

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.708
or, let's say, in a well

00:03:26.863 --> 00:03:29.663
that will allow
the free circulation of liquids

00:03:29.783 --> 00:03:32.498
between the inside
and the outside of the bacterium.

00:03:33.222 --> 00:03:35.384
Therefore, this will finally produce

00:03:35.518 --> 00:03:37.349
an osmotic shock in the bacterium.

00:03:37.721 --> 00:03:42.384
You have here, in the pictures below
taken with the scanning microscope,

00:03:42.578 --> 00:03:45.709
the structure of these pores or wells

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:47.543
on the surface of the bacteria

00:03:47.658 --> 00:03:50.440
and here we have a cut
where you can see perfectly

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:53.823
that there is free circulation
between the internal and external environment.

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:57.727
But as on other occasions,
and to understand it better

00:03:57.922 --> 00:04:00.229
we will see all this
with an animation.

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:06.016
The Lytic pathway is therefore started
with the convertases of C5

00:04:06.136 --> 00:04:07.927
from any of the other routes.

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:09.660
C5 is the last rupture,

00:04:09.826 --> 00:04:12.420
C5A is anaphylotoxin,
as I told you,

00:04:12.584 --> 00:04:17.153
and C5B is deposited
with the help of C6 and C7 on the wall.

00:04:17.553 --> 00:04:21.362
C8 physically perforates
this bacterial membrane

00:04:21.526 --> 00:04:25.729
and C9 by polymerizing
an undetermined number of times

00:04:26.007 --> 00:04:29.518
forms this pore,
which will allow free circulation

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.213
between the inside and outside.

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:33.991
In all this set of proteins,

00:04:34.111 --> 00:04:41.225
i.e. the large fragment of C5, C6, C7, C8
and n times C9

00:04:41.647 --> 00:04:45.875
is known as MAC
or Membrane Attack Complex.

00:04:50.258 --> 00:04:53.796
So if we recapitulate a little
what has happened with the Complement,

00:04:53.916 --> 00:04:58.537
it has been possible to activate it by the Classic way
with a series of factors

00:04:58.709 --> 00:05:00.395
participating,
by means of the Lectins

00:05:00.731 --> 00:05:05.401
sharing C2 and C4 with the Classic way
but with new starting factors

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.278
and by means of the Alternative way
in which the sterile thiol bond of C3 is key.

00:05:10.701 --> 00:05:15.713
But I remind you that the central step
is the hydrolysis of the C factor.

00:05:16.471 --> 00:05:21.264
We have just seen what would be the terminal route
or final route of the Complement

00:05:21.384 --> 00:05:25.509
with the intervention
of C5, C6, C7, C8 and C9.

00:05:25.858 --> 00:05:28.906
This would inexorably lead
to the formation of this MAC

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.993
or Membrane Attack complex

00:05:31.348 --> 00:05:34.659
that would allow the lysis of bacteria
by osmotic shock.

00:05:35.369 --> 00:05:38.642
But what if this osmotic shock lysis
didn't occur

00:05:38.762 --> 00:05:40.666
because the bacteria was resistant?

00:05:41.046 --> 00:05:44.076
Would this whole complementary intervention
have been useless?

00:05:44.221 --> 00:05:45.029
No.

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.010
I remind you that the bacterium has been opsonized
with proteins from the complement

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.210
which will favor its later phagocytosis,
for example, by macrophage,

00:05:54.435 --> 00:05:57.988
and I remind you that anaphylotoxin factors
have been released

00:05:58.069 --> 00:05:59.860
that will attract other cells.

00:06:00.057 --> 00:06:02.720
So, what have we seen on this pill?

00:06:03.188 --> 00:06:05.847
We have reviewed the activation
of the complement

00:06:06.045 --> 00:06:08.138
by different routes
and its consequences,

00:06:08.325 --> 00:06:11.114
especially when the final route
is activated.

00:06:11.537 --> 00:06:14.694
We have seen that it starts
by the convertases of C5

00:06:14.989 --> 00:06:18.445
and we have seen
what other factors besides C5 intervene.

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.587
We have seen the formation
of the membrane attack complex

00:06:22.688 --> 00:06:23.718
also called MAC

00:06:24.025 --> 00:06:28.754
and reviewed what the effector functions
of the Complement System are.

00:06:29.032 --> 00:06:33.762
So if all these things are now clear,

00:06:34.088 --> 00:06:36.976
you should be able to answer
the following questions:

00:06:37.601 --> 00:06:40.335
How does the Lytic path
of the Complement System begin?

00:06:40.555 --> 00:06:42.445
What is the protein that pulls it out?

00:06:43.015 --> 00:06:46.018
What is the latest enzyme
in the complement cascade?

00:06:46.383 --> 00:06:47.985
Is it on this route?

00:06:48.274 --> 00:06:52.961
Which proteins form the so-called MAC
or membrane attack complex?

00:06:53.654 --> 00:06:58.165
If a pathogen is MAC-resistant,
has the activation been in vain

00:06:58.285 --> 00:07:00.098
or is there any other consequence?

00:07:00.392 --> 00:07:01.523
And, finally,

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:04.848
what effector functions
can have the opsonins

00:07:04.968 --> 00:07:07.197
deposited on the pathogen

00:07:07.317 --> 00:07:10.092
or the anaphylotoxins
that have been released into the environment?

00:07:10.751 --> 00:07:12.237
And you know,
as I always tell you,

00:07:12.548 --> 00:07:14.431
until these questions are clear,

00:07:14.641 --> 00:07:17.716
you should not move on
to the next pill of the Complement.

00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:19.086
See you soon!
