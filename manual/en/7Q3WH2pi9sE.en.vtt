00:00:00.167 --> 00:00:03.069
(upbeat music)

00:00:04.838 --> 00:00:05.939
- [Nikki] Today we're making this drink

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:07.441
based on the Incredible Hulk from the

00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:09.710
new Avengers movie "Age of Ultron."

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.106
- Exacamente, let's make this drink!

00:00:13.106 --> 00:00:14.542
(Nikki growls)

00:00:14.542 --> 00:00:16.450
Nikki, sugar in this bag!

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.284
- [Nikki] Yes sir!

00:00:17.284 --> 00:00:18.619
- Black food coloring.

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:20.587
- [Nikki] Where did you
find black food coloring?

00:00:20.587 --> 00:00:22.238
- I don't know homeboy, I
know people who know people

00:00:22.238 --> 00:00:23.290
who know people you know what I mean?

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:24.024
- The black market?

00:00:24.024 --> 00:00:25.558
- Suge Knight, good looking out!

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:27.628
Soaking up some corn syrup.

00:00:27.628 --> 00:00:29.596
With the little toxic sign.

00:00:29.596 --> 00:00:30.697
Got these on Amazon.

00:00:30.697 --> 00:00:31.765
The link's in the description.

00:00:31.765 --> 00:00:33.500
Get it nice and thick on there.

00:00:33.834 --> 00:00:35.335
- [Nikki] Nice and thick.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.904
- [Skyy] Nice and light.

00:00:39.628 --> 00:00:40.474
(Skyy play screams)

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:43.444
- Is that what you think sex is?

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:47.080
Oh God, that's definitely not it.

00:00:47.882 --> 00:00:49.116
- What's my name?!

00:00:49.116 --> 00:00:50.538
That's right, that's right!

00:00:50.538 --> 00:00:52.018
- Skyy why are you still single?

00:00:52.486 --> 00:00:53.087
- Huh?

00:00:53.087 --> 00:00:54.122
- Why are you still single?

00:00:54.122 --> 00:00:55.156
- I'm still searching for the right girl.

00:00:55.156 --> 00:00:56.857
That understands me, that gets me.

00:00:56.857 --> 00:00:57.691
That we connect.

00:00:57.691 --> 00:01:00.027
If we connect, please do
send your nudes on Snapchat.

00:01:00.027 --> 00:01:00.761
I'm kidding!

00:01:00.761 --> 00:01:03.097
- If you connect to that, let us know.

00:01:03.097 --> 00:01:04.799
- Okay here I go, ice!

00:01:05.566 --> 00:01:07.334
To get our purple we use some Viniq.

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:09.102
Go ahead, pour.
- [Nikki] Okay.

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:12.806
- Now, we can hit that
with some Grape Vodka.

00:01:12.806 --> 00:01:13.307
Go ahead.

00:01:13.307 --> 00:01:14.741
- Grape Vodka.

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:17.177
- Just a little splash of sprite.

00:01:17.177 --> 00:01:18.979
- [Nikki] How do you measure a spattering?

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:19.780
- I don't know, whatever
the hell that was.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:20.747
- You're just like (inaudible).

00:01:20.747 --> 00:01:22.949
- Yeah, you know like a
drizzle, like a quick pee.

00:01:22.949 --> 00:01:23.950
You know what I mean?

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.653
- Ladies, is this getting you yet?

00:01:26.653 --> 00:01:28.222
- Just think, just think.
- [Nikki] Getting warmer?

00:01:28.222 --> 00:01:29.089
- If you're starting to pee

00:01:29.089 --> 00:01:30.057
and your parents suddenly walked in

00:01:30.057 --> 00:01:31.458
and one look at you like "Hey mom?!"

00:01:31.458 --> 00:01:32.993
That kind of thing, just a little drop.

00:01:32.993 --> 00:01:34.228
- That is so sexy.
- [Skyy] Okay.

00:01:34.228 --> 00:01:37.130
- You keep it so sexy on this show Skyy.

00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:38.399
- Stomp.

00:01:39.234 --> 00:01:40.968
That's right, how come the
hulk always got purple pants,

00:01:40.968 --> 00:01:42.535
but he changes his clothes?

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.870
The weirdest shit ever.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.272
- [Nikki] Yeah he rips
his clothes every time.

00:01:45.272 --> 00:01:46.706
- Now the green.

00:01:48.042 --> 00:01:49.009
- [Nikki] That's not green.

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.310
- Vodka pour!

00:01:51.244 --> 00:01:53.046
Blue Curacao, pour!

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.816
- [Nikki] Blue Curacao.

00:01:55.583 --> 00:01:57.751
- Now we hit that with some orange juice.

00:01:58.785 --> 00:02:00.420
Hey, look at me, look at me!

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.755
- Is that the orange juice speaking?

00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:02.723
- Mmm hmm.

00:02:05.476 --> 00:02:06.760
- [Nikki] There we go.

00:02:07.928 --> 00:02:10.530
Yes, yes.

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.932
- And there you have it!

00:02:11.932 --> 00:02:13.901
The Incredible Hulk!

00:02:13.901 --> 00:02:17.270
From the new movie
"Avengers: Age of Ultron."

00:02:17.638 --> 00:02:18.540
Ready to put your lips on this one?

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.239
- Oh yes.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.203
He's angry.
- [Skyy] You ever had some

00:02:20.203 --> 00:02:21.274
- [Skyy] green up in you?

00:02:21.641 --> 00:02:22.876
- Yes, deep green.

00:02:22.876 --> 00:02:24.344
(Nikki laughs)

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:25.679
Slap it high!

00:02:26.513 --> 00:02:27.481
- That's cheesy as hell.

00:02:27.481 --> 00:02:29.215
Go ahead, put your lips on that!

00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:30.584
All right.

00:02:35.222 --> 00:02:36.156
- Mmmm.

00:02:36.156 --> 00:02:37.124
- That was the bottom.

00:02:37.124 --> 00:02:38.058
- Mmm.

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:39.860
It's like an Otter Pop.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.528
- You like it?

00:02:40.528 --> 00:02:41.361
- Yeah, it's good.

00:02:41.361 --> 00:02:43.898
- The Incredible Hulk
is angry son of a bitch!

00:02:43.898 --> 00:02:44.432
- He is.

00:02:44.432 --> 00:02:45.165
- So is Nikki.

00:02:45.165 --> 00:02:46.433
Alright.
- [Nikki] Sometimes.

00:02:46.433 --> 00:02:47.380
- [Skyy] Now you were telling me about

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.203
a couple times when you got super angry

00:02:49.203 --> 00:02:50.471
and you had to hit a guy.

00:02:50.471 --> 00:02:51.905
- Yeah, but I mean hit.

00:02:51.905 --> 00:02:54.408
But like open hand slap.

00:02:54.408 --> 00:02:55.676
- Was there force behind it?

00:02:55.676 --> 00:02:56.577
- And they deserved it.

00:02:56.577 --> 00:02:57.211
- Was there force behind it?

00:02:57.211 --> 00:02:57.911
- Oh hell yeah.

00:02:57.911 --> 00:02:59.346
- Okay, so that's a hit okay.

00:02:59.346 --> 00:03:00.247
You always try to water em down.

00:03:00.247 --> 00:03:01.648
- There was no bruising or anything.

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:04.017
And they deserved it 100%.

00:03:04.017 --> 00:03:05.185
- Okay what happened?

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:06.720
- So the first guy.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.523
Okay the cops caught
him, he's 19 years old.

00:03:09.523 --> 00:03:12.225
And they caught him with a
bunch of alcohol in his trunk.

00:03:12.225 --> 00:03:14.028
It's midnight, I'm in bed.

00:03:14.028 --> 00:03:15.195
The cops call me.

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:17.063
This motherfucker blamed it on me.

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:19.059
(Skyy stutters)
- And gave him my number.

00:03:19.059 --> 00:03:19.700
- [Skyy] Who was he?

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:20.967
- This was one of my ex- boyfriends.

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:21.848
- This is your boyfriend?!

00:03:21.848 --> 00:03:22.436
- Yeah.

00:03:22.436 --> 00:03:24.104
- So your boyfriend get
arrested and snitched?!

00:03:24.104 --> 00:03:26.306
- Yes, but it wasn't even my alcohol!

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:29.476
So he lied, and had the cops call me.

00:03:29.476 --> 00:03:31.979
And so the cop was like
"Well, your boyfriend

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:33.513
"says that this is your alcohol."

00:03:33.513 --> 00:03:35.081
And I'm like, "I don't have a boyfriend."

00:03:35.081 --> 00:03:36.550
(Skyy and Nikki laugh)

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.154
Then I went to his house and
I slapped him across the face.

00:03:39.154 --> 00:03:39.854
Yes I did.

00:03:39.854 --> 00:03:40.787
- How hard?

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:42.055
- Really fucking hard!

00:03:42.055 --> 00:03:42.870
- [Skyy] And what did he say?

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:43.657
You don't do that to people.

00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:44.257
- [Skyy] And what did he say?

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:45.292
- It's more of a wake up slap.

00:03:45.292 --> 00:03:47.227
It's like what fuck bro, you know?!

00:03:47.227 --> 00:03:48.362
- Did you break up afterwards?

00:03:48.362 --> 00:03:50.197
- Yeah, but then we got back together

00:03:50.197 --> 00:03:51.765
because I'm a fucking pussy.

00:03:51.765 --> 00:03:53.500
(Skyy laughs)

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.568
- Same guy, I found out
he was sleeping around.

00:03:55.568 --> 00:03:56.436
- Uh huh.

00:03:56.436 --> 00:03:58.538
- I showed up at his door he wasn't there.

00:03:58.538 --> 00:03:59.673
Texted him "Where are you?"

00:03:59.673 --> 00:04:00.641
He wouldn't tell me.

00:04:00.641 --> 00:04:02.309
So I told him I was pregnant,

00:04:02.847 --> 00:04:04.544
and then he told me where he was.

00:04:04.544 --> 00:04:05.879
And I slapped him across the face.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:06.846
And I was like motherfucker.

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:09.058
And then we broke up then, that day.

00:04:09.058 --> 00:04:11.685
But if you, yeah if
you call the cops on me

00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:13.486
and blame for something I didn't do,

00:04:13.486 --> 00:04:14.655
or if you--

00:04:14.655 --> 00:04:16.890
- Yo she was framed for a
crime she did not commit.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:18.192
- Or if you cheat on me--

00:04:18.192 --> 00:04:19.460
- She was cheated on!

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.928
- I will find you and I will slap you.

00:04:21.928 --> 00:04:24.298
- Oh my God you sound
like the boy from "Taken."

00:04:24.298 --> 00:04:24.998
(Nikki laughs)

00:04:24.998 --> 00:04:25.732
- If you cheat on me.

00:04:25.732 --> 00:04:26.366
- But then I'll never see them again.

00:04:26.366 --> 00:04:27.868
- Or if you blame me for
something I did not do.

00:04:27.868 --> 00:04:30.170
I will find you and I will kill you.

00:04:31.538 --> 00:04:33.373
- Maybe I am him, you don't know.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.575
The world has yet to see the worst of me.

00:04:35.575 --> 00:04:37.411
- Anyway, go check out
"The Avengers" okay?

00:04:37.411 --> 00:04:38.345
- Also check out my channel,

00:04:38.345 --> 00:04:40.147
YouTube dot com slash Nikki Limo.

00:04:40.147 --> 00:04:41.582
I make videos Monday through Friday.

00:04:41.582 --> 00:04:44.117
- Exacamente, the Incredible Hulk.

00:04:44.117 --> 00:04:45.686
It tastes just like candy.

00:04:45.686 --> 00:04:48.655
- [Female] Today we're
making the Caramel Delight!

00:04:48.956 --> 00:04:50.257
(female hums)

00:04:50.257 --> 00:04:52.225
You know with that whip cream it's easy to

00:04:52.225 --> 00:04:54.928
like you know, manipulate
it on certain areas right?

00:04:54.928 --> 00:04:56.263
- Really, I haven't done this.

00:04:56.263 --> 00:04:57.931
- How do you do it with this one?

00:04:57.931 --> 00:04:58.678
You use finger?

00:04:58.678 --> 00:05:00.139
- Just grab a handful and just.
