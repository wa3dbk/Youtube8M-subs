Hello, My name is Candance Draper and I'm
a fit expert here at Canyon Beachwear.

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:09.740
Everyone that works here at Canyon Beachwear
is a fit expert.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.950
We know everything there is to know about
bikinis.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:14.979
It's kinda eat, breath, sleep bikinis.

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:20.650
So we're like the girlfriend you forgot to
bring into the store.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.420
You can also find us online or at www.canyonbeachwear.com.
you can find us on Facebook and twitter as

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:28.619
well under canyonbeachwear and today we're
gonna be talking about swimwear.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.590
This is exactly how you should wear a tankini.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:37.060
Ashley has on the over the shoulder, this
is a Kenneth Cole and its got the rueshing

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:38.060
on the sides.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.660
So she could take it and make it larger if
she needs to, or bring it down and make it

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:42.660
a little less.

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.120
It also has the bra strap support, so your
not going to have any kinda pain around the

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.120
neck.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.270
She also has the ruffle detail in the front,
which matches the bottoms.

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.290
The great thing about this tankini is you
can pull it down and cover if you need to.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.793
Or you can bring it up if you want it to bring
out the break out between the bottom and the

00:01:00.793 --> 00:01:01.793
top.

00:01:01.793 --> 00:01:03.239
Its a tie side keyhole bikini.

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.960
Which shows the circle in the middle and you
can still adjust it.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.869
So it can still go larger or smaller if need
be.

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:14.039
The back of this suit is gonna be a higher
back.

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:18.450
Its going to hit right at your shoulder blades,
so you get that full coverage that most majority

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.859
of people are looking for in tankinis.

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:26.210
You get the adjustable straps so she can adjust
it if needed and the bottom if a full coverage

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.210
bottom.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.939
Kenneth Cole does a really good job in making
sure the fit is perfect as well as the coverage.

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.420
On Mariah we have sunsets, which is one of
our signature brands.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.229
It has the twist front which is very flattering
for all bust types.

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.639
It also has a great underwire, which is why
we have the support straps here.

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:50.170
SO your gonna have the bra strap support but
you can also unhook them and make it a band

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.539
out if you like.

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:56.729
Or if you have a bigger bust you can criss
cross it the back to give yourself that extra

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:57.729
bit of support.

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.649
The bottom is a little high waisted and it's
seamless so Its really nice, so this top you

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:04.239
can't see it.

00:02:04.239 --> 00:02:10.620
We matched this with a cobalt blue bottom
so you want to break up the material sometimes

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.670
with the tankinis.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.560
The whole point is not to be in a one piece.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.101
So if you do a pattern and then a solid, it
breaks it out so its not like your in one

00:02:18.101 --> 00:02:18.850
piece.
