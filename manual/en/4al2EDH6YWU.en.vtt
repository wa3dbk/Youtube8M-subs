00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.879
We are standing in a room that used to be
a carport when the house was originally built

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:11.200
and somewhere along the line one of the owners
has turned this in to a living quarters, whether

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:18.110
it be a bedroom or a family room or whatever
and we are in the process of doing a few changes

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:24.150
in here. We had some paneling on the walls
and the home owner decided he did not like

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.240
that so we are taking that down and when we
did that we found that the dry wall was not

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:35.699
completed so we had to finish up the dry wall,
fill in all the holes, and we are pretty well

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:39.479
done with that with the exception of the one
wall and we are holding off on that until

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:46.589
we install the new door. That is the process
that we are in now. At this point we are just

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:51.890
about ready for texture on these walls. We
are now standing in the existing utility room

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:59.639
where we have decided to add the second bathroom
which shrunk the utility room quite a bit.

00:00:59.639 --> 00:01:04.549
The original washer and dryer sat against
the far wall over there. We have constructed

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:10.729
a new 2x6 wall and we will make the backside
of that our new bathroom and this side will

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:17.840
become our new washer and dryer utility room.
We are in the original utility room, we had

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:22.560
a tiled floor, a washer and dryer, there were
a number of shelves that were up on the wall

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:31.509
which we completely removed. When we originally
drew up the plans this wall we added was going

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:37.580
to be a 2x4 wall but we discovered that we
needed a three inch vent for our sew line

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:43.539
so we had to increase the size of the wall
to a 2x6 wall in order to get enough plumbing

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:48.920
in the wall. The water heater has always been
in this place and we have enough room to leave

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.130
it in place so we did not have to worry about
moving this. It still gives us enough room

00:01:53.130 --> 00:02:01.030
to put our washer and dryer back into the
room when our project will be completed.
