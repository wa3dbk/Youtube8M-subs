Today! I'm going to eat Welch's Jelly

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.380
"Welch's" reminds me of a soft drink.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.760
But this maker is also making jelly.

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.400

Personally, I don't like jelly very much.

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.660
I'm not sure about jelly.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.220
I usually like chocolate, not candy or jelly.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:14.260
And there is one more thing.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.320
I'm not sure about it.
Tangerine? Grapefruit?

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.740
I'll eat them now.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.880
It's very soft.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.720
Once I start eating it, I can't stop picking it up.

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.060
Only if you try it for yourself,
you'll know this taste.
