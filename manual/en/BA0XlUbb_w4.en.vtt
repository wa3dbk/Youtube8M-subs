00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.180
Motorola Milestone Review, Part 4.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.700
Camera.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:19.090
The Motorola Milestone boasts a five megapixel
camera with autofocus and a flash, plus VGA

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:24.460
resolution video capture. On paper, this looks
very good.. but in practice, the camera is

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:32.160
possibly the biggest disappointment on the
Milestone. The camera is awkwardly positioned

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.360
very near to the corner of the phone, and
it is very easy to accidentally get part of

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.340
your finger in shot, but that isn't the main
problem with stills images on the Motorola

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.920
Milestone.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.550
As a comparison, we used a Kodak EasyShare
DX6490, a 4 megapixel traditional digital

00:00:51.550 --> 00:01:00.610
camera, and the Nokia E90 which is a standard
3.2 megapixel Nokia camera.

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.740
Contrast and colour are certainly OK with
the Milestone, but a close look at the details

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:13.210
shows that the 5 megapixel camera isn't all
it is cracked up to be.

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:20.030
A close inspection shows that the image lacks
detail and has a lot of noise, and it does

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.650
not seem to be significantly better than the
3.2 megapixel Nokia unit, and despite having

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:32.170
5 megapixels compared to 4 on the Kodak DX6490,
the Kodak's superior optics deliver a much

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.740
sharper picture.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.920
Another set of comparison photos of a much
closer object also show problems with crispness,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:51.970
although colour is still good.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.980
Other shots show significant problems with
the autofocus, which seems to have a mind

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:01.220
of its own especially with close-up shots.
The camera struggles with objects lit from

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.369
behind, and it seems to have a problem with
lens flare.

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.530
Overall, the stills photos are very disappointing.
There are some rumours that autofocus problems

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.930
on the DROID were fixed by a software update,
so it is possible that a future update on

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.800
the Milestone may improve matters. However,
the actual camera hardware doesn't seem to

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.410
be up to much, which is a little surprising
considering that one of Motorola's few recent

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:34.530
successes was the camera on the Motorola ZINE
ZN5.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.140
There's a similar story with the Milestone's
video capture - in theory, it is capable of

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:45.920
720 x 480 pixels at 30 frames per second.
In practice, the images tend to look blocky

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:53.120
if dealing with a lot of motion and the quality
is certainly not as good as we hoped.

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.800
Video quality is just about acceptable for
uploading onto YouTube, and you can upload

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:02.440
videos directly to YouTube from the Milestone,
which does at least make video blogging very

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:10.300
easy to do. Overall, the camera isn't much
good for stills photos or video capture, and

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.300
if these things are really important to you
then you might want to look elsewhere. On

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.480
the other hand, the integration of GPS into
everything and the variety of apps from the

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.110
Android Market that you can use with photos
does still make it a slightly useful choice.
