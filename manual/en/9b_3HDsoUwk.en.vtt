Hi I'm Sylvain. Hi, I'm Court. Welcome to
Ecuador Freedom Bike Rental!

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.980
We're the country's first full-service motorcycle
rental and tour operation located here in

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.110
the magnificent capital city of Quito, at
9500 feet.

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:30.110
And, this is Salina, our Head of Security.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:39.020
We started our business out of a passion for
motorcycling and adventure and based on twenty-three

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.570
years of friendship. We formed this business
together in 2009.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.570
In 2008, we rode from New York to Buenos Aires.
We spent a year riding in Central and South

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.100
America checking out sixteen countries, looking
for the ideal place to start our business.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.489
After riding to Argentina, we came to Ecuador
- it was the ideal place.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:11.489
It has the variety of terrains, climates,
friendliest people and very low crime rates.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:19.470
We started giving tours of Ecuador in 2010.
We give the tours to take you to the best

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.770
places in the country. And also to places
that very few people come to visit.

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.740
Yeah - so we are going to visit places that
very few people see, which means we are going

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.799
to go off road a little bit - off the beaten path.

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.040
And we have riders from all different levels
with us on these tours, so on our first day,

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.619
we are going to take it easy - we are going
to see where everyone's abilities are - and

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:47.510
we are going to go on a variety of different
roads - we are going on paved roads, cobblestone

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:50.000
roads, and dirt roads.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000
We'll start off easy. During the tour, as
we progress, from day to day, it will get

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000
a little more challenging. But we want you
to be comfortable. We don't want to have you

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
be "pushed to your limit." Our goal is really
to get out, into the countryside and see some

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:19.069
things you won't see on paved roads.

00:02:24.529 --> 00:02:31.529
A typical day is starting very early in the
morning because we want to have nice weather

00:02:34.669 --> 00:02:40.359
and to have time take pictures and time to
take in the road. We are starting with a nice

00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:47.359
breakfast, we go to very very nice places.
We try to be on the road at 7:30-8:00.

00:02:47.749 --> 00:02:53.930
That's right, we stay in really nice places.
The goal is to be very comfortable. We stay

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.540
in the best hotel in town.

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:06.510
We have great meals, we want to have you get
a great night's sleep. Have a great shower.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:13.510
And be comfortable and ready to ride all day.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:22.889
We ride like a team. We all stay together.
We stop together to take pictures and we all

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:24.980
eat together.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.760
Yeah - there are riders of different abilities
so sometimes, people will go off ahead but

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:37.659
we do keep the group together. If something
happens, we all stick together. It is adventure

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:42.719
riding - that's what this is about. And its
a lot of fun.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:48.889
We cap small groups. No more than eight people.
So, that makes everything a lot easier and

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:53.040
a lot more fun. It's like a small family travelling
together.

00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.040
We'll go from seal level - to 15,000 feet.
And there's a lot of changing.of clothes.

00:04:03.479 --> 00:04:10.059
Putting on layers, removing layers through
the day. And there's really nothing that stays

00:04:10.059 --> 00:04:17.000
the same during the whole day's ride. There's
no straight "eeeeeehr" driving along....its

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.810
beautiful roads, but constantly changing -that's
the beauty here of Ecuador.

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:28.570
If you don't have all the gear we've got a
lot here you can use. Pants - rain gear - jackets

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:35.370
- helmets - all kinds of stuff here, so don't
worry about that, we'll get you set up.

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:41.750
We ride Ecuador all year 'round and we have
friends everywhere in Ecuador.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:47.750
So our tours are about riding around and meeting
these friends and doing other things other

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:54.750
than riding. It's great riding but we also
visit archeological ruins, Incan ruins.We

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:02.060
go deep into the Amazon jungle with a native
guide. We visit gold mines. We go surfing.

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.000
We go paragliding. We go canyoning. We go
rafting. There's a whole bunch of stuff that

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:18.100
we do along our tours, but we craft it to
what you guys want to do during the ride.

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:25.910
Come to Ecuador. Come to see us! Have a good
time with us.

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:32.590
We love riding this country and we love sharing
our passion for riding here and we'd love
