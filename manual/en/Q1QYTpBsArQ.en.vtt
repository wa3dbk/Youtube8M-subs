00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:07.849
I'd like to share with you our new building that we just put up.

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:11.090
It's the 815 Albany Street medical students' residence hall.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.000
It's an energy efficient building.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Materials being used in the building are environmentally friendly.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let me take you into the lobby next, 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
and we can talk about some of the features that are in there.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is a neat little item here. 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
This allows the person visiting the student in the building.
You can dial by name. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
It would call their cell phone, on their keypad it would allow to unlock the door.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Some of the other amenities that we have in the security is we have cameras obviously throughout

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that view the neighborhood surroundings, internally and externally.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
We have the traditional Boston University's blue phones that are out there.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
All those are connected directly to our command center, which is 1.5 blocks away.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Let's follow in.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Welcome to our student lounge.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
It's an informal setting that the students can gather for meetings to prepare for studies for exams, white board, that type of setting.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.560
A small kitchenette that allows them to take advantage of late-night snacks.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.000
And what I'd like to show you next is the exercise room that we have.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This here is a universal gym. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
What we have is a couple of treadmills, bicycles, ellipticals.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
There are TV sets in the room, mirrors.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
We have a couple of safety features in the room. There's an emergency call button. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000
We have a dispensing area here for everything to be wiped down.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
This room has a special air conditioning system.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It has a lot of air exchanges for what you'd find in a fitness area.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
But what I'd like to do now is take you upstairs
to show you one of the suites.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
What you have here is a kitchenette, stainless steel.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
It's an efficient space. The lighting is all compact fluorescent, carbon monoxide sensors.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The rooms themselves have air conditioning, separate controls, which allows both rooms to have cooling and heating all year round.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Typically, you would have to choose one system or the other.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.649
The ceiling is a special ceiling tile that has acoustical properties to deaden the sound to help the study qualities of the space.

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.649
We're now in the storage room where the students are allowed to store their bikes.

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.000
It's a secure space, there are over 30 racks that are available to them.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
It's in the basement, and it's free and accessible to them.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
These are kind of neat. The students can view on the web the availability of these machines.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000
And there's a card system that's available here, so they don't have to take their wallet down all the time.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Down the hallway here is a vending services that allows them to have food and snacks during the night.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And we have nice Corian surfaces for easy maintenance and everything like that.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Right now we're on the roof of 815 Albany Street, the new student residence building.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
We're in the heart of the South End. 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Just shortly down the street, there's our medical community.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
The Roxbury community is over here. 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
On the back side of the building you can actually see the CITGO sign.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And on the front corner, you actually have a great view of the Prudential building and the Hancock. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Very impressive, sought after view.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
Let me explain some of the amenities we have in the garden park.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
This is in cooperation with the city of Boston.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The benches have been set up.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
There's a 10,000 gallon tank underneath this facility which collects rain water off the roof,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
which allows us to irrigate some nice flower settings.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
It helps us get our LEED certification.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
And I'd like to show you our future aspirations.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000
This lot here. It's actually two lots, which will possibly house another residence hall and some administration buildings. 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
And hopefully I'll have a chance to show those to you in the near future too.
