00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:16.278
[SONG: I bought hiking shoes but I'm not planning to hike].

00:00:17.461 --> 00:00:20.461
SANDMANN: To my left in a brown shirt sits aba.

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:25.821
[SONG: I have lanterns worth as much as a 
 VW golf, but I'm not a security guard].

00:00:27.423 --> 00:00:30.423
ABA: And to my right in a blue shirt sits Sandmann.

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:35.765
[SONG: I have a rope, hook and eye, but I'm not a climber].

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.570
BOTH: And together we are Dosenfischer.

00:00:40.008 --> 00:00:44.708
SANDMANN: We call it fishing for cans, or geocaching. It's a family hobby...

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.900
Well, famous isn't really the right word

00:00:46.997 --> 00:00:48.997
but there are a few people who know us,

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:52.249
because we've run a Podcast for the past 3.5 years.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.220
We are sitting pretty much in the center of Schwerin. 

00:00:55.612 --> 00:00:58.912
Behind us is the famous castle, the Schwerin castle.

00:00:59.443 --> 00:01:02.443
ABA: And, of course, there is a geocache over there.

00:01:02.717 --> 00:01:04.717
We started the hobby relatively early.

00:01:04.946 --> 00:01:09.946
because geocaching was not yet established at the time.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.370
Let's go and search!

00:01:17.578 --> 00:01:19.578
Back then I did not know any geocachers.

00:01:19.814 --> 00:01:21.814
If you had asked me as a little boy, 

00:01:22.083 --> 00:01:25.083
I would have said that geocachers are something like aliens, right? 

00:01:25.319 --> 00:01:27.319
ABA: Ah, here!

00:01:27.622 --> 00:01:28.622
ABA: No.  SANDMANN: No

00:01:29.165 --> 00:01:31.465
ABA: I came across geocaching, and found it totally exciting

00:01:31.626 --> 00:01:33.626
I tried it out and was laughed at.

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:38.527
Tom did not find the hobby as exciting as I did.

00:01:39.172 --> 00:01:41.670
but you still got hooked on it at some point.

00:01:44.071 --> 00:01:46.070
ABA: Found! SANDMANN: What?!

00:01:46.773 --> 00:01:48.770
SANDMANN: How pretty!

00:01:48.943 --> 00:01:51.940
SANDMANN: I bought a GPS device and then I was 
 sitting at home on the couch and thought,

00:01:52.083 --> 00:01:54.080
'It's not doing anything'

00:01:54.335 --> 00:01:57.340
and then, somehow I figured out you have to 
 move in order to see the result.

00:01:57.477 --> 00:02:00.480
and so I took it out with my family,

00:02:00.636 --> 00:02:04.640
and my wife said, 'Man, all of a sudden 
 I can actually go walking with you.'

00:02:04.723 --> 00:02:08.720
The family peace was established, and geocaching won me over.

00:02:09.463 --> 00:02:11.460
ABA: Oh, look there's even a Trackable.

00:02:12.566 --> 00:02:15.570
ABA: Good.  Depart!  SANDMANN: Depart!

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:19.290
[SONG: I fish for cans (Sundays, weekdays, day 
 and night, I follow the compass needle).]

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.140
[SONG: I fish for cans (crates, boxes, large 
 and small, in the countryside and Autobahn)]

00:02:23.644 --> 00:02:25.640
ABA: When we started geocaching, 

00:02:25.913 --> 00:02:28.910
that was something we never could have imagined doing.

00:02:29.002 --> 00:02:31.000
Many things simply happen, they are not planned.

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:33.140
[SONG: I fish for cans!]

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.320
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.550
This is how concerts happen, this is how CDs happen.

00:02:38.755 --> 00:02:40.760
That is a development.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.030
We have fun with it and that is why we do it.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:45.330
And we will keep on doing it as long as it's fun.

00:02:45.499 --> 00:02:50.000
[SONG: I feel so micro-o-o-o-oh].

00:02:53.708 --> 00:02:56.210
[I'm the silent majority].

00:02:56.541 --> 00:02:58.540
[I don't blow anyone's socks off].

00:02:58.779 --> 00:03:02.280
[I'm no one's friend, they just come to log].

00:03:02.516 --> 00:03:04.520
[I'm a micro].

00:03:05.586 --> 00:03:09.090
ABA: At the moment we have more than enough songs.

00:03:09.243 --> 00:03:12.240
We have some songs in the pipeline.  

00:03:12.493 --> 00:03:16.490
Currently there are 25 songs and 25 titles with different themes.

00:03:17.861 --> 00:03:19.360
We sing about nightcaching.

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:22.170
[SONG: Out into the night! Out into the night!]

00:03:22.641 --> 00:03:24.140
We sing about a 'better hider'

00:03:24.243 --> 00:03:26.740
[SONG: But Ronny was a better hider!]

00:03:27.006 --> 00:03:28.510
We sing about Lost Places.

00:03:28.771 --> 00:03:31.270
[SONG: A staircase leads down].

00:03:31.445 --> 00:03:34.440
[An iron door creaks].

00:03:34.947 --> 00:03:37.450
ABA: And we have it all on CD

00:03:37.684 --> 00:03:39.680
SANDMANN: On one CD.  ABA: Right.

00:03:39.963 --> 00:03:41.960
ABA: And the second is on it's way.  SANDMANN: Right.

00:03:42.238 --> 00:03:46.240
SANDMANN: We have also asked ourselves that in the Podcast 
 whether we will ever run out of themes,

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:50.360
because we are talking about a very narrow topic.

00:03:50.503 --> 00:03:53.500
Then it occurred to us that this game is very close to life,

00:03:53.918 --> 00:03:56.920
and the material can never run out.

00:03:58.572 --> 00:04:01.570
ABA: When we are on the road, when we meet people, 

00:04:01.809 --> 00:04:05.310
it is also their stories that are partially reflected in our songs. 

00:04:05.528 --> 00:04:09.530
So it's not just our own experience, but 
 also the experience of others.  

00:04:09.649 --> 00:04:12.150
and there is plenty of material for many many more songs.

00:04:12.935 --> 00:04:16.940
[SONG: I never thought the day would come].

00:04:17.695 --> 00:04:22.700
[I never thought you'd become a Geogroupie, *08].

00:04:24.197 --> 00:04:27.200
SANDMANN: And then, what do we do in 5 years?

00:04:27.292 --> 00:04:31.290
ABA: If all goes well, we will still 
 be having fun with what we're doing.

00:04:31.511 --> 00:04:37.510
Things that revolve around geocaching, whether it is the blog, 
 the podcast, the music, or who knows what else.

00:04:40.056 --> 00:04:44.060
SANDMANN: It is little bit like during the Oscars that 
 at this point I have to say, 

00:04:44.537 --> 00:04:50.540
that this whole thing would not have been possible 
 without the many great people who we've met.

00:04:51.057 --> 00:04:55.560
[SONG: We call it searching for cans, or geocaching].

00:04:55.845 --> 00:05:00.840
[It's a family hobby, it's a family hobby!]

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:06.840
