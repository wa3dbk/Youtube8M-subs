00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.699
Solitaire is a game that, to say the least,
is available.

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.980
If you ever wanted to play a game of solitaire,
odds are very high that you would be capable

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.050
of doing that.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.619
Besides playing the game with a deck of cards,
it is available on practically every computer

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:39.360
released since 1992, on every phone, iPod,
watch, toaster oven, and I’m pretty sure

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.920
it is also in the back pages of books in case
your read is boring.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:47.890
What I’m saying is, if you want to play
solitaire, you can.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.829
And you can also play with your PS3 and PSP.

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.480
But obviously, this version has to be pretty
special for them to charge money for something

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:06.710
that has been free since forever.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.060
Best of Solitaire is packing a pretty decent
punch for being simply a solitaire game.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.450
First off, it provides a pretty decent way
of playing the popular time waster.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.420
Everyone by now should know how the game works
so I don’t feel the need to explain it.

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.320
You can deal cards and move all with the face
buttons, and even get a hint if you are stuck.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.840
It is a pretty fluid way to play, which it
has to be.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:35.060
But the big selling point to this game is
the number of different ways to play the game.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.369
You are not given just the simple normal Solitaire.

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.119
The game provides 101 different ways of playing,
all with their own rules and strategy.

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.300
The normal game is actually called Klondike,
but there is also FreeCell, Double Klondike,

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.849
Pyramid, Spider, Eight Off, and many more.

00:01:54.849 --> 00:01:59.539
If you are a fan of solitaire, it is pretty
fun to go through the many different games,

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.450
and experience the changes.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.310
Maybe you want to play your favorite and improve
your stats, or stick to your favorite couple,

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.739
or try a new one each time.

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:17.330
You could play this game 101 times, and not
have the same experience twice.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:25.640
There are also nice minor touches like changing
deck design and background.

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:31.319
Maybe you want to play solitaire on the beach,
in Venice, in a field of flowers, or even

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.739
up in the sky.

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:44.739
And it keeps your best times and score, adding
more reasons to play better next time.

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:48.569
Solitaire is everywhere, including your PS3
and PSP.

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:53.680
While it is ridiculous thinking about paying
for solitaire, this game does enough to justify

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.680
it.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.299
With 101 different ways to play and smooth
gameplay, this could easily become your go

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:01.509
to for solitaire.
