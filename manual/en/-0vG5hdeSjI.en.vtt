What's up fish tank people? Tanktv, Dustin
Wunderlich. I am excited...dustinsfishtanks!

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:18.269
I am sitting in my zen chair and this is in
my office. I was all excited yesterday, because

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:23.510
I have shown you guys my pond, but I wanted
to show you what is going to go in that pond.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.980
A lot of people give gold fish a bad rep,
and it drives me crazy. They are like the

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:33.699
first starter fish you get, they are hardy,
they grow easy, they eat anything, they are

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:39.940
colorful, they are good like me they breed.
I want to give a shootout to my goldfish,

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:46.940
I call them "The boys", if you will. They
are in my 29 gallon right now. Check this

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.450
out. This is my 29 gallon and I am showing
a few early in the morning, because you can

00:00:54.450 --> 00:01:00.360
see I have got some really killer natural
sunlight coming in and hitting this tank as

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.660
well, but we are not talking about that tank
today.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.660
We are talking about this tank. This is my
ryukin. These are my favorite fish right here.

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.520
I love them! They are from Japan. I think
from an island called Ryuke and they are bred

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:23.520
with an extra tall...the high back as you
can see on there. And I love that red color!

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:31.329
What happened was I had these guys out in
my pond, "The boys". There is one of them,

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:35.969
I think he actually might be a girl. What
happened is they bred and they created these

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.149
ones. I pulled these suckers out of my pond.
These are the babies I had last year. Aren't

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:45.399
those wicked? So I think that they are mix.
I got to get them in the shade. I think they

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.380
are a mix of this guy, or this girl and this
guy... I haven't sexed them yet. But there

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:57.969
they are. Look at them! Will you tell me that
one, isn't related to that one?

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:01.959
I am absolutely loving these things! When
I pulled those out, I was so pumped. So you

00:02:01.959 --> 00:02:06.549
can see that one is getting fat. That one
has got a nice ryukin shape, a little taller

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:11.140
up top. I have also put a killer pot of jungle
val. This actually was out in my pond and

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.340
I brought it in. Now it just says wild and
it grows great! This is like my garbage disposal

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.930
tank, if you will. I just put everything that
like I pull out of my tanks. I put it in there

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:26.019
and these guys eat it. It's great! They love
it, like this moss they are always pecking

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:30.260
at. That keeps them really healthy in the
winter and then probably in a month I am going

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.269
to put them outside. I like having them here,
I like looking at them in the morning. So

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:42.269
these are "The boys"! This is actually L1.
This is original bred, the first brood or

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:49.480
whatever.That one right there. Obviously looks
kind of like a standard goldfish. I am going

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.069
to try and breed these. I have got some other
Ryukins at home, but this is my original strand.

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:57.979
I am pretty proud of those. That's it!
