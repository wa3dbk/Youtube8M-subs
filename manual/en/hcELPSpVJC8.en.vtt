00:00:05.463 --> 00:00:07.625
Welcome to this Camera FV-5 tutorial.

00:00:07.637 --> 00:00:11.962
In this video you will gain insight into
the application settings and parameters.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.802
Here you can find the
application settings

00:00:14.815 --> 00:00:17.577
then the exposure program modes

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:20.915
and here at the
bottom we can find

00:00:20.925 --> 00:00:23.352
some very important parameters
for the photo, like

00:00:23.377 --> 00:00:24.790
white balance

00:00:24.815 --> 00:00:25.814
focus modes

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.040
light metering modes

00:00:27.065 --> 00:00:28.389
ISO sensitivity

00:00:28.402 --> 00:00:30.052
and exposure compensation.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.565
I will explain later how to
change all this setitngs.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.116
This is the photo capture
button, but you can use

00:00:36.117 --> 00:00:38.490
the shutter key as well
if your device has one.

00:00:38.628 --> 00:00:43.541
To trigger the autofocus system, tap on
the screen or half-press the shutter key.

00:00:46.954 --> 00:00:49.191
The photo parameters
are, from left to right,

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:52.516
aperture, exposure time expressed
in fractions of seconds,

00:00:52.554 --> 00:00:55.066
and ISO sensitivity.

00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:58.415
The ISO sensitivity can be
changed by using the ISO

00:00:58.425 --> 00:01:01.065
toolbar located at the
bottom of the viewfinder.

00:01:03.853 --> 00:01:06.328
The number in square
brackets indicate the number

00:01:06.329 --> 00:01:08.978
of remaining shots in the
current selected media.

00:01:09.017 --> 00:01:12.517
And the last number indicates the
number of shots pending to be written.

00:01:16.691 --> 00:01:20.841
The plus/minus icon opens the
exposure compensation toolbar.

00:01:21.416 --> 00:01:26.342
Then, with the plus and minus buttons,
we can adjust the exposure time

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.130
relative to the correct exposure
time calculated by the camera.

00:01:31.018 --> 00:01:34.717
When we are done, to dismiss
this dialog and others as well,

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.377
just tap outside it.

00:01:39.652 --> 00:01:43.164
As we said before, to
adjust the ISO sensitivity,

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:47.539
we can do this by using the
ISO sensitivity toolbar.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.852
Here we can choose
from 100 to 1600

00:01:50.852 --> 00:01:53.214
or activate ISO automatic.

00:01:53.615 --> 00:01:57.852
Once we have chosen a value we will
see the changes reflected instantly

00:01:57.965 --> 00:02:01.690
although in this particular bright scene
we are not going to see the difference.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.252
Light metering modes are useful to
determine which part of the photo

00:02:07.257 --> 00:02:10.590
is going to be taken into account
to calculate the right exposure.

00:02:10.628 --> 00:02:14.677
Matrix, center and spot are the
three different choices available.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.727
Centered uses only the central part of the
frame to calculate the right exposure,

00:02:18.752 --> 00:02:21.552
where spot uses just the
focus rectangle area.

00:02:21.752 --> 00:02:27.415
Matrix, the default mode, uses the whole
frame area to calculate the right exposure.

00:02:29.841 --> 00:02:33.102
There are different focus modes
available in Camera FV-5

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.240
depending on which
model you have.

00:02:35.265 --> 00:02:37.353
Those focus modes are auto-focus...

00:02:37.391 --> 00:02:38.266
...macro...

00:02:38.304 --> 00:02:39.366
...touch focus...

00:02:39.391 --> 00:02:40.603
...infinity focus...

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:42.852
...plus an autofocus lock toggle.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.490
Macro mode will let you
focus on closer objects

00:02:46.515 --> 00:02:49.690
but it will work with
other distances as well.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.515
Automatic focus is the default mode and will
let you focus on any object on the scene.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.500
Infinity focus mode will
disable the automatic focusing

00:03:03.526 --> 00:03:07.213
and will make far away objects
to remain always in focus.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:12.500
Finally touch focus mode lets you
choose which object should be in focus.

00:03:12.538 --> 00:03:16.577
To do so, tap on the screen to
move the focus rectangle position.

00:03:18.678 --> 00:03:23.640
The focus lock toggle prevents accidental
focus changes by locking the screen.

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.565
When the focus lock is active

00:03:25.577 --> 00:03:28.264
tapping on the screen doesn't
change the focus position

00:03:28.303 --> 00:03:33.315
thus preventing accidental focus changes
while other parameters are being adjusted.

00:03:33.328 --> 00:03:39.103
While in touch focus mode, coming back to
autofocus mode resets the touch focus rectangle.

00:03:40.165 --> 00:03:44.340
White balance let you compensate lighting
conditions of different color temperatures.

00:03:44.378 --> 00:03:48.326
You can choose from some presets
like sunny or cloudy conditions,

00:03:48.351 --> 00:03:52.701
or just choose automatic white balance
to let the application decide

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:54.926
which situation is the right for you.

00:03:54.964 --> 00:03:58.251
Of course, you can choose the
wrong white balance setting,

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:02.275
if you want to create a warm or
colder sensation for your photo.
