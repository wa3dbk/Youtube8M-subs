Hi, I'm Holly with Mono Machines and this
is the Swingline 500X Stack-and-Shred.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:15.500
It's a cross cut shredder for office use and
I'm gonna show you how it works.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.500
It can shred up to 10 sheets of paper at one
time.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.320
Put this paper into the 9-inch throat here.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:27.030
It can also tear through CDs, credits cards,
paperclips and staples.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.230
It also has a power save mode.

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.680
But the real reason you want this shredder
the auto feeder.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.100
Check this out.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.449
Pull up this lid.

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:37.680
It has a 500-sheet capacity.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.760
You can put a huge stack of paper in there
but before we do that I'm gonna point out

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.550
a few key features.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.620
See this red light indicates the shredder
needs oil.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:47.989
It does have an auto oiler.

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.489
Just flip up this lid here, take out the plug,
put your oil in and the shredder does the

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:55.489
rest.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:56.489
Here is our CD slot.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.589
You can go ahead and shred a CD for you.

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:05.350
Super easy just pop it in there and it's gonna
shred away, easy as that.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.700
Now we are gonna shred some paper.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:15.939
You can grab a huge stack of paper here and
lift up this lid once again, like I said it

00:01:15.939 --> 00:01:25.969
has a 500-sheet capacity you can shred a lot
of paper, you can go ahead and shut this lid

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:27.450
and watch your shred.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.880
For addded security we do have a 4-digit pin
here.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:37.579
We can set this pin and it locks up so if
you have some sensitive documents that you

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.469
donâ€™t want to stand around and wait for
them to shred you can go ahead and set that

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:43.469
pin and it's gonna reset once the shredding
is done.

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:48.210
This is also on caster so you can move it
around really easily and you can see the shred

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.070
falling into our 21-gallon bin.

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.920
I'm going to show you what that looks like
right now.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:05.400
Here is our CD shred and this is what our
beautiful cross cut paper shred is gonna look

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.929
like, very, very nice indeed.

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.590
Now this machine is going to save you a lot
of time.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:14.390
All you have to do is stack, shut and hred.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:21.860
Thanks for watching, I'm Holly with Mono Machines.
