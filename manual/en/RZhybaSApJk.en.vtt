00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.400
- I love whenever Halle Berry
is on the show.

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.133
I mean, I'm worried that
she's going to be intimidated

00:00:04.133 --> 00:00:05.333
by my beauty,

00:00:05.333 --> 00:00:06.966
but anyway,
we always have fun.

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:08.633
The last time she was here,
we played a game

00:00:08.633 --> 00:00:10.066
called "Stuff Your Cups."

00:00:10.066 --> 00:00:14.166
I hadn't had that much fun
and cash in my bra,

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:15.333
I don't know,

00:00:15.333 --> 00:00:18.066
I was at Diddy's party
the last time that happened.

00:00:18.066 --> 00:00:19.066
Watch.

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.566
- In honor of your new
lingerie line--

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.833
- Tres Belle
- Tres Belle, Halle Berry.

00:00:22.833 --> 00:00:23.966
We're gonna play a game.

00:00:23.966 --> 00:00:25.900
First let's bring down
two people from the audience.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.333
Where are Vicki Cho
and Hannah Wimberley?

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:34.333
[upbeat music]

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:40.033
- Hi.
- Hi.

00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:43.466
- Hi.
- You are as beautiful as--

00:00:43.466 --> 00:00:45.000
- Thank you.
Hi.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.266
- Hi.
- How are you?

00:00:46.266 --> 00:00:48.933
- I am honored--I'm honored--
I'm honored to be here today

00:00:48.933 --> 00:00:50.700
next to you beautiful,
strong women.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.900
- Wow.
- And you. This is amazing.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.300
All right,
we're gonna play a game,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.633
and it's called
"Stuff Your Cups."

00:00:57.633 --> 00:00:58.633
[singing]
- Now push it

00:00:58.633 --> 00:01:01.166
[hip-hop music]

00:01:01.166 --> 00:01:03.133
Push it good

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.433
Push it

00:01:04.433 --> 00:01:06.466
Push it real good

00:01:06.466 --> 00:01:08.533
Push it

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.533
Push it good

00:01:10.533 --> 00:01:11.600
Push it

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.066
Pu-push it real good

00:01:13.066 --> 00:01:15.200
- So here's what's
gonna happen.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.200
All right,
here's what's gonna happen.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.866
Halle and I are gonna put on
her dream bra,

00:01:18.866 --> 00:01:20.566
and we're gonna step
into the cash machine.

00:01:20.566 --> 00:01:22.900
We have 30 seconds to grab
as much cash as we can,

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.366
stuff it into our bras,

00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:25.700
and whoever
gets the most money--

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.900
Whatever we get,
we're gonna--

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.400
we're gonna share.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.333
So...

00:01:31.333 --> 00:01:34.333
Thank you very much.

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:37.333
[cheers and applause]

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.000
- Okay.
- All right.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.566
- Ellen, I just hope
I don't hurt you in there.

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:44.033
- You're not gonna hurt me.

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:47.500
I hope I don't hurt you.
All right.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.733
The money's
gonna fly around.

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:49.900
If you want
to put these on...

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:52.466
Let's get in there,
and so...

00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:54.866
- Okay.
- Oh, wait.

00:01:54.866 --> 00:01:57.733
Who are we playing for,
Vicki or Hannah?

00:01:57.733 --> 00:01:58.833
- I'll play for Vicki.

00:01:58.833 --> 00:02:00.566
- All right,
I'll play for Hannah.

00:02:00.566 --> 00:02:01.566
All right.

00:02:01.566 --> 00:02:04.566
[cheers and applause]

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.266
All right.

00:02:07.266 --> 00:02:08.766
- [laughs]

00:02:08.766 --> 00:02:10.400
- Turn it on!

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.833
[air rushing]

00:02:11.833 --> 00:02:14.833
[cheers and applause]

00:02:16.933 --> 00:02:22.933
[frantic music]

00:02:26.533 --> 00:02:28.333
My bra's
not big enough!

00:02:28.333 --> 00:02:29.866
Won't hold all my money.

00:02:34.933 --> 00:02:40.933
[frantic music]

00:02:45.333 --> 00:02:46.733
[cheers and applause]

00:02:46.733 --> 00:02:48.033
- Hey!

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:49.866
You're not supposed
to stuff it in your pants!

00:02:49.866 --> 00:02:52.833
[laughs]

00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:54.600
- All right.

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:55.800
- You cheated.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.433
[laughing]

00:02:58.433 --> 00:02:59.533
- All right.

00:02:59.533 --> 00:03:02.966
[cheers and applause]

00:03:02.966 --> 00:03:04.600
- That's not fair.
- Well...

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.500
- You look great.
- Thank you.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.766
We don't--
there was $5,000 in there,

00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:10.200
and we don't have time
to count it up,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.733
so we're just gonna
split it evenly.

00:03:11.733 --> 00:03:13.500
Each of you get $2,500.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.500
[cheers and applause]
