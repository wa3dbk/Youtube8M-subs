00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.030
Good morning John; I'm leaving town.

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:05.910
I'm exited about this; just got to get away.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:09.510
(music plays)

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:19.179
(singing)
Country roads, take me home

00:00:19.179 --> 00:00:22.470
To the place I belong

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.230
Hank: There's like a John Denver song about
Montana and I decided not to sing it.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.230
Katherine: Nope.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.009
Hank: I... why did I do that?

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.350
Katherine: I don't know.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.680
(music)

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.809
Hank: Our trip thus far has been narrated
entirely by Cecil Baldwin.

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:40.940
Cecil: Just a blinking light-
Hank: Huh!

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:42.270
Cecil: Red
Hank: It's yellow.

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.329
Point the camera at yourself, I wan to see
how beautiful my wife is.

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:48.329
(Laughs)

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.190
Hank (voice over): Katherine and I were driving
about 150 miles to a place called Freezeout

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.280
Lake.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:00.739
Every year hundreds of thousands of snow geese,
swans, and other water fowl stopped there,

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.540
just as the lake starts to thaw, to fatten
up on harvested barley fields.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.110
But first, we stopped at a farm owned by our
friends Jacob and Courtney.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.210
Hank: This here is my friends Jacob and Courtney's
farm; we're on the Rocky Mountain Front, which

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:18.270
is uhh, the land that happens before you get
to the Rocky Mountains, which are over there.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.299
And the from here on out uhh, it's just err...
mostly just corn.

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.460
And wheat.

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:26.460
And wheat by-products.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.820
(music)
...you took from the shore

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.070
They're easy fears, dear

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:38.130
Hank: Oh you're on me!

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.390
(Hank laughs) Oh man.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:42.390
thanks.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:49.509
(music)
Will you bury me in a far-off field?

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:52.759
Fresh and lovely darling

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:55.280
Hank: Jacob's gonna show me the garlic trick.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.619
What are you doing?

00:01:57.619 --> 00:01:58.619
Ohh.

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.619
Whaaaaat?

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.119
Jacob: Look at that!

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.100
Hank: That does not work with the garlic you
buy at stores, I have to say.

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:09.149
Oh god yeah, just like the most delicious
toothpaste of all time.

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.790
I personally hate Daylight Savings Time, and
I think it's ridiculous and we should never

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:13.790
do it.

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.090
It was created for farmers; you are farmers.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.310
How do you feel about this?

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.310
Jacob: I don't like it.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.310
Courtney: It's hell on babies.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.480
Hank: Okay, well I'm glad we got that settled.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.319
I think we should just take this tape to Congress.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:24.319
That was fun.

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:26.820
(Katherine burps) Bless you baby.

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:32.790
(voice over)
The early bird catches the geese as they say.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.269
So we were up early the next morning.

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.269
Hank: Sunrise in Montana.

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:41.660
The Rocky Mountain Front is generally a very
windy place, which we are experiencing today.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:43.459
(voice Over)
When we arrived at the lake, there were plenty

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.000
of water fowl to be seen but not a goose in
sight, and we were worried that maybe they

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.840
were either gone or they hadn't arrived yet.

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.421
We were early for the goose migration season,
but we figured we'd take the chance and it

00:02:56.421 --> 00:02:58.049
looked like it wasn't gonna pay off.

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:02.799
Then we got kind of lost driving around on
back roads through a horse pasture, and I'd

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:04.940
pretty much given up on seeing the goose migration.

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:15.050
There were horses though, and swans; it was
beautiful, but then there... right ahead of

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:18.530
us.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:28.970
(music; geese honks)

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:42.890
Hank: Katherine just died.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:53.329
(laughs) Of happy.

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:56.809
(laughs)
