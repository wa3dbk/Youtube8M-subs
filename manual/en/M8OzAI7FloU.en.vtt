How to Keep Lips Soft and Plump.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.070
Get luscious, pillowy, kissable lips—with
or without injections.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.930
You will need Lip balm with SPF 30 Sugar Olive

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:25.850
Petroleum jelly Lip injections A lip implant
Vitamin E capsules and plant-based oils.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.790
Cosmetic lip surgery can lead to scarring
and other side effects.

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.930
Talk to your doctor at length before undergoing
any procedure.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:34.210
Step 1.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.940
Protect your lips from wrinkling by wearing
SPF 30 lip balm—either alone or under your

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.570
lipstick—year-round.

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:41.570
Step 2.

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.329
Keep lips supple by exfoliating them.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.820
Buy products specifically made for this purpose,
or get the same results by mixing sugar and

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.660
olive oil into a paste, gently rub it on your
lips with an old toothbrush, &amp; rinse off.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:00.190
Apply this scrub once a week, &amp; give your
lips the once-over every morning with a plain,

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.239
wet toothbrush.

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:02.720
Avoid licking your lips.

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.129
It can cause and worsen chapping.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.130
Step 3.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.920
Keep your lips moist by dabbing a little petroleum
jelly on them at bedtime.

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.880
Or open up a vitamin E capsule and rub the
contents on your lips.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.369
Plant-based oils—like olive, coconut, sunflower,
and jojoba—work, too.

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:19.369
Step 4.

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:24.380
For temporary bee-stung lips, use an over-the-counter
lip plumper, which contains irritants that

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.439
swell lips.

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.069
There are also over-the-counter topical treatments
that may slightly enlarge lips over time because

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.329
they contain peptides or hyaluronic acid.

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:36.630
To make your own plumping product, rub a small
amount of cayenne pepper on your lips.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.520
It’s the main active ingredient in many
commercial plumpers.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:46.349
If you have allergies to latex, bananas, kiwi,
chestnuts, or avocado, you may have a cayenne

00:01:46.349 --> 00:01:47.349
allergy.

00:01:47.349 --> 00:01:48.450
Step 5.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:52.659
Create the illusion of fuller lips by lining
them—except for the corners—with a pencil

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:55.639
that matches your natural lip color, then
smudging it.

00:01:55.639 --> 00:02:00.569
Next, apply a thin line of liquid highlighter
at the top center of your upper lip and blend.

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.130
Finally, apply a neutral lip color; then dab
a tiny bit of shimmery gloss on the center

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.969
of your bottom lip.

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.110
Layering two complementary lip colors can
create the illusion of depth.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.140
Step 6.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.390
If you’re interested in a longer-lasting
plumping solution, collagen or hyaluronic

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:19.569
acid injections or a lip implant may be an
option.

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:24.040
Remember that these are medical procedures:
Consult a doctor before making any decisions.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.420
Did you know Angelina Jolie’s lips are the
most coveted by American women, according

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.840
to a poll by the Beverly Hills Institute of
Aesthetic &amp; Reconstructive Surgery.
