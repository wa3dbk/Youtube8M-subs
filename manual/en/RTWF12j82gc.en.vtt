00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hi everyone and welcome on our pre-season

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We’re at the hotel management training centre 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
in Chatillon where we’re staying

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
during the course of our preparations

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It’s a very good structure

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.000
We’re able to train here

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
the pitches are nearby

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.500
and we don’t even have to take the bus

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:21.000
to training

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
so it’s very comfortable for us

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Here’s the entrance 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
which only the team and staff can use

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Nobody else can gain access from here

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Let’s have a walk around

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
so you can have a better look at where we are

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.000
This is the restaurant 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
where we eat breakfast, lunch and dinner

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.000
Good morning everyone!

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.000
This is the restaurant 

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and here’s the long table

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000
where we sit down to eat

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
This is my place and I sit near Lichtsteiner

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Matri and Quagliarella

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Simone should be head of the table

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
he’s the one who leads the banter

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Simone Pepe

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
This is where the staff 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and all the others sit

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And here’s where the manager

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and his backroom staff are located

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The food is really good here 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and the medical staff have given us

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
the right menu

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000
which we look to follow in the best way possible

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Diet is a very important thing

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Let’s now go upstairs

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
and have a look at the bedrooms we’re staying in

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Hi. From the dining room 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
you go up this staircase 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.000
and reach the first floor

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000
where you’ll find the corridors with our bedrooms

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The corridor opens up 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
and there are some rooms over there

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
while the others are here

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I am in room 104 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and if anyone’s interested

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Pepe and Storari, a nice couple

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
are in room 101

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Marrone and Matri are here

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
I honestly wouldn’t know who’s in this one

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.000
I’m in 104 and I’ll take you inside

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
My room-mate, Lucio, isn’t here yet

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
but he gets here tomorrow

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
We’re now in the room

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
there are two beds, a television

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
air conditioning system

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
I’ve brought a few books to read

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
because we have a lot of free time

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
I’ve also brought an iPad

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Here we’re able to enjoy

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
a wonderful view overlooking

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
the five-a-side pitches and the hotel garden

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
It’s a good way of relaxing

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
because we have lunch around 1pm

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
and then we can rest until 4pm

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000
also because the training sessions are tiring

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
and we require a lot of rest in between them

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Right guys, speaking of rest

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
that’s exactly what I’m going to do now

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
We’ve got a tough afternoon of work ahead of us

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Thanks, bye everyone!
