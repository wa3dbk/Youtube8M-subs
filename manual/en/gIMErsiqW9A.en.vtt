Hi I'm Angel with Fleecefun.com. Today I'm
going to show you how make a no sew hobo.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:26.790
No lie, no sewing required. For this pattern
you will need the following. You will need

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:33.770
the free PDF pattern that's available on Fleecefun.com,
all printed out. 2/3 yard of fleece. 2/3 yard

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.510
of netting and this is optional and scissors.
Alright now that you have all the materials

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.290
you will need, it's time to get started.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:56.480
You'll need to assemble the pattern. Instructions
are available on Fleecefun.com's channel.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.120
When cutting the fringe and I do recommend
that you pre-cut the fringe because it will

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:07.590
be easier, cut all the way down the black
line to the outline of the pattern.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.159
Once you've assembled and cut out your pattern,
it's time to cut out the fabric. Cutting out

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:19.470
this pattern nicely is crucial for this pattern
working properly. Please take your time when

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.160
cutting out this pattern. When cutting out
this pattern, cut out the entire outline first

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:28.940
then go back and cut your slits. It will be
easier. Cut out one of the purse body and

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:35.390
one of the handle. If you want to use netting,
cut out an additional purse body from the

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:43.330
netting.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:49.020
Great now that you've cut out all the pieces,
it's time to start tying.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:57.880
Now it's time to tie the purse together.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:03.660
Take one of the handle where the fringe is
and taking one side of the purse, matching

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:13.069
up the first strand with the first strand,
tie them together using a square knot or a bow.

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.910
 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:38.420
Tie all the way down one side and do the same
on the opposite side and then tie the bottom.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:44.859
And that's it! Fast, simple, and very cute.
