00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:07.480
In continuation to installing the front cross
member, now we're going to install- before

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.660
installing the rear cross member you need
to install the zerk fittings which are supplied.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:34.770
To help the fitting slide in easier, put a
little grease on the ends and hammer in. Now

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:38.430
after you install the zerk fittings, you're
going to put in the metal sleeves into the

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.510
zerk fittings. Just like with the zerk fittings,
put a little bit of grease on and hammer in.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:01:08.690
And make sure when hitting, that the fitting
seats all the way through on both sides. Once

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.870
both fittings are set and go to go and now
you're ready to install the rear cross member.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:20.040
Now we're placing in the rear cross member.
Make sure that you have the sides set right

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.460
because there is a dip down in the passenger
side, for the front differential. Slide it

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.510
in place. Install the bolts facing from the
head of the bolt from the rear. Now the rear

00:01:29.510 --> 00:02:03.340
cross member is installed. All

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.629
right now before installing the control arms
into the new brackets, you must grind out

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:14.329
the outer flange on the control arms so that
they will fit in the bracket. What you do

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:20.109
is you take a grinder, grind the little lip
that's in the control arm, flush with the

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:26.299
control arm. After that's done paint it black,
paint over it so there's no rust. Then you

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:32.329
disassemble the factory torsion bar bracket
form the control arm which is right here.

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:36.499
The kit supplies a new bracket. The new bracket
will be bolted to the new control arm and

00:02:36.499 --> 00:02:40.430
once that's all bolted on, that's it, now
you start to install the rest of the lift.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.170
The control arm will go on and the new spindle
will go on. Which is right here. You'll install

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.420
the hub assembly to this and bolt everything
back up. Tighten everything, torque it all

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:58.799
down. With that the whole front installation's
done. Mount the, mount the wheels and tires.

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.300
For the fronts done torque the torsion bar
exactly to the same torque and specifications

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:07.049
that it was when you took it off and that's
it for the front.
