00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.000
Hello everyone
World Rubber Market

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.410
Is Yassun
This table tennis Chiebukuro is

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:12.690
A way to turn off the strong horizontal under rotation
And I'm going to do

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.599
This content
You do not cut the well serve

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.130
Is for beginners
Since it has been the subject

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.560
Thank you
This time we are you questions

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.369
To get the horizontal under rotation expired
How do I

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.169
Please tell me
By that

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:30.679
As much as possible this trouble
Resolution can be as

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.500
And I want to do
Of this horizontal under rotation

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.040
I'd way to cut
The basic idea

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:45.040
Not only horizontal under
Toka horizontal rotation under rotation Toka reverse

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.710
In various Serve
Since the application can be thinking of

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.760
It 's not Come Deke horizontal under rotation
To be wanna cut Serve

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.780
Come for those who are wondering
I want leaked by reference to

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.780
It has become the contents
By increasing the serve of sharpness

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.570
Of course the other party of
Receive mistake also then you Sasoe

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.830
Opponent What receive
The choices me or trying to

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.080
Since it can reduce
The Tteyuu Saab

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.670
And I think that's one ball first attack
Come working on practice

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.830
I think wants Na
Just train Serve

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.080
When the game of winning percentage also up
Because you think the Saab practice

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.320
Please do each and every
In how

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:23.560
Next under rotation has expired
The principle I mean out

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:28.310
I'm going to explain
First, make a strong rotation

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.640
To Kill
A strong energy

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.810
I do not and over not
To make strong energy

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:40.500
The moment of the force hitting swing
In fast Tara this slow

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:43.590
Only slow Nari amount of rotation
Can not be ensured

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:45.680
Firmly fast swing
I'll be

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.290
If a fast swing
To much ball

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.130
Force adds
Joined the way of power, for example,

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:59.020
Once you've played me bread
Of emphasis on speed

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.520
Is applied way of force
The thin and become you to the contrary in

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:10.759
I catch the ball thin
Rather than to be shed and bread

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.989
The top of the racket
It is an image, such as rolling

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:17.019
Fast grasped if you cut
When was this

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:20.239
I'm a lower rotary
By doing so

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:26.939
Firmly the rotation
You can apply

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.040
Increase the amount of rotation
Firmly speed

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.980
In order to put the
The backswing

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.810
Big or Toka
When was the only course superficial

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:37.079
Since not out me fast swing
Taking large

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:39.769
To come waving Te Gun~tsu at the shoulder
Finally me Kyukyukyu

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.700
a strong rotation by putting
Toka or over

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.650
Please be in Fu Tteyuu
To turn off the horizontal under rotation

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:51.959
When say and what to do
When you turn off the ball

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.340
Rather than when you turn off the bottom
Little racket

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.829
Obliquely downward and to stand slightly
Under oblique than yourself

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:03.730
Please try to be able
It is too upright here

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.749
Taking the right beside
And then you become a lateral rotation

00:03:06.749 --> 00:03:09.840
Since become lower rotary If you turn off the bottom
Initially about the middle

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.919
Next under from behind
To come pull back swing

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:20.439
If you turn off the place to apply here
Since facing up rotating

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:27.019
It is a place to go down this most
Here at the this diagonal

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:33.879
Please try to be able
Here is it is such feeling

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:39.889
The well serve at this time
If you try to control

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:44.359
Whether the cell is-to-bound
And weakly to think

00:03:44.359 --> 00:03:46.939
Try to control
You tend to lead to

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:49.840
Absolutely and that's it
The Tteyuu strong A blown rotation

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.129
From First, because put out not stand
Because I come out firmly amount of rotation

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.239
Over strong amount of rotation
Even if I flew

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.819
Anyway, so good
That is that it lacks a strong rotation

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:04.790
Please do
First of all, Toka or become a pan

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:07.400
At a slower swing
So that they do not become this happens

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:14.400
Firmly swing only
While early first amount of rotation

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:17.280
And gone out of the die to ensure
Control

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.180
Because do not have to be
I ensure the rotation amount

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:22.849
Every time firmly every time
I would like off a strong rotation

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:26.539
From where it was saying
Please start the practice

00:04:26.539 --> 00:04:31.259
The swing speed from there
The ball without loosening

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.900
Control
And if we do that Tteyuu

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.870
To naturally firmly
Low it was possible to control

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:40.080
Short cut lateral under rotation
Be put out that Tteyuu

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.409
I think that it will be able to
So that it is not struck in reverse

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:46.300
Thinking and so as not to be struck
From control

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.389
And will contain
The Tteyuu rotation

00:04:48.389 --> 00:04:52.270
Can not be well secured
Consciously only control

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.680
It does not cut so much
Firmly Since sounding would

00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:02.680
Strong impact waving arms
be regarded

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:07.710
I bet a good rotation
I think the secret kana

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.590
In First suddenly practice
Rather than to be used is

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:14.139
Firmly doing Saab practice
Cut anyway cut anyway

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.080
And be aware that Tteyuu
Please do

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.870
While this is multiplied by the strong rotation
The well serve

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:23.889
How kana you think because you put out
By all means practice Saab practice

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:29.039
Toka under rotation to not only beside under rotation
Horizontal rotation on a rotating course

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:31.120
yg serve Toka also
I'd all of together

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:33.849
That way
I think that the Na want to do

00:05:33.849 --> 00:05:35.860
Come everyone
Please try it
