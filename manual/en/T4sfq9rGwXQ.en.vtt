00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:05.160
I'm going to talk to you a little bit about
skateboard stance. The very first part of

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:13.410
learning how to skateboard is to ask yourself
where do I place my feet on the board. One

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.420
foot your front foot is going to be placed
over the front trucks and your back foot is

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.340
going to be placed over the back trucks. Now
the question is which way do I stand? Do I

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:35.480
keep my front foot forward? Do I keep my left
foot forward? Standing on a skateboard with

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.990
your right foot forward and pushing with your
left is referred to as goofy footed. Standing

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:49.110
on a skateboard with your left foot forward
and pushing with your right is referred to

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.300
as regular footed. There is a third stance
which is not advised because it causes you

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:02.680
to lose your balance, it's called mango footed.
Mango footed individuals push off with their

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.600
front foot instead of pushing with their back.
The problem with mango footed stance is that

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.080
it causes you to have to shift your back foot
and pivot on the deck. This way it throws

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.470
off your balance and you are not able to get
as much speed. A goofy footed push your balanced

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.040
on the front foot. A regular footed push your
balanced on the front foot. But with a mango

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:34.150
push you are balanced on the back of the board
and to maintain stability have to pivot on

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:39.271
your back foot while rolling and shift your
foot around. By the time you're pushing a

00:01:39.271 --> 00:01:46.210
foot, it makes it back around you lost stability
and control. So remember always push with

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.060
the back foot no matter how you stand whether
you stand goofy with your right foot forward

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.320
or regular with your left foot forward. Always
avoid mango footed which is pushing with your

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.880
front foot.
