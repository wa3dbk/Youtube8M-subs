Welcome to your Kiwicare guide to eradicating rodents.

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:14.460
Now that you've determined that rats or mice are the problem,

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.980
Kiwicare have a range of products to eradicate them.

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.420
NO Rats &amp; Mice One Feed blocks.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.500
One feed is sufficient to kill rats or mice. 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.760
The One Feed block can be used both indoors and outdoors

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:33.020
because it is formulated to resist both heat and moisture. 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.000
They also have a hole in the middle so can be easily secured in place.

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:39.200
NO Rats &amp; Mice Bait Blocks. 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:45.039
The NO Rats &amp; Mice Bait Blocks contain a toxin that is more quickly broken down

00:00:45.039 --> 00:00:50.000
in rodent bodies, so it poses much less risk to scavenging animals.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.409
This block is weatherproof

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:54.200
and can be used both indoors and outdoors. 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.200
It's less toxic and therefore safer, but 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.699
it still must be kept out of the reach of children and pets.

00:01:00.699 --> 00:01:04.139
NO Rats &amp; Mice Dual Action Bait &amp; Powder.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.160
NO Rats &amp; Mice Dual Action Bait &amp; Powder is either eaten as a bait

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.950
or when the rodents run through the
powder they pick that up in their paws and fur,

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.110
and then ingest during preening.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.760
The Bait &amp; Powder is for use dry indoor situations.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.080
Sprinkle a line of Bait &amp; Powder in roof voids where rodents run.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.080

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:34.200
The NO Rat and NO Mice bait stations

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:39.140
protect children, pets and other non-target animals from the bait.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.620
The NO Rats and NO Mice bait stations

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:45.160
protect bait from moisture and
contamination.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:50.229
And provide a place where rodents feel
comfortable and therefore eat more bait.

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.380
