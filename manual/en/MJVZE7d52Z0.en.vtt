A Smile of Hope

00:00:09.295 --> 00:00:11.017
In the name of Allah (God) The Compassionate,
The Merciful

00:00:11.318 --> 00:00:13.080
Welcome to a new episode of Basmit Amal
(A Smile of Hope).

00:00:13.394 --> 00:00:15.932
Smile of hope today is from Australia.

00:00:17.376 --> 00:00:22.511
The story’s headline is “A thief, but a human”

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.580
this is how I found it on an article in an
Australian newspaper.

00:00:29.142 --> 00:00:34.799
He was a thief specialized in picking
women’s handbags.

00:00:35.253 --> 00:00:43.450
He used to snatch the bags
of the unheeding women.

00:00:48.857 --> 00:00:57.354
One day he found an unheeding woman as usual,
and snatched her handbag.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:09.012
The women screamed but in vain when the thief
went home he didn’t find any money in the handbag

00:01:09.595 --> 00:01:22.581
he only found a camera, a good one and an envelope,
when he looked at the pictures of the camera,

00:01:23.116 --> 00:01:34.487
it was all pictures of the woman
he stole with children.

00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:44.756
So many pictures, he figured out that
they must be her children.

00:01:45.484 --> 00:01:48.923
when he took a look at the envelope,

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:51.598
he found these touching words written:

00:01:52.331 --> 00:01:56.643
-“dear children, after I got cancer,

00:01:57.817 --> 00:02:08.833
I have left this camera to record my memories
with you through the pictures in this camera

00:02:11.704 --> 00:02:20.587
please keep these pictures with you after I die” .

00:02:21.326 --> 00:02:27.227
And she put her name at the end of the letter.

00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:30.740
The thief was touched.

00:02:31.195 --> 00:02:33.001
Yes, he is a thief, but he was a human.

00:02:33.472 --> 00:02:36.432
He determined to give her back the camera,

00:02:37.113 --> 00:02:42.956
but didn’t know how he tried his best
to reach the woman,

00:02:45.653 --> 00:02:55.928
when he couldn’t he turned himself to the police,
so that he can reach the woman

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.265
and give her back the camera.

00:03:08.245 --> 00:03:12.771
Imagine how happy the woman was,

00:03:13.619 --> 00:03:18.823
I am telling you this story to tell you that
no matter how people look harsh,

00:03:20.278 --> 00:03:22.769
but from inside, he is a human.

00:03:26.355 --> 00:03:30.476
Never think that those around you
are no longer humans

00:03:32.222 --> 00:03:38.027
no one is devoid of mercy that Allah
has put inside him.

00:03:39.281 --> 00:03:41.307
No matter how bad he is.

00:03:41.744 --> 00:03:45.111
Look at the human inside him, and look
at the human inside you

00:03:45.534 --> 00:03:49.354
Look at the human inside those you hate.

00:03:50.219 --> 00:03:58.049
Then you will find a human,
and will also find a smile of hope.

00:03:58.975 --> 00:04:01.581
Thank you and May the peace and blessings
of Allah be upon you .
