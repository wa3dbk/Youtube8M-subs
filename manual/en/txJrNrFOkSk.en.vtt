00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.440
- Don't thay say looks count most?
- As they do in this case.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:16.420
- Check out what I'm cruising in.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.880
- The Ford F-series pick-up is the most sold car in America.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:28.240
- The Yanks are pick-up crazy.
- Nearly all families must have a pick-up!

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:35.040
- And we've got the chance to put it through its paces.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.580
- I wonder what Alén will think?

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.260
- Can you hear me Tervis?
- Tervis where are you?

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.460
- Not far now. Did you miss me?

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.200
- Yeah I've really missed you...
- Hey you do remember we're doing the pick-up today?

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:02.980
- Yep and you're gonna be surprised. I've got a beauty...

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.760
- Do you want to see it?
- Ok lets see it!

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.100
- Look to your side. 650cc coming at ya!

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:13.180
- As I said it's the looks that count most...

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.020
- That is nice. What is it?

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.680
- You'll soon find out. Follow me, I know a good spot.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.800
- It's wet today.
- Yeah swimming weather but I think we've got right cars for it.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.540
- Weather like Colorado!
- I want to show you the standard American pick-up.

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:03.900
- The Ford F-150, 6,2 litre, 4-wheel drive V8. 
- It weighs just under 3000kg.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.120
- Its heavy...a bit like you.
- Oh thanks!

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:14.060
- Its got the off road feel but still a street model.
- It's pimped out a little.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.540
- Mine too!
- Whats Europes answer?

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:31.780
- Europes answer is the 3,2 litre, 200-HP Ford Ranger.
- And I bet it gives America a run for its money!

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.960
- Ok! Shall we let Europe speak first? 
- Yes lets.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.620
- I coming too!
- I think it might be too slippery for it though...

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:46.680
- This car was designed for the Sahara desert, the Autobahn and the snowy roads of Lapland.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:51.480
- The Ford Ranger was chosen this years pick-up of the year.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.640
- And here we go!
- The pick-up show!

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.060
- The new Ranger was made for the most important markets in Europe.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.900
- It's had a total rehall.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:13.200
- The motor, gearbox, frame, suspension, steering, brakes, base, the metal surface and interior.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.820
- Everything is new!

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.640
- The load capasity is better than ever and the pulling power is best in class.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.660
- It's designed for those who want to use it for work and play.

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.940
- For instance these clowns.

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:30.220
- I'm driving nicely even though it's too slippery...
- I said it's slippery...

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.780
- It's seems easy to control...
- Yeah when you know how.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.200
- That's these babies!

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:53.180
- A forest road.
- We're doing 80km/h...

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:59.000
- ...and this is quite a difficult road. All I have to do is keep it in the lane.

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.320
- Now I understand why you love pick-ups.

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:09.820
- I got a taste for them while driving the Dakar Rally.
- I drove a Dakar pick-up. That's where it started.

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.420
- It's got a speedlimiter though...
- Yeah it's limited to 100km/h.

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:22.480
- It's probably not made for this kind of use though...
- No that's true! We're on the limit here!

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:41.640
- The Ranger can tow up to 3350kg.
- And this 4x4 model can drive in more than 80cm of water...

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:43.640
- ...while carrying a full load...

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:58.700
- Ok, we've seen we can get good speeds out of this too...We could try something more demanding.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:09.080
- With the weather like this we've been driving on 4H.
- This has 2H, 2 wheel drive, 4H and Low.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.360
- Pretty amazing.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.120
- And downhill slowly...

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:19.740
- And we're on Low.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.660
- It's nice to have buttons.
- You can feel it push back.

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:29.520
- It's like there's no challenge. Its' so easy.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:33.660
- Just keep the wheels turning and you won't get caught.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:39.480
- But it'd be nice to have more feel in the steering...It's a little slow.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.420
- Because the features are so good you tend to drive fast.
- Yeah I see.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.940
- So how do you rate the Ford Ranger?

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:59.860
- I think Fords got a good pick-up here. It's got driveability, feel, sportiness...Everything.

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:06.380
- It has durability, power, looks, safety and comfort.
- So it get's a high score.

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:13.940
- But the only thing is the price: 50,200€
- And how much is tax?

00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:17.840
- 11,000€ almost 12,000€ tax...That's just wrong.

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:22.000
- A car like this would be usefull in normal use...
- Especially in this country.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.320
- Good! On to the next one!

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:29.620
- Do tell me more!
- That's that!
- That's that!
