00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:06.310
Hi there!

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:11.690
My name is Zed the Squarehead, and I know
that there’s a champion in every kid.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.110
Big kids, small kids.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.050
2 eyed, 3 eyed, 4 eyed kids.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.139
Doesn’t matter.

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.080
There is definitely a champion in all kids!

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.990
But sometimes we forget that.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.310
Sometimes a kid will try to feel cool or strong
by choosing to be mean to those who are smaller

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.880
or weaker than them.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.279
They might pick on people who can’t do or
say anything back.

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.530
They might do it over and over, too.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:35.630
Have you ever seen that happen?

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:40.640
Well that kind of behavior is called bullying,
and it’s not cool.

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.260
But you can do something to stop bullying
as it is happening!

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:51.140
If you know a few tricks, then you can actually
choose to stop the meanness right in its tracks.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:54.210
You can choose to stand up to bullying.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.440
And you can be an upstander!

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.180
Pay close attention to this scene.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:01.570
Here’s the playground.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.500
Here’s the bully who’s trying to feel
cool by picking on

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.000
This guy, Tar.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.560
Now, here’s a bystander.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.680
A bystander is someone that sees bullying
happen, and doesn’t know what to do.

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.080
And back here we have NED.

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.760
NED’s going to start off a bystander.

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.690
But when the bullying starts, he does know
what to do.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.520
He’s going to choose to be an upstander!

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.800
NED’s going to stand up to bullying!

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.350
And when he does, he chooses from four upstanding
options:

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.600
1.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.810
Be a buddy.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:42.369
When NED sees Tar getting bullied, he shows
Tar that he has a friend.

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.240
Bully’s aren’t used to their targets having
a buddy!

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.569
It could change everything.

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:49.159
2.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.759
Interrupt.

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:54.819
When the bullying starts, NED finds a way
to interrupt.

00:01:54.819 --> 00:02:00.420
Here, he interrupts by asking Tar to come
and join him at the electro-ball hoop!

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.600
When NED interrupts, he gives Tar a reason
to walk away from the problem.

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.600
3.

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.530
Speak out.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.400
This one takes tons of courage!

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:15.100
Here, NED faces the person who is bullying
and says,

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.300
“that’s mean.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.400
don’t do that.”

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.430
By speaking out about what is happening, it
shows that meanness is not welcome.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.189
It also gets other people to look!

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:29.950
And they might join as upstanders, too.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:30.950
4.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.390
Tell someone.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.810
Whether it’s during the bullying or after
it, NED’s going to choose to tell an adult

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.040
about it.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.819
This is NOT tattling, because he is not trying
to get someone in trouble.

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.240
He wants to keep someone safe.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.420
It takes courage and hard work to be an upstander.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:54.820
But by being an upstander you’ll be an awesome
friend to someone when they need it most.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:58.780
And the letters in NED’s name can help!

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:04.180
N - never give up on helping your school to
be safe!

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:09.270
E - encourage others to be upstanders with
you!

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:16.959
D - do your best with all the upstanding ways
that you can use to stop bullying at your school.

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:24.470
If you know the N.E. and D. in NED’s name,
you’ll probably choose to be upstanding

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:26.220
whenever you see bullying.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:29.880
When bullying takes place, you’ll make a
champion choice to:

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:31.060
Be a buddy.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.420
or
Interrupt!

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:33.980
or
Speak out.

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.960
And also,
Tell someone.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.840
If you do any mixture of those things when
you see bullying happen, you'll go from being

00:03:41.849 --> 00:04:00.909
a bystander to being an upstander at your
school.
