00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:06.140
As you watch just about anything
grow you often find yourself looking

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.719
back and wondering where the time has gone.

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.049
That's certainly the case here at the
Blue Grass Chemical Agent-Destruction

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.769
Pilot Plant,

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:18.010
where 2010 was a year of real
progress. "Yeah currently we're at

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:19.820
twenty five percent of the way done,

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.759
and that's really quite an accomplishment
for this year".

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:27.000
It's almost to the point that someone who
last saw the plant in January might

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.179
not even recognize it anymore.

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.689
One big difference would be that we have
walls now, like this blast containment wall on

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:35.010
the munitions demilitarization building.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.219
Walls like this one will protect workers
and the environment in the unlikely

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.850
event of an explosion during processing.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.649
Workers began placing these walls back in
September, and

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.700
despite the cold now they'll continue
placing concrete throughout the winter.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.440
"We're under winter caring conditions,

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.450
so we have a heated enclosure, we have

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.090
blanketing on all the form work.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.740
Yeah the idea is to adapt to the conditions that you're facing."

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.020
And the winter conditions have already gotten
pretty harsh this year, with single digit

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:02.550
temperatures and a good amount of snow
accumulation.

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.790
Those kind of conditions make it hard
for construction workers to get their job

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.050
done, and that's why progress here at the
utility building has been so important.

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.850
It's really beneficial to be able to have indoor work, as well as outdoor work, in order to maximize

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.500
the efficiency of

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.110
our craft. In January,

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:22.810
we had nothing but a concrete slab here.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.619
Since that time we've had our local
subcontractor come in, N.P. Kelly,

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:27.710
and they have erected

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.570
and they have erected

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.720
the building itself, and have also installed the roofing and siding.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:40.720
The best thing about working inside is you don't have to have so much cold weather gear on. You don't have to worry about the rain, the snow, the cold, your fingers freezing up, you know, getting numb.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.290
The control and support building isn't completely
enclosed, but it does have three walls, and

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:48.960
workers are finishing up the roof.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.000
As we get

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.770
more and more buildings enclosed, we can

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.640
bring on additional craft

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.240
and start the interior features such as piping and electrical.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.920
Powering the site through the future is
another milestone of 2010, the fully

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.010
operational 138 KV substation

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.549
which provides electricity to the plant.

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:12.209
Soon the fire water pump house will be
operational, and will provide fire

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:15.029
suppression throughout the site.

00:02:15.029 --> 00:02:18.349
Now that it's 2011, we're looking
forward to continued progress throughout

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:19.510
the plant,

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.529
including building up the Supercritical
Water Oxidation Building.

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:26.440

the duration of the project.
