00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:24.180
with almost every router available.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.220
The CRB7 functions right out of the box

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.489
as an Offset Base. The large footprint
adds stability to your edge forming

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:33.750
operations,

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.750
keeping the router stable even when
working around corners

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:47.739
 

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.000
The included pivot pin and screw

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:54.170

to nearly nine inches in radius. The
micro adjust wheel

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.850
allows for precise setting of the bit
so that your cuts

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.009
are exactly where you want them to be
and unlike most other router jigs

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:20.679
circle size adjustment can be made
without disturbing the position on the

00:01:20.679 --> 00:01:27.679
board.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.119

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.880
This method also allows for making
V groove,

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:11.310
fluted or even bead bored faux panels.

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:18.310

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:09.870
allow you to set the cut precisely where
you want it.

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.410
the edge guide comes pre-drilled with
holes for mounting a sacrificial fence.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:23.060
