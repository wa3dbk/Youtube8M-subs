00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.980
One of the basic foundational exercises in
Qigong is what's known as the horse stance,

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.870
or what I like to affectionately call "hugging
a tree". In this exercise, you really have

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.460
to work within your own ability level. So
start small. You can tremendous gains from

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.890
some simple, very shallow postures, and then
you can work your way up as you build that

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.259
foundation of strength for your body. So,
the basic movements for this are we're going

00:00:25.259 --> 00:00:29.140
to just go either shoulder-width apart, or
some people like to go a little bit further

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.800
than shoulder-width apart. And you'll see
why when we go a little bit lower with this.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.670
Your feet are parallel. So your feet are pointing
straight ahead. And then we're just going

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.500
to make like we're sitting on a bench. We're
just going to sit straight down, ever so slightly.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:49.399
So my knees are bent. My back is straight.
And then we're going to put our hands; again,

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:54.720
the elbows are slightly lower than our palms,
and our fingertips are almost touching. There's

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:00.289
a little space between our fingers. And we're
relaxed. This is a great posture to be in

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.660
while you're practicing your belly-breathing.
So we can slowly do some belly-breathing that

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:17.530
we explained on another segment, or we can
take this to some more advanced levels where

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.470
we start to sit lower. And so what's important
as we sit lower is that our back stays straight,

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.540
still like we're sitting on a very low stool,
now. And then if I look forward, I can still

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:35.570
see my toes. My knees don't expand out past
my toes. So we can take that to a larger exercise,

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:42.100
which is similar to a deep knee bend, what
we call a danyu, where we crease down. And

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.360
this helps to loosen up the sacrum and the
spine. Don't try this if you have any kind

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.330
of knee or low back problems, unless you're
working with a Qigong instructor or a Tai

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:58.060
Chi instructor who is familiar with these
exercises. For most people, just start with

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:02.330
this. And within about a minute or two, you'll
actually feel some muscles getting quite a

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:05.000
workout. After five minutes, you'll be sweating.
