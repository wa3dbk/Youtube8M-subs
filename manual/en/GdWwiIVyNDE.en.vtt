00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.000
Hi I'm Sarah Maxwell and I'm a fitness
coach and have been for more than 20 years.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.500
I'm also NIVEA's fitness and lifestyle expert
and I'm here, in Montréal, at Ubisoft, doing

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.400
something very exciting.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I think what people are going to take away from this game
 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
is the fact that exercise can
be fun and it doesn't have to be intimidating.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:48.000
And I think that what is so amazing that Nivea
has chosen me to do this when there's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.190
hundreds of thousands of trainers out there
is thefact that I'm really quite a normal kind of person:

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.010
I have a normal kind of life that
other people have.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.809
I'm not going down to some route of obsessive
fitness.

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:07.479
And what I want everybody to get away from
this is that you can work out, it can be fun,

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:09.670
you don't have to be perfect.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.450
Nivea came to me because of my philosophy.
They didn't just choose me and say: "We want you to say this".

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.780
Because this is what you get, this is absolutely me

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.159
and I'm real.
And they said: "We like the way you're thinking"

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.159
"We want to be really honest and say to people
that in order to get maximum benefit from

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:30.469
this cream, put the cream on, look at what
you eat and do some exercise

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:37.380
I think the combination of myself, Your Shape game and NIVEA
are an incredible combination.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.990
Because a lot of people who have never even
considered using a video-game, and certainly

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.429
not for exercise will all of a sudden go:
"Hang on a minute. I can do this!"

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:50.000
Alright! Nice work! Let's stick with it!

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.259
With Nivea being such a trusted brand, it's

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.960
something that people can say: "If Nivea is
doing this, this is ok."

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:04.619
I'm gonna be appearing in Your Shape: Fitness
Evolved and we have a very specific NIVEA

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.619
program which I devised, that you can fit in
around your lifestyle.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.310
My name is Nicola Godin.
I work at Ubisoft Montréal and I'm one of

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:26.510
the game designers on the project Your Shape:
Fitness Evolved.

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:32.010
We are here with a big team and especially
with Sarah Maxwell who is from NIVEA.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:39.010
She came to Montréal to work with us and
build a routine with exercises that she made.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:43.790
Because it's a long process to build these
animations by hand, we needed to come to this

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.489
MoCap studio and do motion capture
As you can see behind, Sarah Maxwell has already

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:54.659
her suit on, with the captors on it.
We can track all her movements on the screen

00:02:54.659 --> 00:03:01.659
and make sure to process them and make the
best exercise possible for the game.

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:20.209
After this workout with Nivea and Your Shape:
Fitness Evolved, you'll find that it's going

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:23.349
to work your whole body.
And the whole point of it is that you got

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.799
a fantastic workout from top to toe including
the abdominals, because there is a lot of

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:33.209
coastability within this workout so it's really
worth doing it.

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.870
Putting the cream on, doing the exercise and
eating well!
