Hi my name is Mitra Chester and I am at the
Deluxe Resale Shop in Eugene, Oregon. And

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.000
today I am going to show you some different
techniques on how to customize your jeans.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.820
There are various ways to customize them.
You can do slashes, various forms of wear.

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:22.620
Holes with patches underneath, holes with
patches over. Various types of fading in certain

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:27.920
areas, and bleaching, whiskers and various
types of different kind of marks and cuts

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:33.399
on the edges and what not. You can also take
in the leg, hem them up. And we are just going

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:37.989
to go through real simple ways of doing all
these. So the supplies you are going to need

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:45.600
to do these effects today are some pins, sand
paper. This is one eighty grade, some spare

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:51.969
denim. Maybe an exacto knife, scissors a bleach
pen and some chalk. It is very important when

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:57.260
you are customizing your jeans that you put
them on first; and have an idea of what effects

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.359
you want to achieve and mark with some chalk
while they are on you where you want those

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:07.479
effects to be. With the whisker effect I think
it is pretty important that you mark it on

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.170
your body so the whiskers don't look really
awkward and fake which they kind of do in

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:17.590
this pair. So just kind of do some marks.
Have in mind what you want. Mark it with the

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:23.969
chalk. Take your pants off and first we are
going to show you how to do this kind of just

00:01:23.969 --> 00:01:31.140
fading patch. So kind of this effect you can
achieve in small areas with and exacto knife.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.800
By just scraping vertically the denim with
a knife. You want to do this, so that will

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.420
create some small areas. If you want a larger
area like on the thigh or the knee you can

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:53.789
use sandpaper. Basically by find an area and
scruff it up and once you wash and dry this.

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:57.499
Which is a very important step with all of
these techniques it will show up a little

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:03.140
more. But you can see how that will give you
a kind of ruffed up kind of faded and worn

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:09.390
in area. That is actually going to create
this after it is washed and dried. And this

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:14.360
exacto knife technique done vertically is
going to create this. If you do it horizontally

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.590
it is going to create more of a snagged exposing
certain threads. So you are just going to

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:23.630
scrape it across horizontally. Usually in
one direction helps. You can also use scissors

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:31.000
to do this or a pocket knife. Basically any
kind of edge but it will start exposing certain

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:38.570
threads. And basically achieve there you go
after awhile. This type of look. With the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.840
holes. This is a hole, this is a slash. It
is as simple as basically, you can also rip

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.370
them. But it is pretty easy to just cut either
a hole. So you want to just kind of, if you

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.790
want a vertical slash. Start with a small.
You can either just rip it or cut it with

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:03.520
the scissors. Across like that. That actually
ripped in both directions so it is easier

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.960
to have more control with scissors. Or you
can just mark a hole and cut within the perimeter

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.440
of the hole. Because when you wash and dry
them it is going to fray out a little bit.

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:18.740
And if you want the hole this size you want
to keep within the perimeter of that. And

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:23.100
any kind of alteration you want to do to the
leg, you want to try your jeans on inside

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:29.480
out. Have someone pin them on you. Maybe taking
them in or pin them up for a hem. And then

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:35.620
sow along the pin line and cut off the access
when you are done. Maybe zigzag stitch along

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.621
the frayed edge. If you want the bleach line
look you can basically take your bleach pen.

00:03:40.621 --> 00:03:45.790
If you want a crease down the front, you want
to iron a crease that is going to be centered

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:51.510
between your two side hems. So you are going
to fold it like this, iron it. Take your bleach

00:03:51.510 --> 00:04:01.070
pen and basically apply a bead of bleach along
that line. And then if you have your whisker

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:07.850
effect, you marked it with a chalk. You are
basically going copy over the chalk lines

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.700
with a bleach pen. And you can make them a
little more subtle or faded or precise. It

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:18.410
kind of depends. But you basically use it
just like a pen. And most bleach pens do need

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.670
to be activated with some hot water. So you
can either do this. Throw them right in the

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:26.690
washing machine or spray it with some warm
water before you actually do the effect. But

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.400
hopefully it won't cover up the chalk marks.
So those are the techniques you can use to

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.500
customize your jeans.
