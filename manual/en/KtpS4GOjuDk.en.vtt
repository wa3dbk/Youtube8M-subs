00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.020
I need to know how to get my PS4 controller
to charge.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.440
The light bar will blink orange as it charges
the controller, and when charging is complete,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.990
the light bar turns off.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:18.360
Thus the unit may not be charging because
it is already charged.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.990
I think the controller is dead.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:22.450
What do I do?

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.860
The controller is charged when you connect
the controller to the PS4 with the USB cable.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.730
Did you use the right type of cable and make
sure it is fully plugged in at both ends?

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.300
That’s the first thing I checked.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.260
My next suggestion is changing out the cable,
just in case someone whipped it around too

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.140
much and broke a copper cable inside.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.670
It is not obviously broken.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.840
It should be obvious that the PS4 won’t
charge the controller if it does not have

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.120
power.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.240
If you unplugged the PS4 to save power or
hard-reboot it, the thing cannot charge the

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.240
controller.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.650
The PS4 is plugged in, as is the controller.

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.470
The PS4 can charge the controller if it is
on or in rest mode, but it typically won’t

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.030
if it is turned off.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.720
I do not think I ever turn it off.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:12.810
I play constantly.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.150
The console won’t automatically charge the
thing while in rest mode.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.630
Go to settings, power save settings, set functions
available in rest mode, supply power to USB

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.630
ports.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.070
I’ll check that, but I wonder if the controller
will work very long after charging.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.100
If you play the controller until it dies,
it will take two hours to charge.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.960
If you do not let it charge long enough, it
will seem never to be charged.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.150
So I’ll leave it on overnight.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.570
Remember that batteries need to be in an environment
between 50 and 86 degrees to have their ideal

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.880
life, as does the controller.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:55.479
I do not let my house get that hot or that
cold, so how could that affect things?

00:01:55.479 --> 00:01:59.650
If you have the controller locked up with
the PS4 in a cabinet where there is not enough

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.159
air flow and it all overheats, the controller
may not be charging because the console is

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.989
shut down or the batteries are essentially
inoperable.

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.460
I can check to see if the thing is overheating.

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:16.489
I’m definitely hot under the collar from
it seemingly dying all the time.

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:21.680
If you do not use the controller much, make
sure to fully charge it often so that it does

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.389
not chemically reset the battery to a half
charge or less.

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:29.250
I’ve heard of that problem with cell phone
batteries.

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.799
Sony says to fully charge them at least once
a year, so that the battery’s memory does

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:35.950
not reset to zero.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.500
If I go that long without using the controller,
it is because virtual reality is finally real.
