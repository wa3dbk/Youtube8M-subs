00:00:01.472 --> 00:00:03.906
Is the light
keeping you awake?

00:00:03.974 --> 00:00:05.475
No.

00:00:13.484 --> 00:00:15.818
Ahh.

00:00:17.321 --> 00:00:19.188
Your breathing
has become erratic.

00:00:19.256 --> 00:00:21.357
A torg for your thoughts?

00:00:21.425 --> 00:00:24.360
Beldar,
are you content with me?

00:00:24.428 --> 00:00:27.863
Of course.
Why would I not be?

00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:31.867
Now, I would like to
enter my slar phase.

00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:33.369
Let us suppose

00:00:33.437 --> 00:00:36.372
For some reason
my life function ceased.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.873
What would you do?

00:00:37.941 --> 00:00:39.875
I would
incinerate your carcass

00:00:39.943 --> 00:00:42.878
In the tradition
of obedai the obtuse.

00:00:42.946 --> 00:00:45.381
Would you find
a new genetomate

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:47.883
To bring
to our goz chamber...

00:00:47.951 --> 00:00:49.452
And propagate?

00:00:50.954 --> 00:00:53.889
Ah, my most precious one,
I would collapse.

00:00:53.957 --> 00:00:57.893
I would draw the shades
and live in the dark.

00:00:57.961 --> 00:01:00.396
I would never leave my slarpad.

00:01:00.464 --> 00:01:03.399
My fluids would coagulate,
my cone would shrivel...

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:06.402
And I would die
miserable and lonely.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:08.471
The stench would be great.

00:01:09.807 --> 00:01:12.608
Oh, beldar, you have
made me very happy.

00:01:12.676 --> 00:01:14.977
Yes. I know.
Good night.

00:01:21.919 --> 00:01:23.853
Life on earth
is good.

00:01:23.921 --> 00:01:25.354
I agree.

00:01:25.422 --> 00:01:27.924
Stability and contentment
have been achieved.

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:33.930
[snoring]
