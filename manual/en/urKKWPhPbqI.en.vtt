00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:07.200
This video is to demonstrate the basic steps
in washing down a wellscreen.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:13.020
More complete information is found at www.drillyourownwell.com

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:19.640
This example will be a REALLY short well,
but hopefully you'll get the idea.

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.039
This is our drill pipe with a drill bit attached
to the bottom end.

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:39.340
At the top end are two fittings for connecting
hoses.

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.190
This is a well screen.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:55.770
It has hundreds of very small slits that will
let water in and keep sand out.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.580
This well screen has slits that are too large
to be practical

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.350
but will be used for demonstrative purposes
in the video.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:14.049
In my left hand is a drill pipe and in my
right hand is a well screen.

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.630
The hole is drilled by rotating the drill
pipe back and forth

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.350
as the drill pipe is pushed down into the
ground.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:34.439
Then, the drill head is removed and a well
screen is placed down through the drill pipe.

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:42.409
The drill pipe is then removed leaving only
the well screen in the ground.

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.119
Let's look at it again.

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.710
Water is run into the top of the drill pipe
through the fitting on the top of the drill

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.710
pipe.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:57.319
Then the hole is drilled by twisting the drill
pipe into the ground.

00:01:57.319 --> 00:02:01.889
Work the drill pipe up and down and side to
side to make sure it is really loose in the

00:02:01.889 --> 00:02:04.189
ground.

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:10.920
Then remove the water supply

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:19.470
and put the well screen down through the drill
pipe.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.980
Then remove the drill pipe from the ground.

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:26.500
This leaves only the well screen in the ground,
and that is your well.
