00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.370
In this clip we'll be talking about rehearsing
an orchestra and the various things you will

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.210
do to get an orchestra ready for a concert.
So the first thing is, you'll want to rehearse,

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:15.840
you know, run the piece the first time. And
this is more for a lot of youth orchestra

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.330
situations, younger orchestras, orchestras
that aren't at the top of the, you know, the

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:27.250
playing level, that are not quite professional
orchestras. And, so you'll want to, you'll

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.149
want to run the piece at least once, twice,
maybe three times and give everyone an idea

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:36.710
of what the piece sounds like together. It's
okay if it doesn't sound that great at the

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:43.149
beginning with a youth orchestra especially.
It will by the end. And so you'll run it a

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.129
couple of times. Once you feel like you've
gotten the most out of running it without

00:00:48.129 --> 00:00:52.899
having them work it, you'll let them take
it home for a week or whatever and they will

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:59.089
come back the next week, or the next day whenever
you rehearse again, and you will have, have

00:00:59.089 --> 00:01:05.859
them sometimes go into sectionals. And you'll
either have the sectional run by the section

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:10.130
leader of each section. So the concert master
might take the first violins or the first

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:16.220
and second violins and have a sectional. You
know, the, the oboe player might take the

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.450
woodwinds, whatever; whoever your leader player
is of each section will take those sections.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.580
And sometimes you'll go with a certain section.
Or you'll run a section that needs help. And

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:33.189
you'll go into different rooms at a different
time or at the same time and run a sectional.

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:39.310
And you will have them work out their own
part and then the ensemble, how it fits into

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.150
their little ensemble. So the woodwinds would
go with the woodwinds, or the flutes might

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.319
just go by themselves. And then it, they see
how it feels with just the woodwinds there

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:52.600
and then you put them back into the orchestra
and of course they sound a lot better because

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:59.010
the whole thing melds together much better.
So a lot of times, you'll, you know, you'll

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:03.329
need extra rooms and stuff for that, but you
can either do it at a separate time, or sometimes

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.140
you'll have the orchestra, you know, only
the woodwinds will come this week or only

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:11.040
the brass or whatever. So it just depends
on your situation.
