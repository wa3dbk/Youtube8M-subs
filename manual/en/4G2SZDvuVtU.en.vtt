Hi everyone! Welcome to Wendy's Lookbook.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.340
We're in my bathroom today, and it's going to be a special episode. 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.530
It's a fan request episode and I'm going to share with you how

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:13.400
I do my.... hair!

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:17.630
 I look like a bird. Kadoo!

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.140
So they key ingredient to doing this look is to have

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.160
is to have a day old hair. So yesterday, I
styled my hair, I woke up this morning and
So they key ingredient to doing this look is to have

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.480
is to have a day old hair. So yesterday, I
styled my hair, I woke up this morning and

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.140
I haven't washed it and it gives it that texture,
that oil that we really need to carve up that

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.000
big volume up here. I call it the runway look
because I saw it on the runway, and I was

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.350
playing with my hair for a little bit and
I figured out how to do it. So, I'm really

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.780
excited. Take a little clip, can you see it?

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:48.690
It's missing two teeth! 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.330
So what we're going to do is, we're just going to

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:57.100
to do is we're just going to messily gather
the top part of our hair. Like this. And we're

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.160
going to clip it. Now we're going to take
the whole thing, and just wrap it into a bun.

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.010
Yah.  Just really relaxed.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.060
And then we're going to....

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.500
I have these heandband things. 
I got them at Target for 2 for $3.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.230
We're just going to put the headband over
our little updo. 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.960
Okay, now we're done!

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.950
I'm just joking.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.950
So we're going to take it off...
adjust it. 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.060
Let it free flow, take a bobby pin. 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.150
And we're just going to gather certain spots on
the hair. 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.240
We're just going to pin it against our head.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.770
 And we can almost do this at a very random pace. 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.930
Then we take another rubber band, or whatever this is called. 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.610
And we're going to put it over our first one.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:49.250
We're just going to adjust to your liking.
How big, or how puffy you want it to be. 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.640
Comb out the front. 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:59.290
And if there's any loose hair, that's kind of out. 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:05.530
I just grab it, I just tuck it in and pin it again. 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.630
So it has that like, messy look. 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:13.710
And then, I take my hairspray

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:18.170
and then I sssssss all over it. That's pretty
much it. 

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.430
Thank you so much for being with me today.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.510
I hope that was helpful. I like
this look a lot, because it has a lot of volume

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:29.950
and it's just really messy. It has that relaxed
chic look. I usually wear it with a scarf,

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.950
I wear it with anything that would be more
of a statement piece here. So then my hair

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:42.400
would be out of the way. But, I hope you enjoy
it and I'll see you soon on Youtubeland. Bye!
