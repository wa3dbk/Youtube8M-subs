00:00:00.476 --> 00:00:15.096
[Music] Heather was a wonderful
child, a wonderful young woman.

00:00:15.446 --> 00:00:17.456
Very intelligent, and magical.

00:00:17.796 --> 00:00:19.096
She was magical in
a lot of ways.

00:00:19.156 --> 00:00:20.746
She always loved Disney World.

00:00:21.216 --> 00:00:22.016
Since she was five.

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:23.836
We took her when she was five.

00:00:24.146 --> 00:00:25.876
And she cried the
day we had to leave.

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:27.456
I mean, sobbed.

00:00:28.146 --> 00:00:32.056
And she said, from that moment
on, "One day, I'm gonna work

00:00:32.056 --> 00:00:33.706
in Disney and live in Florida."

00:00:34.426 --> 00:00:37.006
And so she made that
dream come true.

00:00:37.566 --> 00:00:39.606
She was engaged there.

00:00:39.876 --> 00:00:43.236
He proposed in October of 2007.

00:00:43.486 --> 00:00:46.456
We went down for the
Christmas holidays to meet

00:00:46.506 --> 00:00:47.426
with Heather and Patrick.

00:00:48.046 --> 00:00:50.746
January 3rd, we had a
meeting set up at noon

00:00:51.076 --> 00:00:52.506
at Disney's wedding planner.

00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:56.016
And we got there around
11:30, and little did we know

00:00:56.016 --> 00:00:59.706
that Heather was killed at
11:30, on her way to meet us

00:00:59.706 --> 00:01:00.396
at the wedding planner.

00:01:02.526 --> 00:01:04.036
She was about two
minutes from her home,

00:01:04.596 --> 00:01:08.456
and stopped at a red light
along with eight other vehicles.

00:01:08.686 --> 00:01:12.226
And a tractor-trailer driver
came up a little incline

00:01:12.986 --> 00:01:16.526
and hit all nine vehicles
stopped at that light.

00:01:22.576 --> 00:01:24.156
We were shocked, angered.

00:01:24.876 --> 00:01:25.466
Disbelief.

00:01:26.116 --> 00:01:27.716
Nothing is quite
the same anymore.

00:01:27.886 --> 00:01:29.386
Nothing will ever
be the same again

00:01:29.386 --> 00:01:30.596
because Heather should be here.

00:01:31.376 --> 00:01:33.086
She had a special little giggle,

00:01:33.486 --> 00:01:37.336
that she would just brighten
my day when I would hear it.

00:01:37.586 --> 00:01:39.036
And I think I miss
that the most.

00:01:39.036 --> 00:01:41.226
That little giggle is
what I miss the most.

00:01:41.986 --> 00:01:43.426
You hate to think
about the future.

00:01:43.426 --> 00:01:44.816
I have a hard time
with the future.

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:47.976
I have a hard time making new
memories cause I don't have

00:01:47.976 --> 00:01:48.656
new pictures.

00:01:48.776 --> 00:01:51.596
And it's hard to make
plans for future events

00:01:51.876 --> 00:01:55.056
because Heather can't be there.

00:01:55.136 --> 00:01:58.526
There's a simple analogy that
you can't write a paragraph

00:01:58.636 --> 00:02:00.206
and read one at the same time.

00:02:01.036 --> 00:02:04.776
And it's the same way our brains
are not designed to drive and be

00:02:04.776 --> 00:02:06.306
on that cell phone
at the same time.

00:02:06.926 --> 00:02:10.406
Everybody across the country
has a Heather in their life.

00:02:11.656 --> 00:02:13.296
It's someone that you
love with all your heart.

00:02:13.846 --> 00:02:16.186
And we have to do all
we can to protect them.

00:02:16.846 --> 00:02:17.616
Just speak out.

00:02:18.116 --> 00:02:18.856
Spread the word.

00:02:19.386 --> 00:02:21.236
Tell your children to stop.

00:02:21.336 --> 00:02:23.396
It's a dangerous thing.

00:02:23.426 --> 00:02:28.706
There's no disease,
there's no vaccine for this.

00:02:28.926 --> 00:02:39.116
All you have to do is
put down your phone.

00:02:39.116 --> 00:02:39.406
Common sense.

00:02:39.436 --> 00:02:39.726
Common sense.

00:02:39.726 --> 00:02:41.276
[Music] Distracted
driving kills,

00:02:41.976 --> 00:02:44.126
safe driving starts with you.
