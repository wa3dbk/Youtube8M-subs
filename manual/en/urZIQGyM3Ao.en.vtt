Edwin: Guitar timing in bachata, so the guitar
is the dominant instrument in the bachata,

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.710
and it is also called the requinto.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:16.049
The sound of it is going to go...

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:19.160
You're going to notice that the steps are
going to be more stacked up and a little bit

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:20.160
faster.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.200
Let's demonstrate that slow first.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:29.080
Five, six, seven and one and two and three,
tap, five and six and seven, tap...

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.140
Step, step, step, break.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.500
Step and step and step, break.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.400
Step and step and step, break.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.990
Step and step and step.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:44.020
So to break it down, first you need to make
sure that you feel light on your feet.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:45.650
Make sure that you don't plant your heels.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.610
Don't make yourself extra heavy and all you're
doing is kind of like tiptoeing to the side

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.020
so we're going to go, step, step, step, break.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.340
Step, step, step, break.

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.540
Very important that we switch sides on the
break, so that we can go to the other way.

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.920
Tap step, step, step, switch step, step, step
and switch.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.470
Daniela: And for ladies, we can always remember
we have our hips, move them, so when you're

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.110
doing this step your buttocks are moving out.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.490
So step, step, step, tap.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:20.869
Step, step, step, tap.

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:27.380
You can also use your hands, place it on your
waist or coming off.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.270
Once again, feel sexy.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:38.150
Edwin: And gentlemen, you can also use your
hands to maybe follow the ladies or roll your

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:40.939
hands in front or shoulders.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:44.100
Feel free to explore different things that
you can do with your upper body, so that you

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.560
don't feel stiff on the top.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.730
And that is your guitar timing.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.740
Let's try it with the music.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:58.650
What we're listening is for...

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:11.920
And five, six, seven and 
make sure you're switching direction, so you're

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:21.640
going this way to the left tap, and switch,
and that is your guitar timing in bachata.
