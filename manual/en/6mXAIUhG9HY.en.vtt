Hello everyone. Michael here with The Daily
Note II/3 YouTube channel.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.890
You may have noticed that I have changed the
format of how I do videos on this channel.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:12.200
Well, one of the things that is making it
possible is the portable mic that I'm using

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.830
right now
called the Rode SmatLav.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:20.029
It is a mic, especially built for portable
audio recording. And one of the best devices

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:22.470
to do it with is the Galaxy Note 3.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.539
As a matter of fact, I'm recording the audio
separately right now and then while editing

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:32.160
the video, I will replace the audio with what
I recorded on the Galaxy Note 3.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.270
So here's the review of the Rode SmartLav
for the Galaxy Note 3 and how to get the cleanest

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.200
recording from it.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:54.500
So the Rode SmartLav. Here is what you get for $60. You get the mic with a TRRS connector.
It is specially wired with compatibility for

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.969
iPhones and most Android devices including
the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 and probably most

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:06.340
Samsung Galaxy phones. That is important because
Samsung Galaxy phones have proprietary wiring

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.909
which makes it not compatible with any standard
microphone without an adapter.

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:18.909
So it comes in this box.  You get this leather pouch, and this clip.
It's a high quality clip that's mostly metal,

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.259
and it feels very durable. It also comes with
a quick start guide that shows you how to

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.229
put wires through this clip so that the wires
are the least visible and the mic is the most

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.420
comfortable.
On the Galaxy Note 3, it will not sound good

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:40.290
with the standard voice recorder that comes
with the device. Instead, I recommend a free

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:46.219
app called RecForge Lite. The most important
thing about this app is that it lets you turn

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:53.219
off automatic gain control or AGC. So let's
do that. And let's also set this to record

00:01:53.259 --> 00:02:00.259
in wav, 48khz, 16 bit, and mono should be
fine. Keep in mind I'm recommending this app

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.769
and these settings for the Galaxy Note 3 only.
On other devices, try with different apps,

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:13.980
settings, and with auto gain control off or
even on when recording with the rode smartlav.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.620
When deciding
to purchase this for my Android, or more specifically

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.730
Galaxy Note 2 and Note 3, I couldn't find
any samples online even though there seems

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.670
to a limitless supply of samples for the iPhone.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:37.100
So let's try an audio sample. This is a sample audio recording of the rode smartlav with the samsung galaxy note 3. Using the

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.300
rec forge lite app with the agc turned off with the gain set to plus 10

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:47.700
so for the sample of how it sounds, i'll include a link for the raw audio file in the description in this video.

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:53.800
As a matter of fact, all the audio in this video has been recorded on a Galaxy Note 3 with a rode smartlav

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.470
So audio engineers believe that in a video,
such as the one you're watchinhg right now,

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:02.800
audio quality is much more important than
video quality.  I did not believe it at

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:09.159
first but let's look at the example.  For example, if you have good audio but not
good video, you can still sit throught the

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:14.590
video, but if you have high quality video,
and not good audio, it is unwatchable.

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:18.970
So if you're into making videos, and you talk
in it, you might want to make a small investment

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:22.940
in the Rode Smartlav. And use it with your
favorite smartphone.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:27.170
So that's it for today. As it turns out, you
can get professional grade audio from the

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:31.780
Rode SmartLav if you use the right app and
with the right device.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.430
