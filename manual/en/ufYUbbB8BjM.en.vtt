Hi, I'm Jennifer Cail. On behalf of Expert
Village I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.610
a variety of different rolled sugar cookies.
Now that our dough has been completely rolled

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:14.509
out, I've peeled off the top layer of wax
paper and it's time to start cutting out our

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:18.661
cookies. I'm going to show you three different
types of cookie cutters that you can use.

00:00:18.661 --> 00:00:24.300
We are going to start with our open and just
plain metal cookie cutters. You might find

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.429
these metal, sometimes you can find some really
pretty copper ones but these are going to

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:36.660
be the easiest ones to use. I've got a variety
of three; we have a nice little women cookie

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.610
cutters and a bear, then a dachshund. As I
mentioned before if you are making these as

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:49.300
gifts you might want to incorporate people
personal likes in making cookies for them.

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.530
For this all you're going to do probably don't
have to worry about flouring the edges but

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.170
you might want to just to be on the safe side
depending on how warm you kitchen is. If your

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:04.710
kitchen is warmer your dough is going to be
sticker if it's really warm then you might

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.270
want to refrigerate your dough a little bit.
Either before you roll it out or if you roll

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.490
it out onto a pastry board then you can stick
it in the refrigerator to firm up a little

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:18.960
bit first. So we are going to take our cookie
cutter and we are going to start at the edge

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:25.329
of the dough you want to get as many cookies
as possible out of each roll so you want to

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:33.890
start on the edge and get a nice good cut
there. You are going to do a couple and you

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.890
want to get them close together so that you
are not having lots of waisted dough around

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:46.409
the edges. The easiest way to take them off
is pull the dough away from the cutting and

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:57.609
put it back in the bowl to get rolled out
again. Then you can use a spatula and just

00:01:57.609 --> 00:02:06.289
gently lift your little cookie dough woman
off of the wax paper. You want to make sure

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:13.800
that you floured the wax paper so that it
lifts off a little bit more easier and like

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:19.740
this one the dough is getting a little bit
soft. From here you want to be able to transfer

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:27.950
them onto a cookie sheet. You want to use
an ungreased cookie sheet and put it on there

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:32.420
then when you fill up the entire cookie sheet
you will be ready to stick them in the oven.
