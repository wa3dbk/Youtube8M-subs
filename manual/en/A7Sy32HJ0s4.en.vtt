00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.680
So I feel a bit obligated to talk about France.

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:04.220
It was really fun, really.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.340
Okay, one thing though. Every meal is, like, SUPER important in France.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.580
Except for breakfast, for some reason.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:14.920
For lunch and dinner, everyone sat down together, as a family, and talked.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.660
But, for breakfast they were just like:

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.740
"Here's a croissant! Okay, let's go."

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.640
I mean, breakfast is only the most important meal of the day.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.800
And I was going to make a joke about how they have an entire aisle of cheese in the grocery store,

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.860
but I realized back home we have an entire aisle for candy and ice cream.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.060
So, whatever.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.600
We went to the Louvre, which was, like, [raspberry] so amazing.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.040
They had really cool art by famous people.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.460
They had the famous statue with no arms,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.340
they had these really fancy rooms, because apparently people used to live here?

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.340
And probably the most famous painting in the world, the Mona Lisa.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.420
That room was super crowded.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.700
And right behind the Mona Lisa, there was this super tall painting that probably took twenty years to make.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.480
The picture frame was as wide as my body.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.240
But were people crowded around this one taking pictures?

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.740
NO.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.080
I don't even know what this one's called.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.320
The American school system has failed me yet again.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.120
And as someone who likes to draw, I thought it was really cool to look at the amazing color and details.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.500
Also, I took a bunch of pictures of butts!

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.300
Look, this is the really famous no-arm one!

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.880
Look at her butt!

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.120
So I had a good time, but afterwards we went to the Picasso Museum, Modern Art Museum,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.000
and this other one.

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:24.580
I forgot its name.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.680
It was French.

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.020
And it's kind of weird going into these places as someone who likes to draw cartoons.

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.520
"Oh, I like the colors, they're pretty neat,

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.500
and oh, putting the face on the side of the head.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.400
That's -

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.200
That's an interesting... design?"

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.520
But I kind of have to draw the line somewhere, Picasso.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.160
I mean, just look at this!

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.640
Why is it framed?

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:46.420
Someone -

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.640
Someone framed this.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.900
And Picasso was a good artist,

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:52.820
shoot, he's better than me,

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.600
so why go with this stuff to HANG UP -

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.380
Would you call this his best work?

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.920
It's not just Picasso, look at the modern art museums.

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.740
My favorite piece was the painting of a black ring.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:08.200
In fact, I loved it so much that I drew over it in my phone,

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.400
and probably spent more time and thought THAN THE ACTUAL ARTIST!

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:15.960
I'm not saying the more real a painting looks, the more artsy it is-

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.360
oh wait, yes I am.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.740
I mean, look at my drawings,

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:19.800
(no seriously, look at them.)

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.120
Their heads are super round, and they're so white they can't dance.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.600
If I entered an art contest against Leonardo Da Vinci,

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.220
HE WOULD WIN!

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.760
Because his stuff took talent, it's not easy to draw something exactly like it does in real life.

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:33.900
But cartoons?

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.880
They're easy.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:35.920
They're so easy.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.440
And I know I'm leaving out paintings with color schemes and forms,

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.800
and after seeing this, I've come up with something called the Keith Haring Principle,

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.700
to help people like me better understand modern art.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:52.200
In the late 70's, a man named Keith Haring drew graffiti in subway stations and had sort of a unique design.

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.860
Whenever he started to draw graffiti, he never thought about what the the finished product was going to be.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:58.660
He just drew whatever he felt like.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000
He ended up make thousands of them

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.980
and people started to notice his unique characters.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.660
Soon, he got more and more famous and popular.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.660
Now he's at the point where you can buy T-Shirts and mugs of his drawings

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:10.860
And I think that's really cool.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.240
They're interesting designs and I would wear them

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.200
Do they belong in a museum?

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.220
No.

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.140
Keith made thousands of these small, simple drawings.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.380
They're still art,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.520
but not art people should pay to see.

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.300
They should pay to wear and drink out of it.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:28.260
And by the way, this stuff is in no way researched, so I'm talking completely out of my butt right now

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:35.420
But I think Picasso, and this circle painting, should be on T-shirts or kid's books or even web comics.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.240
So people would say, "Hey, I like your shirt".

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:42.800
"Thanks, I like the design and would never frame it and hang it up on my wall."

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.680
