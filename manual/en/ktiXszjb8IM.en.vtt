00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:20.440
OK, so now we're gonna consider how to draw
an isosceles right triangle using the turtle.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:27.750
This triangle is isosceles because these two
sides are the same length, and it's a right

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.399
triangle because we have a right angle right
here.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:39.820
Let's put our turtle right over here, and
for now I'm not gonna draw anything on the

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:50.649
screen, I just want to see if I can get the
turtle to follow the path of this edge.

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:59.309
So, um I happen to know that this particular
triangle is 100 steps on this side, and 100

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:08.590
on this side. So, the start is easy, I can
just say forward 100, and that takes me up

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.670
to the corner.

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:24.040
Now I want to figure out how much of a turn
I have make here. Well, let's consider for

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.530
a minute how we make a right angle isosceles
triangle.

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:38.360
If we look at this square, we see that this
triangle is made by starting with a square

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:47.880
and drawing the diagonal. Well, this diagonal
cuts this angle right in half, doesn't it?

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:57.280
We know that each corner of the square is
90 degrees. If we cut that angle in half,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:05.969
we have 45 degrees, right here.

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:12.200
So we know that this angle is 45 degrees.
How much of a turn do we have to make? How

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.970
much of a turn does the turtle have to make?

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:29.440
Let's look here at the turn, OK? Now in general,
when we're turn a corner, you see we're still

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:39.280
facing in this direction, this, this entire
angle, if we take the blue corner of the triangle

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:48.000
together with this little sector is 180 degrees.
And we know that this little blue part here,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:55.950
this little angle is 45 degrees. So the total
amount of turn, the angle in this whole sector

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:07.510
here is 180 minus 45, or 135 degrees.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:16.510
So let's turn right 135 degrees and see how
that looks. OK, that looks about right. Now

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:24.030
we have to figure out the length of this line
right here, and that's a little bit trickier.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:33.421
Um, let's consider for a minute, what we're
gonna have to look at is, well we're gonna

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:43.370
start with two squares here, and think for
a minute about the area of squares, and then

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:51.310
it'll be clear in a minute why we have to
worry about the areas. But, we said this is

00:03:51.310 --> 00:04:00.790
100 steps, actually let's make up our own
unit, we'll say this is one hectostep, OK,

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:08.230
a hectometer is 100 meters, a hectostep is
100 steps. So this is one hectostep, so this

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.540
square is one by one.

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:22.950
So if each side is 1, then the area as a whole
is 1 hectostep. And these two squares make

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.569
up two square hectosteps.

00:04:27.569 --> 00:04:47.740
Now let's rearrange these pieces for a minute.

00:04:47.740 --> 00:05:01.910
OK, we know the area of this square is two
hectosteps, because the area of this is one

00:05:01.910 --> 00:05:06.969
hectostep, the area of this square is one
hectostep squared, so this has to be two hectosteps

00:05:06.969 --> 00:05:10.770
squared.

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:15.860
So what does that mean about the length of
this line? The length of this line times the

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:25.599
length of this line is 2 hectosteps, So that
means that one of these lines is the square

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:38.530
root of two hectosteps. And since a hectostep
is 100 steps, that means we want to go forward

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:44.189
100 times the square root of 2.

00:05:44.189 --> 00:05:51.330
So if we watch this turtle when I hit return
and we go forward, we should go all the way

00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.490
to the other corner. Let's see.

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:57.949
Yes, that worked, OK?

00:05:57.949 --> 00:06:11.110
So now, let's see. Let's put our original
triangle back in place and now we want to

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:17.390
figure out how much of a turn we need to make
on this side. Remember we turned 135 degrees

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:18.390
here.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:28.189
Let's take a look at that turn. Well, this
is also 45 degrees, so the turn we need to

00:06:28.189 --> 00:06:36.069
make here is also 180 minus 45, or 135 degrees.

00:06:36.069 --> 00:06:55.840
Let's go right 135. That looks right. And
now, we knew that this was 100 steps. When

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:03.599
we went from here to here it was 100 steps,
and this is also 100 steps.

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:09.940
And finally, just to get ourselves back to
our initial state, to our starting position,

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:18.340
we'll go right 90. And that draws it.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:28.669
So let's just double check. We'll move this
guy down here, and put the pen down. Now I'll

00:07:28.669 --> 00:07:37.650
just back up and walk through all the steps
we did before. We went forward 100, right

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:46.639
135, forward 100 times the square root of
2, right 135, forward 100, and right 90.

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:57.860
And that's how you make an isosceles right
triangle.
