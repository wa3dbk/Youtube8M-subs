Hello, in this tutorial I show you how to make 
 a squash scrapbook card

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.960
material

00:00:26.245 --> 00:00:36.245
cardboard of 2 colors optional the craftingeek downloadable graphics, 
 it can be downloaded at the bottom

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
to decorate, stickers, markers, pictures, etc

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:58.661
ruler, scissors or cutter, pencil and glue stick or double sided tape

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:13.450
take the cardboard, measure and mark two squares of 9 x 9 cm

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.600
and cut it

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.641
you will have this

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.375
leave aside and take different colored cardboard

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.793
trace 3 squares of 15 x 15 cm

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:34.290
and cut

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.887
you should have this

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.220
take one and fold it in half

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.480
marking well the fold

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:57.110
you'll have a vertical fold, flip the figure and fold in half

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.600
you´ll have two folds that form a cross

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:09.300
take the bottom corner and bring it up to form a diagonal fold

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.800
you should have this

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:22.080
leave aside and do the same with the other squares

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:30.360
if you have trouble bending, you can help with a ruler

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.250
the squares should look like this

00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:40.720
arrange the squares so that the diagonal fold be vertically

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.090
overlap them like this way, put the second 
 over the first, aligning the overlaped square

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.170
do the same with the last

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.900
you´ll have something like this

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.480
take the glue stick or double sided tape and glue those squares

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.300
caring remaining properly aligned

00:03:12.274 --> 00:03:14.960
press so that it fits closely

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.900
Do the same with the other squares

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.710
you can use the adhesive you want

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.600
when you finish it will look like this

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:46.910
flip vertically and take the 2 squares below, fold inward

00:03:47.864 --> 00:03:53.320
it's really easy, take the corners and carry them 
 to the center of the square below

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.750
press to mark the fold

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.300
take the other squares bellow and fold outward

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:08.690
remember to mark the fold

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.840
take the last two and fold inward

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:32.880
you´ll have a little square, remember that first you have 
 to fold inward, then outward and finally inward

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.950
press marking folds

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.690
take the squares of the begining, let's glue them to make the covers

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.940
take your glue and put it on top of the main figure

00:04:48.693 --> 00:04:50.640
glue 1 square

00:04:53.587 --> 00:04:56.050
making sure it is centered

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:08.960
when you finish do the same with the other square

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.240
paste aligning with the other so that it is equal

00:05:19.316 --> 00:05:21.890
open and decorate the inside

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.740
to decorate the triangular areas you can download craftingeek charts

00:05:41.258 --> 00:05:43.930

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:53.650
use stickers and decorate with markers

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.850
when you finish fold it back

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.670
now decorate both covers

00:06:14.987 --> 00:06:20.580
you can use any type of paper, decorated or not

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:33.820
