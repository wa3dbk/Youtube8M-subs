Hi this is Gary with MacMost.com.

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.160
Let's take a look at creating slideshows using
iMovie.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.789
We're using iMovie version 10.

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:16.260
Let's take a look at building a slideshow
using photographs in iMovie.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.680
There is so much you can do here.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:23.110
First of all you have access directly to your
iPhoto library from Libraries here on the

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.110
left.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:27.160
So if you bring that up you can see all the
photos that you've got there.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:34.399
So let's start off by creating a new movie
project and then we will simply set it to

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.420
No Theme and name it.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.670
Then we will look at the iPhoto library.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.540
You can see I can drag and drop.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.660
I can dig down into Events.

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:45.839
I can look in my Albums.

00:00:45.839 --> 00:00:46.839
Things like that.

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:54.739
But I am going to drag and drop photos here
and put a few of them right after each other.

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.890
Let's shrink down the magnification here so
I can see them a little more easily.

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:05.309
You can see right away by default they have
this kind of Ken Burns effect where they zoom

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.700
and out like that.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:16.719
We can adjust that pretty easily by simply
selecting the photo there and go to Adjust.

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:19.070
Under Adjust we have Cropping.

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.520
You can see it is set to Ken Burns.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.560
You have your start area and you have your
end area.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.580
So we can do lots of different things with
this to animate the photo.

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.509
It it pretty self explanatory how it works.

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:39.460
Now if we move through here we can see (let's
set this by hitting the button again up there)

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:42.710
and then we can see how it goes from one to
the other.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.229
But if we don't want that, that isn't what
we want, we can use Fit or Crop.

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:51.829
Crop will then fill the entire frame here
while Fit will actually fit the entire photo

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.210
in but it is going to leave black bars on
the left and right because the photo is a

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:59.299
4 x 3 photo where I'm doing a 16 x 9 video.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:06.439
So cropping does this and then I can adjust
what part of the photo I want to include in

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:07.439
there.

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.720
You can see now along the duration of the
photo if I scrub back and forth you can see

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.340
there is no movement because I'm not using
the Ken Burns effect there at all.

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.780
Just like with videos I can add transitions
between the photos.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.920
I can use the same transitions that I use
in the video.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.349
So just drag and drop those in there.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:35.150
Now you can see as you scrub across it the
transitions like that.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.920
You can apply the same Effects as well.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.870
So I can click on this video here and I can
do color effects like these and I can do video

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:46.599
effects as well.

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:52.370
You can Preview there on the right what it
looks like.

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.670
I can decide to stick one in.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:03:01.470
So by using an animated effect, like say aged
film, I can actually even make it look like

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.939
it is video because there is something moving
on there.

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:08.920
Now you're not restricted to just grabbing
things from you iPhoto library, from there

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:09.920
like that.

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:11.230
You can actually go from the Finder.

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.959
So here is a Finder window and I've got a
bunch of pictures and I can actually drag

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.489
and drop a picture into the timeline just
like that.

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:21.440
So it is not even in my iPhoto library.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.440
That works just fine.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.620
So you don't even need to use iPhoto for this.

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.560
You can drag and drop a whole folder full
of pictures into iMovie.

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.810
It will throw them all together and create
a slideshow for you.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.069
In addition, of course, you can also use Titles.

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:39.720
You can put the title over the photo.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:48.010
So I can assign some text there and just select
it and change the text very easily.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:54.080
I can also add text to say the beginning of
the video.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.770
So let's find something that works for that.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:05.750
Let's say lets use the standard here and I
can put that before the video.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.700
You can see how it drops in so now you can
have that as its own thing.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:15.810
If I want to change the duration of any of
these I can select them and, under Adjustments,

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:19.680
I can go to Info and there I have duration
right there on the right.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.570
So I can make it twice as long just like that.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:27.940
But I can also drag the edges here if I don't
need to be precise.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:35.300
The same thing here with the title of course.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.000
So you can do just about anything you do with
video you can do here with photos in a slideshow.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.690
Then when you are done you can Share it just
like a video as well.

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.340
So you can share it to all the same places
as before.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:47.390
Upload it to YouTube.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:53.000
You can export it to a File as well or send
it to iTunes for greater compatibility with

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.630
other things.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:56.630
The sky is really the limit.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.380
You can drag and drop music in.

00:04:58.380 --> 00:05:04.740
So we can go to sound effects in Music or
GarageBand and grab some music that we've

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.750
got and drag and drop that in to hear as a
soundtrack.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:15.720
You can also use the voiceover ability in
iMovie to record your voice and you can basically

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:21.659
narrate a slideshow and export the video.
