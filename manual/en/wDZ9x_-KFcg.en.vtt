00:00:01.189 --> 00:00:03.850
Fabric or line technique, creates a look

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:08.260
elegant linens or fabrics variations of
color, on the wall or ceiling.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.710
The finish can be applied vertically,
horizontally,

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.170
diagonally or in random line patterns.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.970
You need a handheld whisk broom, dry brush

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.060
or other implement and a six inch mini
roller.

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.130
A dry whisk broom or almost

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.359
any dry brush that's four inches a wider,
will create a basic line

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.380
effect; the softer the brush, the less
pronounced the pattern.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.660
On smooth walls, a notched trowel

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.700
create stronger, boulder, patterns. Also,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.960
a lighter touch, will create a delicate look,
while applying more pressure,

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.460
will make the pattern more pronounced.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:50.340
Dip a quality four inch wide nylon and
polyester brushed

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.239
into the colored glaze mixture from the
bucket. With your brush,

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.239
cut-in around the perimeter you're
working surface.

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.899
Start at the top corner and continue
along the ceiling

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:05.600
and around the baseboards. Then, pour the
colored glaze mixture

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.180
into a paint tray and work is six inch
mini roller,

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.970
into the glaze, until it is fully loaded.
To remove excess glaze,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:17.770
roll the tool on the ribbed area of the
paint tray.

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.990
Next, starting at the top corner of your
project area,

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.170
roll the colored glaze down the length on the surface, in a three-foot wide vertical

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.340
section. Faux Glaze has an open working
time of approximately 15 minutes.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:33.850
Working at a quick and steady pace, will
help avoid the development of

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.929
hard lines. While the grazes wet, drag the
dry brush,

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.080
whisk-broom or other implement over
the vertical section,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.600
from top to bottom. Wipe off your dry brush with cloth rag or paper towel

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.159
after each pass. If you want to look at
lines,

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.740
continue this process overlapping in
blending each section,

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:58.079
to avoid hard-edges. For a fabric pattern,

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.119
before the vertical lines dry, overlap a
texture horizontally

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:05.320
by dragging the dry brush were implement
from left to right

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.489
on the wet surface area. Repeat the
process all the way down a section,

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:14.540
overlapping each drag, with the next.
Continue working in three foot wide

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.640
vertical sections.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.750
Overlap and blend each section as you go,
to avoid hard edges.

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.299
Stand away from the wall and preview
your work periodically,

00:02:23.299 --> 00:02:28.380
to ensuring even look. Repeat the process
until the project is complete.
