00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:11.470
We have been driving along the east coast
of North America, starting at Miami, passing

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:22.170
by Daytona Beach, visiting Fort Matanzas,
Saint Augustine, Jacksonville and beautiful

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:38.300
Savannah.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.100
This is part three of our road Trip to New
York.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.400
The Talmadge Memorial Bridge spans the Savannah
River, between the states of Georgia and South

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.400
Carolina.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:57.250
We are driving on US 17 towards Charleston
And we are now in the great state of South

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.890
Carolina.

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:23.600
After a while on US 17 we move over to I-95,
in order to save some time.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.570
Our time here in Charleston is very limited,
so we�re just going to walk along Market

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.850
Street, see the waterfront and have a late
lunch.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.850
The historic downtown, where we are, is located
on a peninsula formed by the Ashley and the

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:38.320
Cooper rivers.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.340
The City Market on Market Street dates back
to the 1790�s.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.119
The indoor market begins at the historic Market
Hall, at the corner of Market and Meeting

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.039
streets and stretches for four blocks ending
at East Bay Street.

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:58.219
This is where the also historic Custom House
is located.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:04.329
From the dock we see the Arthur Ravanel Bridge
and the Charleston Harbor, and Castle Pinckney

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:07.030
on tiny Shutes� Folly Island.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.130
We have a late lunch at this place called
Magnolias, which was recommended by roadfood.com.

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.780
It is fancy, delicious southern cuisine.

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:22.310
But time flies when your having fun, and in
the winter it gets dark way too early.

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:28.220
We want to reach New York by Christmas day
so we must say hasta la vista to Charleston

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.610
and continue due north.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:45.049
Revisiting this pretty town is a must.

00:02:45.049 --> 00:03:02.870
We will spend the night at North Myrtle Beach,
but before checking in at our hotel we are

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:08.340
going to cruise along South Ocean Boulevard,
the heat of Myrtle Beach At this time of the

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:11.159
year is, not surprisingly, deserted.

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:13.870
It is late December, and the temperature is
pretty low.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:18.610
It is very much reminiscent of our own Miami
Beach.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.881
This is another place we must revisit, in
the summer, when it is at its prime, but this

00:03:23.881 --> 00:03:25.280
time we�re just here to sleep.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.261
We are actually staying at a place a little
further north.

00:03:27.261 --> 00:03:31.980
So we�re staying at the Bay Watch, in North
Myrtle Beach.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:51.720
This place is like a ghost town.

00:03:51.720 --> 00:04:01.159
Good morning.

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:07.079
Today we continue north towards Wilmington,
North Carolina.

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:27.750
�Keep right at the fork�
Wilmington�s historic downtown sits on the

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:29.720
northern bank of the Cape Fear River.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:36.560
The city is mostly famous for its beaches,
the seafood, and historic plantations.

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.780
Some antebellum houses and other buildings
survived the Civil War, as the city didn�t

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:41.980
see much action.

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.360
The port however was very important to the
confederate side, as supplies from England

00:04:46.360 --> 00:05:05.310
arrived here.

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:09.420
We have breakfast at this place called The
Dixie Grill, one of the few places we found

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:24.500
open this early on Christmas Eve.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.860
After breakfast we walk towards the river.

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:31.940
There have also these historic tours on horse
drawn carriages, which seem to be very informative

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:40.340
but we don�t have the time on this particular
occasion.

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:45.540
We must content ourselves with a stroll along
the riverfront, and the sight of battleship

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:52.100
USS North Carolina moored here, once considered
the world�s greatest sea weapon, and one

00:05:52.100 --> 00:06:03.270
of the most decorated battleships of World
War II.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:07.740
Wilmington was also the filming location of
the fictitious town of Capeside, from the

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.410
late 90�s TV series Dawson�s Creek.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:18.120
This is another place that definitely deserves
a less rushed visit.

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.290
What else is new?

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.370
Back to the car!

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:29.110
We drive around a little bit on this historic
downtown area and then it is off to our nation�s

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:39.870
Capital, Washington DC.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:53.340
I hope you have enjoyed this, part three of
our road trip to New York.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:56.560
Don�t forget to check out the previous videos.

00:06:56.560 --> 00:07:02.650
And coming up next we visit Washington DC,
and continue through Baltimore, Maryland,

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:08.460
to another Wilmington, this one in Delaware,
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:13.390
finally spend Christmas in New York.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:20.810
Please keep sending you comments and as always
thank you for watching and see you on the

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:21.810
road.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:22.030
Bye now.
