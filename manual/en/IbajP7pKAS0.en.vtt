00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
Today on 'Science at Home' we will learn
how to tell a hard-boiled from a soft-boiled egg.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.730
Today on 'Science at Home' we will learn
how to tell a hard-boiled from a soft-boiled egg.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:40.520
With me today is my devoted assistant, Hanna.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.350
Hanna, let's say that your mom cooked some
hard-boiled eggs and placed them in the fridge

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:49.440
right next to the soft-boiled eggs.
How could you tell which one is which?

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:50.800
I have no idea!

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.030
Okay, so today we'll learn how to tell
with 100% certainty.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.600
All we need to do, is simply


00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.320
place the eggs on the table
and spin them.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.760
I'll explain:
First, a hard-boiled egg

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.750
spins better than a soft-boiled one.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.130
when I spin...

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.410
I observed how it was spinning.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.340
Now I'll spin this one...

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.400
we see that it doesn't spin as nicely.

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.980
But still it's hard to tell a nice spin from a bad one.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.960
In a short moment we'll learn how to tell
if an egg is hard or soft inside.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.730
The hard-boiled egg

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.480
and the soft-boiled egg.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.400
In a soft-boiled egg, since the contents are liquid,
the liquid breaks the spin

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:31.320
so it spins slowlier.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.190
Let's say we are not sure
what is fast and what is slow.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:39.290
We'll learn how to tell the difference
with 100% certainty.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.360
We can spin the egg
and then stop it with our finger.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:44.530
It stops.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.280
If it stops - it means it's hard-boiled.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.900
A soft-boiled egg, on the contrary:
when I spin it...

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:51.750
and stop
- but then it keeps spinning.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.880
What happens is...
that the liquid inside keeps moving

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:57.740
and then although I stop it, the liquid
inside keeps moving

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.250
and keeps the eggs spinning.

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.790
Let's see if we were correct.
According to the experiment, this one is soft-boiled

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.600
and this is the hard-boiled egg.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:05.880
Let's see...

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.580
This is indeed hard-boiled...

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.290
and this one...

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.800
the soft-boiled egg.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:23.460
Nice!
