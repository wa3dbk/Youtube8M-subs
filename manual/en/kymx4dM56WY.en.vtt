00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.120
yo people, today we are at Wild

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.660
a fish pond in Reutum

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.040
Today we will go fishing on sturgeon, catfish and carp

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.920
we  have already one fish caught, we didn't filmed that one, but we will show you a picture

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.120
see him fight

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.140
yes, you have got him Tim

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.440
a bit slippery

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:15.660
a nice mirror carp

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.880
calm, calm, calm

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.880
I think I also have a bite

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.480
nice!!

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:45.240
Max is trying to pull in a strong fish with the rod action

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:46.440
think about your slip Max

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:50.080
yes, but he is taking more line than I can pull in

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.340
that doesn't matter, he will be tired itself

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.580
if I pull three meters in, he will pull the triple back

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.080
very strong!!

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.560
it was a kind of funny, we were set up the tent, and then we got a bite

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.840
I think Max has a carp on the line

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:24.920
or, a catfish

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.660
it can

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.120
or a sturgeon, but I don't think so

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:32.160
he would like to

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.660
Yes

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.800
yo, boys it is the second day

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:55.240
I just woke up

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.100
Today we go again fishing by Wild

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.160
we hope we catch some nice fish, you will see it

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:09.160

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.140

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:34.820

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:35.880
it is my first carp

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.900

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.520

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.640

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:11.300
so boys, I'm so happy my first carp. calm, he is very heavy

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:16.360
we can't weigh him, but it is a super beautiful mirror carp

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.620
back into the water

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.180

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.600
way is dad drilling him than?

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.900
because we don't want to lose him

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.540
he is rather big and strong

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:07.840
I have a very big bite

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:35.180
we have a new kind of sturgeon this is a sterlet, a gray sturgeon, he has a very pointed nose

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:38.620
very soft

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.660
super beautiful sturgeon, a little wound on his back

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:46.500
Tim has also a bite

00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:48.740

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:52.440

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:53.480
and he is gone

00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:55.060
