Hi! I'm Amelia and on behalf of expertvillage.com,
I'll be talking to you about using thermal

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.940
styling tools. Hot rollers are probably some
of the most under appreciated thermal tools

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.489
because they really are great. They're a great
way to get a lot of body in the hair, especially

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:22.160
if you've got fine limp hair. Fine hair, you
want to use more steamrollers like these,

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:28.529
whereas the other style, just the regular
to rollers. Those are better for course hair.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:32.880
It's going to help smooth the hair out a little
bit more. The steamrollers tend to give a

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:41.180
little bit of a firmer curl. If you're wanting
just some body and not a lot of curl, you

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:49.080
want to use your larger size. You're going
to want to bring that hair up. Bring that

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:54.710
strand together and roll that hair on that
strand. If you've got some layers going on

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.810
like Lauren here does, you just kind of do
your best. You can also kind of wrap it around.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:06.440
Remember, the tighter you wrap it, the more
curl you're going to get. This particular

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:13.740
roll that I'm giving her, that will be a pretty
tight curl. If I'm just wanting a little bump

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:26.340
at the ends, I would just take a piece of
hair here. Take a strand and just do the ends.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.470
The advantage of hot rollers is that you can
have your hair all set and ready to go and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.390
then you can finish the rest of your morning
routine. You can eat your breakfast, you can

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.440
put on your makeup, you can walk around the
house, take your dog for a walk. Whatever

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:47.280
you need to do while your hair is styling.
This is going to give more than just a bump

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.460
at the end, whereas this is going to give
her a full on curl. The more hair you've got,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:02.560
the less body you're going to have. The more
in the strand. The tighter you wrap it, the

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:16.279
smaller the curl. The closer you get to the
scalp, the longer the curl. Now she's ready

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:21.769
to put on the rest of her makeup and get dressed
for work. That's how you use hot rollers.
