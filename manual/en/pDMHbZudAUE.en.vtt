00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:06.379
I don't know how many of you really love to interview people.

00:00:07.608 --> 00:00:09.939
Is that something you get up every morning and say,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:14.079
"I'd really love to go have to hire someone new,

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.739
an assistant or salesperson, a product manufacturer,

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:19.379
or a product manager?"

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:24.169
So we always want the person to be the right person.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.979
We look them in the eye, and we assume they're the right person,

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.879
because we don't want to interview the next 50 people.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.459
And then we ask questions that guarantee they are the right person.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.769
Hiring is a 50 &amp;#37; probability gain.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.669
I don't know what you all, or what your odds have been,

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:50.399
but if you just go back in history and say,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.319
"How many mistakes did you make out of

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.159
the percentage of people you hired?"

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.214
The fact is, it's a risky business.

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.229
And so you have to take that into account.

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.369
And I think you have to spend a lot of time in particular,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.129
trying to make sure that you don't make a mistake.

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:09.089
Because it turns out,

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.939
mistakes in people are what cause companies to go bad.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.189
So someone did some research with a group

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.369
of young presidents' organization people.

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.989
And the estimate was that bad people hire, person hire cost $500,000.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.269
But in my experience, it very often costs the whole company.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.459
You lose the company because people who

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.109
are bad turn out to make bad decisions,

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:38.264
and they hire other bad people.

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.089
And so one of your tasks as an entrepreneur is

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.649
to recognize that you might make the mistake,

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:47.509
and then be pretty quick at trying to solve that mistake.

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.269
People don't change.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.719
You do need to treat them with respect,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.604
you need to give them the opportunity.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.554
You need to give them feedback.

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.514
But in the end, your organization depends on having great people.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.310
And so you have to be ruthless.
