Here step-by-step instructions

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.220
on how to use the Metro. Step 1: locate a
metro station

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.740
metro stations normally have a blue and white 
stylized "M"

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.390
some stations are located in side
building while others are out in the

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:18.780
open

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.100
Step 2.  Decide where you wanna go

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.500
to try to locate the appropriate stop on
the map. Check what line it is on

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.250
then locate  your current position and
see what direction you need to travel (what is the name of the last station)

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.520
This will determine which signs you
need

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.200

the Ginza line is gold, and currently

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:09.910
has 19 stations.  The Asakusa
Station is station 19

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.729
on the Ginza Line.
