Hi, I'm Amy from Synology.

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:11.740
Today I'll introduce you to Photo Station, 
a web-based application designed to help you

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.460
organize and view photos stored on 
your Synology NAS over the Internet.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.220
With its refined and user-friendly interface, 
Photo Station allows you to upload, browse,

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:23.900
manage, and share your photo albums 
in just a few simple clicks.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.120
In this video, we'll go through how to create an album, 
upload photos from your Synology NAS

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.220
or from your computer as well as browse and 
organize your photos in Photo Station.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:40.240
First, go to Package Center and make sure that 
the Photo Station package is installed.

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.020
When you launch Photo Station, a new tab will be 
opened outside DSM for Photo Station.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:49.740
Here is where you can upload and manage 
all your photos and albums.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.820
To easily access your photo albums in the future,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.440
it is highly recommended that you 
enable QuickConnect service.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.230
Whether you are at home or on the move, QuickConnect allows you to access your Synology NAS and

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.230
Photo Station from anywhere via the Internet with a 
custom ID yet without the hassle of having to set up

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.190
complicated network configurations, 
such as port forwarding rules.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.320
There are a couple of ways to 
upload photos to Photo Station.

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.280
The first way is through the Photo Station interface.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:24.720
I don't have any photos or albums yet, so I'm going to 
click "Add" to create a new album for the photos

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.560
I want to upload, so I'll go to the drop down 
menu, and select "Create folder".

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.040
I want to create an album for the photos I recently 
took on a trip to Europe with my friend Sean,

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.720
so I'll name my album "Europe" 
and add a description too.

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:43.260
Now you can set permissions for your album.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.360
A public album allows anyone with 
the link to browse your album.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.580
A private album cannot be viewed by anyone 
unless you give the user permission to do so.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.360
You can also password protect your album, 
meaning that to browse this album,

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.680
viewers will have to first enter a password 
you previously configured.

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:07.560
I 'm going to create a public album and then further 
refine my permissions by clicking "Assign Privileges".

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.640
As you can see, the default settings for a "Public Album" allows all users to browse the album.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.480
I want to allow my friend 'sean' to also be able to 
upload and contribute photos to this album

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.019
so I'm going to tick the box in the upload columm 
and click OK to save my settings.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.700
Now I can upload photos to my "Europe" album.

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:31.600
There are two ways I can upload photos to this album.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.500
First, I want to upload some from my DiskStation.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.140
Here are several photos from May that I've oragnised 
and put into a folder on my Synology NAS.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:44.440
I'm selecting the photos I want 
to upload and clicking OK.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.280
Wait for the photos to be uploaded.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.100
I still have some photos on my computer I haven't 
uploaded to my Synology NAS that I also want

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.880
to add to my album in Photo Station.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:06.860
This time I'll select "Your computer" and 
select photos from my file explorer.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:20.110
Another way to upload photos to Photo Station 
is with the Photo Station Uploader.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:24.880
Go to Synology's Download Center and in Utilities, 
find Photo Station Uploader

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.040
and download it for your operating system.

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.010
We recommend you use Photo Station Uploader 
because thumbnails of each photo to display

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.490
will be generated during the uploading process.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.620
Uploading files via Photo Station Uploader 
will leverage the computing ability

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:41.960
of your computer to speed up the conversion.

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.940
Launch it once you have finished installation.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.849
I'll click "Create Profile" and then enter a name 
and the server name/IP address of the

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:55.589
destination Synology NAS for the new profile.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.600
The server information and user credentials provided 
will be saved to this profile for future use.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:07.800
You can set up several profiles according to 
different rules or destinations.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.860
Instead of filling in server information again 
the next time you use Photo Station Uploader,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.180
you can select an existing profile and 
use its configurations set up previously

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.560
to upload photos to the same destination.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.340
Choose whether you want to upload the files to 
Photo Station or Personal Photo Station.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:28.600
But for now, I'll just upload to Photo Station.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:32.260
I'll enter the user credentials for my Synology NAS.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.640
Once I've created a profile, I can use it 
to upload a new folder to Photo Station.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:44.040
I'll click "Browse" to select the folder I want to upload.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.420
Here I want to keep the default settings 
and then click "Next".

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:53.100
Wait for the album to be uploaded.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:01.900
Once upload is finished, I can see the folder 
"Taiwan" under "Albums" in Photo Station.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:09.140
Alternatively, you can simply right-click on any photos 
you want to upload and select "Upload to Photo Station"

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:11.500
using an existing or new profile.

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:23.840
As you can see, all photos are now successfully 
uploaded and displayed in my Photo Station.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.460
With all my photos uploaded, I can browse
 and organize them in Photo Station.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:37.000
For example, I'm able to refine the settings of my albums by right clicking on the album to edit its properties

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.440
or set the album cover.

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:47.840
Inside my album, I can browse my photos using 
different thumbnail sizes or view modes,

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.340
as well as right-click on any photos to do changes 
to suit my needs, such as rotating photos,

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.180
editing tags, or adding them to a shared album.

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:07.140
As you can see, Photo Station integrates 
a variety of rich and easy-to-use functions,

00:06:07.140 --> 00:06:10.520
so uploading and organizing photos 
is super simple and quick.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:16.140
Photo Station offers many other ways to record 
and share your exciting moments with others

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:18.580
to make sure not a single precious memory is lost.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:24.000
