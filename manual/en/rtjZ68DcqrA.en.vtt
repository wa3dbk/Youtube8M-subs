00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.400
In the relatively clear waters
of Bull Shoals and Table Rock Lakes,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.900
fish can be found in a variety of water depths. 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.400
So, depending on the time of year,

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.900
you’ll want to make sure not to concentrate
all your efforts along the banks.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.400
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; King: The only time they’re really heavy on 
 the banks
here is in the springtime. 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.900
And then occasionally in the fall a few fish will move back
in 
 on the banks again when the weather cools off, 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.900
but the rest of the year, the biggest part of the 
 fish
in this lake are not on the banks. 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.900
So people have a misconception. 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.400
They come here and see a beautiful timbered bank,
they think 
 they can catch bass off of it. 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.400
And really most of the year you can’t do that. 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.900
You’ve got to back out on the points and use your electronics,

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.900
find the bait fish and fish the techniques that it 
 takes
to catch them out in the deeper water. 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.900
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Clunn: I think that the hardest part
about fishing 
 these lakes is the clarity of the water.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.400
The clearer the water is, no matter where you’re 
 fishing,
the harder the fish are to catch. 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.900
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; King: People just have a natural tendency
to want to fish the shoreline. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.900
And really on these clear water Ozark streams,
a lot of times you 
 have to get away from the bank to catch fish.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.900
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Snowden: And usually once you find the depth
that the fish are in,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.400
they’ll be in that area throughout the lake.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.400
You know, if they’re in 30 feet of water,

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.400
they’re going to be in 30 feet of 
 water
in the majority of the lake. 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.400
So once they find where they are getting a few 
 bites,
they can just repeat that process on different points.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.400
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Sainato: So that kind of makes the 
 lake fish
a little smaller for you. 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:40.400
Because you come out here and you're looking at
all this water 
 -- there’s 45,000 acres of water out here --

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.900
it’s intimidating for a lot of people.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.400
But if you just do a little bit 
 of homework
before you come out here, 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.900
you can really narrow it down to where you need to fish. 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.400
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Webb: So we fish a lot of deep water.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.400
We fish a lot of trees that are way underwater. 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.400
A lot of points that go way out like we’re 
 doing right here,
we’re fishing 35 foot deep. 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.400
We’re probably, I don’t know,
three or four hundred yards off the bank. 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.900
Here comes a fish right there. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.900
There’s about five of them there now,
they’re just surrounding my bait. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.400
There he is.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.900
Coming up fast.
That’s a nice fish right there. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.900
(Line drags)

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.900
Boy, that’s -- that’s the sound I love right there,
the taking line. 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.400
Boy, that’s a nice spotted bass right there.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.900
Nice.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.400
Come here.
Oh, that’s a nice one.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.900
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Oh, nice fish.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.400
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Webb: That’s a nice fish.
Come here, sweetheart.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.900
Come here.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.400
Look how pretty that fish is. 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.900
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Woods:  Bluffs with and without standing timber
are also productive areas.  

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.400
Also, be on the lookout for bass surfacing
and feeding on shad.  

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.900
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Webb: This is one of the things I would 
 tell people
that come down here to look for 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:08.900
that are new to area is the bluffs
where they 
 fade into shallow water like this. 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.900
We’re sitting in 32 foot of water;
a half a cast from the bank. 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.900
When we get up here this just shallows right out.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.400
I would just stay on this ridge
and take 
 it out in the middle slowly 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.900
and just fish this ridge out all the way out and around.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.400
That’s where the fish,
they stay out in the 
 deeper water to hide and stuff. 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.400
And then they come up on the flats
and 
 feed as the shad come over. 

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.900
They’ve got everything they need right in here.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.400
&amp;gt;&amp;gt; Clunn: If you don’t like fishing deep,
and there’s guys like that; I’m one.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.900
I really prefer fishing shallow.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.900
Then you have to learn how to overcome the clear water. 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:49.400
Wind is your biggest friend in clear water 
 lakes
if you want to fish shallow. 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.900
I want to fish in the wind; it tends to bring the fish up.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.900
It tends to make them less tentative
about hitting artificials in that clear water. 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.900
So that’s one approach. 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:06.900
The other approach is actually to run
and find 
 the little bit of off-color water 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.900
that might exist even in these clear water 
 lakes
like Bull Shoals or Table Rock. 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.700
And that’s usually up there in the tributaries.
