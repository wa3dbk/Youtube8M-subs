Serving your dog food and water while traveling
can be easier if you keep a few things in

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:25.010
mind. Instead of bringing your dog’s large
heavy bowls, you can get some light weight

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:34.000
soft bowls. I like to have two; one for food
and another one for water. I like to bring

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:44.860
this water one along when we go hiking locally
so Pip doesn’t get dehydrated. When I make

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:50.810
a long road trip with Pip, I place all of
her hard crunchy food inside of a small rectangular

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:56.490
waste basket. This keeps it from getting torn
or crushed and I bought this to only be used

00:00:56.490 --> 00:01:01.090
for this purpose and it was a lot less expensive
than the containers that are sold as food

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.690
carriers. You might want to bring all of your
pet’s food on the trip as it may be hard

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:14.570
to find your brand when you get to your destination.
You can also pre-measure food in advance and

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:22.390
place it in Ziploc bags for meals on the go.
If your dog gets an upset stomach, you might

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:27.490
try feeding him a mixture of rice and very
plain versions of lamb, chicken or turkey

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:33.780
baby food. Choose a baby food that is very
simple. I like to give my dog Gerber brand

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.390
in the number 2 series. For instance here
are the ingredients for chicken; just ground

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:46.390
chicken, water and corn starch. Lastly you
might find that your dog will be much less

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:51.659
interested in eating while traveling to your
destination. If your pet doesn’t begin eating

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.179
more than a day after you arrive, you might
consider seeing a veterinarian.
