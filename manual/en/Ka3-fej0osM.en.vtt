00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.470
I jokingly said last week as as a
complete joke okay this was

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.149
just hypothetically completely kidding
that

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.170
when talking about Neil deGrasse Tyson's
I

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.360
6500 lightyears

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.199
crab nebula example so no the grass
tyson on Cosmo is the new series on Fox

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:19.570
said

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:24.320
you know we kind of have proof that the
the universe is more than 6,000 years

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.869
old

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.510
because the crab nebula is 6500 light
years away

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.630
and we wouldn't be able to see anything
that's further away

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.130
if the universe were less than 6500

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.800
years old I jokingly said you know I
maybe conservatives are the religious

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.989
right will say

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.489
how do we really know the speed of light
I mean we could be deceived by God about

00:00:45.489 --> 00:00:47.579
the speed of light I jokingly said it

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:51.960
and this has actually happened there's a
group called Answers in Genesis their

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.629
website

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.910
is Answers in Genesis dot com and
they're making this exact argument they

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:57.530
say

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.359
this is a quote what tyson of course
does an address in the program

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:05.059
is that young earth creationist
scientists do offer biblically

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.280
consistent models to explain

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.970
how we see faraway objects in space
without tampering with the laws of

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:12.700
physics

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.700
one such model is the any so tropics
synchrony convention

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.509
which is based on the fact as Einstein
recognized remember mentioning Einstein

00:01:22.509 --> 00:01:24.030
apparently gives you credibility

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.560
that it is impossible to objectively
measure the one-way speed of light

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.560
we instead measured the round-trip speed
have lied

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.720
and simply agree that the one way speed
must be happy above the total

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.810
read more about how this explanation
would answer the question of how light

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:43.970
from distant stars

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.420
could reach earth within the time
allowed in biblical history

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.189
in quote distant star light and for more
technically minded readers any so

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.090
tropics in Gurnee Convention

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.090
a solution to the distant star light
problem

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.340
so what's the problem with this theory
in layman's terms the idea is OK

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.790
we're assuming that light travels at the
same speed in one direction

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:10.709
that it does in the opposite direction
but we don't really know that

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:14.250
we don't know that it might be traveling
one way faster

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.920
and then we're just dividing by 2 in
assuming it's the same in both

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.379
directions the problem

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.840
is as is the case with almost every
single one of these types of arguments

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:24.980
the problem

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.090
is that it depends on non falsify a ball
claims made

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.629
mostly in this kinda hypothetical

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:37.790
philosophical sense there is no actual

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.819
evidence that would suggest light
travels at a different speed

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.349
in one direction then it does in the
other is hypothetically possible

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.860
that's true but there is absolutely no
evidence for it

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.319
the idea was initially published in a
creationist Journal

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:57.849
called answers research journal in
September 2010

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.280
and it says without violating any known
laws of nature

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.200
we could have you special relativity
added as if they're

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.590
is one-way infinite Lightspeed I

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.610
however I am there is absolutely

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.940
no evidence of this in both cases when
we look at the argument made in the

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.680
answers research journal

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.700
and the argument made by Answers in
Genesis you create

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:28.860
needlessly more complex calculations and
if we think that both

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:32.879
the simplest explanation is typically
the correct one

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:38.280
and that extraordinary claims require
extraordinary evidence as Carl Sagan

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.989
himself

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.330
suggested there is a completely

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.670
ad hoc nature to this theory so

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.080
I was completely joking when I said next
thing you know

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.989
creationists will say well we might be
deceived we might not really know the

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.330
speed of light

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:57.330
I i think that the it is

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:00.689
absolutely astounding that this is now
being presented as an

00:04:00.689 --> 00:04:05.569
actual beary and I'm not taking any
credit at all

00:04:05.569 --> 00:04:09.590
for for predicting that this would
happen I was completely joking and it

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.230
turns out that
