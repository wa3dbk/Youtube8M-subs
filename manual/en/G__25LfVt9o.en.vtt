00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.540
every girl loves a little sparkle in her life

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.620
for that special occasion that comes

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.770
with an RSVP

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:09.150
you definitely need a killer look

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.220
here's a sophisticated smoky look

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.900
for any dressed-up event

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.850
first, you want to hide those dark circles and

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.210
any imperfections 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.020
just take your shade play concealer color mixing palette

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.520
apply the concealer under your eyes, around your nose and on your chin

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.980
and then just blend away with a few pats

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.790
now just seal in that flawless look with love me for me finishing powder

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:42.120
apply it all over your face

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.620
1, 2, done!

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.020
next step, prep your eyelids with a

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.850
long-lasting eye primer 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.180
just dab directly onto the lids and pat with your fingertips

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.520
the primer will help your eye makeup stay 
in place 'til the wee hours of the night

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:03.420
I'm loving the shade play artistic eye
color palette in NYC smoke

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.360
it's perfect for a soft, sophisticated smokey eye

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.259
first, use your brush to
apply the shimmering charcoal

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:11.020
color to the corners of your eyes 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.899
wing it just a bit from the outer corners

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:14.139
and then blend

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.420
next step bring a little bit of that
charcoal shade

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.680
up to the eye crease outlining the eye

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.960
for the next step I liked to dab a shimmering pale pink color into the middle of my eyes

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.410
the pink color is what helps give you that softer look

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:32.590
and it makes your eyes appear bigger

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:34.930
to open up your eyes even more, 

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.210
apply silver in the inner corners of the eyes with a brush

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.560
and then just smudge

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.270
you can dab a little more silver on the center of your lids for that extra sheen

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.380
so next step, apply a smoky black on the
outer corners with an eyeliner brush

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.580
again, wing it out just a bit for that extra drama 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.440
to finish off the eye look, take your scribble calligraphy liquid liner

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.480
and draw a very thin line along the top of your lid

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.340
out to the corners in that same wing shape

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:24.540
once the eyes are done,

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:28.570
take a little color matte lipstick in
"honey honey" and apply to your cheeks as

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:30.870
you would to your blush

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.070
and then just blend with your fingertips

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.360
alright, now just pull out your blush duo

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.520
in "pinched by pink" and sweep this on the apples of your cheeks

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.280
and along the sides of your nose

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.800
perfect, we're almost done! 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.600
finish off the look with a little creamy color matte lipstick

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.750
first in "honey honey," the same color used
on your cheeks

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.550
and then in "cuddle up pink"

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:13.400
great! now be ready for any fancy
schmancy formal

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:16.950
whether it's a birthday party, a dance, sweet 16

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:18.550
you're gonna look amazing 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:19.620
have fun!

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:20.680
good luck
