00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.840
We had many 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:08.850
expectations

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:13.569
but we were not hoping for a miracle 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:15.969
or a definite 

00:00:15.969 --> 00:00:17.269
solution

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:18.739
At the same time

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.730
we didn't expect to advance so much.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.000
Seeing a result 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.470
only 15 days 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:27.749
after the first injection

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:31.579
was very emotional.

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:33.070
The possibility 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:35.440
of improving 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.300
Renzo’s quality of life 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.470
was a real possibility.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.150
It was really

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:53.150
moving for us. 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.640
My name is Enrique Centurión 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:58.910
and I am here 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:59.809
with (my son) Renzo.

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:04.650
We are from Argentina.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.969
Renzo had CP 

00:01:05.969 --> 00:01:07.470
since he was born.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.530
Due to 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.960
some complication during his birth 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.910
he lacked oxygen (hypoxia)

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:18.130
and that caused damage in his brain,

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.330
affecting his

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.700
motor skills

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.860
all over his body,

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.250
but especially on his right side.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.580
His 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.090
condition (CP)

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.090
makes his 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.370
daily life difficult

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.180
hygiene, getting dressed

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.850
eating...

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.070
His family 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.719
helps him in

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.820
these chores. 

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.180
He still lacks certain skills to become

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.479
completely self-sufficient. 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.660
What encouraged us to do the treatment

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.720
was that Renzo had 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.930
plateaued in his progress since he was 6 years old. 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.840
There was a limit

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.999
on how much he could do 

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:12.909
with rehabilitation 

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.399
and he only 

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.799
needed a little bit more in order 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:19.439
to gain self-sufficiency.

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.969
We saw this as a possibility to achieve that goal.

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:27.169
Just 15 days after the first injection

00:02:27.169 --> 00:02:29.839
we had a very emotional moment,

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:30.930
he was able  

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.940
to do that.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.899
It may not seem much

00:02:34.899 --> 00:02:36.780
but for Renzo it means a lot. 

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.399
Now he can hold a glass, drink water, 

00:02:39.399 --> 00:02:42.049
write with his right hand,

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:48.989
get dressed by himself, put on a T-shirt, 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:50.080
grab

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.059
objects with his right hand. 

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:54.919
It was a big step forward for him.

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:59.099
Another thing we noticed was that 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.659
he had more strength 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.179
in his upper body, in his legs, his posture improved. 

00:03:04.179 --> 00:03:06.739
He could walk much more. 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.019
Before the treatment he could only walk a few blocks 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.179
and a few months later he could walk up to two or three kilometers.

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:19.779
With this second treatment 

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:21.380
of stem cells, 

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.939
we have noticed an improvement 

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:25.089
with the voluntary movements 

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:26.829
of his muscles. 

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:29.519
He used to compare

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.089
himself 

00:03:32.089 --> 00:03:34.099
with me, 

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.199
while he tried 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:38.349
to do muscle 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:41.519
contractions 

00:03:41.519 --> 00:03:43.969
and yesterday 

00:03:43.969 --> 00:03:44.790
he was able 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.470
to do it.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:47.639
And

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:48.459
we were 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.060
really happy. Renzo called us to show us. 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:55.579
The control of his right hand 

00:03:55.579 --> 00:03:57.419
has improved. 

00:03:57.419 --> 00:03:59.770
Before he could barely 

00:03:59.770 --> 00:04:01.409
do this movement 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:06.449
and now he can use the hand more easily.

00:04:06.449 --> 00:04:12.869
We would like 

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:15.369
to thank the people from Beike 

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:17.769
for the treatment we received.

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:18.989
They are very professional,

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.609
the administration, 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:27.039
the doctors, the nurses...

00:04:27.039 --> 00:04:28.419
Well,

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.729
the experience 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:32.199
here  

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:33.479
is really good.

00:04:33.479 --> 00:04:35.749
The organization 

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:38.539
is truly good

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:40.050
and the professionalism of the 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:42.559
therapist's 

00:04:42.559 --> 00:04:44.120
and the staff is 

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.120
very high.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.710
The food 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:49.059
is very 

00:04:49.059 --> 00:04:50.889
healthy. 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.199
The whole thing 

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:54.580
is very integral, 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.210
not only because of the stem cells 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.400
but because of 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.580
the physical 

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.469
care.

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:06.189
Renzo’s skin is 

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:09.520
better,

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:11.139
his body 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:14.620
is better. In general we

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.400
believe it is a very positive experience.

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:20.610
We would recommend the stem cells, 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.479
no doubt about it. 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:26.159
Based on our experience,

00:05:26.159 --> 00:05:27.849
it is a simple and 

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:30.070
non-invasive 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.099
procedure. 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:32.889
This is 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.939
based on 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:36.629
what we saw 

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:39.889
and our experience 

00:05:39.889 --> 00:05:42.240
and also based 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:46.400
on what other patients 

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.289
with whom we 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:49.520
talked to 

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.879
also said.

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:54.100
We feel very well, 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:57.800
they have treated us very nicely 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:00.640
and for that we are very thankful

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.720
and happy for having the possibility that 

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:06.880
Renzo could undergo this treatment.
