00:00:01.478 --> 00:00:04.767
The 4th heat of the Focus Challenge
is really very simple...

00:00:04.813 --> 00:00:08.116
...drive towards the wall at 40 mph
and do an emergency stop.

00:00:08.328 --> 00:00:11.923
Exciting? It is when you have
to stop as close to the wall as possible.

00:00:26.525 --> 00:00:28.896
He was great, wasn't he?

00:00:29.436 --> 00:00:31.133
I broke a nail.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.465
This is team, uh...
-Autowereld.

00:00:39.686 --> 00:00:41.432
That's it, Autowereld.

00:01:06.998 --> 00:01:11.636
For heat 5 we're going to park,
but not like you'd think.

00:01:11.744 --> 00:01:14.493
The person behind the wheel
wears a straitjacket...

00:01:14.594 --> 00:01:17.943
...and the person in the passenger seat
steers the car. He is blindfolded, though.

00:01:17.966 --> 00:01:20.047
It's really a team effort.

00:01:35.981 --> 00:01:38.445
Now what?

00:01:38.972 --> 00:01:41.188
Just put it in first.

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:55.272
This is how my mom parks.

00:01:55.624 --> 00:01:56.919
Look at that.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.404
We're not parked straight, but I like it.

00:02:00.048 --> 00:02:03.369
Me too.
-Indeed, he can see very well.

00:02:07.059 --> 00:02:10.353
It seemed to be such a fair game...

00:02:12.061 --> 00:02:15.514
Until we saw this in editing...

00:02:34.264 --> 00:02:37.272
Unfortunately, the jury didn't seen this...

00:02:45.188 --> 00:02:49.444
Heat 6 is the last one,
we'll have to really perform now.

00:02:49.766 --> 00:02:53.538
We're going to drive backwards
through this slalom track.

00:02:53.725 --> 00:02:59.635
Fastest time wins. We can't cross the lines
and we can't hit the sign.

00:03:23.763 --> 00:03:26.992
It's good that we all play by the rules...

00:03:28.638 --> 00:03:32.227
Especially since you're only
allowed to use the mirrors...

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:37.034
This is team, uh...
-Autowereld.

00:03:37.055 --> 00:03:38.747
That's it, Autowereld.

00:03:44.132 --> 00:03:49.684
In the end, Autowereld has won.

00:03:54.044 --> 00:03:56.000
I didn't like it at all.
