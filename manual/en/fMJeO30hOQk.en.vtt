00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.650
Hi guys and welcome to French Guy Cooking.

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:10.549
Today : an explosion of indian tangy flavors
trapped in the most reassuring english Tradition,

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:11.549
Plus !

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:17.640
I'll bring you the most undisputable proof
that you have the power to work miracles.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.810
Let's make the unexpected but stunning Palak
Paneer Hinglish Pie...

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:32.680
You are about to make your own cheese.

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.640
How you feel about it ?

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.360
The Paneer cheese is insanely fast and dead
simple to make.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.180
Paneer is a fresh cheese quite common in India.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.150
It is made by curdling heated milk with an
acidic liquid.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.899
It tastes quite soft, but it is milky and
nutty.

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.930
In a big pan over medium high heat, pour 2
liters of whole milk and 1 cup of cream

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.120
Stir it from time to time.

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:57.950
When there is serious foam forming

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:02.610
Remove the milk form the heat, and add half
a cup of apple cider vinegar.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.409
This is where things get exciting !

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.700
The reaction just takes a few minutes.

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.240
The milk will separate into curds and whey.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.720
Now get yourself a piece of cloth.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.740
This can be called a cheesecloth or a muslin.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.080
Just take whatever cloth you find.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.360
Place the cloth in a strainer over the sink.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.930
Pour the liquid in.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.920
Carefully Make a knot.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.740
Now put weight on it.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.930
It will squeeze the excess of water out.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:34.150
The Paneer Cheese will be ready when we need
it.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.530
A good pie is all about a good filling.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.479
For this one, we 'll use Fish and Spinach.

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:41.479
What ?

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.100
Do you remember we are trying to gain subscribers
?

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.780
Well I do, and thrust me

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.650
you won't find any watery spinach or bland
fish in this recipe.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:56.680
Instead, think of outstanding explosive flavors
like mint, ginger, garlic, lemon !

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.080
First things first.

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.470
Let's marinate the fish.

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.060
Cut 4 fillets of trout into big chunks.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.470
Season well with salt and pepper, then place
them in a bowl.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.790
Add a Drizzle of oil

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:10.200
A drizzle of honey

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.670
A crush of garlic

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.239
A gratted thumb of ginger

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.489
The juice of half a lemon

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:18.170
And all the zest you can get from it

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.690
A sprinkle of chopped mint leaves can't do
any harm.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.730
Let it rest while we prepare the greens...

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.060
From now on, we will use an oven-proof frying
pan.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.650
You can also use a skillet.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.599
Or a frying pan and a pie dish.

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.150
Over medium high heat, a big knob of Butter

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.870
Add a thumb of gratted ginger

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.959
2 crushed cloves of Garlic

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:42.200
Chop 3 onions,

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.349
2, 3 minutes should do it.

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:50.020
Add loads of fresh spinach and let them fall
down in the frying pan.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.239
Spinach will litteraly vanish in the pan.

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.730
So When I say loads, I mean tremendous amounts
of spinach.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.040
Like : "fuck i shouldn't put that much".

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.390
A good big pinch of Salt, pinch of pepper.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:08.150
When almost all the water has evaporated,
we can move on to the next step.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.709
Let's build the pie up.

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:11.780
Two rolls of puff pastries on the board.

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.819
Parchment paper under it.

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:17.140
Heavy Sprinkling with an indian spices mix.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.140
Coriander seeds

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.140
Cumin seeds

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.140
Nutmeg

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.140
Salt

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.140
Pepper corn

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.879
A bit of cinnamon

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.790
Fat is always a good carrier of taste, because
many flavors do not dissolve in water.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.980
In this case we use the fat of the puff pastries
to retain the indian spices.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.310
Thoroughly rub to the puff pastries.

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.180
On one roll, sprinkle breadcrumbs.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:41.800
They will suck out the excess of moisture
during baking.

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.140
Spread the onions and the spinach.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.629
Carefully slide it in the same pan we used
earlier.

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:49.989
We are baking it in the frying pan for two
reasons :

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.420
One, It is convinient.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.560
Second, it's unexpected.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.799
People are gonna get curious about it and
even more when they'll discover what's inside.

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.000
Next add the drained chunks of fish.

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.640
Time to use the paneer cheese.

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:08.280
Unwrap it, slice it and place it on top.

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.900
Fold the edges towards the center.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.540
Place the second roll on top, spiced side
down.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.220
Here comes a cool part.

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:21.909
We are forming the pie, not by sealing it,
but by folding it like a bed sheet.

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:22.909
why ?

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:25.249
How many pies have you sealed in your life
?

00:04:25.249 --> 00:04:27.409
And how many beds sheets have you folded ?

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:34.539
Gently Push the edges back in the pan, under
the first layer.

00:04:34.539 --> 00:04:37.020
Prick the pastry so that steam can escape.

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.669
And finally, brush the pie with milk.

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:40.669
BOOM !

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:46.339
In a preheated oven until you achieve a nice
golden brown finish.

00:04:46.339 --> 00:04:50.219
There we have it : The unexpected Palak Paneer
Hinglish Pie !

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:56.530
Outside, the shiny crust is crispy as hell
and encrusted with bold indian flavors.

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.840
Inside, it's all about freshness and moisture.

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:02.509
Tell a story : It's no boring pie !

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:06.629
it's journey made of warm blankets and dream
countries.

00:05:06.629 --> 00:05:10.909

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:12.020
