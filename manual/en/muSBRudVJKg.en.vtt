00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.710
How to Fix a Running Toilet.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.650
Is a constantly running toilet driving you
mad?

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:12.180
Don’t call the plumber until you try these
simple adjustments.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.120
You will need A faulty toilet and food coloring.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:17.700
Step 1.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.950
Get to know your toilet.

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:21.450
Lift the cover of the tank to see what's inside.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.160
At the bottom of the water, either a ball
or a flapper will be covering a valve that

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.820
lets water into your toilet bowl when you
flush.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.130
Flush the toilet to see the valve at work
-- the problem may become obvious.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.420
Step 2.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.570
If you see that the ball or flapper is not
completely covering the valve, investigate

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.770
what’s prohibiting it from doing so.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:44.320
The chain or rod that pulls it open might
be twisted, bent, or caught on something.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.850
Or the flapper or ball itself might be damaged
or corroded, keeping it from making a solid

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.730
seal; you'll need to replace it.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.930
If the valve appears to be covered but the
tank never seems to fill, you might have a

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.930
slow leak.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.150
Put a little food coloring in the tank; if
it seeps into the bowl, you'll need to replace

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.940
the flapper or ball.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:03.060
Step 3.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.759
If the valve is completely covered but the
water continues running, you need to lower

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:07.759
the float.

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.850
The float is the piece that moves up and down
with the water level in the tank.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.329
The float will be either a closed cup that
encircles a tall tube or a rubber ball at

00:01:15.329 --> 00:01:17.100
the end of a long metal arm.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.100
Find your float.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.060
Lowering the float will lower the water level
in the tank and keep it from rising above

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.609
a safety mechanism called the overflow pipe,
which is the open-topped tube sticking up

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:27.609
in the tank.

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:31.520
Normally, the water level isn't supposed to
reach the rim of the pipe, but if it's set

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.189
too high, water will run through the pipe
into the toilet bowl.

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.549
Step 4.

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:37.549
Lower the float.

00:01:37.549 --> 00:01:41.789
If you have a float cup, squeeze the metal
clip attached to it and slide the clip down

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:43.700
so it's below the water level.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.109
If you have a ball float, either tighten the
screw at the end of the arm opposite the ball,

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:49.659
or bend the arm downward.

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.369
Step 5.

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.799
Flush the toilet to test the new water level.

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.509
If it still rises above the overflow pipe,
lower the float some more.

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.689
If the water gets too low for an adequate
flush, just raise the float until you get

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:02.689
it just right.

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.249
Usually, the water level should reach about
an inch below the rim of the overflow pipe.

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:08.349
Step 6.

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.100
Before replacing damaged parts, shut off the
water to your toilet by locating the valve

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.030
in the wall behind it &amp; turning it clockwise.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.340
Flush the toilet &amp; remove the part; then take
it with you to the store to ensure you buy

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.460
an exact match.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:25.840
The sound of running water is now a thing
of the past -- and you’ll have the lower

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:27.470
water bill to prove it!

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.519

toilet 2,500 times a year.
