Hi everyone, it's Marina

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.000
Thanks for joining me.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:06.300
We're here at the ice arena

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.000
and we're about to see my first ever hockey game.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.000
It's the Illini playing Ohio State.

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.300
And if you didn't know the ice arena is a

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.000
part of campus recreation, it's a division.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.000
And we're about to go inside, the game starts in about ten minutes.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.300
So maybe we'll get a chance to see the ice arena a little bit

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.000
and I'll show you some of the game.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.300
Hey guys! It's the end of the second third.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.000
The game is going really well and I have to say,

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.000
I did not expect hockey to be this exciting!

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.000
The fans are crazy and there is so much energy on the field.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.000
I hope you got a good chance to look at the arena and see our team play

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.000
I hope next time to meet you here!
