00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.000
If it wasn't clear yet, yes this is the convertible.
The M6 convertible.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.500
Second generation M6 convertible.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:35.000
There were more generations coupe cars, 
M-lookalikes, but not the M6 itself.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.500
The technology the M6 uses is well-known because 
it has the engine and the platform of the M5...

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.500
...or the 5-series platform,
it is just the coupe of the 5-series.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.500
So the V10 is gone and a monster 
of a V8 is replaced instead.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.500
Two turbos...

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.500
...560 bhp and 680 Nm.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.000
It's really incredible fast.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.500
There is another benefit because... 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.000
...the car became more economical as well. 
A lot more fuel efficient.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.250
And I hear you thinking, who cares?

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.000
Well for the tax you pay in The Netherlands,
which is actually a CO2 levy.

00:01:13.508 --> 00:01:18.008
Through this, this car became 35,000 Euro
cheaper than it's predecessor.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:24.500
Personally, I would doubt heavily between 
the convertible and the coupe.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:29.000
The coupe is prettier than the convertible...

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.500
...it's lighter in weight, the car is 12,000 Euro 
cheaper but that is not the most important.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.500
It is quicker because the convertible 
weighs more due to the heavy roof.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:46.000
The lightweight roof of the coupe is made of 
a special Carbon Fibre Reinforced Plastic (CFRP).

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.500
The difference is 285 pounds (130 kg), 
so the convertible is not a lightweight car.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.000
The M6 convertible is 4400 pounds (2000 kg) and with 
a couple of passengers and luggage it's even heavier.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.500
This is not really a sports car, 
the car is intimidating though.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.000
That could be understood positive, or negative...

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I can explain the negative part the best 
by missing some feedback from the vehicle.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The steering is quite good, but not perfect.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Handling is sublime, but still there is something 
about the weight and size of the car.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.500
You really have to get used to it.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The positive side of the car is mainly due to 
the brute engine, it's easy to scare yourself.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.500
And that is also the reason for buying a BMW 
M-model, because it is supposed to be very fast.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.250
Well, that's exactly what it is.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
The convertible is doing 0-60 mph in 4.3 sec.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.000
And the coupe, the quickest production 
BMW so far: 4.2 sec from 0-60 mph.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:01.000
There is another reason for buying a coupe,
top speed is limited at 155 mph (250 km/h).

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.000
With the M-drivers package your top speed goes 
up to 190 mph (305 km/h). Also very nice.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.500
There is also a reason for buying the convertible.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:16.500
Well, I complained quite a bit about the "singing V8".

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:22.000
The V10 is a classic opera singer.
Absolutely fantastic, everyone loves it.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.500
Amazing engine for that matter.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:30.750
Perhaps we have to compare the sound of the V8 
with electronic music, not the preference of everyone.

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.000
There is an electronic gadget that comes with this car: 
the sound is amplified by the internal sound system.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.750
But the convertible gives a very clear sound 
of what comes out of the exhaust at the back...

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.000
...and that just sound much better than from the inside.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.500
Furthermore this car has all the M-goodies 
you could expect it to have.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:55.500
Like different fenders with loads of air intakes&nbsp;and the 
typical M-gills on the sides of the car.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.000
It doesn't really make the car prettier.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:04.000
A decent locking differential that is able to lock from 
0 to 100%, which is a great part of this car.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.500
Not like the rubbish you can find on the M135i,
with brake intervention etc.

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.000
No it's nice and mechanical how the connection between 
both rear wheels could be blocked completely.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.500
And this leads to tires that wear very fast.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:24.250
The quickest and&nbsp;sportiest BMW&nbsp;currently available,
but not a real sports car.

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:27.500
And that's a pity, because the competition...

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.250
...that I won't mention by name, but everyone 
knows the two cars I'm talking about.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:33.000
But those cars do have that.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.500
That doesn't make this car less attractive, but makes 
you wish even more for a super sports car from BMW.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000
This is mainly&nbsp;a GT made for long distances, 
driving at top speed.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.250
And&nbsp;because it's a little more fuel efficient you won't have 
to stop at the gas stations like with the old M6...

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.500
...in which I succeeded to have the cheerful 
number 3.5 km/L in the display.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:01.000
Now it reads 5.0 km/L, which is a considerable improvement.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.500
So what does it cost?&nbsp;

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:12.000
153,000 Euro for the coupe and the convertible&nbsp;is even 
more expensive, especially with a couple of options.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.750
And fortunately I don't have that amount of money...

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:17.250
...because I wouldn't be able to choose 
between the coupe and the convertible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:05:23.215 --> 00:05:29.870
