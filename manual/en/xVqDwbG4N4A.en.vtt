00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:07.207 align:start position:0%
how close are you
to an actual divorce?

00:00:16.048 --> 00:00:17.717 align:start size:22% position:78%
[sighs]

00:00:17.717 --> 00:00:19.019 align:start size:47% position:53%
I love Colby...

00:00:20.886 --> 00:00:24.791 align:end position:100%
But this has been
an ongoing pattern

00:00:24.791 --> 00:00:26.759 align:start size:41% position:59%
for 13 years.

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.361 align:start position:0%
Okay.
I wanted to ask you that.

00:00:28.361 --> 00:00:31.264 align:end position:100%
Everything--every issue
we've ever had,

00:00:31.264 --> 00:00:33.032 align:start size:78% position:22%
he learned to fight mean.

00:00:33.032 --> 00:00:35.034 align:start size:78% position:22%
He'll hit below the belt.

00:00:35.034 --> 00:00:39.606 align:end position:100%
He told me once
that I'm not a mother.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.542 align:end position:100%
Things like that,
you know?

00:00:42.542 --> 00:00:43.977 align:start size:69% position:31%
Just demeaning things.

00:00:45.411 --> 00:00:48.614 align:end position:100%
I mean, I'm not going
to make excuses.

00:00:48.614 --> 00:00:49.983 align:start size:75% position:25%
I am not a good husband,

00:00:49.983 --> 00:00:52.218 size:88% position:56%
and I am not a great father.

00:00:52.218 --> 00:00:53.620 align:start size:31% position:69%
All right?

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.555 size:88% position:56%
But there are certain things
that I struggle with that--

00:00:55.555 --> 00:00:59.892 align:end position:100%
with her that bring some tension
into our relationship too.

00:00:59.892 --> 00:01:01.727 align:end position:100%
So there's a lot of stuff
that goes around.

00:01:01.727 --> 00:01:03.396 align:end position:100%
I'm not that tyrant
all the time.

00:01:03.396 --> 00:01:05.397 align:start position:0%
Let me put this
in a different perspective.

00:01:05.397 --> 00:01:08.434 align:start position:0%
There are absolutely
two sides to your stories.

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:10.136 align:start position:0%
You have a side;
she has a side.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:11.170 align:start position:0%
But it's just not okay

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.406 align:start position:0%
for her to not be able
to express herself

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.240
and have to just eat that up.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.243 align:start position:0%
It's not okay for you
to attack her character.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:20.847 align:end position:100%
And I'm--I want
to live my life.

00:01:20.847 --> 00:01:22.148 align:start size:59% position:41%
I want to be happy,

00:01:22.148 --> 00:01:25.452 align:end position:100%
and I want my kids
to be happy.

00:01:27.921 --> 00:01:29.589 align:end position:100%
I need you to do
something for him,

00:01:29.589 --> 00:01:33.759 align:start size:78% position:22%
'cause I think he's open.

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:34.794 align:end position:100%
I need you
to look at him

00:01:34.794 --> 00:01:37.797 align:end position:100%
and tell him if you're
really done.

00:01:37.797 --> 00:01:40.933 size:78% position:39%
Just look at him and say
whatever you need to say,

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:42.769 size:88% position:44%
because he needs to hear it.

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:49.642 align:end position:100%
We've been together
for a long time,

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:51.043 align:start size:41% position:59%
for 13 years.

00:01:51.043 --> 00:01:53.612 align:end position:100%
We've been through--
we have two beautiful children.

00:01:53.612 --> 00:01:56.115 align:end position:100%
I love them
with all my heart.

00:01:56.115 --> 00:01:58.284
- I know you love them too.
- Yeah.

00:01:58.284 --> 00:02:00.653 align:end position:100%
As much as I've
been at peace

00:02:00.653 --> 00:02:02.789 align:end position:100%
and as much--
I want that with us.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.224 align:start position:0%
Right.

00:02:05.224 --> 00:02:07.827 align:end position:100%
But I don't want--
I don't want to be hurt.

00:02:07.827 --> 00:02:10.630 align:end position:100%
I don't want you
to hurt the kids.

00:02:12.798 --> 00:02:14.167 align:start position:0%
(Colby)
I'm all yours.

00:02:14.167 --> 00:02:18.671 align:start position:0%
I mean, I will shut--
I'll keep my mouth shut gladly

00:02:18.671 --> 00:02:18.705 align:start position:0%
just to have a normal
house, you know?
