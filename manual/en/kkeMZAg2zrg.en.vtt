00:00:03.833 --> 00:00:04.916
Hi! How are you?

00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:09.500
I've received very good comments from the videos
of the 20 tips that can solve your life.

00:00:09.625 --> 00:00:11.333
And today I bring you 20 more.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:17.666
If your burned your bread
while toasting it,

00:00:17.791 --> 00:00:21.833
rub them together to eliminate
all the black part of the surface.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:26.500
If you are trying to open a
bottle that's very tight

00:00:26.666 --> 00:00:30.208
put a rubber band around the lid
to have a better grip.

00:00:32.208 --> 00:00:35.666
If you have to study or transcribe from
a notebook to the computer,

00:00:35.833 --> 00:00:38.666
use a clothes hanger to
make it much easier.

00:00:40.041 --> 00:00:44.208
Have you noticed that when you eat ice cream
your brain freezes and your head hurts?

00:00:44.333 --> 00:00:48.375
The solution is to put the tongue close to
your palate so that it goes away faster.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:51.916
Do you need to nail and
you're a bit clumsy?

00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:56.333
Use a comb to fix the nail so that
you avoid hammering a finger.

00:00:57.625 --> 00:01:01.083
If you have little space to travel
What do you think about this technique?

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.166
If you charge your cell phone in airplane mode,
it will charge twice as fast.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.333
Leaving your phone in airplane mode will also cause
the advertising of your games to stop working.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.166
Do you have a very tight keychain
and it's hard to add new keys in?

00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:29.666
Use a staple remover to avoid
breaking your nails in the attempt.

00:01:31.208 --> 00:01:34.083
With an airtight pouch,
a sponge and water,

00:01:34.375 --> 00:01:37.458
all to the freezer, it can be
a homemade icepack.

00:01:39.291 --> 00:01:42.208
If your sneakers or gym
bags smell a bit bad,

00:01:42.583 --> 00:01:45.583
put dry tea bags inside
to absorb the odor.

00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:49.208
Do you have to cut cherry tomatoes?

00:01:49.541 --> 00:01:52.125
Put them between two dishes and
cut them all at once.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.875
If you need to heat two things
at the same time in the microwave,

00:01:56.875 --> 00:01:59.541
put a cup and place one
of the bowls on top.

00:01:59.541 --> 00:02:02.708
You save space and both meals
will heat up alike.

00:02:03.833 --> 00:02:06.666
When turning off your room
lights, cover an eye.

00:02:06.791 --> 00:02:09.583
Thus the naked eye will see
better in the dark.

00:02:09.958 --> 00:02:10.708
Try it!

00:02:12.291 --> 00:02:15.583
If you dropped a ring or something
very small that you cannot reach,

00:02:15.875 --> 00:02:20.000
use a rubber band to tie up a panty to the
tube of the vacuum cleaner and turn it on.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.500
Do you always carry water with you?

00:02:23.625 --> 00:02:29.375
Fill bottles in half and store them sideways
in the freezer and you'll always have cold water.

00:02:30.625 --> 00:02:32.708
If you are going to see a movie
on your computer,

00:02:32.708 --> 00:02:36.791
make sure you have a dark t-shirt on
so that it won't reflect on the screen.

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:39.958
If your dishwasher is clogged,

00:02:39.958 --> 00:02:43.375
pour half a cup of bicarbonate
and a cup of red vinegar.

00:02:43.375 --> 00:02:48.416
When the frothing is gone, rinse it and you will have
uncovered it in an economical and ecological way.

00:02:49.458 --> 00:02:52.583
If you add a teaspoon of baking
soda when boiling eggs,

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.000
the peel will come off easier
when they're hard.

00:02:58.916 --> 00:03:03.333
Measure the size of your hand, the distance
between fingers or that of your forearm

00:03:03.333 --> 00:03:07.833
and remember the figure so you can measure
things when you do not have a ruler nearby.

00:03:08.875 --> 00:03:11.458
I hope I have helped you
to solve your life a little.

00:03:11.708 --> 00:03:14.708
I also invite you to see the 23 things
that you don't know about Malcolm.

00:03:14.708 --> 00:03:15.750

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:18.875
