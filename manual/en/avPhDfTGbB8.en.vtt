00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:05.320
Hold, hold me for a while

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:13.000
I know this won't last forever

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.780
So hold, hold me tonight

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:28.440
Before the morning takes you away

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.180
Hold, hold me for a while

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:47.040
Before the morning takes you away

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.020
We're in each others arms

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.280
Soon we're miles apart

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:10.320
Can you imagine how I'll miss

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.760
Your touch and your kiss?

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.260
Short moments of time

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:33.870
We have left to share our love

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.080
Hold, hold me for a while

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.100
I know this won't last forever

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.060
So hold, hold me tonight

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.220
Before the morning takes you away

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.460
Hold, hold me now

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.920
From dusk all night to dawn

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.420
Save, save me now

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:28.780
A short moment of time

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.040
Hold, hold me for a while

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.500
I know this won't last forever

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.880
So hold, hold me tonight

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:03.960
Before the morning takes you away

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.800
Takes you away
