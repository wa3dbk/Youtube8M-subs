00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:22.460
Quick: What do Pulseman, Yoshi, and Smart
Ball have in common?

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:26.080
They’re all games developed by Game Freak
that AREN’T POKEMON.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.080
Man.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.400
You single-handedly redefine portable gaming
and you get typecast.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:35.920
The couple recent times they’ve broken out
of that mold - like 2005’s Drill Dozer - have

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.610
been met with relative success.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.620
And now they’re back with a strange little
downloadable game for the 3DS that combines

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.480
action platforming with rhythm and music.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.580
But, since it’s Game Freak, that music might
just be a little bit... iconic.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:59.740
You’re just experiencing it in a completely
new way.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:04.140
The quote unquote plot of the game features
a kid named Tempo, assisted by a rabbit who

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.400
holds signs, tasked with delivering a big
note-shaped whackin’ stick to Symphony City

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.010
where it can be handed off to a HarmoKnight
capable of saving the world from the noise-drenched

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.540
meteors that have been making a mess of the
place.

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:21.070
Along the way, you’ll join forces with other
warriors with significantly different playstyles,

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.720
but the basic gist is to run to the right,
collecting notes along the way, and walloping

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.159
any miscreants that step to you.

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.600
WITH RHYTHM.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.811
It seems like a fairly straightforward platformer,
albeit one with forced running at a tempo

00:01:33.811 --> 00:01:37.650
you can’t control, until things start getting
fancy.

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.210
Platformers work best from a standard perspective,
but the camera in Harmoknight has no qualms

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.620
about pitching itself at odd angles or even
circling all the way around Tempo in some

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.040
stages, reinforcing the dependence on rhythm.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.409
The view might even come into extreme close-up,
shortening your field of vision and making

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.410
you rely on audio clues rather than just visual
stimuli, reinforcing the dependence on rhythm.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:02.840
Or maybe you’re in a cymbal-monkey mine
cart.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.750
And that’s cool too.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:13.080
While the platforming action makes up the
slight majority of the gameplay, the rest

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:17.439
is reserved for more cinematic boss battles
that really make you appreciate the 3D capability

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:18.439
of the system.

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:24.090
These tend to take a more call-and-answer,
Space Channel 5-esque tack, while featuring

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.700
goofy, frantic action that makes me want to
go back and play some Gitaroo-Man.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.439
(And get pissed off that, after 11 years,
I STILL can’t beat the Sanbone Trio on Master

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:34.900
difficulty.)

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.569
By collecting a sufficient majority of notes
in a given song, you can score a “Great”

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:42.890
rating, which allows for that track to be
attempted in a double-speed “fast” mode,

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.840
where another “Great” rating unlocks concept
art.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.520
If you’re used to music games, the majority
of the campaign will be a bit less than challenging,

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.139
but the post-game content features some stages
that gave me fits.

00:02:54.139 --> 00:02:58.569
Watch out for the very last level.

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:06.989
It’s a doozy.
