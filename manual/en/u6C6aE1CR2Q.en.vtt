Hi, my name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of
Expert Village. Today I'm going to show you

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.930
a really nice, quick, easy way to make cannelloni.
Now in order to save time, the first thing

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.481
we're going to do, is we're going to take
our pasta water here. You're going to put

00:00:14.481 --> 00:00:16.670
like three and a half to four quarts of water
in this, crank it up on high, when this hits

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.890
a boil we're going to add our pasta, so just
like I said, in order to save time we're going

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.940
to start this now before we go ahead and start
cutting up our onion or anything, because

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.910
you know, it's just a matter of compacting
up all your time. So I'll come back to this

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:33.449
when the pasta is ready to go and we'll throw
the pasta in and cook it. And here we are

00:00:33.449 --> 00:00:39.010
with our onion. So we meet again, Mr. Onion.
So what we're going to do, take our knife,

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.719
we're going to cut off this end of the onion,
and not this end of the onion. Reason why

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.340
is that the root end is the part that is going
to hold the whole onion together when we go

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:58.210
to dice it. See? Not going to fall apart.
So we'll cut across this as such. Peeling

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.899
back any parts of the onion we don't want,
I'm going to go ahead and discard this entire

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.509
outer layer, because this onion is a little
dinged up; I don't like cooking with dinged

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:16.820
up onions. By dinged up, I mean it's got some--looks
like it was kind of crushed in transit maybe.

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:22.420
So, which I didn't notice at the store when
I bought this, but it's all right, we can

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.979
persevere here. So we're just going to peel
that off, you want to make sure that there's

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:32.619
nothing in the way on the cutting board. Grab
a hold of our onion, and since we're going

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:36.580
to go for a dice, I'm just going to make a
series of vertical cuts. I'm going to do like

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:44.140
a half-inch, because I want some nice visible
onion here in this recipe, in this sauce.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.479
And also realize when you cook it, it's going
to shrink a little bit, and it's going to

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:54.439
become, you know, very flexible, so that's
much less of an issue at that point. So there's

00:01:54.439 --> 00:02:01.299
that. Same rules apply for the other half
of the onion here, a series of vertical cuts.

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:08.520
And see, what's happening here, is this root
end is holding the whole thing together. It's

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:17.490
very "neat-o", for lack of a better word.
So what we'll do, is we'll take this end here,

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.970
we'll just give it a couple of runs across
the knife like that. Maybe a few little like

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:30.531
this, one like that. And that point, all we're
wasting is this little tiny nub, which goes

00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:35.500
in the trash. So that's our onion, so let's
go ahead and put this in something so we can

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.390
get it out of the way, and I'll show you how
to peel and mince garlic really quickly.
