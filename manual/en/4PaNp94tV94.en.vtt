&gt;&gt;Aaron: When a lot of people
think about flipped classrooms,

00:00:15.356 --> 00:00:18.746
they start thinking about
videos, lots and lots of videos.

00:00:18.746 --> 00:00:21.816
Video, video, video,
video, video.

00:00:22.266 --> 00:00:24.896
And video has a technological
component to it,

00:00:24.896 --> 00:00:26.446
and a lot of people then think

00:00:26.446 --> 00:00:28.666
that the flipped classroom
is a technological solution.

00:00:29.156 --> 00:00:31.576
Well, we think a flipped
classroom is a pedagogical

00:00:31.576 --> 00:00:33.766
solution with a technological
component,

00:00:34.026 --> 00:00:36.776
a very large technological
component, so let's get some

00:00:36.776 --> 00:00:39.046
of these tech tools on the table
so we can get you the tools

00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:41.186
that you need to start
flipping your class.

00:00:41.326 --> 00:00:43.326
&gt;&gt;Jon: But Aaron why do I
need to make my own videos?

00:00:43.326 --> 00:00:44.576
There's lots of videos
out there.

00:00:44.576 --> 00:00:47.186
Two plus two equals four,
whether I say it or somebody

00:00:47.186 --> 00:00:48.146
on the internet says it.

00:00:48.316 --> 00:00:49.766
&gt;&gt;Aaron: Well, you're right,
there's plenty of material

00:00:49.766 --> 00:00:52.866
out there but I think it's
really best for teachers to try

00:00:52.866 --> 00:00:54.596
at least to make
their own content.

00:00:54.806 --> 00:00:57.726
There's a relational aspect
that you have with your students

00:00:57.726 --> 00:01:00.846
that no one else in this world
has, and you cannot replace

00:01:00.846 --> 00:01:02.606
that by using someone
else's material.

00:01:04.136 --> 00:01:06.306
So I've decided to make
my own video content.

00:01:06.306 --> 00:01:08.056
I don't know the first
thing about making videos,

00:01:08.056 --> 00:01:09.926
what do I need to
make this happen?

00:01:10.076 --> 00:01:11.456
&gt;&gt;Jon: I know a teacher, he
hands the phone to a student

00:01:11.456 --> 00:01:13.376
and says, "Can you help me
make a video after class?"

00:01:13.376 --> 00:01:15.676
And they shoot the video of
him standing at the chalkboard

00:01:15.676 --> 00:01:17.256
and then he posts
the video online.

00:01:17.496 --> 00:01:19.266
&gt;&gt;Aaron: And if you choose
a student who's struggling,

00:01:19.266 --> 00:01:20.606
that student is going
to get it twice.

00:01:20.606 --> 00:01:22.916
They're going to see you when
they're there live with you

00:01:22.916 --> 00:01:25.136
and then they can go back and
view that video content again.

00:01:25.476 --> 00:01:27.606
&gt;&gt;Both: Differentiated
instruction.

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:30.366
&gt;&gt;Jon: Another tool for making
flipped class videos are screen

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:31.336
casting programs.

00:01:31.376 --> 00:01:35.286
Whatever is on the
screen is recorded.

00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:39.536
&gt;&gt;Aaron: And in case you haven't
noticed, tablets are everywhere,

00:01:39.536 --> 00:01:42.386
and there are a plethora of
whiteboarding apps for tablets

00:01:42.386 --> 00:01:44.586
that you can write on the
screen, bring in pictures,

00:01:44.586 --> 00:01:47.426
record your audio to produce
video content for your students.

00:01:47.426 --> 00:01:49.656
Okay, so now that you've
created some video content,

00:01:49.656 --> 00:01:51.716
where are you going to put it
so your students can access it?

00:01:51.796 --> 00:01:54.366
&gt;&gt;Jon: There's a plethora
of sites such as YouTube

00:01:54.366 --> 00:01:58.016
and Vimeo you can use, but what
if your kids don't have access?

00:01:58.016 --> 00:01:59.666
A lot of kids, well,
they don't have access

00:01:59.666 --> 00:02:01.166
to the technology,
what do you do then?

00:02:01.476 --> 00:02:03.146
&gt;&gt;Aaron: We have physical
media that we could use.

00:02:03.146 --> 00:02:05.966
We have USB drives, they're
relatively inexpensive.

00:02:06.066 --> 00:02:08.406
Get a few of those, check them
out to your students as needed,

00:02:08.406 --> 00:02:10.736
or you could burn
them onto a DVD.

00:02:10.736 --> 00:02:12.976
&gt;&gt;Jon: So with all these
tools for creation and sharing

00:02:12.976 --> 00:02:16.566
of the videos, we're often
asked, which is the best tool

00:02:16.566 --> 00:02:18.196
or tools that you should use?

00:02:18.446 --> 00:02:19.786
Ultimately, it depends upon you.

00:02:19.786 --> 00:02:21.816
What technology are
you comfortable with,

00:02:21.816 --> 00:02:22.866
what do you actually have?

00:02:23.356 --> 00:02:24.976
That's the tool that's
going to be best for you.
