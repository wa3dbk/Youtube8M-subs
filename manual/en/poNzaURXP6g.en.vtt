My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village. Today I am going to show you my favorite

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:10.730
way to cook King Crab legs. The next thing
that we will cut up is our celery and when

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:15.211
you get celery at the store, this part right
here it's the part that we are not going to

00:00:15.211 --> 00:00:20.359
eat so we will cut that off. It doesn't taste
very good. Usually if it has already been

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:24.640
cut like this, you see how nasty that looks
on the end, we want to cut that off too and

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.180
expose a nice fresh end there as opposed to
the brown part that we got from the grocery

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.590
store. Now we are going to let this cut pretty
small. As a matter of fact we are going to

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.220
cut very small so what we are going to do
is we are just going to run our knife right

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.621
down the center of the rib until it splits
open like that and then we are going to run

00:00:40.621 --> 00:00:49.750
our knife down the center of each individual
rib then that we have. Use the tip of your

00:00:49.750 --> 00:01:01.370
knife just like that and now we are going
to take our knife and just very very tiny

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:11.740
mints here that we are working with. The reason
being is that we are not going to be pureeing

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:17.990
this or anything. It is just going to be a
mix together kind of sauce. It's okay if you

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.600
accidentally over cut some here because what's
going to happen in a second is we are going

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:31.069
to take everything that we just cut, all these
pieces, line them up like that and cut them

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:40.000
some more too. So nice easy stuff. You may
not even end up using that whole rib. You

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.539
really only need about an ounce of this celery
but unfortunately they don't sell half ribs

00:01:50.539 --> 00:02:00.350
or quarter ribs so it is the whole rib. Besides
I will show you what you can do with the leftovers

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:09.170
in a second. Nice little trick, so that is
our celery. So what we are going to do now

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:20.800
is figure out how much we need and how much
we don't. So I've got a little dish here and

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.760
I only need about that much. The rest I don't
need so what I am going to do is I am going

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:36.600
to put this in another dish and we will come
back to see what happens to it later. But

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:42.190
you will see that I end up utilizing the entire
thing. So this is very nice; no point in being

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:58.040
wasteful. If I can get all this celery out
of my knife. All right so off to our next

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.400
vegetable.
