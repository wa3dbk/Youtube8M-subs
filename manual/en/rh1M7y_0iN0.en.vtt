Mark Skaife,

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:06.190
how many years you've been coming to the Territory?

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:08.000
Nineteen nighty-eight was my first tour.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:08.600
Really?

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:09.600
Have you ever been outside Darwin?

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.600
Never.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.500
Really?

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:12.500
I'm so pumped for this

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.000
We're gonna finally get to see Kakadu

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:14.799
and get out of town.

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:16.600
Now, should I do the driving?

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.349
I don't think so, Mark.

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:19.400
Well, I drive for free.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.400
If you want.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:20.900
Okay I'll do it.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.300
Mate, what a beautiful part of the world, huh?

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:27.200
It's incredible.

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.200
The thing against me

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.700
is I expected it to be almost flat desert.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.100
And it's not.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.900
It's always bush and little mountains.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.800
That's a croc.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:36.600
No way.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:37.700
Just at the edge of the river.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.320
No way.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.100
Giant croc.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:40.800
Check it out.

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:41.600
And that is amazing.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:54.000

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.900
Do you see that crocodile?

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:05.100

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.100
Nice job, pilot.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:07.600
The Bark Hut Inn.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:09.700
Perfect. Ready for this?

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:11.800
How about local food?

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:13.700
Beautiful.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.600
Have a look at this place.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.800
I believe I could spend a day here.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:19.400
You could.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:20.900
It's got character, hasn't it? There's everything.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.800
So what have you enjoyed, Mark, about Kakadu?

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:25.900
I love the whole experience.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.500
For me it's something that I was

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.400
unsure what it would look like.

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.700
Even just the landscape, I didn't know what to expect.

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.400
Spending time with Patsy I will never forget.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.700
You know that's a real insight into Indigenous Australia.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.400
And the roads are good.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.800
There's plenty of people out there

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.400
there's people in buses

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.900
and a big pool of road trucks

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.500
and people in cars like us.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:46.000
That's good.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.200
My question to you.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:48.759
Is there a chance that you might shout?

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:49.800
It has been a good trip.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.100
And I'm in Territory, mate.

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.200
So this one's on me.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.050
Good work.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.600
Order up, not too big.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.500
