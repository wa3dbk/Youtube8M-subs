00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.860
Today I wanna talk to you about Pinterest
and how

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:08.470
to do promoted pins on Pinterest and
more importantly

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.370
if it's worthwhile for you to get more
traffic

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:19.000
to your blog from Pinterest. The first
thing you need to do

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.840
is head over to the application for
promoted pins

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.910
on the Pinterest website. If you don't have

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.490
the option turned on - on your account
yet.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.880
I should also mention that your account
should be

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:39.230
a business account on Pinterest and once
you have the

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:42.309
ads enabled for your account

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:46.030
you'll go over to ads.pinterest.com

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.190
in order to set up and manage your ads

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.870
And the next thing you need to do is
pin the

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.329
image from your blog, that you want to
promote.

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.609
So at the top of the dashboard you'll
see the promote button

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:05.280
and when you click that on

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.580
Pinterest will bring up all of your
recent pins.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:13.280
I'm gonna choose this one see how when I hover over, it

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.220
let's me know, you know if I click that
on it's going to

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.360
bring me to the promotions dashboard.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.240
This is where you set up your ad and
basically you're going to get the

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.549
option of the keywords that you want
people to find

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:33.439
that image based on. Then you'll get

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.150
the audience. Now

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.000
for location I like to use all but
then

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.420
you can also select language, and for
language I usually stick

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.509
to the English-speaking languages but
you see here that other languages

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.460
that you can use to advertise to are
there.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.000
You also can go by devices

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.950
I would choose all of them. Maybe you just
wanna do it on the web.

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:04.759
You may want to test

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:06.980
You may wanna do one version of the ad

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.550
on the web and then another version

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.570
of the same ad on the devices

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:17.310
that's up to you. But for most part just
getting started

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.920
I would just choose all. Same way with
gender

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.910
unless you have a product
that's for a specific gender

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.500
And the reason why the says "unknown" is
because a lot of times

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.190
Pinterest -- depending upon how people sign up for Pinterest

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.710
they won't know your gender - if you've
connected with Facebook or something

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:37.270
like that

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:42.610
then they know if you're male or female.
So the next thing you're going to do

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:48.820
is select your bid amount and I would
start off with a low bid like maybe

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.070
twenty five-cents

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.070
15 cent, because you're only gonna pay

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:57.780
when people actually click-through to

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.560
your blog. Then as you can see you can
verify

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.670
your destination URL of course you can't
change it once you're in here

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:11.190
and the name of your campaign. You always have to give the campaign a name

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.530
the date and your daily budget you may
want to put five dollars - you know it depends

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:17.420
upon your budget!

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.420
And then you'll click promote this pin.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.190
Now just to give you a couple tips - in
your description you're not allowed to

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:26.010
have

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.880
hashtags, you can't have pricing

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.940
in these descriptions as well.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.350
So I would just put some keywords in the
description of the pin,

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.680
probably same one that your are already
using on your blog anyway.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:47.680
Now for the sake of privacy I do have
to blur out some

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.320
love the details just because of Pinterest's

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.209
terms. But you get the idea that you're
gonna know

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:01.020
how many impressions you got how many
repins, the number of clicks,

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.489
the click-through rate, the

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:08.000
average cost-per-click and your total
spend.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.680
So now let's just go over into Google
Analytics

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:17.299
just to see if I got a surge

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.769
in traffic from Pinterest

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:24.440
during the time when I was running the
promotion. So over in Google Analytics I

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.449
can scroll down and see

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:29.729
that Pinterest was my number two
referral

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.660
traffic for the month. I'll just click on
Pinterest

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.240
and see that this surge

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:42.470
of traffic from Pinterest came around
the same time

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:45.870
that I was doing the promotion so it was
effective

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:49.070
I did get the traffic from Pinterest that I
wanted to get.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.870
Now one last thing I wanna show you,
because traffic is important but you

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:54.729
also can check your 

00:04:54.729 --> 00:04:59.440
goals that you have set up
in Google Analytics

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.720
and one of my goals is to make sure that
these people that came over from

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:04.590
Pinterest

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.910
actually look at more than one

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.380
page. Or they didn't just bounce right of

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:14.789
of my blog. So let's take a look at the
goals

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:20.320
Over in Google Analytics you'll see what I
did was I actually changed the date range

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.330
to include the two rounds

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:26.810
of Pinterest promotions that I did, and

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.000
you'll see that there is definitely
spikes in traffic around the times when

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:32.630
I was running the promotions

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.690
and as we scroll down we'll see

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:42.699
that not only did I get a lot of visits
to my site from Pinterest

00:05:42.699 --> 00:05:47.909
but I also see that the people spent

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:53.229
a good amount of time you know
the bounce rate is extremely low.

00:05:53.229 --> 00:05:56.270
People who are visiting more than one
page

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.900
which is fantastic that's exactly what
you want to see from a promotion.

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.070
So now that you've seen the interface

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:09.340
and some of the results that I got with
my promoted pins

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.830
tell me what do you think are you going
to use promoted pins

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:18.349
