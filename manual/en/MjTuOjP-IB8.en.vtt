Hi This is Alia and welcome back to my kitchen!

00:00:10.089 --> 00:00:13.899
Today, I'm going to show you how to 
 make one of my favorite desserts ever!

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:18.561
We're going to make "Egg Custard Tart" OR "Pastel De Nata"

00:00:18.561 --> 00:00:22.108
Whatever you want to call them! They just delicious!

00:00:22.108 --> 00:00:26.975
I think the original come from Portugal as their names Porgies Ectors

00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:31.112
But it's very very popular is Asia and 
 I love eating them here in Korea.

00:00:31.112 --> 00:00:33.694
So I'm going to learn you how to make them

00:00:33.694 --> 00:00:38.768
They basically, buff pastry with a custard and baked to perfection

00:00:38.768 --> 00:00:42.197
Buff pastry is very easy, just get from your supermarket

00:00:42.197 --> 00:00:44.049
in the frozen section

00:00:44.049 --> 00:00:47.611
If you don't have it in your supper 
 market, You can make it at home

00:00:47.611 --> 00:00:51.640
Click here to watch my video and how 
 to made fresh homemade buff pastry 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.659
which I'm using today in my video

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:57.060
That's it! Super delicious! Let's start!

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.635
First, we are going to make the crust. 

00:00:59.635 --> 00:01:03.334
We are using puff pastry – this one is homemade!

00:01:03.334 --> 00:01:06.042
Check out my video on how to make it! 

00:01:06.042 --> 00:01:12.688
First rule, the pastry has to be cold otherwise it will stick 
 and it will be hard to work with it! 

00:01:12.688 --> 00:01:19.485
Lightly flour your working space, the top of 
 the puff pastry, and your rolling pin.

00:01:19.485 --> 00:01:21.777
Roll out the puff pastry. 

00:01:21.777 --> 00:01:27.417
I am going to use a muffin pan and a cookie cutter 
 that is the same size as the pan wholes. 

00:01:27.417 --> 00:01:30.080
Cut out the pastry with the cookie cutter

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:31.965
remove excess dough

00:01:31.965 --> 00:01:35.781
and place the pastry disks into the muffin pan.

00:01:31.965 --> 00:01:35.781
and place the pastry disks into the muffin pan.

00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:42.660
Gently press in the center and sides of the pastry so 
 it takes the shape of the muffin wholes. 

00:01:42.658 --> 00:01:47.100
If the excess pastry is sticky, wrap with a plastic sheet

00:01:47.104 --> 00:01:51.410
and chill in the fridge for 30 minutes before rolling it again.  

00:01:51.414 --> 00:01:55.310
Poke the pastry base with a fork multiple times

00:01:55.313 --> 00:01:59.140
then line the pastries with baking cups

00:01:59.141 --> 00:02:02.640
and place a bunch of beans in the cups.

00:02:02.643 --> 00:02:08.070
We are adding weight on the puff pastry base so 
 that is does not puff and stays flat.

00:02:08.071 --> 00:02:12.840
Place the pastry cups in the fridge for 15 minutes before baking them 

00:02:12.842 --> 00:02:19.450
in a preheated oven at 400 F / 
 200 C for around 20 minutes. 

00:02:19.451 --> 00:02:22.510
Now let’s make the custard. 

00:02:22.511 --> 00:02:26.610
Heat the milk and cream in a saucepan on medium heat. 

00:02:26.613 --> 00:02:31.550
In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the sugar until dissolved.

00:02:31.547 --> 00:02:37.560
Then add the cornstarch and continue whisking until well incorporated. 

00:02:37.555 --> 00:02:41.400
Once the milk and cream reach a boiling point

00:02:37.555 --> 00:02:41.400
Once the milk and cream reach a boiling point

00:02:41.405 --> 00:02:46.920
turn off the heat, and add the vanilla extract. Mix well. 

00:02:46.922 --> 00:02:52.660
Pour a little bit of the milk mixture 
 on the egg mixture and beat quickly.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:03:00.220
We do this step to temper the eggs and increase their 
 temperature before adding the rest of the hot milk mixture.

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:03.780
Otherwise, the eggs will cook! 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:03.780
Otherwise, the eggs will cook! 

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:09.160
Continue adding the hot milk mixture to the 
 eggs little by little while whisking. 

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:09.160
Continue adding the hot milk mixture to the 
 eggs little by little while whisking. 

00:03:09.158 --> 00:03:16.440
Then pour back the custard mixture into the 
 saucepan and cook on medium heat. 

00:03:16.444 --> 00:03:22.790
The secret here is to just continuously whisk the mixture so it stays smooth.

00:03:22.786 --> 00:03:26.890
Otherwise, it will be grainy and you don’t want that.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:34.040
So whisk whisk whisk until the mixture starts 
 thickening and becomes a medium-thick custard. 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:34.040
So whisk whisk whisk until the mixture starts 
 thickening and becomes a medium-thick custard. 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:34.040
So whisk whisk whisk until the mixture starts 
 thickening and becomes a medium-thick custard. 

00:03:34.044 --> 00:03:41.130
Remove the custard from the heat and add the honey to it. Mix well.

00:03:41.131 --> 00:03:47.250
Place a pastry bag, still closed, in a bowl 
 and fill it up with the custard.

00:03:47.252 --> 00:03:50.130
then clip out the end later. 

00:03:50.127 --> 00:03:53.400
Check out our pastries, they are done!!! 

00:03:53.403 --> 00:04:00.090
Remove the baking papers and beans to see these 
 beautiful pastry cups with a superb golden color.

00:04:00.094 --> 00:04:05.920
Keep the pastry cups in the baking pan, and 
 fill them up with the custard cream.

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.990
Then place them back in the oven, still at 400 F / 200 C

00:04:11.991 --> 00:04:15.770
 for around 10 minutes until the custard settles

00:04:15.768 --> 00:04:23.040
You know they are ready when you gently touch the surface 
 of the custard and it does not feel sticky

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:28.620
and when you shake the pastry, the custard is firm but still wiggly.

00:04:28.623 --> 00:04:31.040
Remove the tarts from the pan 

00:04:31.044 --> 00:04:35.840
and let them cool down on your counter 
 for 15 minutes before serving them. 

00:04:35.845 --> 00:04:42.350
