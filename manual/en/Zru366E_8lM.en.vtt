00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:23.470
In a 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.679
perfectly fitting and completely unplanned
sequence of events this week, I played the

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:32.759
director's cut of Deus Ex: Human Revolution
the day before playing this...a game from

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.250
the same publisher, in the same genre and
with many of the same ideas.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.250
Only one game is considered a masterpiece,
and the other is Project: Snowblind.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.140
A game I've never even heard of.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:43.910
Take a guess which one's more fun.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.020
Oh, and here's a hint.

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:48.200
If it was the masterpiece, there wouldn't
be much of a point to this intro.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:01:10.950
And my intros always have a point.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.000
So I did not expect much from Project: Snowblind.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.540
It's a shooter from the mid-2000s, which means
it's probably blurry and awkward and trying

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.869
very hard to be the cinematic shooters that
would come out ten years later.

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.420
And hey, look—Project: Snowblind is all
of those things, what are the odds?

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.130
But Project: Snowblind has a lot more going
for it than the fact that it was apparently

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.649
named after a Black Sabbath song.

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.630
It's also a really fun shooter.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.310
Fast, straightforward...and fun.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.770
Something bigger and more celebrated shooters
could really learn from.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:52.840
So the first thing you notice about Snowblind
is that it doesn't waste your time with stories

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.590
or characters that are never as interesting
as game developers think.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:57.941
Instead, this one sticks to its strengths.

00:01:57.941 --> 00:02:02.899
It starts you off with an all-out gun battle
against soldiers and walking robots before

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.160
culminating in an aerial assault you stave
off with a goddamn turret.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.700
You've blown up 37 robots and finished an
entire level in the same amount of time other

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.200
shooters take introducing you to poorly voiced
characters with boring, broken stories.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.730
What's your motivation?

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.150
You're actually having fun.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:20.760
Weird, right?

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.209
So the thing it borrows from Deus Ex is, obviously,
the whole augmentation thing.

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:26.780
They're even called augmentations.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.000
And you play as a soldier who—you guessed
it—has augmentations.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.690
His name is Nathan, and he likes to blow sh*t
up.

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.230
Snowblind is completely focused on action.

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.790
It's a game with plenty of style and presentational
panache, for its time...but the game is always

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:41.860
highlighting the action.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.680
It doesn't feel like, "Oh, we have to get
through this gameplay to get to our next big

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.680
cut scene."

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.879
It's putting all of its energy into gameplay...and,
you know, being a shooter.

00:02:51.879 --> 00:03:05.120
In which you shoot things.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.490
That's the thing I love about Snowblind.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.930
It's just so fast and to the point.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.970
The pacing is such a refreshing contrast to
a lot of modern games, which drag their feet

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.180
over narrative pleasantries.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.299
None of that here.

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:17.459
Just awesome gameplay.

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:18.459
And that's the thing.

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:22.459
This game plays far better than you might
expect a nine-year-old shooter to play.

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.950
Great controls, tight aiming...really solid
shooting mechanics.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.610
Speaking of mechanics...the augmentations
are well done, too.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.780
You earn some seriously empowering abilities
in Snowblind, and they're actually usable,

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:34.780
you know?

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:38.290
You can see them in action, as opposed to
some minor attribute increase.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:39.770
You get the vision augmentation?

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.299
Yeah, now you can see through f*cking walls.

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:44.030
And you can use that to shoot enemies that
haven't even seen you.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:49.590
You can slow time, you can create some electrical
field that makes you invincible...these are

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.319
the kinda powers I want from a game.

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:56.640
I want badass powers that let me strike my
enemies like the fist of an angry god.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:58.930
Not, freaking...oh, plus one defense.

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:01.400
Now I can take ten bullets, instead of nine.

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:14.510
And you know, I'm impressed with how it looks,
too.

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:19.100
A lot of games from this era that went for
that gritty, realistic look...they look like

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:22.100
blurry brown messes, from a modern perspective.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.100
This one doesn't.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.590
It actually looks pretty good, especially
some of the environments.

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.680
It could've used more color, but you can say
that about every shooter.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.510
I guess earth tones are the only testosterone-compliant
tones.

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.580
Look, is this some radical piece of game design?

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:37.580
Hardly.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.660
Does it push the medium to new emotional heights?

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:41.721
F*ck no, that's what I love about it.

00:04:41.721 --> 00:04:44.580
It's a shooter that remembers what the shooter
is.

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:50.490
The whole game—it's this linear path through
big robots, big ambushes and even bigger explosions.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:53.830
And in 2013, that's a breath of fresh air.

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.060
You know, apart from all the smoke.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.600
The explosions.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:15.780
It's Project: Snowblind for the original Xbox.
