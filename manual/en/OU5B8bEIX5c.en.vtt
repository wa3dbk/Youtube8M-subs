00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.000
Hi, and welcome to the ValveTime news.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.690
Each week, we'll bring you the biggest talking points
regarding Valve and the community.

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:13.130
Now, the news:

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.440
As promised in a blog post last week,

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.690
Counter-Strike: Global Offensive was updated to include
a revamped version of the classic map "de_mirage,"

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.360
which has received a full visual overhaul and
several tweaks to readability and gameplay.

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.090
The map was released alongside a new
blog post on the Counter-Strike website,

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:32.620
which talks about how Mirage can be
played in the three main game-mode types,

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.100
including Deathmatch, Competitive, and Casual.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.670
The blog post also announced a new weekend
sale for the Operation Payback pass,

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.200
which can be picked up for $0.99 or £0.79
until sometime on Monday June the 17th.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.470
The pass, which is normally available for $5.99, or £5 if you're British,

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.010
helps "pay-back" community creators similar
to Team Fortress 2's map stamp system,

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.110
while providing players with access to a number
of the Steam Workshop's most well received maps

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.350
on Valve's official low-latency servers.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.240
If you'd like to learn more about the sale or the new Mirage map,

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.290
be sure to head on over to the Counter-Strike
blog post via a link in the video description.

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.850
Alternatively, if you're just looking to get
stuck in with some Counter-Strike action,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.320
Mirage is now available as a bomb defusal mission,

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.170
which you can check out from the main
matchmaking section of the CS:GO play tab.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.460
This week saw the introduction of two major Dota 2 patches,

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.940
the first of which introduced a new "Compendium Matchmaking"
game-mode accessible only to compendium owners.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.310
The new mode allows players to participate in online
matches using predetermined heroes and lane setups

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.850
which appeared in a featured professional
International 3 qualifier game.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:41.300
This week's featured match is the third game between
RoX.KIS and EG in the semifinals of the Western qualifiers,

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.000
which EG infamously threw away their chance at winning.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:47.580
The new game mode can be accessed via
a new "Compendium Matchmaking" option

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:51.320
below the normal game modes in the
Play tab of the Dota 2 menu dashboard.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.430
The second update released this week introduced
a wide selection of gameplay fixes,

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.410
UI upgrades, and a pair of new higher
quality models for Puck and Brewmaster.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.260
Several changes were also made to core gameplay mechanics
with the introduction of "Quick Cast" and a warning ping system.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:08.270
The "Quick Cast" system, once activated from the settings UI,

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.390
will automatically cast the player's
abilities towards their mouse pointer,

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.930
streamlining the magic system for players who
prefer not to have to click to confirm their abilities.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:20.080
The warning ping system allows players to
hold the Ctrl key while pinging on the map

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.060
to create an "X" shaped warning icon on the mini-map
to highlight potential dangers to their teammates.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.420
New cosmetic item sets were made available for
Axe, Lina, Pudge, Skeleton King, and Sniper,

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:36.550
while the contents of the "Treasure of Incandescent Wax" chest
were revealed to include a new Vengeful Spirit-themed ward

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.240
and several singular cosmetic items for Doom,
Skywrath Mage, Necrolyte, and many more.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.590
The "Driftwood," "Gear Tooth," "Jungle Ruin,"
and "Menace" custom HUD skins

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.940
were all updated to include new preview images and new
skin-specific loading screens suited to each appropriate theme.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.570
For more information regarding this week's pair of patches,

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:00.770
be sure to head on over to ValveTime.net for our full write-up,
the official changelog, or Cyborgmatt's full patch analysis.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.370
Links to all three are included in the video description, as always.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:07.770
In similar news, it was revealed in this month's edition of PC Gamer

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:13.890
that Valve are planning to ship Dota 2 sometime later in the
summer before the International 3 tournament in August 2013.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.900
The original article only briefly touched upon the release window,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:20.930
so we decided to contact Dota 2
project lead Erik Johnson for confirmation.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:26.090
Shortly after our reporter smash sent Erik an email,
he responded and confirmed, "That is the plan."

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:32.440
So you can expect to see Dota 2 officially lose its beta title sometime
after the inclusion of heroes Legion Commander and Abaddon,

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.970
who were mentioned in the PC Gamer article as being the
final two heroes set to be included before the game's launch.

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.740
We've included a screenshot of the full email over on ValveTime.net,

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.160
which you can go check out to get a
closer look at the confirmation by Erik J.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.650
We'll be sure to let you know when a
definitive release date is announced.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.790
Valve made a special announcement on the
Team Fortress 2 website earlier this week

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:58.480
which revealed that the game's community contribution
service passed the $10 million threshold last weekend.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:04.050
The $10 million has been paid out to over 400
contributors and partners over the last few years,

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.610
with over $250,000 of that total being distributed to the 60+ individuals

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:11.730
who contributed towards the recent "Robotic Boogaloo" update,

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.570
which featured entirely community-made assets.

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.950
To celebrate the major monetary milestone,

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.590
Valve announced they were releasing a new
update to the content submission system,

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:24.530
which now features a "Gold star" rating
that is awarded to user-submitted items

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:27.740
should they meet a set of automatically
identified, predetermined conditions

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:31.500
in order to quickly analyze how game-ready hats or weapons may be.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.420
Several days later, Valve introduced a minor update
which included 10 new items from the Steam Workshop,

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.970
all of which had been vetted using the new gold star system,

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.920
showing the potential improved efficiency of the system.

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.600
A blog post released alongside the update claimed,

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.500
So stay tuned for more big Team Fortress 2
news and content coming sooner or later.

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:00.450
For this week's discussion, leave a comment
down below letting us know

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.270
specifically what kind of content you'd like
to see Valve deliver for Team Fortress 2

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:06.860
and why you would personally enjoy that particular update.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.980
Would you rather see an expansion of existing content,
or something entirely new, similar to Mann vs. Machine?

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:14.140
We want to hear your ideas!

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:20.780
Last week, we told you about Respawn Entertainment's new
"Titanfall" first person shooter title set to use Valve's Source engine.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:22.940
While few details were available at the time,

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.880
a lot more information regarding the
game has surfaced in the past week

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.490
after the game was shown off multiple times at the
Electronic Entertainment Expo in Los Angeles,

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:33.910
which ran from Monday, June the 10th
until Wednesday, June the 13th.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:39.300
The game's central mechanics revolve around the transition
between traditional on-ground first person shooting,

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:44.010
free running/parkour and large-scale mech
combat using robotic suits known as "Titans".

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.550
The Source engine's trademark facial animation
system was also on display during the reveal,

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:51.130
even if it appeared strangely out of sync with the audio.

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:53.820
While the game certainly shows a few of Source's minor wrinkles,

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.220
we were amazed at the level of visual fidelity
and scale possible on the decade-old engine,

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.060
even with the supposed next-gen changes
Respawn have allegedly been making.

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.050
Polygon's Aaron Gies reported on the design
decisions behind the engine choice,

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:08.780
which include the development team's familiarity with the engine

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:13.650
and the ability for Source to run smoothly at
60 frames per second on current generation consoles,

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:16.160
something many other third party engines lack.

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.950
If Respawn Entertainment's 65-person team is able to
make this kind of technical leap with the old Source engine,

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:27.450
color us excited to find out what Valve's own dedicated engineers
and programmers will be able to do with Source 2.

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:30.890
We'll keep you posted with any further developments
regarding the current Source engine

00:06:30.890 --> 00:06:33.170
or the upcoming next-gen Source 2.

00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.150
That brings us to the end of another week of Valve news.
