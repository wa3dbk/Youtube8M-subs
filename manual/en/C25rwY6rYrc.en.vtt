00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.870
Despite what your intuition may tell you,
simplicity - nay, 'elegance' - is very hard

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.170
to pull off when designing a game, especially
when you're trying to convey a deeper meaning

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.900
and experience.

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.070
Crow by Sunside Games strips back the rail
shooter and while its individual parts may

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.670
seem simplistic, getting the full story will
require dedication and skill.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.500
The titular crow is sent from another plane
of existence to act as a vessel of vengeance,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.970
eventually getting caught up in the struggle
between two 'spirits' seeking to use your

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.750
powers for their gain.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.850
The choices you make are starkly black or
white, but the reasons for making your decision

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.600
may be influenced by the story you uncover
as you explore each landscape.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.410
There are two main gameplay sections that
are repeated over and over with players first

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.399
gliding around a landscape in search of 'trinkets'
that help to unlock skill points.

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.410
As you progress you'll uncover either 'challenge'
maps or 'story' features where the game transforms

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.429
in to a third-person rail-shooter.

00:01:00.429 --> 00:01:04.309
Swiping allows you to move the crow around
the screen (avoiding projectiles and dangerous

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.810
environments), while an energy gauge charges
up, allowing you to cast one of several spells.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.210
The basic shield and attack are all you need
to finish the game, but new powers will also

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.250
unlock (and can be upgraded with skill points)
to make life easier.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.060
Unfortunately, despite the beautiful environments,
Crow suffers for its third-person perspective,

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.620
making it extremely difficult to avoid some
projectiles thanks to a combination of your

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.790
finger and the large bird itself getting in
the way.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.950
At times it's also unclear as to the 'depth'
of an object, making it all too easy to run

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.610
in to a hazard you though you already passed.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.820
This would be far more forgivable if some
of the longer battle sequences featured checkpoints

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:45.670
- in particular, the final boss may make you
put down the game depending on the path you've

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.670
chosen.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.060
Despite these concerns, Crow still manages
to provide a compelling experience that's

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:54.620
sure to eat up an afternoon - it's all too
easy to catch yourself saying 'I'll just clear

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.530
one more area' and before you know it, the
game is over.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.500
With any luck, future updates will polish
the experience even more, making it a definite

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:12.200
must-try for those after something out of
the ordinary.
