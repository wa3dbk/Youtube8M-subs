00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:05.960
Welcome to 'Draw My Life'.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:11.980
I'm the average American girl in the United
States.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.440
And this is my life.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:17.340
It's a pretty average one.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.770
And I love pink.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:19.880
Hooray.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:24.090
The average girl is going to be named Sophia
because that is the most common name in the

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.019
United States.

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.720
And when Sophia grows up she's probably going
to have brown hair because like most people

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.550
have brown hair and according to the CDC she's
going to be 5 foot 3 inches tall and 166 pounds

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.829
and she'll like polka dots too.

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.780
When Sophia is a girl she's going to love
horses because don't all girls love horses.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.449
I mean this would not be complete without
loving horses.

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.070
And she loves horses so much in fact that
Sophia likes to wear her hair in a ponytail

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:50.250
and she's all like, 'Yay, I love my ponytail.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:57.989
Being a kid is fun until she hits 12 to 13
years old when she has her first period.

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.610
And at that point estrogen makes it's debut
in little Sophia's life, bringing along with

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.909
it all those wonderful changes that will bring
Sophia from girlhood into womanhood.

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:16.729
Things like higher rates of depression, increased
risk of osteoporosis, and increased risk of

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.329
someone saying, 'Girl you crazy,' and her
saying, 'It's just the estrogen.

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:22.340
I swear.'

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:30.439
Ahh, and then at 17, oh 17 the average girl,
our little Sophia will have S-E-X for the

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.630
very first time but you know, FYI kids just
because you're having sex doesn't necessarily

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.340
mean that it's love.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.020
Uhh, this is an unromantic view of the average
woman's life.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:44.510
But then she's going to be all like texting
all the time, like, 'Hey gurl, where u at?'

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:49.579
According to studies Sophia will be sending
more than 100 text messages per day driving

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.909
her parents totally crazy because she's going
to be on like Facebook liking a bunch of stuff,

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:01.020
tweeting stuff, hashtag like this bird looks
weird, or here's an instagram picture of some

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.330
food that I ate, everybody like it.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.220
Share it.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.399
And then at 18, Sophia, smart Sophia is going
to graduate from high school and we're so

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.380
proud of you Sophia.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.010
And then she's going to go to college and
she's going to study business because business

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.600
is the most common major for men and women
in the United States, didn't you know.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:31.220
But the thing is in the real world Sophia's
probably going to earn 77 cents to every dollar

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.500
that the guy she graduates with will make
in the work place because of something delightfully

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.070
called the gender wage gap.

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.070
Poo.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:47.400
And on top of that being a secretary is the
most common job in the United States for women

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.220
so there is unfortunately an okay chance that
Sophia might end up serving coffee to this

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:54.800
really annoying guy who's like, 'Where's my
coffee?'

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.510
She's all like, 'Ugh, why'd I go to college?'

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:03.200
And because of that Sophia is probably going
to lose out on $434,000 which is the lifetime

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.660
cost for a woman of the gender wage gap.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.280
All the sudden this average life is getting
so political.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.560
On top of that I mean let's get real, Sophia
is one of the 78% of American women who doesn't

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.070
like her body either.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.400
What's going on?

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.590
The average life for women is kind of becoming
a downer so why don't we talk about shoes?

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.330
Did you know that the average woman in the
United States owns 17 pairs of shoes, kind

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.650
of like these fabulous red-soled Christian
Lou Betons?

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.700
I mean those shoes are fit for a queen.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:38.980
Now speaking of fit for a queen, check out
that engagement ring.

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:39.980
That's right folks.

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:42.460
Little Sophia is getting married.

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:49.290
Hooray I love life and my ring and oh I can't
wait for my day, I'm 27 years old like the

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:51.670
average bride in the United States.

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:58.490
But oh good gracious my wedding costs over
$25,000.

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:05.430
Yes this is the average cost of a wedding
these days in the United States y'all.

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:07.060
One word: Elope.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:08.060
Okay?

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:13.720
Now because of this financial expenditure
Sophia's turning into a little bit of a Bridezilla

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:17.110
being like argh, I don't even care about my
roses.

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.000
But then she's all like you know what actually
it's totally fine, I'll be fine.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.230
And according to statistics she'll have 1.67
babies.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.640
Hooray.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.951
And as Sophia gets older, you know, she's
got her job, her marriage, her kids and she

00:04:31.951 --> 00:04:36.910
thinks to herself like most American women
do at a certain age, 'Can I really have it

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.910
all?

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:38.910
Everything I need?'

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:43.780
While she's wondering that time is passing
and she all the sudden is an old lady with

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:44.780
a cane.

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:47.270
And she lives to be 85 years old.

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.660
And then I guess she dies so that's the end
of the average life of an American woman.
