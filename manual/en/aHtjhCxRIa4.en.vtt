00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.450
Happy New Year, Vsauce! Michael here.
And in honor of 2013

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:07.950
let's discuss 13 things.

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.240
To begin, where to spend all that cash
you picked up over the holidays?

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.049
Now, plenty of website sell cool stuff.
United Nuclear sells

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.380
Aerogel, radioactive isotopes, jet engine schematic

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.859
and even marbles doped with uranium.
Maths Gear sells these cool non transitive

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:26.859
dice I actually bought

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:31.750
yesterday, as does Grand Illusions.
But they also carry for explosive magic

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.320
tricks,

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.739
optical illusion masks and a poster of

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.149
this image.
What makes that

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.629
image so special?
Well, it's an example

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.950
of the land effect.
Even though it appears to contain

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:49.590
a bunch of different colors -
oranges and yellows and greens,

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.980
the entire image is actually made out of nothing

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:57.629
but red. Seriously. I've linked the image
down in the descriptions, so you can grab

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.079
it and investigated using

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.570
your favorite image editor.
The yellows are actually

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:06.790
light reds or pinks.
And the green is just dull grey

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:09.979
red.
What's going on is called

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.310
color constancy.
Your visual system, your eyes and brain

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.680
calculate the average illumination
conditions of a scene

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.479
and then subtract those conditions,
so that colors remain relatively constant.

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:25.990
This is why a blue object looks blue,
whether you're viewing it

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.810
under the midday Sun or a dark red
sunset or fluorescent light or

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:30.810
incandescent light.

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.000
It's a very brilliant system, but it can fool

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.770
us. Special images, like this one, appear
to be illuminated with a lot of red

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:39.290
light,

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:43.680
so your brain actually subtracts the red
and makes assumptions.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.470
There are plenty of other examples of
the land effect and other ways our visual

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.040
system lies to us.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.140
But you know what else is a lie?

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.660
Raindrops.
Well, at least

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.450
that depiction of raindrops.
Raindrops are not shaped like

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.860
teardrops.
Surface tension means that  small drops are spherical,

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.540
but when they combine the air and get
bigger, the pressure of the air below

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:09.780
them as they fall causes the bottom to

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.260
flatten, which means that raindrops are
shaped less like

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.730
teardrops and more like hamburger buns.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.520
But how many raindrops have fallen

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:24.440
on land ever?
It's a fun question

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.830
and there are plenty of resources
discussing how many raindrops fall

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.410
during a typical storm,

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.239
but throughout all of history?
Let's go to mathforum.org for this one.

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.940
Doctor Ian calculated,

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.940
quite roughly but amusingly, that given
the percentage of earth

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.390
usually covered in land and the amount of rain that

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.280
typically falls on earth and the volume of a raindrop,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.739
the total number of raindrops that have fallen on land,

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:54.250
ever since earth began, is about 16 times

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.360
10 to the 28.
So, earth

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.560
has had a lot of raindrops.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:05.239
But you know what earth doesn't have a
lot of? Nice big, old chunks of Moon rock.

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.360
Material from the Moon is incredibly rare.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.569
We can only get pieces of the Moon in two ways.
By

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.610
visiting it or by finding chunks of the
Moon that were blown off

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.629
a long time ago and eventually fell to Earth.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.800
Interestingly, you can buy paintings

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.060
containing traces of Moon dust made

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.950
by an astronaut.
I discussed this with my friends over at emotistyle,

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.370
video link in the description.
But the point is, you will not be owning

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.400
a big old Moon rock anytime soon.
Interestingly,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.409
a surprising number of the rocks we
brought back from the Moon

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:45.099
have been stolen or just plain

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:48.510
lost.
For instance, in 2002

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.370
interns Thad Roberts and Tiffany Fowler stole

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.890
101 grams of lunar material

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.030
from the Johnson Space Center.
They celebrated by throwing the rocks onto a

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.560
bed,

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.129
and I guess the best way to explain what
happened next would just be to point out

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:07.030
that the book based on this true story

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:12.110
is called "Sex on the Moon."
Or, from a different angle,

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.870
fun.
This was built using the Side View maker.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.690
Type in a word or name and it will
construct the word using

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:23.970
dots, which from another angle say
something else. For instance, Vsauce

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:27.780
can be vacuum.
If you prefer dots that represent people,

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:33.630
Brandon Martin-Anderson's got just what
you need. The entire 2010 US Census

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:37.040
on a map with a dot for every single

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.410
person.
The data is specific down to the size of an individual

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.800
block.
It's really fun to play around with, as is

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.600
the searchable Calvin and Hobbes.
I shared this on @tweetsauce a few weeks ago.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:53.729
Type in a word and you can find every
single Calvin and Hobbes comic strip

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:59.310
that used that word. Words or phrases
that help you remember something are

00:04:59.310 --> 00:04:59.900
called

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:03.050
mnemonics.
For instance, if you wanna remember the exact

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.430
speed of light in meters per second in a
vacuum, just count the number of letters

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:10.509
and each word of this sentence.
"We

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:15.710
guarantee certainty, clearly referring to
this light mnemonic."

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:19.139
Or if you're like me, your biggest
struggle is spelling the word

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:22.560
diarrhoea.
Well, don't worry. Just remember

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.750
diarrhoea is a really runny heap

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.370
of endless amounts.
We've all seen illusions like this before.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.259
Four circles with corners cut out of them.
We perceive

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:38.830
an actual square resting on top of
circles, even though no square

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:42.130
is there.
Now interestingly, if you take this shape

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:46.030
and put it on top of text, the letters within the

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.229
fake square appear bigger than the rest of the letters.

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:54.150
This is because our brain assumes the letters are closer to us

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:58.740
than the rest of the text. After all,
the letters are on top of a square

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:02.400
that's on top of circles on top of text.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.690
Speaking of size, let's take a look at the scale

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:08.930
of our solar system.
OMGspace.net

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.819
is a website containing images of the
Sun and the planets

00:06:12.819 --> 00:06:15.870
to scale.
Not just in size, but also

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:20.180
distance. If you scroll long enough,
you will eventually get to Mercury

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.310
and then Venus and then Earth and so on.
Or, just click a planet's name

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.940
and have the site take you there right away.
If that sort of thing makes you

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:28.710
feel

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:33.090
small and insignificant, rush on over and grab yourself

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.490
emergency compliment dot com.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.220
The site will keep complimenting you
until you feel better,

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.729
but if practicing patience is more your thing, check out

00:06:43.729 --> 00:06:48.960
chickenonaraft.com.
Geo sketch is a really fun way to draw.

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.490
You have this strange folding mechanism that

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.710
draws.
You can individually control the rate of rotation for each

00:06:56.710 --> 00:07:00.990
joint to see how it affects the image.
But if you'd rather combine rotation

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.410
with our solar system,

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:05.500
check out gravity.
Click and drag to place

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.039
objects of varying size in the space and watch how

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:12.090
they interact.
So there you go

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.210
that was about 13 things.

00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:18.229
I guess. I don't really know.
But there's more.

00:07:18.229 --> 00:07:22.250
I created a playlist of videos that you should totally see.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:26.060
I host the playlist and you can start it by
clicking the link at the top of this

00:07:26.060 --> 00:07:27.139
video's description

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:30.800
or this annotation.
I call it a lean back,

00:07:30.800 --> 00:07:34.660
because you start the playlist and
just lean back and let YouTube

00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:37.919
do the work.
So, what are you waiting for? Go ahead and click

00:07:37.919 --> 00:07:39.619
and I will see you over there.

00:07:39.900 --> 00:07:41.200
And as always,

00:07:41.210 --> 00:07:42.270
thanks for watching.
