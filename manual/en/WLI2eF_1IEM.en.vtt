-The Amazing spider-man-

00:00:18.407 --> 00:00:23.691
Peter Parker was just an attractive, Intelligent, Likeable, Athletic, Well-dressed

00:00:23.692 --> 00:00:24.692
Teenaged loser

00:00:26.054 --> 00:00:28.808
But when he easily walks into a high security lab,

00:00:29.856 --> 00:00:33.518
one radio-active spider bite will give Peter the ability to...

00:00:33.691 --> 00:00:35.105
Twitch like a crackhead

00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:37.086

AUNT MAY: "Who does this to you?"
PETER: "Please, please go to sleep!"

00:00:53.362 --> 00:00:57.502
And studder worse than Shia Labuef in Transformers.

00:00:57.692 --> 00:01:00.130
PETER "Uhm so uh you want to uh, I don't know

00:01:00.783 --> 00:01:01.654

Proving that love always prevails, even when
you have gaping wounds that require immediate medical attention

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.119
Immerse yourself in the epic battle, between a hero who refuses to fight with his mask on

00:01:37.511 --> 00:01:42.247
And a villain, with the most cliche origin story imaginable...

00:01:42.248 --> 00:01:46.361
Who is conveniently connected to the most
important people in Peter's life

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.566

mentor, is that who your talking about?

UNCLE BEN "That if you could do good things for otherpeople, you would have a moral obligation to do those things

00:02:08.645 --> 00:02:12.396
"That's what's at stake here. Not choice...
responsibility

00:02:13.024 --> 00:02:17.431
As well as all these other moments that you've already seen before

And more of this

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:24.811

NARRATOR Swing along, with the smartest teenager in
Manhattan

Who uses the myspace of search engines

00:02:31.926 --> 00:02:35.538
And does a terrible job of hiding his secret identity

00:02:38.834 --> 00:02:40.849
