Hello and welcome to another jewelry making
video brought to you by KeepsakeCrafts.net.

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:23.439
Today, we are going to be making this happy
bracelet full of beaded pearl dangles. It

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.420
is kind of like a party on your wrist.
To make this bracelet, the first thing you

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.920
will need is a bracelet base. I have gone
ahead and started mine here. I have chosen

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:40.550
three different types of chain. We have one
with 10 mm links, another with 5 mm, and another

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.860
with 6 mm.
All I have done is, I have cut one of them

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.860
to be the length I need for a bracelet. Then,
I put all three onto a jump ring, and then

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.730
cut the other two to match the length. I also
added a lobster clasp to this end.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:05.420
To finish the other end of the bracelet, all
you need to do is open another jump ring,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:12.420
and slide in all the ends of the chain. Make
sure your jump ring is closed securely. That

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:16.830
being done, we now have all of our bead dangles
to make.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:23.830
I have here an assortment of glass pearls.
They actually came in a bag from Fire Mountain

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:31.420
Gems. This is called the, "Mixed Glass Pearl
Collection". They range from 12 mm down to

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:39.220
5 mm.
I have just slid them all on to a head pin.

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:46.350
Each bead has also gotten a gunmetal plated
bead cap. That will just tie everything all

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.570
together. I have about 60 of these here. This
is how I recommend you work.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.229
If you are making one of these pieces of jewelry
that has a lot of bead dangles, just do it

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:05.229
assembly line style. Get all your beads and
bead caps on to head pins. The next step will

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.690
be to trim and the step after that will be to
make loops.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:19.610
Let me show you that. You simply take a ruler.
I find it helpful to have a ruler, so that

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.850
I make them all the same length. You are going
to cut, I like to sort of, grab it with my

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:33.630
pliers and pull on it so that I know I've got
all the wire that is coming out of the bead.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.970
Right at 3/8-inch I'll snip it with the
flush part of my pliers towards the part I

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.480
am keeping. Three eights, about a centimeter
of wire sticking out the end

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:56.280
Next, grasp that wire, and if you need to
mark a 2 mm spot on your pliers with a Sharpie,

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.639
So your loops will all be consistent. Put that
wire in there so you can't feel any

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:05.840
of it coming out.
Your hand should be positioned like this,

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:16.220
with the pliers facing up. All you do is twist
your wrist. Keep twisting until that wire

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:23.380
has crossed over itself. And then, we're just
going to grab this and bend it back. That

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.000
centers the loop over the bead, and also uncrosses
it from itself.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.850
It should be nice and closed right now. You
are just going to do that with all of your

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:44.650
bead dangles. Like I said, it is a great idea to string them all, trim them all and then make all your loops

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:49.690
at once. It is just a nice project to sit
and listen to some music, or listen to a good book.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:52.609
Ok, here I have gone ahead and made all of my

00:03:52.609 --> 00:03:59.609
beads and bead caps into bead dangles just
with simple loops. No need for wrapped loops

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.780
here. And now, it is time to attach them to
the bracelet.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:10.780
We are going to use 6 mm jump rings. While
I was wrapping my beads, I just took the time

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:17.949
to kind of sort these into groups with the
largest, so that each group of three would

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:24.009
have a bigger one and a smaller one.
There are 21 links on this 10 mm chain, so

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:31.009
I have made 21 piles of three beads. I will
put three on each. Let me show you how we

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:36.040
do that.
I am going to grab a jump ring with a pair

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:43.040
of chain nose pliers, and hold it on one side.
Use another pair of chain nose pliers to twist

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:51.710
it open on the other side. I am going to start
down this end. I am going to slide the jump

00:04:51.900 --> 00:05:01.060
ring through one of the large links of chain.
Just so it is not crowded, I am going to reposition

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:05.970
my chain nose pliers, so I am grabbing
it with the side, just so there is a little

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:12.970
bit more room to put my dangles on. I am going
to put on one group of three dangles. This

00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:22.640
And this is where the bent chain nose come in handy
because you can get into tight spaces.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:30.190
Now, I am just going to make sure that
jump ring is very securely closed. And then,

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:37.130
I am going to work my way down this chain
adding a group of three bead dangles to each

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:44.130
of these large links. Occasionally perhaps,
catching one of these smaller chains in the

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:51.260
jump ring, just to kind of hold it all together.
So there! I have attached all my bead dangles

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:58.680
in clusters of three with jump rings. What
I kind of ended up doing, was alternating.

00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:07.290
One jump ring would grab the silver chain
on one link. And then, the next jump ring

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:13.950
would grab this black chain. I just kind of
kept going that way.

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:18.630
What you end up with is this very full, it's actually quite heavy, bracelet. And it really

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:28.120
is just a fun kind of party bracelet. This
will be great to do with all crystals. Or

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:35.050
it will be wonderful with just a monochromatic
scheme. You could do it with all pearls of

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.510
one color.
It is actually a very simple project to put

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:43.450
together. It is just time-consuming because
of the number of dangles. But it ends up having

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:47.670
a rather fun, weighty feel.
Here is another look at the bracelet that

00:06:47.670 --> 00:06:53.639
we made today. I hope that you like this project,
and you will give it a try. If you like this
