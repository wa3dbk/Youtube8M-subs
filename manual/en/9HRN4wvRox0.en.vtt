00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.480
Today I will be making lauki chana ki dal.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:17.740
It's bottle gourd with gram lentil.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.280
This dish has both vegetables and lentil

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:26.260
so it makes it a very wholesome meal.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.680
This recipe will serve 3-4.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.100
For this recipe we need:

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:34.380
1 medium size bottle gourd

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.860
which in hindi known by several names as doodhi, lauki or ghiya.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:47.220
I have already washed, peeled and cubed in about half inch pieces.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.720
1/2 cup of gram (chana ki dal).

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.680
I have washed and soaked for an hour.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.480
As you see it has became about little more than double in volume.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.120
2 tablespoons of oil

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.060
1/2 teaspoon of cumin seeds

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.180
Pinch of asafoetida

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.820
2 whole red chillies

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.920
About 1 tablespoon of shredded ginger.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.320
1/4 teaspoon of turmeric

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:21.340
1/4 teaspoon of red chilli powder

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.760
1 teaspoon of salt or adjust to your taste.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.580
1/4 teaspoon of garam masala

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.200
1 teaspoon of mango powder (amchoor)

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:39.140
And about 2 tablespoons of shredded cilantro (hara dhaniya).

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.260
And 1 cup of water.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.120
Heat is on, medium high.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:48.200
First I am going to add the oil

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.680
and wait for a minute till oil is hot

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.960
before adding the cumin seeds.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.200
So oil is hot.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.220
So first we are going to add the cumin seeds

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.680
and you see as we are putting, it's cracking up.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:05.740
Asafoetida

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.460
Red chilli

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.740
Just stir and then add ginger.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.300
Red pepper

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:17.980
Turmeric

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:26.580
And gram.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:27.520
Stir it.

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:33.580
Now we can add the salt.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.160
And bottle gourd as you see after I have sliced it became about 4 cups.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:51.240
I am making this in pressure cooker just because it saves some time.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.700
You can do make this in any pot you want.

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.480
It will take after it comes to boil about half an hour.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.480
And in pressure cooker it will take 10 about minutes.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.760
Going to add the water.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.780
Water also you can adjust,

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:14.060
sometimes bottle gourd has more water in than other time.

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.820
So please do adjust the water as it's needed.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.760
I am going to close this pressure cooker.

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:30.020
And wait till it starts steaming.

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.480
And after that it should be about 10 minutes.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.100
This has started steaming

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:40.620
so I am going to lower the heat to medium.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:46.660
And it should take about 8-10 minutes it depends on your pressure cooker.

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:49.480
This has been about 8 minutes.

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:51.360
So I will close the heat.

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:57.520
Don't open the pressure cooker till all the steam has escaped.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.900
If you want to open it in rush, you can take this under the cold water.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.860
Open just the tap water and it will make it faster.

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.100
I can open the pressure cooker now

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.100
as you see there is no steam coming.

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:19.500
I have taken the pressure cooker in the sink

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:23.980
and opened the cold water for about 30 seconds.

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:33.420
It's looking good.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.280
Time to add the garam masala.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.900
Amchoor (mango powder)

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:43.860
And cilantro.

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:47.840
Mix it well.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.500
And lauki chana ki dal is ready to serve.

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.040
Lauki chana ki dal or ghiya chana ki dal

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:07.860
anyway you say, it looks great and taste very good.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:10.740
It's a very healthy dish.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:15.440
You can serve this with roti or with the plain rice.

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.500
Thank you.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:18.780
And I will see you again with a new recipe.
