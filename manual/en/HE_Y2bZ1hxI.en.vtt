Everyone, everyone~~. OK!

ToQ No. 1, ToQ No. 1

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.020
I saw it

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.990
It's here~

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.340
It's a present from the Red Ranger

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.880
ToQger cake

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.980
ToQger cake, I'm going to open it

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:33.000
Yes! I can't see it at all.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.990
OK I can see it after opening it. There're candles inside too!

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.720
Oh oh!

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.780
Red Ranger is inside!

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.600
Oh! A track!

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.980
ToQger No. 1 is inside too

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.990
The items included are, a cake and a card, two candles and some chocolate thing.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.260
Alright! What's this~

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.920
I'm going to draw a picture using chocolate

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.500
Oh! I failed...

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:28.480
ToQger~

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.470
Red Ranger ToQger~

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.980
It's sweet

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.240
The candles are standing

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:50.780
ToQGer No. 1, ToQGer No. 2, ToQGer No. 3, ToQGer No. 4, ToQGer No. 5

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.940
Alright! It's standing. Oops, I broke it~

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.740
But it's OK

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.880
I'm shooting the ToQ Blaster ! Bang!

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.260
I'm standing it up

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.000
The candle is upside down

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.020
ToQGer No. 5, ToQGer No. 5

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.260
I put it in an empty spot

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.180
I'll place it next to ToQGer No. 5

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.120
It's a tight fit

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.400
Happy Birthday to You~, Happy Birthday to You~

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.480

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.340
Wow!!

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:29.480
Hmm? Coffee flavor

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.060
It comes with wheels

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.920
Let's eat

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.220
There's strawberry jam inside

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.360
It's sweet

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:09.670
Delicious!

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
That was yummy

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:28.440
This is a ticket for a call with ToQGer

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.650
The back looks like this, and the front looks like this

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:40.400
This is Hero dial, Hero dial

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.740
Today is your birthday?

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:45.260
Happy 5th birthday!

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.060
Make me a promise

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:49.500
Practice until you can do it

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:51.500
Work hard at everything

00:04:53.780 --> 00:04:55.060
Hmm?

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.280
No way!

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.000

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.760

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.990
Isn't it energy?

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.790
