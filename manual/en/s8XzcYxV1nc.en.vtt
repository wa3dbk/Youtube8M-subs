My name is Dan Llywelyn Hall. I’m a BP artist
from 2009, my entry was Harry Patch. I’ve

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.860
entered the BP Portrait Award probably about
6 times prior to being eventually selected

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:25.160
for it. And on each occasion, the thought
that I’d get in and didn’t… And then

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.449
eventually this portrait of Harry Patch was
selected. It was quite topical at the time

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.789
obviously Harry Patch, the last Tommy, had
actually died during the run of the exhibition

00:00:36.789 --> 00:00:40.819
and so it made it even more poignant, and
the fact that the image was used as posters

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:45.550
across the Underground. I did feel quite proud
that I’d sort of caught a moment in history

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:51.829
which I was, felt privileged to be involved
in.

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:58.210
Painting Harry Patch was probably the most
moving of situations I’d been in, I think,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.819
probably in my life I think, because I’d
built myself up to it for quite a long time.

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:07.340
I’d initially thought about painting about
8 years before I did it. And I wanted to be

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.840
the person to paint the last person to set
eyes on the trenches, and experience the First

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.979
World War. And, for me, seeing him the first
time, he was at the time living in a retirement

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:23.439
home and he was, he’d dressed for the occasion
so he’d been wearing medals and things.

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.790
I came into this area and he was sitting on
his own. And he just looked like a man who

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.100
was entirely on his own, he’d had none of
his contemporaries around him. The man was

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.799
111 when I saw him. So, it really overwhelmed
me. And I think that helped for the portrait.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.961
Now, had I worked from reference from photographs
and not met him, it wouldn’t have worked.

00:01:40.961 --> 00:01:44.850
That, for me, consolidated the idea of having
to be with the subject, and work with the

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.700
subject and experience it. And then, that
helped me then make the work in the volume

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.999
that I did.

00:01:53.999 --> 00:01:59.619
Successful portraits are ones which are ultimately
a good painting, a good picture. And that

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:05.170
we don’t feel as though we have engage with
the sitter. They become the portraits in their

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.729
own right. Much like a writer would start
a story, from a particular experience and

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.411
then go off on a tangent, something that’s
well away from an actual truth about a subject,

00:02:13.411 --> 00:02:16.510
but that’s underpinned by the subject being
a sitter.
