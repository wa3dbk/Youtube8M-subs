00:00:12.523 --> 00:00:14.523
There are many aquatic invasive species, 

00:00:14.726 --> 00:00:16.726
including certain species of Asian carps, 

00:00:16.775 --> 00:00:18.775
that pose a threat to the Great Lakes 

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:20.584
and other important aquatic resources.

00:00:21.487 --> 00:00:23.487
Silver and bighead carps were originally

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:25.429
imported into the southern United States 

00:00:25.282 --> 00:00:27.282
for use in aquaculture ponds in the 1970s.

00:00:28.991 --> 00:00:30.991
Through flooding they escaped and entered 

00:00:30.824 --> 00:00:32.824
the Mississippi River and its tributaries,

00:00:33.224 --> 00:00:35.224
where they have been invading northward ever since.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.730
In the wild silver and bighead carps 

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:40.429
have caused immense damage to

00:00:39.743 --> 00:00:41.743
the country’s aquatic habitats,

00:00:41.872 --> 00:00:43.872
out-competing desirable fishes for food.  

00:00:44.715 --> 00:00:46.715
That competition results in 

00:00:46.164 --> 00:00:48.164
fewer and slower growing native fishes.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.800
Silver carp, sometimes referred to as 

00:00:50.766 --> 00:00:52.766
“jumping” carp, are also a health

00:00:52.812 --> 00:00:54.812
hazard to recreational boaters.

00:00:54.913 --> 00:00:56.913
When agitated by the sounds 

00:00:56.197 --> 00:00:58.197
of boat motors, silver carp can 

00:00:58.153 --> 00:01:00.153
jump out of the water 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.300
becoming potentially dangerous projectiles. 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.879
Both species are listed as “injurious”

00:01:04.338 --> 00:01:06.338
under the Lacey Act, 

00:01:05.601 --> 00:01:07.601
which means their importation 

00:01:07.231 --> 00:01:09.231
and interstate transport may 

00:01:09.144 --> 00:01:11.144
be regulated by the

00:01:10.087 --> 00:01:12.087
Secretary of the Interior.  

00:01:12.301 --> 00:01:14.301
In the instance of bighead

00:01:13.541 --> 00:01:15.541
and silver carps, it is 

00:01:14.691 --> 00:01:16.691
illegal to transport live fish

00:01:16.274 --> 00:01:18.274
across state lines.

00:01:18.603 --> 00:01:20.603
There are several species

00:01:20.117 --> 00:01:22.117
of carps in the United States.

00:01:22.178 --> 00:01:24.178
In this video you will 

00:01:23.378 --> 00:01:25.378
learn the distinguishing characteristics 

00:01:25.041 --> 00:01:27.041
of silver and bighead carps, 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.950
as well as grass carp

00:01:28.209 --> 00:01:30.209
and common carp 

00:01:29.102 --> 00:01:31.102
as points of comparison.  

00:01:36.507 --> 00:01:38.507
Silver and bighead carps 

00:01:37.824 --> 00:01:39.824
have certain physical characteristics 

00:01:39.507 --> 00:01:41.510
that make them easy to identify.  

00:01:42.122 --> 00:01:44.120
A distinguishing characteristic of 

00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:45.660
both of species that sets 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.830
them apart from any 

00:01:45.688 --> 00:01:47.690
North American fish is the

00:01:47.195 --> 00:01:49.200
position of their eyes.

00:01:49.141 --> 00:01:51.140
In both silver and bighead 

00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:52.780
the eye is set low on the face,

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.650
below the midline of the fish.

00:01:56.226 --> 00:01:58.230
Another characteristic to look 

00:01:57.321 --> 00:01:59.320
for is the relative size 

00:01:58.357 --> 00:02:00.360
of the head.

00:02:00.126 --> 00:02:02.130
As the name implies, 

00:02:01.212 --> 00:02:03.210
the bighead carp has

00:02:02.123 --> 00:02:04.120
a large head when compared 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.500
to the rest of its body. 

00:02:05.454 --> 00:02:07.450
Though not as large as bighead, 

00:02:07.056 --> 00:02:09.060
silver carp also have a 

00:02:08.388 --> 00:02:10.390
relatively large head.

00:02:10.765 --> 00:02:12.760
The mouths on bighead 

00:02:11.726 --> 00:02:13.730
and silver carps appear 

00:02:13.023 --> 00:02:15.020
to be downward slanting,

00:02:15.373 --> 00:02:17.370
or in a frown.  

00:02:16.201 --> 00:02:18.200
Silver carps have normal sized mouths,

00:02:18.437 --> 00:02:20.440
but bighead carps have very large gapes.

00:02:22.457 --> 00:02:24.460
The location of a mid-ventral keel 

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:26.710
is also a good way to distinguish 

00:02:26.145 --> 00:02:28.140
a bighead from a silver.

00:02:29.126 --> 00:02:31.130
On the bottom of the fish

00:02:30.005 --> 00:02:32.000
you will see a line or ridge, 

00:02:31.627 --> 00:02:33.630
known as a keel.

00:02:33.412 --> 00:02:35.410
On silver carp the keel 

00:02:34.717 --> 00:02:36.720
extends from the anal fin 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.240
to the throat of the fish.

00:02:38.732 --> 00:02:40.730
In bighead, the keel 

00:02:40.267 --> 00:02:42.270
only runs from the anal fin

00:02:41.587 --> 00:02:43.590
to the pelvic fins.  

00:02:43.335 --> 00:02:45.340
It does not extend 

00:02:44.575 --> 00:02:46.580
onto the belly of the fish.

00:02:47.543 --> 00:02:49.540
The coloring of silver 

00:02:48.518 --> 00:02:50.520
and bighead carps is also 

00:02:49.927 --> 00:02:51.930
different from each other.  

00:02:51.257 --> 00:02:53.260
Bighead carps have splotches

00:02:52.761 --> 00:02:54.760
of darker pigments that 

00:02:53.997 --> 00:02:56.000
can be found on their head 

00:02:55.508 --> 00:02:57.510
and scattered across their body, 

00:02:57.454 --> 00:02:59.450
often being concentrated

00:02:58.993 --> 00:03:00.990
across their backs.

00:03:02.802 --> 00:03:04.800
Silver carp may have dark pigment, 

00:03:03.851 --> 00:03:05.850
but it will not be seen as patches

00:03:04.603 --> 00:03:06.600
or blotches on its skin.  

00:03:06.346 --> 00:03:08.350
Another distinguishing characteristic 

00:03:08.135 --> 00:03:10.140
in bighead carps is the 

00:03:09.165 --> 00:03:11.160
shape of their gill rakers.  

00:03:11.469 --> 00:03:13.470
If you look underneath

00:03:12.518 --> 00:03:14.520
the gill cover of a bighead carp 

00:03:13.457 --> 00:03:15.460
you will see gill arches 

00:03:15.508 --> 00:03:17.510
with the red gills attached.  

00:03:18.027 --> 00:03:20.030
Next to the red gills

00:03:19.022 --> 00:03:21.020
you will see the gill rakers,

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.650
which are long fine strands 

00:03:22.236 --> 00:03:24.240
that have been described as comb-like. 

00:03:25.747 --> 00:03:27.750
On the silver carp the 

00:03:27.124 --> 00:03:29.120
gill rakers are very different.   

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.310
They are fused together 

00:03:29.205 --> 00:03:31.200
and form a sponge-like matrix. 

00:03:33.486 --> 00:03:35.490
Grass carp is another regulated 

00:03:34.745 --> 00:03:36.740
species of Asian carp,

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.300
but they look fairly different 

00:03:37.448 --> 00:03:39.450
from silver and bighead carps.

00:03:39.737 --> 00:03:41.740
Grass carps are long bodied 

00:03:41.162 --> 00:03:43.160
with narrow blunt heads 

00:03:42.203 --> 00:03:44.200
and petite mouths.  

00:03:44.018 --> 00:03:46.020
Grass carps are typically gold 

00:03:45.757 --> 00:03:47.760
tinted in color with large scales.

00:03:48.226 --> 00:03:50.230
The scales on grass carps 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:51.370
have dark tinting around 

00:03:50.611 --> 00:03:52.610
their edges that give the fishes 

00:03:52.355 --> 00:03:54.360
a cross-hatched pattern across their skin.  

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.640
Grass carps also have 

00:03:57.098 --> 00:03:59.100
fat tails that only narrow slightly 

00:03:58.413 --> 00:04:00.410
as you move toward the rear fin.  

00:04:01.422 --> 00:04:03.420
Common carps look nothing 

00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:04.490
like bighead or silver carps.  

00:04:04.446 --> 00:04:06.450
They are much darker in color 

00:04:05.786 --> 00:04:07.790
and have much larger scales. 

00:04:07.965 --> 00:04:09.960
They may remind you of grass carps, 

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:11.810
but an easy way to know 

00:04:10.883 --> 00:04:12.880
that you are looking at a 

00:04:11.816 --> 00:04:13.820
common carp is the 

00:04:12.917 --> 00:04:14.920
presence of barbels, or whiskers, 

00:04:15.151 --> 00:04:17.150
on its upper lip.  

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:18.710
Thank you for taking the time 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.900
to learn how to properly 

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:20.950
identify silver and bighead carps.  

00:04:21.097 --> 00:04:23.100
With your help we can 

00:04:22.667 --> 00:04:24.670
prevent the spread of these species.
