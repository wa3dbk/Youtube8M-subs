00:00:04.696 --> 00:00:08.096
(toys hitting against the floor)

00:00:08.096 --> 00:00:10.846
(dramatic music)

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.120
- Good morning everyone.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:18.167
Well, for you, it's morning.

00:00:18.167 --> 00:00:19.112
Maybe it's morning.

00:00:19.112 --> 00:00:20.281
Could be anytime.

00:00:20.281 --> 00:00:21.447
I don't know when you watch these.

00:00:21.447 --> 00:00:22.382
Usually post them in the afternoon.

00:00:22.382 --> 00:00:24.195
I don't know why I say good morning.

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:25.785
Especially right now 'cause it's evening

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:29.122
because we've had a
crazy, crazy couple days

00:00:29.122 --> 00:00:32.584
and I forgot to vlog,
or was too busy to vlog,

00:00:32.584 --> 00:00:35.093
or it was too chaotic to vlog.

00:00:35.093 --> 00:00:36.969
I haven't been vlogging very well.

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:37.950
Sorry about that,

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.480
but I thought I'd bring you up to speed

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.404
with what's been going on with us.

00:00:41.404 --> 00:00:43.945
Brooklyn, our cousin Brooklyn.

00:00:43.945 --> 00:00:45.687
What's up, Brooklyn?

00:00:45.687 --> 00:00:46.742
Say hi.

00:00:46.742 --> 00:00:47.904
- Hi.

00:00:47.904 --> 00:00:49.465
- Then we also have our cousin, Leila.

00:00:49.465 --> 00:00:51.587
Actually, they're my nieces,
but they're my kids' cousins,

00:00:51.587 --> 00:00:53.036
so I keep calling them cousins.

00:00:53.036 --> 00:00:56.161
They're here and we're
having like a slumber party

00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:57.627
and they've been here for a couple days.

00:00:57.627 --> 00:00:59.691
They decided to come over
and spend some time with us.

00:00:59.691 --> 00:01:02.156
Now we're gonna have a good
old fashioned hot dog buffet,

00:01:02.156 --> 00:01:03.929
where it's all you can eat hot dogs.

00:01:03.929 --> 00:01:05.218
- [Chris] What do you
think of that, Parker?

00:01:05.218 --> 00:01:06.115
- Bah.

00:01:06.115 --> 00:01:07.199
- [Chris] Hot dogs? - Hot dogs.

00:01:07.199 --> 00:01:08.158
- [Chris] Hot dogs.

00:01:08.158 --> 00:01:09.382
- (squealing)

00:01:09.382 --> 00:01:10.817
Hot dogs!

00:01:10.817 --> 00:01:13.543
- [Chris] Yeah, oh, look at this.

00:01:13.543 --> 00:01:16.126
(upbeat music)

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.420
- [Children] Hot dogs! - Hot
dog, hot dog, hot dee dee.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:42.753
- Hot dog, hot dog, hot dog.

00:01:45.218 --> 00:01:47.077
- [Chris] Jessica's got a veggie dog,

00:01:47.077 --> 00:01:50.260
which looks way more appealing
than a regular hot dog.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.269
Excited about your veggie dog?

00:01:52.269 --> 00:01:53.311
No?

00:01:53.311 --> 00:01:55.464
- You mean my veggie-Italian sausage?

00:01:55.464 --> 00:01:58.156
- [Chris] Oh, dun, dun, duh.

00:01:58.156 --> 00:01:59.406
- Oh, duh, duh.

00:02:00.725 --> 00:02:01.709
- We're in my garage

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:03.414
and I wanted to show you
guys a little project

00:02:03.414 --> 00:02:04.538
that I've been working on.

00:02:04.538 --> 00:02:08.587
This is a sketch for a
backdrop for a summer camp

00:02:08.587 --> 00:02:10.961
that my kids are gonna
be involved in this year

00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:14.262
and they asked me to paint it,

00:02:14.262 --> 00:02:16.679
so I have this giant backdrop

00:02:17.574 --> 00:02:20.620
taking up over my entire garage.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:21.453
It's fun.

00:02:21.453 --> 00:02:22.893
It's been fun to sit here and paint

00:02:22.893 --> 00:02:25.600
and Jess is helping me out with it.

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.597
It's a nice calming thing to
do when the kids go to sleep.

00:02:28.597 --> 00:02:31.597
(upbeat jazz music)

00:02:57.994 --> 00:03:02.865
So, Jacob was wondering how
I did this particular drawing

00:03:02.865 --> 00:03:06.492
because it started off this
size and went to this size.

00:03:06.492 --> 00:03:07.869
I don't know if you guys care about this,

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:09.223
but a lot of you seemed interested

00:03:09.223 --> 00:03:12.552
in how I did Joshua's shoe
for What's Up Internet?

00:03:12.552 --> 00:03:14.752
I showed that in an earlier vlog

00:03:14.752 --> 00:03:16.724
and I talked about using a grid.

00:03:16.724 --> 00:03:18.625
That works really great for odd shapes,

00:03:18.625 --> 00:03:20.108
but as you can see with this,

00:03:20.108 --> 00:03:22.256
it's a lot of circles and rectangles.

00:03:22.256 --> 00:03:23.401
Right, Jacob?

00:03:23.401 --> 00:03:24.257
- Yeah.

00:03:24.257 --> 00:03:26.560
- Yeah, so for that type of thing,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.381
it's a little bit better
to just draw it to scale

00:03:29.381 --> 00:03:31.798
and use this tool right here.

00:03:32.715 --> 00:03:35.318
This is called an architect scale.

00:03:35.318 --> 00:03:37.489
- [Chris] On this, you
can see, on one side

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.656
it has regular inches and
then each of the other sides

00:03:42.862 --> 00:03:44.914
has a different scale.

00:03:44.914 --> 00:03:48.678
For example, this is
the one I used for this.

00:03:48.678 --> 00:03:50.845
It is three fourths scaled.

00:03:50.845 --> 00:03:55.519
That means every three quarters
of an inch counts as a foot.

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:56.704
On this thing,

00:03:56.704 --> 00:04:00.727
every three quarters of
an inch equals one foot.

00:04:00.727 --> 00:04:04.150
All I had to do is measure each thing out

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.516
and figure out, okay, this
here is going to be ...

00:04:07.516 --> 00:04:10.980
The center of this circle
is going to be two feet,

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:13.461
five inches from the edge.

00:04:13.461 --> 00:04:14.739
I just measured everything

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.130
and drew all the lines with pencil.

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.115
Now, Jacob wanted to know
how I made these circles.

00:04:20.115 --> 00:04:21.588
- [Jacob] With this?

00:04:21.588 --> 00:04:24.746
- I used this very basic tool.

00:04:24.746 --> 00:04:27.927
This is a compass that I made
out of a piece of cardboard.

00:04:27.927 --> 00:04:30.647
Basically, there's a screw here

00:04:30.647 --> 00:04:32.839
and then I measured out
the radius of a circle.

00:04:32.839 --> 00:04:33.672
That's from the center

00:04:33.672 --> 00:04:35.702
to the edge of the circle is the radius.

00:04:35.702 --> 00:04:39.303
I measured that out and
I put a pencil in there.

00:04:39.303 --> 00:04:42.737
Then all I had to do is hold
this here and turn here,

00:04:42.737 --> 00:04:45.757
(pencil writing noise)

00:04:45.757 --> 00:04:49.424
and if I go all the way
around, it makes ...

00:04:51.583 --> 00:04:55.097
a circle that's exactly
the size that I need.

00:04:55.097 --> 00:04:56.850
If you need to make a
big circle on something,

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:59.337
all you need is a piece
of wood or cardboard

00:04:59.337 --> 00:05:01.260
that you can punch a hole through

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.709
and put a screw on one side, or a nail,

00:05:03.709 --> 00:05:05.590
that will stay in one spot.

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.569
Use a pencil and go around

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:10.375
and that'll make a very
nice circle for you.

00:05:10.375 --> 00:05:14.568
Hi, let's talk about
what we learned today.

00:05:14.568 --> 00:05:18.735
First we learned that my kids'
cousins are not my cousins.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.770
We learned that it's
not just a tofu hot dog,

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.270
it's a veggie Italian sausage.

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:29.500
Finally, we learned that my videos

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:34.189
are at least as entertaining
as watching paint dry.

00:05:34.189 --> 00:05:36.735
(guitar playing)

00:05:36.735 --> 00:05:38.693
Thanks for watching, everybody.

00:05:38.693 --> 00:05:39.526
- [Jessica] Jacob, come inside.

00:05:39.526 --> 00:05:40.757
(guitar playing)

00:05:40.757 --> 00:05:42.251
(laughing)

00:05:42.251 --> 00:05:45.157
- Obviously, there's
gonna be a dance party.

00:05:45.157 --> 00:05:48.240
(upbeat dance music)
