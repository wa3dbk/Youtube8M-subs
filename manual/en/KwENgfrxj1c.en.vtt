00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.320
Update version 1.2, an interview with Marriland
himself, and more coming up right now on the

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.120
Pokemon Update, brought to you this time by
Origin.

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.640
Hey guys it's Jess, and we've had some new
developments in the months since Pokemon X

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.010
and Y's release.

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.970
Most recently, Nintendo released Pokemon X
and Y update version 1.2, which is available

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.250
now from the Nintendo 3DS eShop.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.640
This update fixes several things, such as:

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:37.480
An occasional bug causing Pokemon to not learn
new moves after evolving through Wonder Trade,

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.710
an occasional bug where certain captions for
Trainer PR videos were not unlocked in Lumiose

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.679
City, and an internet communication issue.

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:50.059
Note that you must install update 1.2 before
you can continue performing any online interactivity

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.359
such as trading or battling.

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.569
This is partially due to a program developed
last year that when used, allowed players

00:00:56.569 --> 00:01:01.170
to read all of their opponents' team data
during battle, effectively letting them cheat

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.289
and anticipate all their opponents' moves.

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:06.640
So if you guys were cheating - ha, can't do
that anymore!

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:12.450
The update requires 236 blocks of storage
and is mandatory, so hurry up and download

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.450
it!

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.280
And speaking of downloading games and updates
before you can play, be sure to check out

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.490
our sponsor Origin - remember they have a
fantastic pre-load system that lets you download

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.570
games ahead of time before they're even released
- that way the moment a game ships you're

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:27.160
ready to play!

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.980
Ever wanted to know more about Marriland himself,
the man behind the myth?

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:35.170
Well, not exactly a myth, I guess I just wanted
to score some alliteration points.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.490
Anyway, Marriland participated in an interview
on Sephazon's YouTube channel, talking all

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:42.220
about the history and future of the website,
YouTube channel, and Marriland himself!

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:48.360
The interview clocks in at nearly two hours
long....but you need something to do while

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.640
installing update 1.2, right?

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.270
Click the link below to watch the interview
video!

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.880
Finally, yours truly recently got to participate
in a special video review of Pokemon X and

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:03.640
Y, but with a twist - a very spicy twist,
and that's all I'll say for now!

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.080
But keep that in mind in the coming weeks,
and we'll be sure to let you know once the

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.090
finished product is live and viewable!

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.660
That's about all the Pokemon news we have
for you this time, but as always be sure to

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.019
subscribe to Curse and Marriland if you haven't
already, and give this video a thumbs up for

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:18.019
Pokemon!

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.549
Thanks for watching, enjoy the game.
