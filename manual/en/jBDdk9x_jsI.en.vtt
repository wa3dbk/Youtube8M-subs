Hi I am Jenna and this is the Gnu B Pro

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:10.140
this is absolutely my favorite board I've been on all day

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.180
 I actually got a chance to ride it for about a half a day a week ago

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.230
 just excellent in all conditions this is a great board for your intermediate

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:22.290
 to advanced level girl who really just wants to take on anything on the mountain

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.330
 you could take this thing in the park you can fly on this board

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:30.370
 it has excellent edge hold super stable super comfortable

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.420
 the reason being it's got a lot of technology behind it

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:38.480
 first of all this has what Gnu calls Magnatraction so you've got

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.520
 this wavy sidewall here and what it does it give you it acts like a

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.580
 serrated knife it gives you multiple contact points with the snow so

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.620
 you can take a little bit softer of a board generally this is

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.670
 a midflex I'd say mid to a little bit stiff and you just get that

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.740
 extra edge hold without just a super super stiff board

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:02.790
 you could also de-tune the edges if you're more of a park rider

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.860
 you're still going to be able to ride everywhere else on the mountain because you have those multiple contact

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.900
 points you also have this is called C2

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.950
 so what you have is camber directly underneath

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.040
 the bindings and then rocker in the tip and the tail as well as in the middle of the board

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.120
 so you get the benefits of rocker which is great

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.180
 that you can get this into some deeper snow you really just sit back on

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.250
 it and it makes it super easy to float on but the camber again gives you that

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.330
 edge hold takes away that swirly feeling of rocker

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.440
 really makes it just a solid ride what I really liked about this

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:43.500
board is that you can get it into variable conditions and you always feel secure

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.580
 you feel comfortable on it because you know you have that edge hold with the Magnatraction

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.650
and the camber under the bindings so excellent board for your intermediate

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.720
 to advanced level girl who really wants a board that can help her

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.820
 take it to the next level it will absolutely make you a better rider

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.570
 and a super fun board all around
