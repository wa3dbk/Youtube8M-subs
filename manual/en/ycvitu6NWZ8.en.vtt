What's up? This is DJ Colione on behalf of
expertvillage.com and in this clip I am going

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:13.170
to show you the basics of vinyl juggling.
So first thing you have to do is mark your

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:20.360
record. You want to take a dot or a sticker
or something, you can take a pen and just

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.660
mark it but you want to mark a specific place
on both records. You notice that I have two

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:34.520
of the same records here Snoop Dogg from Da
Chuuuch to Da Palace. Basically the easiest

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:47.700
thing is to mark the very first beat so find
out where that is and you will see that right

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:52.750
where that beat starts is right where my little
marker is. So I do that on both records. So

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.440
on both records exactly where that first beat
is, is right where my little marker is. We

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:06.740
know that we have a visual cue of where our
beats are on the record. Essentially what

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:13.500
juggling is, is you are just looping the music
back and forth using the two records to manipulate

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.780
it. The easiest form is just the basic loop.
So you can do it in either a count of four

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.729
beats or eight beats but you are basically
going to play say this record for four beats,

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.630
1, 2, 3, 4; you are going to cut to this side
and you are going to play 1, 2, 3,4; you are

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:33.759
going to rewind this side as this side is
playing so you can cue it up on the one and

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:40.080
play 1, 1, 2, 3, 4; 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4
and you will get an endless loop of your music.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:48.189
That is juggling in the simplest form so let's
get a sample of that. So we have our 1 there,

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:55.630
our 1 there and what we are going to do is
play this for 4 beats so we are going to go

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:13.409
1, 2, 3, 4, rewind this one, rewind this one
and you basically loop it back and forth.

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:20.450
It could go on forever but essentially that
is all you are doing. You are going to take

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.430
a little section of one song and you are going
to loop it over and over to create a new beat.

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:30.609
That is basically the premise of juggling
and from that you can totally do a hundred

00:02:30.609 --> 00:02:35.409
different things. You can do more complex
juggles and pitch changes and what not, which

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:36.639
we will be looking at another clip.
