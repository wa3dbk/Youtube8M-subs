Hello Friends, Welcome to Veenaskitchen.com.
Wish you all a merry Christmas and a happy

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:14.170
new year. Today I will be showing you how
to make dates and choco pudding. This crusty

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.949
date and choco pudding is very simple to make
so let's see how it is made.

00:00:20.949 --> 00:00:27.949
Add 2 cups of pitted dates in a pan and to
it add about 3/4th cup of water and allow

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:35.800
it to cook over a medium flame till the dates
become soft.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:48.039
About 10 minutes later, you will notice that the dates have become soft and the water has evaporated. At this stage add

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:55.379
one and a quarter cup of sugar and one table
spoon of vanilla essence.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:07.720
Blend all of this in a food processor to make a fine puree.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:19.400
Heat another pan add quarter cup of cooking
cream and simmer it on a very slow flame till

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:28.500
it becomes warm. Switch of the flame and then
mix the chopped chocolate in the warm cream

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:36.390
till the chocolate melts completely

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:46.990
Pour the chocolate mixture into the date puree and mix it nicely.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:59.900
In another bowl, sift half a cup of cocao
powder and quarter cup of all purpose flour.

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:20.800
Add the flour and coco powder to the date
and chocolate mixture and fold it gently.

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:28.430
In another bowl take 6 egg white and beat
it till it forms stiff peaks.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:37.500

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:49.260
Fold in the egg white into the date mixture
and mix gently so that the volume is retained.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:12.800
Grease the baking dish in butter and pour
the batter into it and bake it at 190 degree

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:19.920
Celsius in a preheated oven till the outside
forms a nice crust. It should take about 35

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.999
to 40 minutes depending on the shape and size
of your baking dish.

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:32.999
Allow it to cool in the dish itself and then
remove onto a platter or plate. Take some

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:43.859
icing sugar and dust it on the pudding.

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:50.859
