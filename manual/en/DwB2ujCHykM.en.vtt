00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.520
So, when you're speaking with your tailor
or maybe the rental place, where you're going

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.599
to be renting your suit, or someone that is
designing and creating something special for

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:16.299
you, one thing to consider is different neck
shapes that you have, which are going to kind

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:24.710
of alter the shoulder style that your garment
is going to be tailored in; your jacket specifically.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.589
So, if you have a short neck, you're going
to need a square shoulder, if you have a long

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.030
neck, you're going to need more of a sloped
shoulder and then if you just have a regular

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.651
neck, you're going to need just a regular
shoulder. So, there's different ways to measure

00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:47.570
that, or there's different ways to kind of
point out or notice and take into account,

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:55.769
meaning what type of shoulder you want based
on your neck, whatever neck you've been given.

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:03.620
And, all the necks are fine. O.k. so, most
of it is going to be from here to here, same

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.660
as we measured our shoulder seam; but I'll
show it to you on paper, so you can kind of

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:12.620
tell the difference and decide what you are
because maybe you might be living with a long

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.980
neck and you just don't realize that you have
a long neck. Alright, so let's look at the

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:25.170
pages. Alright, so here we are, shoulder style
normal and that is, it's just like we measured

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:35.250
before that point that goes from here to here.
And, then what we have is a sloping shoulder

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:45.380
and as you can see I've showed you here, this
is for like a longer neck, right. If you have

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:52.920
a longer neck, kind of bring your shoulders
down like that and that is from here to there.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.860
Within that, longer, longer meaning, meaning
this way, you know. And, then finally if you

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:08.579
have like a short neck and you're stockier,
it would be squarer from here to here. Same

00:02:08.579 --> 00:02:17.060
thing. So, maybe these diagrams will help
you figure out whether you are a square neck,

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:26.200
or excuse me, a square shoulder, a sloping
shoulder or normal regular.
