Today's episode is sponsored by Public!

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.700
Hello there unboxers! This is Sakis Karpas from GameOver.gr in another episode of Unboxholics.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:52.800
Today we will take a look at the Joel Edition of The Last of Us, Sony's latest star in PlayStation 3's exclusives.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:00.000
In our hands we hold the Greek Edition of The Last of Us which means that Greek subtitles are included in the game.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:09.800
As usual, some information related to the package contents and the game can be found on the back side.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.800
The Last of Us Joel edition shipped in a canvas wrap packaging which adds a nice touch to the whole presentation.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.800
The canvas wrap packaging has an artwork of Joel featured on its front side as well as a PlayStation Logo.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:32.600
The first item we find inside is the Screen Print Effect Poster which again features Joel.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:50.040
Another item that we found inside is a Naughty Dog sticker.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:02:00.700
Moreover, Naughty Dog included an American Dreams Mini Comic from Dark Horse Comics.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.750
Finally, as you can see we found the main part of this collector's edition which contains the game disc. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.700
Some more amazing artworks of the game are featured inside the game's retail box. 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:25.350
On the right side of the retail box, we find the Blu-ray disc of the Last of Us and a manual that features an online pass on its last page.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:39.800
The Last of Us Joel Edition also includes a small page which has voucher codes for a Survival DLC Pack, sight and sounds pack and LittleBigPlanet sackboy skins.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:46.520
A very interesting item of this edition is the Joel skin for your Dualshock Wireless Controller.

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:55.360
Last but not least, the Joel Edition includes an artbook as most of the collector's editions we have unboxed in our YouTube channel.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:14.100
The mini artbook of the Joel Edition features several screenshots of the artwork during the development process.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:26.640
The Last of Us Joel Edition is available now at the price of €79.99. The Last of Us also has an Ellie Collector's edition which is exactly the same. The only change is related to the cover of the package and the Dualshock skin.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:33.800
The Last of Us Joel Edition may not be a must have collector's edition but is certainly deserves €10 more.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:40.100
If you're a PlayStation 3 owner, you should definitely check out the two collector's edition of The Last of Us.
