00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:11.420
Even the best cooks have been known to claim
they can't brew a good cup of coffee, but

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.920
with a few simple guidelines, it's easy to
make great tasting coffee.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.980
And making homemade coffee is a real savings
compared to buying it in a coffee shop.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.760
Regardless of the brewing method you choose,
all we start with freshly ground coffee beans.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.880
Coffee beans are roasted to various degrees
of darkness.

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.380
Choose darker beans for a stronger flavor,
lighter beans for mild tasting coffee, and

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.059
create your own blend for something in between.

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.120
Coffee grinders are inexpensive and well worthy
investment.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:48.899
Since coffee beans lose their freshness quickly,
it's best to grind them fresh each time you

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.960
make coffee.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:59.420
The most popular methods for brewing coffee
are the automatic drip, the manual drip, and

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:00.769
the French press.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:07.590
Follow the manufacturer's guidelines for your
coffee maker for either a fine or coarse grind.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.760
For an automatic-drip coffee maker, measure
the ground coffee into the filter, pour the

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.890
water into the reservoir.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.150
Each 6-ounce cup of coffee, use three quarters
of a cup of fresh cold water and one to two

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.940
tablespoons of ground coffee depending on
how strong you like your brew.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.890
And press the button to start the brewing
process.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.960
To use a manual drip coffee maker, measure
the coffee into the filter, bring fresh water

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:46.620
to a full boil in a kettle, turn off the heat
and allow it to rest for a moment, and then

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:49.750
slowly pour the water over the coffee.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:56.390
Water just under boiling at 195 to 205 degrees
releases coffee's compounds at their flavorful

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.450
best.

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.630
Be careful not to overfill the filter basket.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.890
Give it a stir to make sure all the grounds
are submerged.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:11.250
You may need to wait for some of the coffee
to drip into the carafe before continuing

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.060
to pour the hot water.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:25.459
To make coffee using a French press coffee
maker, measure the coffee into the carafe.

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:38.049
Pour the tempered hot water into the carafe.

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:44.270
Place the lid on the carafe and allow the
liquid to brew for four minutes.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.019
Press the plunger to the bottom of the carafe
to trap the grounds.

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:54.840
Whether you like your coffee black or with
milk, cream, or sugar, it all starts with

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.900
the right brew.
