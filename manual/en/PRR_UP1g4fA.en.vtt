Why do we walk if we could drive a car?
There's so much you can do in dance and there's

00:00:13.449 --> 00:00:19.110
something that I love to do, something that
I feel is a calling in my life. My name is

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:24.880
Slim Boogie. I'm from a crew called Machine
Gone Funk and I'm from Los Angeles, CA. I

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.949
got in Machine Gone Funk about 4 years ago.
Before I was like a house dancer, I was really

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.019
into house. I was too nervous and shy in school
to try popping and I met a friend of mine

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:41.199
named Johnny 5 who got me into it like, "Hey,
you should do it. You got long arms and

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.510
you're tall." I was like, "Okay maybe I'll try it," and I 
fell in love with it and I've been doin' it ever since.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.689
One of my friends saw me popping at a battle
and he was like, "I really like your style

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:58.409
a lot," so he asked me to join the crew. I
learned from a guy named Tae Bo. He's an animation

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:03.080
dancer. He pretty much taught me everything
I know. It's kind of like an umbrella style,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.530
because animation is like a name and underneath
it, it has waving and tutting and dimestop

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:13.440
and speed change and all these things come
together to make animation. And because I

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.120
was a house dancer and the stuff that I learned
along the way I kind of tried to add everything

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:24.740
I learned into popping, because I want to be 
unique. I'm a really strong believer in God and I

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.450
feel like he opened up this door for me to
be able to do this, because I'm really passionate

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:36.350
about it. And if there's something you really
want to do in life, if it's popping or locking

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.270
or breaking, whatever it is just go through
with it and there's really no limits to what

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.520
you can do.
