(bright ukulele music)

00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:07.074
- Hi friends!
- Hey everyone!

00:00:07.074 --> 00:00:08.572
- Thank you for tuning
in to Cook with April

00:00:08.572 --> 00:00:10.777
on Tasty Tuesday, today I'm going

00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:13.669
to show you how to make
fried chicken tenders.

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:15.869
They're so delicious, I hope you enjoy,

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.170
I'm also going to show you how to make

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.086
a homemade dipping sauce with it.

00:00:19.086 --> 00:00:20.709
Let's go ahead and heat up six cups

00:00:20.709 --> 00:00:22.648
of vegetable oil on medium heat.

00:00:22.648 --> 00:00:23.787
It takes a while to heat up,

00:00:23.787 --> 00:00:25.307
so let's work on our dip.

00:00:25.307 --> 00:00:27.081
Two tablespoons of horseradish,

00:00:27.771 --> 00:00:29.293
one cup of mayo,

00:00:31.386 --> 00:00:33.112
one cup of sour cream,

00:00:33.906 --> 00:00:35.816
two teaspoons of worcestershire sauce,

00:00:38.596 --> 00:00:40.553
two tablespoons of mustard,

00:00:44.204 --> 00:00:45.805
and mix those ingredients together,

00:00:45.805 --> 00:00:47.049
and refrigerate.

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:48.511
Now let's work on the breading.

00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:51.551
One cup of flour, one cup of bread crumbs,

00:00:51.551 --> 00:00:53.409
half a teaspoon of cayenne,

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:56.074
it adds a little kick
and some spice in there.

00:00:56.731 --> 00:00:58.274
And then we're just going to go ahead

00:00:58.274 --> 00:00:59.662
and beat two eggs.

00:01:03.474 --> 00:01:06.109
Grab your chicken tenders,
dip it into the egg,

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:08.542
and then coat it with
your bread crumb mixture.

00:01:18.532 --> 00:01:20.632
As you can see I kind of spilled some egg

00:01:20.632 --> 00:01:21.759
so I'm going to go ahead and use

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.536
my Clorox disinfecting wipes to clean

00:01:23.536 --> 00:01:25.190
up my work station.

00:01:27.551 --> 00:01:30.872
And now you're ready to
cook your chicken tenders.

00:01:30.872 --> 00:01:33.049
Go ahead and fry them up in that hot oil.

00:01:33.937 --> 00:01:35.480
And it only takes about six minutes

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.138
to fry these babies up.

00:01:37.138 --> 00:01:39.537
Transfer the chicken once it's been cooked

00:01:39.537 --> 00:01:41.955
into a plate and I like using a plate with

00:01:41.955 --> 00:01:43.764
paper towels to absorb the oil.

00:01:45.696 --> 00:01:47.284
And after my stovetop cooled down,

00:01:47.284 --> 00:01:48.979
I used my Clorox disinfecting wipes

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.196
again to cut the grease that spilled.

00:01:51.196 --> 00:01:52.971
Alrighty, it's good to go,

00:01:52.971 --> 00:01:54.643
you ready try it?
- Yes please!

00:01:54.643 --> 00:01:56.145
I love how you plated it with carrots,

00:01:56.145 --> 00:01:58.382
that's so artful.
- Thank you kindly!

00:01:58.382 --> 00:02:00.013
- Mm-hmm, here we go.

00:02:05.475 --> 00:02:06.579
Oh my gosh, that's so good.

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.129
It's so tender.

00:02:08.458 --> 00:02:10.595
The breading is not too heavy,

00:02:10.595 --> 00:02:12.858
it doesn't taste too fried.
- Oh good!

00:02:12.858 --> 00:02:14.634
- And it's got a little bit of a kick

00:02:14.634 --> 00:02:16.801
in the dipping sauce, is it,
- Mm!

00:02:16.801 --> 00:02:18.280
- I think it's like the horseradish maybe?

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.660
- Yes it is.
- I love it, it's so good!

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.353
This is like, way better
than fried chicken tenders

00:02:23.353 --> 00:02:26.146
that you would get at a
restaurant or something.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:27.892
- I think you like it
because I made it for you

00:02:27.892 --> 00:02:29.731
- Maybe.
- and you pretty much

00:02:29.731 --> 00:02:31.568
like everything I make for you.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.212
- This is delicious, wow.
- Thank you so much!

00:02:34.212 --> 00:02:34.954
(Justin laughs)

00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:35.941

00:02:35.941 --> 00:02:37.909

00:02:38.078 --> 00:02:42.396

00:03:01.167 --> 00:03:02.201
Bye!
- Bye!

00:03:03.161 --> 00:03:04.510
Hey everyone!

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.599
to Cook with April on Tasty Tuesday!

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:08.789
Today, I'm going to show you how to make

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:11.617
a turkey sausage spinach lasagna,

00:03:11.617 --> 00:03:13.984
which Justin actually found on an issue

00:03:13.984 --> 00:03:15.976
of Cooking Life Magazine.
- Yum!
