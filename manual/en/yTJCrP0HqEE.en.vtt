Contact lenses are now available for children at a very young age.

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:09.650
 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.280
I'm a pediatric eye doctor and there are
special cases where young children

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.529
even infants may benefit from contact
lenses

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.699
Meet Adriana. At 6 years old, we discovered
she was very far-sighted in only one eye

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:27.820
in only 1i a movie deal and I am proud
to wear contact lens

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.579
from Dallas fixes on am NOT sometimes
high prescription

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.790
or large difference between the eyes
makes glasses uncomfortable

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:40.329
cited for Adriana to wear contact lens
was

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:43.840
because she was performing on television

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.809
and 8 I gave her little bit of more fun
things

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:52.530
it's beneficial to offer children choice
either you wear your glasses

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.890
or if you're responsible you get to
where your contacts at first

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.129
for a moment and put in her contacts but
after a little practice

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.580
she could do it all by herself for

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:10.420
as a parent you're the one responsible
to make sure that they take out their

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:11.909
contacts every night

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.960
and throw them away as your doctor
recommends to ensure your children

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.869
develop good habits for taking care that
context establish a routine

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.130
when they get ready in the morning they
should brush their teeth

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.170
put in their contacts after dinner
parents should ask

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.450
did you brush your teeth and take out
your contacts often

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.740
it's that simple it's important that you
have a pair of glasses to give your eyes

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:37.110
a rest from contacts

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.750
every day usually start with daily
disposables

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:44.110
dailies are seasoned easy because you
throw them away

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.759
every day you get a week a free samples
to practice with

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.210
if they're doing well you can buy a box
for each other like to see if they're

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.140
ready yet

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:57.970
if you're ready to wear contacts more
often you think that contacts

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.940
that you throw away every month for

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:06.600
sup two reminders to help you remember
to throw away your contacts as your

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.690
