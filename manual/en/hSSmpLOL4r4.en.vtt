00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.340
In just a moment, for MotoTok.pl and especially for you,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.330
we begin the test of the Ford Focus ST

00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:29.299
It's an extraordinary hot hatch,

00:00:29.267 --> 00:00:36.067
whose power is akin to that of my current rally car,

00:00:35.885 --> 00:00:38.885
a CitroÃ«n DS3 R3

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.460
I wonder how this car performs,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.920
so we'll put it to a thorough test in a moment

00:01:48.757 --> 00:01:49.960
-- How is it going?

00:01:49.314 --> 00:01:50.510
-- Great!

00:01:50.124 --> 00:01:55.120
I'ts a bit hard driving it sideways, because

00:01:54.423 --> 00:02:02.920
you make the rear step out, and when you press the throttle,

00:02:02.094 --> 00:02:08.090
this thing has so much power,

00:02:07.238 --> 00:02:13.240
the front instantaneously washes wide

00:02:39.241 --> 00:02:43.740
The 2-litre, turbocharged petrol engine,

00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:48.200
which develops 250 HP of power and 360 Nm of torque

00:02:47.087 --> 00:02:54.090
gives plenty of driving pleasure

00:02:52.957 --> 00:02:59.960
especially when we want to overtake in heavy traffic.

00:02:58.662 --> 00:03:06.660
Thanks to turbocharging, we don't need to change gears constantly

00:03:05.441 --> 00:03:14.440
It has lots of torque, it accelerates briskly even below 2000 rpm.

00:03:15.197 --> 00:03:23.200
The performance of this car is great,

00:03:21.728 --> 00:03:29.730
but at a cost of rather high fuel consumption.

00:03:28.342 --> 00:03:35.340
During our test drive, we were nowhere near

00:03:33.716 --> 00:03:40.720
the official figure of city driving cycle.

00:03:40.082 --> 00:03:46.080
A very accurately working gearbox;

00:03:45.152 --> 00:03:54.150
The gear knob is very precise and smooth,

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:56.650
but it has one minor flaw:

00:03:54.987 --> 00:04:02.990
this part of the central console is quite close to the knob,

00:04:01.495 --> 00:04:07.000
and when I first drove this car,

00:04:05.215 --> 00:04:14.720
I accidentaly hit the console a few times with my hand.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:19.010
The suspension is definitely sport-oriented,

00:04:17.782 --> 00:04:24.780
so the car is rather hard-riding,

00:04:23.404 --> 00:04:29.400
it doesn't lean in bends even when driven very fast.

00:04:27.526 --> 00:04:33.530
The steering is a revelation; very, very precise,

00:04:32.829 --> 00:04:39.830
with one caveat: the turning circle is very large,

00:04:38.112 --> 00:04:44.110
and when driving in the city,

00:04:42.006 --> 00:04:49.010
sometimes we will feel its cumbersomeness,

00:04:47.297 --> 00:04:54.300
the fact the turning circle, even when parking in front of one's house,

00:04:52.175 --> 00:04:57.180
it will give us pain.

00:04:54.895 --> 00:05:01.900
The Focus ST has great brakes,

00:05:00.352 --> 00:05:07.350
even in the mood for spirited driving,

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:11.990
the brakes won't heat up and give up quickly.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:14.860
It has six gears,

00:05:15.489 --> 00:05:24.490
very well-judged ratios, in the 6th gear, we we'll 
 be able to reach the to speed

00:05:22.517 --> 00:05:28.520
which is almost 250 kph.

00:05:29.792 --> 00:05:37.790
The acceleration from standstill to 100 kph takes a mere 6.5 seconds.

00:05:51.739 --> 00:05:55.740
My adventure with Focus ST has finished;

00:05:53.107 --> 00:06:02.110
it has a fantastic engine, truly sport-grade brakes, suspension and gearbox.

00:05:59.473 --> 00:06:05.470
Maybe it's not a proper rally car, but it would be great for

00:06:02.945 --> 00:06:08.940
reconnaissance before a rally.

00:06:07.079 --> 00:06:13.080
A really, really nice car.

00:06:10.947 --> 00:06:15.950
