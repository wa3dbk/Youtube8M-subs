00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.390
What's up guy and girl players of World of
Warcraft. This is Ryutarou aka Tarou is this

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:10.060
video I'll be showing you an overview of the
Quick Auctions 3 addon! For more FREE profession

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:14.480
updates, leveling, and gold guides, check
out my website at tarouwowguides.com

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.520
Quick Auctions 3 is a very powerful addon
and you'll honestly feel like you're cheating

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.700
the first time you use it.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.900
First you'll need to download the Quick Auctions
3 addon from curse.com or wherever you choose

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.949
to get your addons from.

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:30.920
After you have downloaded it, extract the
folder and put it in your WoW addons folder.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:36.660
Next log-in to the game and type /qa config
to load the settings panel.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.320
In the General settings you set a default
for all item groups but I instead like to

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.969
leave these the way they are and only make
sure Smart Canceling is checked.

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:51.030
Next click Profiles in the upper left. Here
you can add custom profiles that can be used

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.780
by any character on your account. I'll call
mine Tarou WoW Guides and click Okay or hit

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:56.780
'Enter'.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:01.020
After that, click Whitelist. If you're like
me, you may list on several characters or

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.330
have friends that you don't wish to undercut.
If you enter their name here, the listing

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.350
system won't undercut them.

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:13.490
Next click Auto Mailer. This basically sets
up a player to Auto-mail to. I'll use my alt.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.070
I then can click on his name and add any items
by typing in their name or selecting a group

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.090
of items or item below that I want to auto-mail
to him. For instance if I add Frost Lotus

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.030
here, it will automtically mail him Frost
Lotus anytime I access a mailbox by checking

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.720
the auto-mail box at the top of the mail panel.
I personally don't usually use this feature

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.049
but it can come in handy if a player likes
to mail certain alts certain items all the

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:40.049
time.

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:45.670
Lastly click Item Groups. In this panel every
player should pay close attention so you don't

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:51.040
accidently list items for strange amounts.
Each of these settings will override the general

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.720
settings. I prefer to use these instead of
the general settings so it pretains more to

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.009
each specific item group better.

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:03.020
For flasks, I like to override stack settings
to ignore any stack more than one. This will

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.369
make sure I don't undercut a stack of twenty
or five or whatever. I then set the override

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:13.999
post time to 12 hours. Next, I'll set my post
cap at fifty but each player should think

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:18.569
of what post cap will work best for them on
their server. If you have to undercut the

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.819
competition a lot you'll want a lower post
cap like five to ten. I'll then set the per

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.569
auction to one so it lists in stacks of one
and move down to price and set my undercut

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:36.411
by one silver. Next, I'll put my bid percent
at 95 and set the threshold to 10g. Think

00:02:36.411 --> 00:02:41.669
of the threshold as the cheapest you are willing
to sell the item for. I still make a decent

00:02:41.669 --> 00:02:46.489
profit at 10g so I'm comfortable with that.
I don't worry too much about the next two

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.459
settings but I do add in a fallback price.
This is the price my item will list at if

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:57.599
there are none up. Players can be a little
greedy here but you don't want to be too ridiculous

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.379
or noone will buy the item and just think
you're a prick of sorts. I'll put mine at

00:03:02.379 --> 00:03:05.599
24g 99s which is overpriced but fair.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:11.599
After that you'll need to add items. You can
add items supposedly three ways; by simply

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:17.319
clicking on it like I do here with this Eternal
Water, typing a portion of or the whole name,

00:03:17.319 --> 00:03:21.719
or by clicking in the box and shift plus left
clicking an item. The last one doesn't work

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:23.780
for me so I stick to the first two.

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.209
So now that you got all your groups setup
it's time to make some items to list. Before

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:33.650
that though you want to see which items are
selling for the most. With Quick Auctions

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.639
3 this is pretty easy. Open Auction House
pane and click the red Summary button at the

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:43.819
top. Next, click a group you want data on
and click the 'Get Data' button. It takes

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:48.199
a minute or two and will load all the current
pricing for items in that category.

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:52.959
Once it's loaded, you can look next to item
and it will show how many you and others have

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:59.049
posted and the price. For gems it will show
next to the base gem in parenthesis how many

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:04.290
you can make of it. Next, hold shift and double
click any item you want to make. Then, type

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.519
the number of how many you want and press
enter. If you have your profession window

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:14.150
open it will pop up tell you what materials
you need. Finally simply click the item to

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:15.579
make it and you're done.

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.900
After you've made all your items listing is
very easy. Open up the Auction House pane

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.330
and click the Auctions tab at the bottom.
Then, click the red 'Post' button at the top

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.240
and watch QA3 go to work as it auto breaks
stacks into singles and posts everything for

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.240
you.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.400
So you got all your items on the Auction House
now but what if someone undercuts them. It's

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.389
pretty simple to deal with. Click the 'Cancel'
button at the top and after it scans everything

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:44.080
click start and it will auto-cancel out all
the items that were undercut.

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:52.979
There are a few more features of Quick Auctions
3 that I won't go over but feel free to mess

00:04:52.979 --> 00:04:54.210
with them if you like.

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.199
So that's it for this Quick Auctions 3 guide
and I hope you enjoyed it.

Thanks for watching^^

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.260
"Now go ... tell me any funny Auction House
story in the comment section below." For me

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:12.830
it's the time I accidently listed a stack
of gems for the price of one. Glad noone noticed.
