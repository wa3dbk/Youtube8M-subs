IBERIA: EIGHT WOMEN WHO COUNT

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.280
Hi, I'm Mayte Alvarez and I work in Iberia's management control office.
 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.280
Let me introduce my boss...

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:25.520
Hi, I'm Elena Vahillo. I'm the director of management control and the finance department, and I have three kids. 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:39.520
Hello, I'm Loreto Costa Gramer and I'm an Iberia pilot; I fly the Airbus A340, which flies the airline's long-haul routes.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:48.520
We fly mostly to North, Central, and South America, as well as South Africa. Come on in, here's my office.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:56.280
Hi there, I'm industrial mechanical engineer Natalia Martinez, and I work in Iberia's engine workshop in the Madrid suburb of La Muñoza.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.280
Hello, I'm Ana, an aeronautics maintenance technician, and I also work in Iberia's La Muñoza hangars.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.280
Hi, Veronica Sanchez here, I work in luggage check-in and passenger boarding at Barajas Airport Terminal 4. 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:14.280
Hello, this is Pilar Vilades in baggage management at Barajas Terminal 4. 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:25.280
Hi, I'm Maria de La Cruz, chief purser on what we call short- and medium-haul flights, within Spain and Europe.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:33.520
My job onboard is to oversee the cabin crew and inflight service. 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:42.520
The reason I chose this job is that I've always loved to travel. It's been my dream since I was a little girl. 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:55.280
Right, thanks so much, see you! 
I chose this profession when I finished my degree in German and realized teaching wasn't for me.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:04.280
So I opted for a large, solid company like Iberia, where I can use my language skills working as a production secretary:

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.280
English, and sometimes German. 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.280
Well, I was actually studying to be a lawyer, but I found I liked numbers more so I stayed in the area of finance.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:28.280
Actually, the truth is that I found my calling a little later in life. I'd always liked the world of aviation, but I came to it professionally only after jobs in other areas. 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:38.280
I took a great flight and engine course and went up in a glider. 
That was the moment I knew that this is what I wanted to do in life: to fly.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:47.280
I've been working in support operations for three years, and my job is to be the liaison between the airline engine repair shop and the airline.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:54.280
What I most like about my job is that it's always changing and never boring, you get to touch every part of the plane.

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.280
The truth is that I have lots of airplane time but not so much flying time.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.280
Thanks, have a great flight!

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.280
I started this to put myself through school, and ended up staying on 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.520
because it lets me practice my languages and meet different people every day.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:21.520
I started this job 20 years ago to bolster my family's income, and 20 years ago there were very few of us women. 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.280
Actually what I most like about my job is that every day is different

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:33.280
and there's always an area to delve into, some ratio to keep an eye on
 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:40.280
and it gives me the chance to keep learning more about a business as exciting as air transport.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:50.520
I like my work because I've been with Elena Vahillo for eight years, we know and trust each other, 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:57.520
and I'm not limited to standard secretarial tasks like answering phones and scheduling, it's much more expansive

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:02.520
I get involved in things like budgeting and securities presentations, and that's why I like it.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:15.280
After 12 and a half years to this day what I most enjoy is dealing with clients and not having a set schedule. 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.280
I can start working at 5 in the morning, or 10 at night, or 6 p.m., whenever

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:20.280
and that's something I really love.  

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:29.280
Well, after 20 years with the company, what still gives me the most satisfaction

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:38.280
is the moment when the airplane lifts off from the ground – I still get a thrill each and every time. 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.520
What I love the most about my job is the fact that we get to use the latest cutting-edge technology

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:47.520
I can handle the entire engine repair process, 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.280
from the moment it's unbolted from the airplane to the moment it's reinstalled

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.280
and that every day I'm able to go pick my three kids up at school.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.280
It's that simple, right? Thanks

00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:03.280
We all get a tiny bit nervous when we travel, and this leads some passengers to tell us their stories. 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.280
With this reader we control all the bags at all times, some 40,000 of them every day. 

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:14.280
Well, I have two children, an eight-year-old girl and a four-year-old boy 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:23.280
And as almost all women do these days, sometimes we have trouble balancing our work and personal lives.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:32.280
But, you know, with the help of your family, your spouse, it can be done, and more power to all the women who do it.  
 

00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:38.280
Clearly in order to be in a position of responsibility you have to work very hard, and long hours;

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:43.520
perhaps the toughest thing is to balance work and home life.

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:50.520
That's why I have someone helping out at home, without whom I'd never be able to have a remotely organized household

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:54.280
and of course there's also the support of my husband and other family members.

00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.280
It's not that important how long it takes you to find the profession that fits you, 
 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:06.280
the important thing is to find what you truly enjoy and to dedicate yourself heart and soul.

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:15.520
The truth is that I feel very proud of having opened the way for other women in a field that was once all-male. 

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:25.520
The message I have for women is that just as I fought for my dream and achieved it, 
they should fight for their own dreams. 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:33.280
It's not easy balancing work and family but if you can manage it, it's extremely satisfying.

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.280
Sometimes you just fall into a job and it ends up becoming your profession. 

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.280
I always loved planes, and since I'm into electronics, I became a maintenance technician

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:53.280
even though this is still considered mostly a man's job, as women we now fit right in.
