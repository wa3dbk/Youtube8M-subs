00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:25.340
Regular viewers might recall that I’m one
of the few, the shamed, the Pirates fans.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.440
Sid Bream knifed me in the heart back when
I was 8, and there’s been no joy in Mudville

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:30.599
ever since.

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.940
(Well, except for football and hockey seasons,
but you get my point.)

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:35.940
And if A.J.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.230
Burnett taking a bunt to the eye - THE EYE
- is any indication, we’re about to get

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.080
a 20th year of futility.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:47.850
After an existence like this, one would be
completely justified in giving up on baseball

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.230
altogether.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.280
After all, last time my team was actually
competitive, y’know what game we were playing?

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:54.440
R.B.I.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.600
Baseball.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.180
And the Pirates weren’t even in that one!

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.340
So how am I supposed to even be excited for
a game in 2008?

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.680
Oh.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.710
It’s Power Pro.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.640
That explains it.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.750
As you may remember from a certain other fantastic
review on this channel, Konami’s Powerful

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:20.030
Pro Baseball series has been running constantly
since 1994, on pretty much any console you

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:26.390
care to name, chronicling the NPB league with
squat, big-headed representations of Japanese

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.560
baseball’s biggest names.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.310
That said, this is Konami we’re dealing
with.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:34.940
The company that pioneered the music-gaming
genre with Dance Dance Revolution, Beatmania,

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:39.729
Guitar Freaks, Drummania, Keyboard Mania,
Pop’n Music... and then mishandled the western

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:43.219
releases of these games until it was far too
late.

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:44.310
Rock Revolution.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:45.690
‘Nuff said.

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.409
So, 13 years after the series’ inception,
the western world would finally be introduced

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:54.710
to Powerpro... and the year after that, a
second go-round, as sports games are wont

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:55.710
to do.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.191
Hey, they got twice as much mileage out of
this as they got out of Beatmania, and I didn’t

00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:07.119
even have to buy an absurd DJ controller!

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:11.310
As far as the game itself goes... my, that’s
a load of options.

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.450
You can wheel and deal, enjoy a full season,
play a quick exhibition game, take some swings

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:21.140
in batting practice, or create your own Pawapuro-kun
and go through the “MLB Life” mode, taking

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.580
your career through the minors and... trying
to get the girl.

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.540
Of course, what’s a baseball game without
some relationship drama, and a childhood friend,

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.720
and a couple other moe cliches?

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.569
You’ll have to develop your character well,
though, buying attributes with points gained

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.540
by training, making sure to avoid injury,
and occasionally being fed habanero-laced

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.930
steak.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.599
Such is the plight of the minor-leaguer.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.790
Eventually you’ll make it onto the roster
and be able to throw a few pitches in-game,

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.130
though you won’t be playing full games at
this point.

00:02:51.130 --> 00:03:02.189
Still, you’ve gotta suck it up, get out
on the field, and impress some scouts!

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.930
Perhaps it’s because of my personal history
with the sport, but I just can’t take baseball

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:07.519
seriously anymore.

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:13.049
Two decades of heartbreak - and eyebreak,
apparently - will do that to a guy.

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.120
The solution, to me at least, isn’t hyper-realistic
representations of the sport, but exactly

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.120
the opposite.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.840
Let me play an absurdist representation of
the game, as I’ve been living an absurdist

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.970
representation of fandom since 1992.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.740
And despite all the super-deformed caracatures
of MLB stars...

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:34.879
PNC Park looks awesome, doesn’t it?

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.360
That’s the important part.

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:48.340
Or so I keep telling myself.
