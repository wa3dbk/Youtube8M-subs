00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.460
John Degenkolb presents his bike

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:08.340
The choice of bike is made up to the two - or effectively three - frames that we have.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.192
That is the "Pfeife", the classic one.

00:00:10.192 --> 00:00:11.720
We have the TCR

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:12.980
and the "Propell".

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.340
The question that is being raised is what qualities do you need.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:20.520
If you want to get the maximum out of your bike while sprinting

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.200
the aerodynamic - because of the speed - plays an important role and the rigidity.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:30.300
This bike is a little bit better in terms of rigidity than the TCR.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:33.700
You don't have a lot of comfort.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:34.340
This needs to be added.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.880
You actually feel everything - every bump over which you drive.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.880
But as the saying goes "Beauty knows no pain"

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.600
or who want to be successful, knows no pain.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.820
Gear transmission ratio is 53 : 39 in the front

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.560
and 28 : 11 in the back.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.620
Also if the mechanics sometimes don't like it so much if you drive 53 : 28

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.180
but it is possible.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.520
And you can also drive in the much-loved cross chaining mode.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.280
I am driving the satellite shift up here - actually full option.

00:01:09.477 --> 00:01:11.477
I am driving the sprint shift in the curves

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.040
and of course you can use the gearshift just the usual way.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.887
Just the normal way - as you are used to.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.460
This is the nice thing about the Di2 - when it is tuned perfectly -

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.360
that is not always the case -

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.200
that you do not need to be afraid.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.600
It functions very precisely.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.740
And even if you fall or if someone drives into your back tire

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and the gearshift is a bit bent and twisted

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.580
then you have the chance with Di2 to adjust it while driving.

00:01:38.053 --> 00:01:40.053
That of course saves time and power during a race.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.160
This inner confidence just belongs to sports

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:46.710
and especially to cycling.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:51.840
And it gives me personally a sense of security if you have something very individual on your bike.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.120
And if necessary you can just briefly knock on the wood

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.800
and thank God for having passed the last spill without falling.
