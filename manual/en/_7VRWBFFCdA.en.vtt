Hey this is Joe Wiles with the Rock 'N Roll
Conservatory for HowToPlayAnySong.com. Today

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.660
we're going to be taking a look at scales
and now this comes at us by request from Jimmy

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.290
out of Las Vegas Nevada. Hello Jimmy thanks
for the suggestion.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.820
The cool thing about minor pentatonic scales
is that they're super easy and they're super

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.129
versatile. It's hard to hit any note in your
minor pentatonic and sound bad as long as

00:00:32.129 --> 00:00:35.350
you hit the right notes, which are really
easy, you're going to sound like an awesome

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:42.350
rockstar so lets take a look at it.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.400
Now the cool thing about minor pentatonic
scales in general is that if you're in the

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:56.900
same key as the music that is being played,
no matter what note you hit of this scale

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.080
that I'm about to show you, it's going to
sound cool and bluesy.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.890
Or if your guitar is distorted, it's going
to sound pretty classic rock, like AC/DC style.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.900
It's every note on the scale sounds awesome
next to a standard chord change in the same

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:12.570
key. So let's get started.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.820
Form 1

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.830
This is the first form of the E minor pentatonic
scale. It starts out with the E note. Hit

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.670
the open E string with a down strum. Then
we're going to take our ring finger and put

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.620
it on the 3rd fret of the same string and
hit it with an up strum.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.530
We're going to continue that down, up, down,
up, down up stuff the whole time. It's called

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:34.920
alternate picking, and you need to practice
it, so make sure that you do.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.540
Moving on, the next one we'll hit is the open
A string with a down strum. And then we're

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.250
going to put our middle finger on the 2nd
fret of the A string.

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:49.750
Then we're going to hit the next high string,
which is a D string, and then put our middle

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.200
finger on the 2nd fret.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:59.200
The next highest string is the G, open. Then
the 2nd fret of that same string with an up

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:06.659
strum. Down strum to the B string here, open,
no frets. Then to the 3rd fret. Then open

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:18.390
high E string here, and then the 3rd fret.

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:26.019
Just real quick through. Those fret numbers
were again open, three, open, three, excuse

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:34.989
me, two, open, two, open, two, open, three,
open, three. You'll notice I used my ring

00:02:40.939 --> 00:02:43.989
finger for all the notes that occur on the
3rd fret.

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.090
I use my middle finger for all the notes that
occur on the 2nd fret. Keep that consistent.

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:51.299
Don't use your index finger just because it's
easier because I know for some of you beginning

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:54.689
guitar players, it's totally easier to use
your index finger.

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:58.269
But you need to practice using more than just
your index finger, okay? So try to make use

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:02.019
of more than, more fingers, especially your
pinky when we get to that point.

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.749
We're going to go through this scale a little
bit slowly so you can get a feel for warming

00:03:04.749 --> 00:03:10.480
up to it. This is what it sounds like.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.480
We're going to do it in reverse. And when
we do it in reverse, we're still going to

00:03:26.279 --> 00:03:33.279
start with the down strum.

00:03:44.889 --> 00:03:49.279
And now we're going to go through that scale
forward from the lowest note to the highest

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:53.519
note, and backwards, highest note to the lowest
note, a couple of times slowly so you can

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:54.799
practice along.

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:59.230
So make sure you have the scale memorized
using the right fingers and the right picking

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:06.230
before you start this next little bit, okay?
Well, here we go. One, two, three, four. One

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:42.970
more time.
