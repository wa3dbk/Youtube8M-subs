Hello.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:08.580
Gino Fort, back to teach you how to dime stop.

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:13.820
Dime stop is a cool technique I would like
us to use, for popping especially, because

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.130
not only is it a great visual to the eye but
it's great to use period.

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.630
Dime stop composes of ticking in isolated
movements.

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:22.630
You can use almost anything with dime stopping.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.500
You can even include slow mo when you dime
stop.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.870
You can either bounce off the beat or you
can bounce your body off the beat or you can

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.300
tick it slightly and stop.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.320
That's where the stop comes in.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.320
Dime stop.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.800
So when you do it, hit, hit, hit, hit, hit,
bounce.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.950
Hit, stop.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.011
You could use almost anything with it.

00:00:43.011 --> 00:00:45.140
You could use elbows and go low.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.920
Pop, pop.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.790
Here is a simple dime stopping routine that
you can do by yourself.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:01:00.060
Go one, two, three, four, move your head slowly
to the left, four and move your whole body

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.500
to the left towards your arm.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.129
So one, two, three, four, five.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:09.549
That's going to be your routine but it has
to be quick.

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:11.369
It has to be very quick.

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.090
Let's do it.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.950
Five, six, slowly, seven, eight.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.810
One, two, three, four, five.

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.100
Let's try it again.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.729
Five, six, seven and eight.

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.509
One, two, three, four, five.

00:01:27.509 --> 00:02:07.590
So let's try it with some music.
