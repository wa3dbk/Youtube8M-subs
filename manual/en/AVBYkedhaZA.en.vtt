Steve: Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.649
Today we are going to show how to change the
dual outlet water valve on your refrigerator.

00:00:05.649 --> 00:00:09.870
It’s a pretty easy job; only need a few
tools.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:16.219
Quarter inch nut driver, five sixteenth’s
nut driver, utility knife and a half inch

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:17.219
wrench.

00:00:17.219 --> 00:00:19.200
Let me show you how it’s done.

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.050
Before we begin this repair the first thing
we need to do is disconnect the power supply

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.050
to the refrigerator.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.150
Now that we have disconnected the power to
the refrigerator, the next thing we need to

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:33.870
do is turn off the water supply and pull the
refrigerator forward so that you can access

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.490
the back panel, which is where the water valve
is located right in this corner.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.970
Now there are six quarter inch hex head screws
that pull the back panel to the refrigerator

00:00:44.970 --> 00:01:02.460
we need to remove all of those.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:13.179
Remove the back panel by lifting up on it.

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:26.060
Set that aside, next we’ll remove the inlet
water connection half inch wrench, and you

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:33.289
may get a little water on the floor here,
but it wouldn’t be too much.

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:40.289
Loosen the nut off, pull the tubing out of
the valve.

00:01:40.289 --> 00:02:03.169
Now we’ll take our five sixteenth’s nut
driver remove the mounting screw, lift the

00:02:03.169 --> 00:02:09.769
valve out on to where we can disconnect the
wire harness.

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:16.579
These are two different size terminals on
here so you can mix up this harness.

00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:23.120
Then we need to disconnect the two water supplies
on the bottom, simply press on the corner,

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:33.790
pull it on the tubing again you’ll get a
little bit of water.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:40.629
Now before we install the new water valve
we want to trim about half a inch off of each

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:56.890
of these two water lines so with an exact
knife make sure you have a nice square cut,

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:09.599
take the new water valve, keeping in mind
how it’s going to sit into the refrigerator,

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:27.049
to get to proper water line just press it
firmly into the opening till the bottom’s

00:03:27.049 --> 00:04:00.989
out, reconnect the wire harness, reinstall
the five sixteenth hex head screw.

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:27.350
Now remove the protective cover from the water
inlet, press the tube firmly into place, till

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.230
it bottoms out.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:39.350
You can start the brass by hand, make sure
that we don’t cross thread it and we’ll

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.200
tighten it with a half inch ranch.

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:55.470
Now at this point before we put the back on
the refrigerator I want to turn on our water

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:01.880
supply, plug the refrigerator back in and
try dispensing some water just to make sure

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.030
that we have no leaks.

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.660
Once you confirm that there are no leaks we
are ready to put the back cover on, install

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:26.310
the 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:38.630
six quarter inch hex head screws hold the
back panel in place, make sure the water lines

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:39.630
aren’t kinked.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:46.090
Now we are ready to put the refrigerator back
into place and your repair is complete.

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.020
That’s just how easy it is to put a double
outlet water valve in your refrigerator.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.930
Thanks for watching, and good luck with your
repair.
