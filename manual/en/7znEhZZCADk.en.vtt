00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.379
Gain ultra smooth focus and precise tilt
control with the Lensbaby Composer Pro.

00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:14.329
The Composer Pro enhances the features
of the Lensbaby Composer creating

00:00:14.329 --> 00:00:17.259
a lens body that is ultra smooth and
refined - 

00:00:17.259 --> 00:00:20.769
perfect for professional photographers
and videographers.

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:24.579
Composer Pro features a refined metal
ball and socket design and can be

00:00:24.579 --> 00:00:29.460
purchased with either the Sweet 35
or the Double Glass Optic installed.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.010
Both optics have a curved field of focus
delivering selective focus with a tack sharp 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.460
Sweet Spot surrounded by beautiful
blur.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.810
The Double Glass Optic has a focal length
of 50mm with drop-in

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.090
aperture discs and provides minimum
diffusion at all aperture settings.

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.160
The Sweet 35 Optic has a focal
length of 35mm with a

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.500
12 blade aperture mechanism.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.860
This versatile optic features both a
slightly wide angle of view and close focus capabilities.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.760
To take a picture, point the Composer Pro
straight ahead and bring the center of

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.940
the image into focus by turning the
focus ring.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.090
When you're first learning it's easier
to focus on subjects in the center of

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.760
your photograph and to practice on a still
subject in daylight or a well lit room.

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.220
To move the Sweet Spot from the center
of your image loosen the locking ring

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.020
and tilt the Composer in the direction you
want your Sweet Spot to move.

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.030
Then readjust the focus with the focus ring.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.510
Try tilting small amounts until you
get a feel for how much you need to tilt

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.520
the lens to place the Sweet Spot where
you want it.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.780
If you want to ensure the Composer
doesn't move after obtaining a desirable composition,

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.320
tighten the locking ring by rotating
it away from the shutter button.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.630
The size of the Sweet Spot is controlled
by your aperture.

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.770
The larger the aperture opening the smaller
the Sweet Spot.

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:56.350
Compare the same image at f/22

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.430
and at f/4.

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.200
To change apertures with the Double
Glass Optic,

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.409
touch the magnetic tip of the aperture
tool to the aperture disc - lift out the old disk

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:08.009
then drop in a new one.

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.239
To change apertures with the Sweet 35 Optic,

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:14.919
simply rotate the aperture ring until
the desired aperture number aligns with

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.849
the dot on the lens body.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.679
Try starting with an aperture of f/4
or f/5.6 until you have some

00:02:21.679 --> 00:02:23.689
practice moving the Sweet Spot.

00:02:23.689 --> 00:02:27.819
