00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.000
Welcome to the Motor City. The place where the world's love affair with the automobile first began.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.500
And the perfect place for the 21st ITS World Congress.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.000
Why? once again we stand at a tipping point in the evolution of transportation.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
A time when long-imagined technologies are fast becoming reality, 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.700
transforming the way people move around the block, and around the globe.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.500
And Panasonic is delighted to be front and center,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.700
showcasing our state-of-the-art Intelligent Transportation Systems to car manufacturers,

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:44.000
government agencies,and other influential and forward-thinking organizations from around the world.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.500
Our exhibit centers on ‘autonomous driving systems’ and the intelligent deployment of ‘big data’

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.500
all in the service of allowing people to travel more freely,

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.000
more comfortably, and more safely than ever before.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Panasonic will showcase advanced technology that ‘sees’ the road in an entirely new way,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:11.000
utilizing 360 degree cameras and deploying smart sensors that not only allow communication between one car and another, 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000
but between the car and the road as well. 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:20.500
The anticipated result? Nothing less than a game-changing reduction in accidents and their related costs

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:26.000
not only material but personal and an unprecedented new level of safety and peace of mind. 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000
With AUPEO! Personal Radio,

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.600
we're also able to provide a custom blend of entertainment and information in a smart solution 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.000
that takes connectivity for our customers to an entirely new level.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.500
For Panasonic, it's all about the consumer experience and making sure that we find ways to enhance that experience 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:51.000
either through audio enhancements or through safety enhancements inside the vehicle such that it enhances the consumers' lives.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.500
So it seems Panasonic offers a lot of cutting-edge technologies and solutions that might be interested

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:01.500
in what we are doing over there, and in general in Nissan,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.000
so that is why I'm here to see what this technology is, and how we can collaborate.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.500
At Panasonic, we believe the journey is as important as the destination.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.000
Which is why we'll continue to develop technologies and solutions to enhance each and every mile.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000
