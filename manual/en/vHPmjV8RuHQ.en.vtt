00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.790
Hello, for today's exercise we're going we
are going to work on the shoulders.

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:27.369
So I am going to show you a few exercises
using the dumbbells for the shoulders.

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:30.570
The first exercise, what we gonna do is stand
up like this, pick up the weights.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.840
Now as you can see here the weights are very
light, we are using only 15 lbs because we

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:45.160
are doing shoulders raises with our arms straight
to the sides and front.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:53.990
I am going to show you the exercises and just
follow along with me.

00:00:53.990 --> 00:01:07.990
First just stand feet and shoulders like this,
like so, raise your arms up like this and

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:18.020
coming back to the side slowly.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:33.770
Now, you don't have to raise it too high,
just up to your shoulders level.

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:50.850
Now, for the next exercise, you gonna do the
same techniques but you're going to raise

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.299
your arms out in front.

00:01:56.299 --> 00:01:57.299
So let's do it together.

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:33.870
If you want to make the exercise more interesting,
what you want to do is to combine the shoulders

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.030
raises two of them together.

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:48.150
You raise to the sides and then you raise
to the front, what you got to is alternate

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.590
them, like so.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.030
Pick up the weight.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.190
Make sure you maintain good posture, back
straight, feet and shoulder width apart.

00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:06.780
From there you raise to the sides first, slowly
down, and then you raise to front, down.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:12.129
Then to the side.

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:24.239
Make sure you maintain your breathing.

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:41.720
For this exercise you can do 3 set of from
6 to10 receptions is very good, so make sure

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.830
you choose the appropriate weights.

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:49.790
For this exercise the weight gonna be a lot
lighter than other exercises because it is

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:50.370
a lot tougher.
