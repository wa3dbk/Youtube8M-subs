Robert: Okay it's all about the flush. And in this video what I want to teach you is how to create 

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:18.130
a really great flush to the cheek. 

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.050
Keep in mind when you're doing a flush to the cheek, you want the rest to be 

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.679
minimal. You could do a little bit
stronger lip or a little bit stronger eye, never 

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:30.369
both. But I always think it's nice if the cheek remains the focus so I'm going to stay with a 

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:32.279
softer eye and a softer lip. 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.670
And let the cheek takeover. 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:35.380
So I'm here with Ivy, 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:37.150
who's flawless to begin with, 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.770
well no, she is now. 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.190
Anyway, so I'm going to do that. Now the trick in creating a flush is layering 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.290
your products. 

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:48.770
First thing you want to do is you want to layer a créme blush 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.430
then you're going to layer a powder blush on top of that by doing the two it creates 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.890
more of a flush that will stay longer, last longer and create the look you're looking for. 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.510
Now remember it's always créme on créme, powder on powder. There are a few exceptions 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.670
depending on the formula

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.250
but for the most part just that it remains easy for you to remember, we're 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.610
going to do a créme on créme, powder on powder. So 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.520
we want to layer our créme blush on before we powder our foundation. 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:12.950
So we're going to put créme on, 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.240
powder our foundation, 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.939
do the rest of face and then put a 
powder blush right on top of it. So that's what I'm going to do. 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.299
I'm going to take my number sixty four brush because I designed this for créme 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.079
blush because me personally,

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:26.840
I don't like to get my fingers dirty. So by having a
brush that you can use a créme blush 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:28.120
with, it helps

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:29.730
get it where you want it

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:33.210
as well as not get my fingers dirty. So I'm going to take a little bit of my créme blush. Smile for me.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.080
Always when you're doing a créme blush, it's forward back, not back forward. 

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:41.030
When we're doing powder many times it's back forward but 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.450
always with a créme blush it is forward back because we want the biggest 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.620
intensity of our color at the front of the cheeks. So smile again, sorry. 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:51.550
And I'm just going to start to put it on. Now don't worry about going a little too strong 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:53.990
because it's hard to overdue a flushed cheek. 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.090
Plus when we powder, we are going to end up going back 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:59.720
and kind of fading some of this color out. 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.990
So you want it nice and strong, once again 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.440
the layering is what's going to create that
flush that really pretty soft flush 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:13.209
after but still a bright pop of color on
the cheek.

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.489
This has really been in all the magazines, it's a really hot look right now. It's great for 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:21.519
girls that just want to look fresh but not overly made up. 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.539
So as you can see we're putting it on pretty darn strong. 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:30.509
Making sure we get a good pop of color. 

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:33.239
I like to follow that was just a little
bit of a 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:34.829
of my 

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:41.829
sponge just to kind of blend out the edges. 

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:52.029
Then I'm going to take my powder brush and my powder and I'm going to powder. 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:52.989
Then i will go 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.829
ahead and paint the rest the face. 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:02:59.489
Which I'm going to do for you and then I'll come back and talk about finishing off the 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:06.489
flush. 

00:03:13.609 --> 00:03:15.339
Okay so we've powdered her face. 

00:03:15.339 --> 00:03:19.729
And then we finished her eye, and now we're going to go back and we're going to do a little bit of bronzing 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:22.719
to ground that color in the back. 

00:03:22.719 --> 00:03:27.519
So taking our bronzer brush number seventy three, we're just going to go back and we're going to bronze the 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:29.379
face a little bit.

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:31.889
Once again it helps ground

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:38.889
that color.

00:03:57.399 --> 00:04:01.479
We're going to contour the nose a little bit. 

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:05.109
Number eleven brush. 

00:04:05.109 --> 00:04:09.269
You all know how I love to contour the nose. 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:16.269
Bringing the brow into the face. 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:27.130
And then we will finish

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:30.330
by reinforcing that flush. 

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:31.729
Smile for me. 

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:33.119
With a little bit of 

00:04:33.119 --> 00:04:35.029
powder blush. 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:38.020
And by layering the powder on top of the créme, 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:45.020
that flush will stay all day long. 

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:56.089
Just blending it out with my powder brush. 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.419
Then I'm just going to do a 

00:04:59.419 --> 00:05:01.669
nice soft nude, 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:08.669
beigy nude lip. 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:42.969
Okay so this is my nice soft flushed look. You can see how great it would be to wear 

00:05:42.969 --> 00:05:45.740
everyday because we layered it. Now remember 

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:49.580
créme on top of créme, powder on top of powder. So we put foundation on first, 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.099
we then took our number sixty four brush, we applied our créme cheek color, front to back 'cause 

00:05:54.099 --> 00:05:56.400
remember a créme cheek is front to back. 

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:59.900
So we get a nice heavy flush first then we powdered the face, 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.630
then we put our eyes on

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:02.639
and

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:06.900
then we applied bronzer to ground the
back of the color with our number seventy

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.879
three brush. 

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:10.499
And then went back and took another pop of blush, 

00:06:10.499 --> 00:06:14.039
powder blush this time and popped it on the
apples of the cheeks with seventy three as

00:06:14.039 --> 00:06:19.889
well to layer that color so we get an all
day wear. So this is the beautiful 

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:22.079
Ivy in her flushed look. 

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:26.719
So I want to see you try it and I want to 
see you upload a picture on the Facebook page

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:28.239
of your trial of this look.
