00:00:01.406 --> 00:00:04.556
&gt;&gt; Nearly 3,000 Purdue
students claimed their diplomas

00:00:04.556 --> 00:00:06.166
at the winter 2008 Commencement.

00:00:06.676 --> 00:00:09.036
President France Cordova 
praised the students

00:00:09.036 --> 00:00:12.126
for their community service
and he's donated several tons

00:00:12.126 --> 00:00:14.206
of food and hundreds
of thousands of dollars

00:00:14.426 --> 00:00:15.486
to the local community.

00:00:15.486 --> 00:00:20.286
&gt;&gt; As a class you've had
substantial influence students.

00:00:21.336 --> 00:00:24.666
While here at Purdue you
created important initiatives

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.466
that will help future students

00:00:26.466 --> 00:00:29.006
and the community
for many years.

00:00:29.086 --> 00:00:31.606
&gt;&gt; Cordova also praised
students for mobilizing

00:00:31.606 --> 00:00:33.966
to shape the recent
presidential election.

00:00:34.306 --> 00:00:38.556
&gt;&gt; Take what you've learned from
the classroom, your activities,

00:00:38.846 --> 00:00:42.616
from your relationships, from
your families, and be confident

00:00:42.866 --> 00:00:46.366
that you have something truly
important to offer the world.

00:00:47.506 --> 00:00:49.646
These are imperfect times.

00:00:50.846 --> 00:00:53.826
The great opportunity lies
in seeing the challenges

00:00:54.066 --> 00:00:56.286
as pathways for innovations.

00:00:57.356 --> 00:01:00.146
The ideas that you
share and the work

00:01:00.146 --> 00:01:02.506
that you will do can
make a difference.

00:01:02.736 --> 00:01:06.576
The effort that you put
forth can improve the world.

00:01:07.056 --> 00:01:09.136
The students' speaker 
Kelly Lynn Krubald

00:01:09.136 --> 00:01:12.766
quoted Ben Franklin when she
encouraged her classmates to go

00:01:12.766 --> 00:01:16.156
to the world without fear
of failure or rejection.

00:01:16.586 --> 00:01:19.206
&gt;&gt; Knowing is better than
wondering; that waking is better

00:01:19.206 --> 00:01:22.326
than sleeping and even the
biggest failure, even the worst,

00:01:22.446 --> 00:01:23.706
beat the heck out
of never trying.

00:01:24.826 --> 00:01:27.656
Take chances, make
mistakes, keep your head high

00:01:27.796 --> 00:01:29.376
and live life with an open mind.

00:01:29.996 --> 00:01:32.226
&gt;&gt; Both Cordova and
Krubald encouraged students

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:34.056
to thank family members
and friends

00:01:34.356 --> 00:01:35.986
who supported them
through the years.

00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:39.486
Thousands of those supporters
break subzero wind chills

00:01:39.526 --> 00:01:42.566
to celebrate their loved ones at
receiving their Purdue degree.

00:01:42.566 --> 00:01:46.116
&gt;&gt; She has enjoyed her
education here at Purdue.

00:01:46.116 --> 00:01:48.616
We've had a lot of lab work,
a lot of research work.

00:01:48.616 --> 00:01:52.636
Kind of in the direction she
wants to head is research,

00:01:52.636 --> 00:01:54.206
eventually into management,

00:01:54.546 --> 00:01:56.306
then I think Purdue has
done her quite well.

00:01:56.706 --> 00:01:59.176
&gt;&gt; She decided to
go an extra semester

00:02:00.096 --> 00:02:02.086
so she can get higher grades

00:02:02.086 --> 00:02:04.166
and she did now she's
graduating with honors.

00:02:04.356 --> 00:02:06.676
So I'm very, very proud of her.

00:02:06.676 --> 00:02:09.466
&gt;&gt; Susan's a very
responsible young woman.

00:02:09.526 --> 00:02:14.556
She's active in her church,
she feels very passionate

00:02:14.556 --> 00:02:18.616
about her country and
about where she works.

00:02:18.616 --> 00:02:21.246
I expect that she'll
be a good person

00:02:21.296 --> 00:02:24.516
and I hope she'll be happy.

00:02:25.196 --> 00:02:27.536
&gt;&gt; At Purdue University,
I'm Jim Schenke.
