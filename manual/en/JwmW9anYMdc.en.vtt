478-Rotator Cuff Repair Open - http://youtu.be/o5UYwfPa08I

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.970
Your doctor has recommended that you have
surgery to repair a torn rotator cuff.

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.610
But what does that actually mean?

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:34.330
Rotator cuff is the term given to describe
a group of four tendons that work together

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:39.370
to support and stabilize the shoulder joint.

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.240
Each tendon connects muscle to bone.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.650
When a shoulder muscles contracts, it pulls
on a tendon which in turn pulls on the upper

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.440
arm bone and causes it to move.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:08.180
When one or more of these tendons become damaged,
the arm loses strength and mobility.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:14.750
After you are unconscious, your doctor will
make a vertical incision on your shoulder.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:25.310
Skin and other tissue will be pulled back
in order to expose the shoulder's muscles.

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:31.180
These will also be pulled aside to expose
the shoulder joint and tendons.

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:37.530
Under the deltoid muscle lies the bursa, a
protective sac that prevents the rotator cuff

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.740
tendons and the shoulder muscles from rubbing
against each other.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.640
Your doctor will remove the bursa to gain
access to the damaged tendons.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:02:00.030
Next, the surgeon will cut away any scar tissue
or unhealthy tissue around the torn area.

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:07.990
Using sutures, the tear can now be repaired.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:17.969
Before closing, the deltoid muscle is returned
to its proper position 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:21.659
and the skin is rejoined and sutured.

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:27.609
Finally, a sterile bandage is applied.

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:32.249
In order to keep the shoulder muscle immobile
while it heals, you will be given a sling

00:02:32.249 --> 00:03:01.039
to wear.
