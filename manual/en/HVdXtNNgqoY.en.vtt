00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:05.440
In this clip we are going to talk about the
proper service procedure for removing and

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:14.299
replacing a rear axle U joint on a Ford Explorer.
In this step we are going to talk about lubricating

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:22.000
of your replacement U joint. What I have here
is the remnants of my Ford equipment U joint.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.140
As you can see it, it's junk, and one of the
things that?s missing on it is the grease

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.540
fitting. This U joint is sealed and lubricated
at the factory. There is no further maintenance

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.770
you can do to this throughout the life of
the vehicle. Your after market replacement

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:45.710
U joint is going to come with a grease fitting.
Now the U joint is already lubricated with

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:51.210
some grease. However, what you?re going to
want to do is use your grease gun and fill

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:58.090
it up until you see grease shooting out from
the U joint seals. I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:17.180
pop that on right now and give it a couple
shots.

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:25.740
Alright, we are going to go ahead and give
it a couple pumps until we see grease coming

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:35.090
out of the U joint seal area. At this point
in time, it's a good idea to inspect your

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.720
front U joint to see if it has a fitting.
Greasing it right now would be a lot easier

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:46.380
than after installing the drive shaft on the
vehicle. This particular drive shaft has the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.860
factory fitting on it and there is no grease
port for it anywhere on here. If your drive

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:00.369
shaft also has a slip joint in it, most four
wheel drive front drive shafts have a slip

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:06.310
joint, it's a good idea to go ahead and take
and lubricate that at this point in time.

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.340
That is the proper way to lubricate your U
joints and drive shaft assembly.
