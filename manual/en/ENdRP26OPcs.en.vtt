Hi I'm Rachel for Expert Village. So this
is our cream cheese after 24 hours. Sometimes

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:22.810
it doesn't get as hard so you can wait, it
is between 24-48 hours depends on how hard

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:47.710
you like it. You can see it is like a ball.
Now we are going to add topping to it and

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:57.119
make it look nice if we want to serve it to
friends or during a fancy meal or regular

00:00:57.119 --> 00:01:03.390
breakfast. If we want to make it a little
bit more nicer we can use this cream cheese

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.700
with different topping on it. I'm going to
use Za'atar which is a middle eastern spice,

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:23.750
crush black pepper, sweet paprika and for
another blend I'm going to use garlic pieces

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:31.310
dry garlic. You can use onions, scallions,
actually anything that you like. What you

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:44.569
do is just take a piece like a walnut size
from the cream cheese and you roll it inside

00:01:44.569 --> 00:02:06.249
the spice that you would like and make one
with pepper. We want plain, then we would

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:09.950
do one with garlic.
