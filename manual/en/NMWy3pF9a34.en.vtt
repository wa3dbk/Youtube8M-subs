00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:09.490
Just stepped over to the 5.11 footwear collection, I'm here with Joel from 5.11,

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.110
and you've got a new line out, the Recon
line. Work me through what you guy's have done.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.539
So the idea with the Recon line is that we really want to challenge

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:20.759
the sort of traditional thinking of our end users,

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:25.210
both in their training applications and their tactical applications. So

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.789
we have a new series of trainers. Three colors- black, shadow, and dark coyote,

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.519
all meant to be fairly subdued, kind
of in the uniform look. And then this one

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:35.279
is

00:00:35.279 --> 00:00:37.180
a little bit more contrast.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.960
The ideal with the coloring is that this is
all sort of working with a multicam

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.070
color palate, so it's multicam compatible.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.670
If i take you through the features,

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:50.050
really there's kind of a bunch of aspects
going on here but, it's playing off of

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.610
the minimalist running movements. So we
know that our end user is really

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.040
active in crossfit, ultra marathoning, real high-performance sports.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:02.060
Compression molded EVA.

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.660
A new outsole for us, that uses kind
of a hybrid approach in that that the forefoot

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.520
is built like a trainer,

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.320
front is really stable, a lateral platform, where as the back is

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.010
really kind of more rounded, more
geared toward running.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.990
In the midfoot, it's open for fast roping,
and then you look here on the medial

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:26.440
side to kind of complete that, we have
this zone called the Rope-Ready Zone.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.780
So is the 5.11 patent-pending Blood Type Patch Kit.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:33.159
This is really our nod to sort
of what they do on the military

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:35.619
boots, right, you brought up Black Hawk Down,

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:39.110
that sort of mentality of writing your blood
type on the back. So

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.470
with the boots it'll come with two logo
patches, and then two blank patches, and then

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.890
as a gift with purchase, we'll offer all
the blood types,

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.460
one that says no known drug
allergies, and no penicillin.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.070
Great feature to see.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:57.990
That's absolutely cool. Cool concept there.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.250
Grabbing it, right away, just the lightweight, I can't emphasize that enough, the

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.740
lightweight materials they put into it,
high-end materials,

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.500
really abrasive-resistant on all sides. Lightweight package.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:13.330
I'm amazed by it.
-Thanks. We're really excited and to help with

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.360
this whole story of reconditioning, kinda rethinking how you approach your

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.290
footwear,

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.269
in the insole, we used an OrthoLite insole,

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.829
but we have this foot with a plus, and that's to give you this idea that you have

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:28.199
more cushioning if you use the insole.

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:32.199
But we built this shoe using what's called California construction. So

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:33.830
it's meant to be used

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:38.210
sockless, if you'd like, and you can take this out, remove it, and be even lower to the

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.009
ground. So there's a foot with a minus.

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:43.850
You can still use it without that insole.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:44.800
Yeah. So

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.909
pretty versatile, very low profile, lightweight as you're saying.

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.330
Great, so when are these gonna be out in the
stores, when can we expect them?

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.469
The end of June.

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.539
End of June. Joel, thank you so much.
