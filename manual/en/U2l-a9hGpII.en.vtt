00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:06.150
Okay this is the VT-32F telephone recording device

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.569
It come in a box

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:11.839
with the user manual

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:16.829
and some places to charge the AC adapter an an optional accessory, but we do include

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:19.369
for free

00:00:19.389 --> 00:00:24.849
and what it does is records any landline, cell phone, in person, or FM

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:25.720
transmission.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.110
uh... it's also good for dictation. There's a built-in speaker so once you have your recordings

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.040
you can just press play and listen to them right from the recorder.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.990
Now over here it is the record button,

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.330
and you have a volume up and down button,

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.640
and this is a selectable microphone settings switch

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.300
for dictation mode or conference mode. So dictation mode if you're going to be holding it

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.920
to yourself in and speaking, and conference mode if it's gonna be recording far away it increases

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.179
the sensitivity

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:57.530
of the dual mics;

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.430
there's one of each side of the recorder, so records very good sound compared to most

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.190
phone recorders.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.199
Over hear is a button for FM recording

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:08.930
this also

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.240
has an FM receiver so you can tune into any station

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:13.489
press the record button

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:17.480
and record music. Or, you can also record through FM

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.840
with the wireless microphone.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.110
And what this is this uh... it's got a little microphone on the end of it

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.590
comes with a AAA battery for it, and then it transmits the signal

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.340
on FM

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.640
frequency that this will pick up.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.780
And you have to have the recorder in about 98 feet

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.389
of the microphone,

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.580
depending on any interferences that you might have, it maybe a smaller distance. So

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.849
next is uh... telephone recording of a landline. And this is the telephone adapter

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.820
and what you do is take one end of this line-in cord

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.330
plug that in there

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.870
and then you plug the other hand into the microphone jack

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.000
of the recorder

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.040
then you take your telephone line

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.840
and plug it into the line side

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.950
of the adapter

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.589
and of course this part would plug into your wall jack.

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:16.039
Press record on the recorder, have your phone call, and it will record both sides of the

00:02:16.059 --> 00:02:16.609
conversation.

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:21.479
uh... this extra slot here is if you want to have a telephone to be able to use at that location

00:02:21.499 --> 00:02:23.440
you can and plug it in there.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.579
You don't have to have a telephone plugged in there

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:28.759
to record; it will record whatever is

00:02:28.779 --> 00:02:29.890
on your phone line

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.870
If a phone is being used at a different location from a different wall jack, it will still

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.249
record that phone call.

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.389
This is a standard set of earphones, if you wanna listen to them

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.059
instead of the speaker, you want to listen to them on earphones you can just plug that into the earphone

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:45.819
jack

00:02:45.839 --> 00:02:50.029
And this is a universal cell phone recording adapter.

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.790
You plug that into the microphone jack,

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:58.770
and how this works is there's a built-in microphone in this little ear bud. Place that in your ear

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.370
You take your cellphone and put that up to your ear and just have your conversation like

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:03.829
you normally would.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:09.169
This microphone picks up both sides of conversation so it doesn't actually plug into your cellphone

00:03:09.189 --> 00:03:13.990
and that makes it universal and compatible with all brands, makes, and models of cell phones.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.549
This accessory is this

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:19.279
lapel microphone or shirt

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.559
clip-on microphone

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:24.039
you put that into the mic jack

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:28.469
and turn the recorder on and put it in your pocket somewhere and then you can clip this on to your shirt

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.719
or wherever you want to put that to do body-worn recording.

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.829
So that's it after you have your recordings uh... again you can listen to them directly

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:37.019
from here,

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:43.730
or it also comes with a usb cable if you want to plug this in; it's both pc and mac compatible.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.329
it's recording in MP3 standard format and it works as just a flash drive

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:55.529
so you can just plug it in and and play your recordings right on any computer

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.660
and that's the VT-32F telephone recording device
