Alina: I've taught for the RSI for a couple
of years now, and it's always so cool to see

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.110
the girls that have come from previous years.
Each week I don't know what I'm going to see

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.700
when I come in on that first day, but I can
definitely pick out the RSI alum from the

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.900
people that are there for the first time.
The Rockettes have a very specific way of

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.140
moving, a style that's all their own, and
you can see that those girls immediately pick

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.350
up on the very small details that we're talking
about. They're squeezing their bevels, they

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.250
have high passes, and their confidence is
just out of this world.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.690
Jenna: I always look forward to the intensive,
because I feel like it's bringing me one step

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.089
closer to my ultimate goal of being a Rockette,
and I feel like every year I've that been

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.190
here, I've grown so much as a dancer and have
gotten so much closer to that goal. I feel

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:53.190
like I'm really prepared to hit that audition
next June.

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.940
Hannah: After my first year coming to the
summer intensive, I knew I had to come back

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.479
every year. Dancing this style for the first
time I automatically fell in love with it,

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.260
so this is something that I'm going to continue
to strive for. The summer intensive really

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.680
helps me get into that style, and continue
to better myself for the audition and whenever

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.850
I hopefully will be able to come a Rockette.
Carlye: When I was here for my first time

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.750
at RSI last year, I was very nervous. I mean
I was 14, and just one year my confidence

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.200
has grown, my kicks have gotten better. Everything
has really improved, and I just can't wait

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.820
to see what the next year I improve on.
Janelle: This is my 4th year attending the

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.130
Rockettes Summer Intensive Program. I keep
coming back because I love it so much. I meet

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.700
so many new girls, I get to work with different
Rockettes every year, and it's a great program

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.650
for me to hopefully reach my goals one day
to improve in my Rockette technique and really

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.750
get the style down so I nail it for the audition.
Alina: It makes me really proud to see how

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.530
much they improve over the years, and how
they really are taking into account all the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.260
things that they learn in previous years.
It's exciting as a teacher that

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.520
I don't have to re-teach things and go back,
so they act as leaders for the students that are coming.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.140
