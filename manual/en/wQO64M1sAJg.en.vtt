00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.990
Hi, I'm Richard Goms, we're here in Murray,
Utah, we're talking about basic car care.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.980
We've got the car jacked up already and I'm
going to show you how to change a tire. We

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:25.321
take the jack handle that is intended to have
a nut driver that will fit over the lug nuts

00:00:25.321 --> 00:00:33.739
of your car and we put it on a lug nut and
then we twist. Now if you have trouble, you

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:42.679
can put it on this way and then step on it
and break loose the lug nuts. But you just

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:51.769
twist and twist and twist. Once you have them
loose, you can just do this and take off each

00:00:51.769 --> 00:01:00.239
lug nut of which there are five on this tire.
And you take off each lug nut, there are five

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:10.460
on this tire until you can remove the tire.
Now it doesn't matter which order you take

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:19.410
off the lug nuts, but it does matter the order
that you put them back on. OK, here's the

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:30.900
last lug nut.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:36.420
Now you've got all five lug nuts off of there
so we can pull, grab onto the wheel and the

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:44.970
tire, make sure not to pinch your fingers
in anything, and then we can change the tire.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.710
Let's say this tire is flat and you need to
replace it with your spare, you should be

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:58.370
able to locate your spare by looking in the
owners manual. You should always carry a spare.

00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:03.110
You should always make sure its full of air
and in good shape. It may be a full size tire

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:08.250
like this, or it may be one of those smaller
tires that you can only run for about 30 or

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:18.340
40 miles. Either way, this is how you would
put it back on. You get the tire up next to

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:35.870
the wheel and you line up the holes in the
tire with the studs sticking out of the wheel.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.160
Once you have the tire back up, you've got
the holes all lined up, you've got it back,

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:48.320
sitting up above the ground on the wheel,
then you get the lug nuts out and start putting

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.420
them on one at a time.
