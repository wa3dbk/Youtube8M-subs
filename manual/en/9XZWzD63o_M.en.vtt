00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:07.240
 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.520
Now we're dealing with streamline.  The streamline is one of the most

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:19.010
critical skills that a swimmer can develop

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:23.720
The reason that it's so critical is
because it is the fastest that a swimmer

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.450
will move in the water

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.970
coming off the walls and on the starts
with the tight streamline

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.210
you'll never swim as fast as you're moving
as you explode off the wall

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:41.210
so it's very very important that you
have a tight streamline

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:44.829
now essentially a streamline is making
the body

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.540
as slender, as skinny in the water as
possible

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.030
to cut down on resistance so the body
moves more smoothly through the water

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:57.040
maintaining speed and momentum.
Now the important parts

00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.230
of the streamline--number one is the
shoulders, the shoulders are the widest

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.900
part of the body, structurally

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:06.369
so they're going to catch the most water
they're going to catch the most resistance

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:11.040
You want to try to eliminate the
resistance by allowing the

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.590
water

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.410
to slide around the shoulders,
making them as slender as possible

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.300
in the water.  I like to tell my swimmers
that your shoulders are the

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.210
widest part of your body but you're going
try to make them

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:30.210
one at the skinniest parts of your body

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.130
Number one-  hands overlapped this is
a bad habit don't have your hands next

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:51.820
to each other

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.050
So hands overlapped, you want to lock
the streamline

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.530
just behind the head with the head
resting on the biceps.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:01.980
It should be nice and tight

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:06.540
Now the key points to locking it is
making sure that you eliminate any

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:07.890
open space

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.009
that will be between your head and your
shoulders

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.700
That will kill you in the long
run as far as a swimmer because any open

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.690
space right there is going to catch water

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:23.690
which is going to create resistance

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.520
with the legs you want to make sure that
the legs are together

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.600
and that your toes are pointed behind
you

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:33.720
One of the common things I have found
with swimmers when starting to

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.010
develop their streamline

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:38.440
is that they allow their feet to hang off the
end

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.550
Now remember, as a competitive swimmer,
you're trying to cut down on resistance

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:45.650
so keep those pointed,  just like a
ballerina

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:51.430
and make sure that you eliminate all
of the resistance that you can

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.050
 

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.820
Here are some secret tricks when
dealing with a swimmer to help them

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.020
develop a tighter streamline

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.310
something that I tell my swimmers
is that your streamline can never ever be too tight

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.090
You're never going to hear a swim coach come
up and say "ooh you need to loosen up

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.020
that streamline it's just too tight"

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.330
No, the tighter the better that is
always the case

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:18.400
another thing that I tell my swimmers is
that a tight streamline

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.960
actually makes the pool shorter.  With a
tight streamline

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:26.720
you'll come off of the wall with more
speed, covering more distance

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.260
and coming onto the surface with more
speed and momentum

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.730
then you would with a broken streamline
with something that's not very tight

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:37.840
so you actually have a shorter distance
to swim

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.040
in the long run when you break the
surface if you have a tight streamline

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:44.760
and you're moving faster which is an added
bonus
