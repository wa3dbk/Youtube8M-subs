Hi, my name is Jorge Benlloch and today I
am going to present here different materials

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:23.279
because I am going to try to make like a duck
decoy. It's going to be like a figurine, that

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.410
you can put it in the interior; it's going
to look like a decoy anyway. We are going

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:39.880
to use, for that I choose gray clay, water-based,
there is several grays here. This is the red

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:47.790
clay, this is the gray clay, all water-based,
and this is Plasticine, which is oil-based

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.100
and this is Sculpey, its a very interesting
material but very expensive, that's why when

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.261
we do all this kind of things with the big
volume, it's better to do it with gray clay

00:00:57.261 --> 00:01:03.970
and later we will process another to reinforce
that. This figure that we are going to make,

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:11.540
this figurine is going to be like self-drying
and self-hardening. It's not going to be very,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:19.650
very strong but later we will finish it in
some kind of finish that, it will last quite

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:28.230
long. Anyway, that's the tools that we are
going to use; that's the rotating plate, that's

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:36.620
the rolling pin, this is very important, that's
wire to cut, and knead the clay and a few

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:46.590
basic tools that, you know you can find in
any art store. This, this two pieces of wood,

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.049
they are very interesting, you will see how
I am going to use it, it's in order to cut

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.870
even slabs off clay that we are going to do
with it.
