00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.620
 

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:11.650
Hi everyone. So today we're going
to be quickly discussing

00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:15.110
how to improve your frame rate in the
Witcher 3 on PC.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:18.839
Now much has been made of this game over the last 24 hours,

00:00:18.839 --> 00:00:22.539
with a large number of people saying
that the frame rate is absolutely atrocious

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:25.929
even on recommended hardware 770 series and

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:31.810
above. Now honestly this is not a particularly great game for optimisation at this

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.470
stage.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.630
The recommended spec, that's 770 GPU
simply does not achieve

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.290
60 frames a second in this game. Likewise, Nvidia's GeForce experience is

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.890
providing

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.570
rubbish suggested settings which do not
provide the stable frame rate

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.960
either. The main issue we have really
with the Witcher 3 at the moment is the frame rate is

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.950
just all over the place on most hardware

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:55.550
ranging from 35 frames a second up to 60 frames a second

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.430
and it can float around anywhere in
between that point almost continuously.

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.640
Now what the best solution we currently

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.740
have for this really is to provide an
artificial frame cap

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.890
so the way this kind of works is we take the

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.810
lowest average frame rate that we've achieved with a card and then we cap

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.720
the Vsync down to that level.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.550
By doing this we can stabilise the frame
rate and stop it

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:21.760
wandering around quite so much. Well,  at
all in fact.

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:25.190
But to do this really requires us to kind of identify what our lowest

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.870
frame rate is. Now on PC anything above 40 frames a second is generally considered

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:30.860
smooth motion,

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:34.400
unperceivable to the human brain that things aren't quite as smooth

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.320
as they could be. Certainly it's much better than having

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.390
the frame rate wandering around
continuously giving you slow frames

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.430
and so on. Obviously those all important texture tears as well

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:47.890
being eliminated. So how do we do this?  Well,  it's actually a very, very simple

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:48.960
process in the Witcher 3.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.810
All you need to do, come into the Witcher 3's user settings file

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.500
which you'll find in your My Documents area. We open that with notepad

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.290
and then what we do, come to edit and find and

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.840
just do FPS here,  just quick and easy and
we'll go through and

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.010
what we're looking for is limit FPS equals.

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:08.860
Now at the moment that will be set to
60

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.300
or whatever your Vsync cap set is.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.760
Could be 60, could be 120 for all I know. But the key thing here

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.960
is to set it to whatever you feel your
minimum rate

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.030
there is. So if you've been observing
a frame rate as

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.700
average bottoming out at 40 frames a second, set it to 40 frames a second and  it won't drift above

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.240
that point. Likewise, if you've got a beefy enough PC it's not going to drift

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.940
under that point either. This will get rid of
all of that slow frames stuttering,

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.410
all sorts of other little graphical issues
that we tend to get when we have an uneven

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:39.140
frame rate.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.980
This is a really really quick and simple
fix and it works

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.520
brilliantly well. This also means that
you can then retune

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.370
your graphic settings in the Witcher 3
to make the best of that 40 frames a

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.970
second.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.760
In my case that means we've actually been able to crank up some of the visual detail in say the

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.600
shadow mapping

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.980
without a massive cost in frame rates
essentially sending the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.989
FPS wandering so much more. This provides a much more stable gameplay experience

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:05.590
and actually

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.790
a much smoother and enjoyable gameplay experience as well.

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.580
If you've not given this a try yet it is well worth doing on PC.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:17.190
Like I say, if you've got a fairly beefy  graphics card you might want to set your cap at 50 frames a second or 55

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.110
but making sure that you have nice stable
frame rate that isn't wandering around

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:25.019
is really what the sweet spot here is all about. So do give this a try and let me know in

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:26.150
the comments how you get on.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.830
 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.680
 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.170
