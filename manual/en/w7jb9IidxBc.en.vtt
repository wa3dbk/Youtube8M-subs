00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:20.380
This is a '70s Telecaster Deluxe.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:29.020
Basically, when they were coming out with
this guitar, sort of an obvious attempt to

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.570
capture the vibe of their competitor, which
is Gibson.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:39.719
With two hum bucking pickups, three way toggle
switch, and volume control for each pickup

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.180
and a tone control for each pickup.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:52.060
They also went for this contoured body shape,
which is characteristic of a Fender Stratacaster.

00:00:52.060 --> 00:01:01.620
It's sort of, like an amalgamation of many
different guitars.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.040
This particular one has a C shaped neck.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.149
It's a soft C. It's a little thinner, profile
wise.

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:14.070
Great or somebody with small hands or smaller
hands.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.940
Not your traditional Telecaster.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:19.060
You're not gonna get the standard Telecaster
sounds.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.080
Mostly because of the pickups.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.540
They're hum bucker pickups.

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:23.660
They're higher output.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:29.990
They have a characteristically darker tone
to them than Tele's usually do.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.860
Tele's usually known for a cutting through
mixes, cutting through other instruments onstage,

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.150
in the studio.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:44.270
Typically, a Telecaster would have two single
coil pickups.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.420
One in the bridge position, one in the neck
position.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.830
A three-way switch.

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:50.900
One volume, one tone.

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:54.080
Those are master controls for each pickup.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.000
You can see that this is a very different
design.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:28.100
In your bridge position.
