00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This sphere of modeling clay is like the bullfighting planet in the hands of Humberto Peraza the sculptor,

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.500
And here it is, the first one of this afternoon

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
There real bulls, and clay bulls;

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.500
just like the bullfighter that raises himself to nail the flags

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.000
A breathtaking instant of thrill, which you already know

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:34.000
It is the super flag-nailer Carlos Arruza

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
He nailed the flags first, and now he is taking them back from the bull

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.000
he fights the bull so close, that the flags  hinder him

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.000
These scenes come from his last bullfight in Spain,

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.000
the famous “Million pesetas”in the Barcelona Bullfighting Plaza

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.000
He embraces the bull from its horns, just like a journey to the crescent

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.000
Teases the bull, and embraces it with prideful authority

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
And now, prepare yourselves

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.000
What is up to come is no cinematic stunt

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.000
eventhou it seems to be it, this is for real

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
something outstanding, beyond belief…

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Four moves in one, and the turnmoil, before the public’s awe

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And the lunge, in the bull’s neck base; the crowd is blown away

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
One of the greatest bullfighters of all times

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.000
Figure and artist, evocked by another artist

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.000
Now, Humberto Peraza decides to end up with this model, vanquishing the figure

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.000
and goes back, giving to the modeling clay its starting spherical form

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.000
And the reverie has come to its end
