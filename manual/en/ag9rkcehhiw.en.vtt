00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:06.960
When working with a twin needle, all you need
to do is first check the size on the package.

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:07.960
This one is 2.5.

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.040
The first thing I'm going to do is, I'm going
to go into the set menu and actually tell

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:16.110
it what size of twin needle I'm using.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.560
Twin needle and 2.5.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.500
Notice all the options there, from 6.0 down
to 1.6.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.880
When I touch OK, you are going to notice that
every stitch I pick will be pictured just

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.320
like it's going to sew.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.329
When you actually pick some of these stitches,
they're going to look kind of cool even just

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:35.329
to start with.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.630
Even the utility stitches are going to look
fantastic.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:42.230
This is one of my favorites because it just
has some fun with itself.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.969
As you go ... ooh, I haven't seen that one
before.

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.820
As you can see, it's pretty exciting.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.760
So if you have stitched out all of your decorative
stitches all ready, why not put a twin needle

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.969
in and go stitch them out again because they
are going to look totally different.

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.680
Again, impressing your friends, this is an
easy way to do it.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:06.619
Once I have set the machine up, I am guaranteed
not to accidentally overstep the boundaries

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:07.619
of the foot.

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.200
That's why we want to set that twin needle
function.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.659
What it does is limit the setting.

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.880
So right now, where it says 4.5 on this, I
cannot make it any bigger.

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.749
Remember, the max is 7 mm minus 2.5, is actually
4.5.

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:27.369
Now when we threaded this machine, I don't
know which side of the tension disc I went

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.869
in, so I'm going to go ahead and remove my
thread, add my second color up here.

00:01:31.869 --> 00:01:34.710
You can do a thread stand or just add it up
here.

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.250
What I am going to do is take both of these
colors.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.310
Why not, pink and purple, every little girl's
favorite color combination.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.499
We're going to go ahead and thread them.

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:47.560
As soon as I get right here, I'm going to
separate them in my hands.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.439
It doesn't matter which one, but you will
notice there is a little metal fin in here.

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.389
Put one thread on the right and one thread
on the left.

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:59.109
Put those threads back together in one hand
and finish threading the machine.

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:03.719
When you get down to the bottom, it actually
does not matter which thread goes in which

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.289
needle.

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:09.790
The only thing that does matter is, can you
see the needle eyes to thread them manually,

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:15.079
because the needle threader is not set up
to thread for a twin needle.

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:20.730
So either get a hand held needle threader
or, if you have a Husqvarna Viking serger,

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.469
often times the needle threader came in those
machines.

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.130
Those are nice and sometimes used over here.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.130
There we go.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:31.130
Slide that underneath.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.849
This is what we are talking about.

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:37.260
When you are working with a decorative stitch,
you are going to get a fabulous combination.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.489
The 2 colors you pick, every time you pick
another color, you've stitched the same stitch,

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.870
it's going to look a little different.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.019
We'll just add this to our little sampler
here.

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:48.019
Let's do this stitch.

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:49.640
It doesn't look like I've done one.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.000
We should be good to go here.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.129
Sometimes what I'll do is just serge a little
bit slower as I kind of get used to and kind

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:59.829
of make sure my machine is all set up for
the way I'm working.

00:02:59.829 --> 00:03:05.219
I like the way it's stitching right now, so
I can go ahead and stitch a little bit here.

00:03:05.219 --> 00:03:10.129
How about for fun, I'm going to just randomly
pick ... I tend to pick stitches that are

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:15.019
a little bit more open, a little bit lacy,
and that are along that line.

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.359
Even just a simple scallop or some of these
fun little guys here are going to look fantastic.

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:26.079
By the way, those will stitch out very fast
because they are a longer stitch.

00:03:26.079 --> 00:03:28.409
A stitch length of 20 per stitch.

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.510
Now it just looks like I have a calligraphy
pen.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.810
You can go ahead and use the thread cutter.

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:39.689
It will work with the twin needle and we'll
see what we get here.

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:42.650
See what I mean about stitching out all your
stitches.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:44.609
You are going to get a different look.

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.880
If you put in a different size of twin needle,
your stitches are going to look a little bit

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.400
different from there.

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.840
So have some fun, impress your friends, try
out some variegated threads, and wow.

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.500
These stitches are fabulous.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.310
Ever see a triple needle?

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:02.900
Now you can stitch them all a third time too.
