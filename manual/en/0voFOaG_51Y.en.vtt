Hey guys this is Heather from Healthyveganrecipes.net.
Today, I’m going to share to you my easy

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:21.199
lettuce wrap recipe. A lot of you asking what
Phil and I eat on a typical day and the answer

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:22.199
are pretty simple.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.550
We usually have some oatmeal or another grain
for breakfast, and then we had a green smoothie

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:34.309
and something else for lunch, and then for
dinner one of the many recipes I shared with

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:35.309
you guys.

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.120
So, what I thought I would show today was
a little bit different – an easy lettuce

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:47.360
wrap recipe. It’s just a quick simple lunch
that Phil and I are enjoying lately.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:53.920
For those of you who was skipped ahead for
the recipe, I’ll post that over at healthyveganrecipes.net

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.109
and, now I will show you how to put this together.

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:01.140
So, to start you need a lettuce leaf that
was going to wrap up nicely, so I’ve got

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.200
some big leaves here. It’s always nice to
have something a little bit more substantial

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.640
in your salad or wraps.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.761
I got some chickpeas here that I soaked and
then sprouted. I don’t know if you can see

00:01:16.761 --> 00:01:23.400
any of a little tails, but makes too much
more digestible and then I cooked them and

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.530
I got them marinating here.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.340
In a really simple dressing of lemon juice,
pressed garlic and some sea salt with kelp

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.350
in it. I’ve been writing on my nutrition
blog at healthyeatingstartshere.com about

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.189
the benefits of minimizing oil and using whole
food forms of fat instead.

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:52.350
This is just an example of how you can make
a salad with a nice dressing and no oil. Its

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:58.640
helpful to let the chickpeas marinate like
this for a little while, you can even do this

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.219
a night before put this on a fridge overnight
it will be so delicious in the morning.

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:09.030
For vegetables, I’ve got some green onions
that I chopped right here and ready to go

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.629
and I got some carrot, zucchini and green
pepper. You can use whether vegetables combo

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:16.000
you like in here.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.819
Its amazing how just being simple salad ingredients
put in a different form, wrap them up in a

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:29.550
lettuce leaf and its so much more fun - totally
different experience.

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.770
Now I find taking this for a mobile lunch
or like for work or a picnic or something.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:40.580
I probably cut everything up, assemble it
and take is separately and arrange it together

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:47.090
on the spot, because the lettuce will probably
wilt once the lemon juice hits it – probably

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.709
it wont stay put very well.

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:56.989
I want to warn you that this is a little bit
of a messy meal but that makes it fun. To

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:05.049
assemble, you just got to take you lettuce
leaf, lay it out flat on the plate, drop some

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:14.620
chickpeas on there – it also very nice to
do a bean spread in this because it’s nice,

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.739
flat and smooth.

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:33.220
Then put some veggies on there – I like
a lot of vegetables, but it’s sometimes

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:42.700
harder to roll up, the price you pay for eating
all your veggies. I’ve mentioned that were

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:52.160
not going to use olive oil, or any type of
fat, we are just using whole foods.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.629
There is some fat in the chickpeas because
I’m going to add a few pumpkin seeds for

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:08.180
a nice little crunch, some extra flavor and
fat. Seeds like pumpkin seeds do better when

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.819
you soaked them overnight and dehydrated to
keep them longer.

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:21.660
When you going to eat it which is getting
a little bit challenging. You just roll it

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:33.080
up, tuck it up in one end – I usually start
eating from this end. As you can see its definitely

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.830
much better to assemble this if you’re going
to eat it.

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:41.080
So there you go, easy lettuce wrap recipe,
an easy lunch idea. Phil and I are going to

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.320
dig into ours now and like I said, we enjoyed
eating with our hands. Its fun to be messy

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:52.480
sometimes because it connects you with your
food a little bit, and just for a little different

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.570
experience.

00:04:53.570 --> 00:05:00.820
