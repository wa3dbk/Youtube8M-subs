Seperating a good wedding production from
a bad one, usually starts by paying close

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:18.449
attention to the audio that carries the video
along.

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:33.190
A wedding is a once in a lifetime event, which
means when you capture the audio, you need

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:40.940
to do it right .... The first time around....

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.210
Mic placement is crucial when it comes to
weddings, as there are several different options

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.780
to choose from. The idea, is to make sure
that you are prepared for all of them.

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.539
First off, you need to make sure that the
camera has a mic input jack, either for XLR

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:58.260
or an eighth inch mini cable. This will ensure
that all your bases are covered. One of the

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.690
most common scenarios that you will be facing,
is who to mic.... The best possible solution

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.700
that is going to result in the cleanest audio
track, would be getting as close to the actual

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:12.480
ceremony as possible. This is why placing
a microphone on the groom is one of the best

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:16.160
solutions. You are going to want to make sure
that you mic the groom just under their collar.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.050
If they aren't comfortable with the mic clip
showing, you can always conceal the mic within

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.350
the button hole of there tux. Now, if this
isn't possible.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.250
Another solution would be to mic the pastor.
He is close the both the bride and groom and

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.600
generally a bit further behind them which
means that a mic clip wouldn't necessarily

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.080
be visable in the wedding video.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.170
If you can't get that close in with the groom
or the pastor, there are plenty of other Audio

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.630
Solutions that should work out just fine.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:48.070
Plugging into the mixing board or the house
mix is a great way to capture good clean audio

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.610
of the ceremony if you have xlr inputs in
your camera. If you don't, be sure to grab

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:57.490
an xlr to mini eighth inch adapter. This works
because now your camera works as a capture

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.620
device for any audio leaving the main house
mix that is captured through the house mic.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:21.159
If the camera that you are working with doesn't
have any xlr inputs and you can't find any

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:27.379
adapters, another good solution would be to
set a hand held mic in front of the main speakers.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.909
Hand Held mics are used to mic instruments
and amplifiers during recording sessions for

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:35.249
bands so they can take a beating when it comes
to loud intense audio and still capture a

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:36.290
clean source of audio. And generally, Hand
Held mics also come with the necessary adapters

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:40.370
for most prosumer cameras. If you are working
on a budget, this is a great solution for

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.569
capturing a clean audio track.

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.280
Sometimes guests want to say something on
camera for the bride and groom, when it comes

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.269
to these types of brief interviews its always
best to move the subjects into an area with

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.680
less noise.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.549
Receptions can be loud and if they are held
outdoors, very difficult to work around do

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:58.969
to the large amount of ambient noise. The
best way to work around this and capture clean

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:10.019
audio is to move your subjects into a entirely
seperate area in which you can control the

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:19.230
scenario. This means if there is a lot of
noise, grab the guest and move them into another

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.420
room where the music isn't louder than their
voices.
