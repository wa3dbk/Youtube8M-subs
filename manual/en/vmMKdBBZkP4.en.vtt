00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:05.430
Rulers, pens, cellphone cases. Have you ever
stopped to think of how plastic is a common

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:07.180
material
in our daily lives?

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.940
But, if instead of making conventional objects,
it happens to be transformed in prostheses

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.120
to people
that suffered accidents?

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.359
The Federal University of ABC is working on
this, using 3D printers. Check in this reporter!

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:26.800
A mechanical hand made in a 3D printer. This
is the project that is being developed in the UFABC.

00:00:26.859 --> 00:00:30.909
Its original model was idealized in South Africa

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:34.309
 by a carpenter that lost his fingers,
and this

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:39.800
proposal was adopted by an NGO of the country.
With the help of an american designer, it

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.949
was
posible to make an prototype using the 3D

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:43.649
printer.
Elizete:

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:48.420
- It was a conceived project to be developed
with focus on children, to a child that is

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.820
amputed, lost
the hand, or was born with a missing limb,

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.469
to take the possibility of playing, manipulate
objects and

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:00.239
develop the cognitive side. But considering
that the project was very successful, it started

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.970
to be used
by adults too. It has a certain limitation,

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.460
you can't do all the kinds of movements or
hold too much

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:17.460
weight, but our idea here in Brazil is to
use the project for children and adults, mostly

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.000
in adults that
just have lost a limb, by a trouble or work

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.630
accident, and are waiting for a prosthesis
in the public

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.039
health system, being this prosthesis aesthetic
or myoelectric.

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:38.039
After four months of development in the university,
the first hand prototype was printed. However,

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.500
it has to be changed to fit in each pacient
case.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:48.500
Elizete -- Its assembly is really like a puzzle,
there are wires and rubber bands, that are

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.719
assembled
one-by-one after printed in the 3D printer.

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:54.289
The prosthesis production is specific to one
pacient.

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:59.619
There isn't one method to acquire the geometry
of the pacient's stump yet. This is one part

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:01.969
of the
project that we are trying to improve. At

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:05.340
first we make the measurements of the pacient's
hand

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.340
width, but it depends of the amputation level
and we make a proportion regarded to the model.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:21.660
Then, we make a bigger model -- one and a
half, two, three sizes -, we estimate the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.750
width of the
prosthesis that will adapt to the pacient.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:40.670
The first patient to receive the prototype
lost part of both hands in a job accident.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:44.150
Ricardo makes occupational therapy at the
Institute of Orthopaedics and Traumatology

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.450
of Hospital das Clinicas, in Sao Paulo. With
exercises and weekly follow-up as he

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.590
prepares to receive the prosthesis.
Ricardo - The therapy that I've been doing

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.580
here here has been very good , because
they are doing exercises in order to help

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.990
me not to lose the movements of the wrist,
so

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:09.990
I can use this prosthesis because I'll need
to use a lot of wrist movement . At home ,

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:17.270
after I take it to do the tests, I'll work
wearing it, to see if I can really do some

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:19.140
things
well.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:25.480
With the prosthesis, the patient's recovery
is easier, besides offering greater comfort.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.220
Mariana -- Actually, the idea is to give patients
mobility as soon as possible

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:39.060
When the patient has an amputation, until
the moment when he is prosthetized, we

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.480
have a long period, due to bureaucracy and
preparation of the stump to receive the

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.870
prosthesis. The idea is that this prosthesis
can take a very early role for patients,

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.630
because it'll be fast and low-cost manufacturing.
So we put it postoperatively,

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:55.680
facilitating their function and facilitating
adherence to the treatment of this patient.The

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:00.240
number of upper limb amputations are smaller
than those of the lower limbs, but in

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.430
return the market prostheses for upper limbs
is tightly restricted. There are about four

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:07.670
types of prostheses available on the market,
but the mechanical hand is the first that

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.810
offers a guarantee of value for money.
Elizete - The advantage is that basically

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.040
does not exist anything like it in the market,
and if we can improve the product and make

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.129
it viable so that it can be produced and
pass a certification, then we'll have a product

00:04:20.129 --> 00:04:23.770
that can be used as a right security
control.
