00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:07.920
Hola, chicas.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.870
I'm Carlos Vera, celebrity
hairstylist for Pantene.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:15.490
I'm here to share some tips and steps on
how to achieve a romantic wavy look

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:16.880
for Valentine's Day.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.100
It's a pleasure to be here with
celebrity and beauty blogger, Rosie,

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.860
from AccidentalSexiness.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.360
Who will, of course, be celebrated
Valentine's Day with her husband.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.640
And I want her to look
absolutely gorgeous.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.470
Rosie has the typical Latina hair type,
which is medium thick hair.

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.230
Today, for Rosie's Valentine's Day look,
I'm going to use a cocktail of

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.250
products from Pantene's Normal to Thick
collection, that can help reduce

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.360
breakage, provide strength against
damage, and help control frizz, in

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.250
order to achieve a beautiful, healthy,
and shiny hair look.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.600
Vamos, let's get to it.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.770
I started by washing Rosie's hair with
Pantene's Normal to Think Moisture

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.520
Renewal shampoo and conditioner.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.180
Then, when her hair was still damp, I
applied Pantene's Split End Repair

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.800
Carotene Protection Creme directly to
the ends, in order to help her prevent

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.050
her split ends.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.420
Now I'm applying Pantene's Flowing
Body Mousse to deliver some

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.670
bounce in her hair.

00:01:14.861 --> 00:01:20.740
I blow-dried her hair, and used a
curling iron to create the curl.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:22.540
Now, I'm finishing pin
setting the hair.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.540
I recommend using a diffuser to add
volume, because it blows air without

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.790
disturbing the set.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.940
Finally, I remove the
pins from her hair.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.150
And we will take a wide-toothed comb to
comb out the wave and create that

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:54.060
voluminous, luxurious, soft wave.

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.330
I'm sure Rosie will leave a
long-lasting impression

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:12.580
