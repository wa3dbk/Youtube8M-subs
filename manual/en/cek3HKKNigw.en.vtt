00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.010
How to Learn the Basics of Bricklaying.

00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:10.429
The bricklayerâ€™s craft ranges from building
and repairing walls to installing firebrick

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:12.190
linings inside industrial chimneys.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:16.710
To learn the basics of bricklaying, start
with building a low garden wall.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:25.070
You will need A tape measure Stakes String
A shovel Two-by-fours A saw A hammer and nails

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:35.260
A chalk line Mortar A wheelbarrow A trowel
A mortarboard Bricks A level A brick chisel

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.000
Gloves (optional) A safety mask (optional)
A story pole (optional) and a pencil (optional).

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.390
Step 1.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.020
Measure and stake out the size you want your
wall to be.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.060
Then attach string around the perimeter of
the stakes.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.060
Step 2.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:53.060
Dig out the area of your wall, 6 inches deep,
and set the dirt aside.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.470
Step 3.

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.469
Measure and cut two-by-fours to construct
a frame.

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.969
The frame will have the dimensions of your
wall.

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.770
Nail the boards together and set the frame
in place.

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:06.890
Then pour concrete into the frame for your
foundation.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:08.310
Step 4.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.750
Measure and mark the center of your wall with
the measuring tape and chalk line when the

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.140
concrete is dry.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.270
Then mix mortar in your wheelbarrow.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.270
Follow the manufacturer's instructions for
mixing the mortar.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.360
Wear gloves and a mask for safety sake when
working with mortar.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.570
Step 5.

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.530
Trowel some mortar onto your mortarboard.

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.140
Then trowel mortar onto the bottom of your
first brick and lay it inside the frame.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.140
Press it down firmly so that mortar is squeezed
out from beneath it.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.310
Step 6.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.659
Trowel mortar onto the bottoms and ends of
more bricks, laying them in a row.

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:43.140
Use the level to make sure they're even.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.340
Step 7.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.060
Start the next row up with half a brick so
that the rows are staggered.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:51.530
Use the brick chisel to cut bricks, and use
your level to keep the bricks plumb.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.490
Use a story pole as a vertical guide for laying
bricks.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.420
Use a pencil to mark the height and mortar
joints of each brick on the story pole.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.590
Step 8.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.210
Build up to 3 feet tall before you have to
add steel reinforcements.

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.990
Beyond 3 feet, consult your local building
codes office for advice.

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.390

Goldberg worked as a bricklayer to make ends
