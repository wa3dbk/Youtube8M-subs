00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.390
In this section we're going to cover
2 elements in suspension setup

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.630
Ride height and rake

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.529
Ride height is really important
on cars that have

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:17.509
a lot of aerodynamic force
or under wings like an IndyCar

00:00:17.579 --> 00:00:19.799
and it's still important
on sports cars because

00:00:19.799 --> 00:00:22.370
they're getting some
airflow underneath the car

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:25.540
The ride height is the
distance from the ground plane

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.179
to the bottom of the car usually
measured at the front and rear axle

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:32.269
and the difference
between the two we call the rake

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:35.329
and the rake can change the
aerodynamic behavior of the car

00:00:35.354 --> 00:00:37.028
the high-speed handling of the car

00:00:37.029 --> 00:00:40.330
So it's a key parameter for
tuning any kind of car,

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:42.670
to get the right
balance at high speed

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.150
Naturally you'd like to run
the car as low as possible

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:48.560
but they're are
some other considerations

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.910
For sure you want
the car as low as possible

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.150
but if you lower a streetcar
down until it hits the ground

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.570
now the suspension geometry
is going to be all out of its

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.750
ideal operating range.
So now you've created more problems.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.680
So you want the car as low
as possible but you also want

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.589
The system and suspension to be

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.990
designed around
that low ride height

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.770
You want the car to be just
touching the ground

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.710
at the highest speed or
highest loading condition on the track

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.670
and not be dragging on the
ground because that'll slow you down

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.910
So you try and lower
the car as much as you can

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.175
before it hits the ground,

00:01:20.175 --> 00:01:22.575
based on everything else
that you are tuning on the car

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.699
Ride height adjustment
also allows you

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:27.810
to change the rake
or the cars angle of attack

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.859
Rake is the difference between
front and rear ride height

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:34.950
So positive rake would be
the rear higher than the front

00:01:34.975 --> 00:01:36.749
and you might do
that if you want to

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.690
move the center of
pressure of the under wing,

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.210
the aerodynamic forces forward,
to reduce understeer

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.430
because that would put more
pressure on the front tires

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.820
reducing high-speed understeer

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.190
or the other way
you might put in negative rake

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:51.464
where the rear is
lower than the front

00:01:51.464 --> 00:01:53.979
so that you put more
aerodynamic force on the rear tires

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:56.580
and maybe fix a
high speed oversteer condition

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.720
So you use the rake to tune the
aerodynamic balance of the car

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.680
by moving the center
pressure forward or rearward

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.890
but at the same time

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.964
rake might affect
the suspension geometry,

00:02:05.964 --> 00:02:07.204
so it's not easy...

00:02:07.204 --> 00:02:09.214
You need to think about
what it's doing to

00:02:09.214 --> 00:02:12.454
your breaking, accelerating,
and corning forces, as well as

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:14.739
the high-speed
aerodynamics

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.519
A weight jacker
is a tool we use

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.219
to adjust the
right to rear

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.340
corner weights and
ride heights on IndyCars

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.269
The weight jacker basically
gets taller and shorter

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:29.248
and thereby increases
the height and the load

00:02:29.249 --> 00:02:31.849
on the right rear corner and

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.719
in that way it adjusts
the handling of the car

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.089
differently than the anti-rollbars

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:41.293
Basically, by adding weight on
the left front, right rear diagonal

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:44.343
by increasing the weight jacker,
the car will tend to oversteer

00:02:44.343 --> 00:02:46.903
and if you take weight off
the right rear, left front,

00:02:46.903 --> 00:02:49.413
In other words,
put it on opposite corner

00:02:49.438 --> 00:02:50.908
it will start to understeer

00:02:50.908 --> 00:02:53.599
So you basically
adjust the weight dynamically

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.569
with the weight jackers on track,
to adjust the handling

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:01.169
