00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:20.560
One day in your life

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.480
You'll remember a place

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.900
Someone touching your face

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.930
You'll come back and you'll look

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.520
Around you

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.670
One day in your life

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.630
You'll remember the love

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.850
You found here

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:02.410
You'll remember me somehow

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.580
'Though you don't need me now

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.750
I will stay in your heart

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.650
And when things fall apart

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:25.680
You'll remember one day

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.530
One day in your life

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.110
When you find that you're

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.400
Always waiting

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:46.840
For the love we used to share

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.630
Just call my name

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.170
And I'll be there

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:35.730
&lt;Instrumental&gt;

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:44.730
You'll remember me somehow

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:50.830
'Though you don't need me now

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:56.620
I will stay in your heart

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.340
And when things fall apart

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:07.320
You'll remember one day

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:11.660
One day in your life

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.820
When you find that you're

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:19.480
Always lonely

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:28.780
For the love we used to share

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.690
Just call my name

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:42.800
And I'll be there
