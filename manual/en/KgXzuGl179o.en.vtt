Hi, sorry, we were just busy practising the final combat.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.300
 Hello, I'm Yohan Faure,  director of «&nbsp;The Fall of Men&nbsp;».

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.640
Hi I'm Vianney Griffon, the art director on the project.

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.040
At the moment we are full swing in the post production,

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:42.300
  as you can imagine, turning the world of dragon ball z into a film is a quite a hand full.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.000
Yep, there is actually a lot of work and it is very time consuming,

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.260
There are five of us working on it at the moment doing :   

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.140
the music, the sound, the editing, the visual effects,

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:56.540
a lot of work and we wanted to have it released by the end of sping 2014.

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.520
Well that's out 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.880
Looks that way ! We are going to have to postpone it. 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.780
 But don't worry, we still have something for show to keep you waiting 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.840
Yeah at first we weren't really into the idea of showing anything before the release.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:12.800
We wanted to keep it all secret so that the film would really be a surprise. 

00:01:13.263 --> 00:01:16.303
It isn't great making a teaser for a film that lasts 20 minutes.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.880
Oh but I thought you were going to say it's like an anime.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.900
Ah no, I forgot.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.620
Nevermind, well anyway it's like an anime.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:25.620
Like a 20 minutes anime. 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.340
An episode? 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.300
Of 20 minutes.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.260
But an anime is 26!

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.080
 A bit longer, it's around 20 minutes and this one will be around that duration.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.920
 Let's turn a page of the script.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.740
Yeah because we wrote stuff!

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.180
So even so, we wanted to share with you the way we see DBZ 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.240
and go beyond the test footage you saw before.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.540
The real teaser and the real shots, you're about to see them very soon!

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.060
We hope you like it!

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:59.300
We want to thank everyone involved on the project with us.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.360
We wich to thank our family and friends for supporting us everyday!

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.520
We want to thank the fans from the Facebook Page.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.000

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.000
And a big thanks to all the contributors of the indiegogo campaign.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:19.040
