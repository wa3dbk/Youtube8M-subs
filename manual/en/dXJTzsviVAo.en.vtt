compelled an entire
country to act.

began on March 18

Taiwan's parliament

00:00:19.724 --> 00:00:21.390

agreement with China.

17, one single congressmen

passed that agreement

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.146
of peaceful protesters took
to the streets of Taipei

00:00:35.146 --> 00:00:37.950
to demand a deliberation over
any trade agreement with China.

are making history in Taiwan,

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.650

so important and so essential

of the House offered

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:53.890
to set up a mechanism
for public oversight

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.040

trade talks with China.
