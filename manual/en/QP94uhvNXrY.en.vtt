Hi, I'm Scott Reil and behalf of expertvillage.com
I like to talk to you about perennials gardens.

00:00:06.669 --> 00:00:10.830
When designing in a sunnier area there is
a pretty wide pallets of plants to use and

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.980
you can really lean hard into the flower power.
Now depending on what kind of soil you have

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.269
you might want to go with more rock garden
plants which tend to do well in dry areas.

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:26.460
Plants like this little Dianthus here just
do a famous job in that drier, sandier areas.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.449
This corner of my garden you see the most
sun just about anywhere so it was a perfect

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.290
spot for this Dianthus and the smell on this
thing is just great. It is wonderful to smell

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.600
that lovely smell as you come around the corner.
Other plants do really well in sunny areas

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.140
are plants like Aster, this is a native nova-angliae
aster, it gets a wonderful red flower. Shasta

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:55.290
daisies, Shasta daisies do really well in
sunny areas. Nepeta loves in those hot dry,

00:00:55.290 --> 00:01:02.760
baking kind of sunny spots. And here is another
iris we have already seen the bigger German

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.640
iris, this is Japanese iris and these would
do well in either a sunny area or a partially

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:14.490
shaded area. Another plant that I love in
a sunny area is lavender and the smell on

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.441
lavender is just wonderful. You can see this
one is just starting to bud up and start to

00:01:18.441 --> 00:01:23.490
get ready on its own. This is kind of a neat;
one it is a white flower form that you don't

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:30.869
see to often. But again when you are working
with plants in a sunny area think about how

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.109
much sun you are getting, think about it realistically.
If it is not getting sun between 10 and 2

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:41.340
then it is probably not a full sun area you
should probably be looking at plants for partial

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:49.319
sunny areas. But in those really hot dry areas
succulence, like seeders can be a really boom

00:01:49.319 --> 00:01:54.179
to you and again those rock garden plants
to you things like Dianthus. Things like Silphium

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:56.450
they are going to do well in areas.
