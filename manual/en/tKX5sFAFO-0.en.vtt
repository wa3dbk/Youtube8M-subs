00:00:03.989 --> 00:00:09.030
Alright today at SEMA I covered the common
repair myths with aluminum repairs.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.280
So I really want to archive today is trying
to dispel some other some the hyper some of

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.900
the myths that are out there concerning aluminum
repairs.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.390
For example a lot of people that think that
you can't put body filler directly on aluminum

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.289
panels which isn't true.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.160
Use the correct body fillers premium fillers
others no problem all fillers that that we

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.160
use.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.029
For example are tested on different substrates
such as aluminum some the other things I discussed

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:36.870
was the necessity of corrosion protection
on aluminum.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.290
A lot of people mistakenly think because it's
aluminum it doesn't rust that you don't need

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.760
corrosion protection but there are a number
of types of corrosion that can occur even

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.010
on aluminum panels.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.920
A couple the other things I talked about were
properly fixed during structural panels offsetting

00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.489
rivets and temporary rivets in place so that
as you bond and rivet panels together that

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:07.080
the panels don't move and elongate holes or
set the rivets incorrectly.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.350
So in general the program is about solving
some other problems.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.619
Talking about how aluminum is different and
steel why that's important to repairs for

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.369
technicians how to deal with some of those
differences.

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:26.399
And of again trying to bring some of the level
hype down that it's a different substrate

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:30.070
bought it's not the end of the world when
we start work on aluminum.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:35.619
The shops will go through that learning curve
but eventually it'll be an easy process.

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:43.020
So the one demonstration I did was to show
how aluminum could be easily misshapen or

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.380
panels can be destroyed if proper repair techniques
are not use.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.600
So what I did was took our small piece of
aluminum coupon and placed on a model dolly

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.170
and took a hammer and hammer right onto the
to the aluminum panel with the dolly directly

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.369
behind it.

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:04.219
What happens when you do that is because the
aluminum's softer material actually stretch

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:10.399
kinda pancake I'll that coupon where when
you when you go to bend that it will have

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.420
an oil can in there where you can pop out
because that material has stretched out.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.560
So the proper technique is to use the dolly
next to the repair area instead of directly

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.560
behind it.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.970
So that was my demonstration today.

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:25.440
So that was a summary for today's program
hope everybody enjoyed it.
