00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.890
Earth, gone.

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.520
The human race, pretty much destroyed.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.940
Send in the clones!

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.929
It's time to repopulate the species among
the stars; to create a clone based utopia.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.840
First up, let us preface this review with
a warning.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.689
This is a true freemium title.

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.750
Many of the actions in this game take time
to complete (up to a few minutes worth).

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.619
All the time based actions can be sped up
by using the utopium resource which is the

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:28.939
in-app currency.

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.610
Despite this, Pixel People strives to give
you things to do so you aren't actually waiting

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.610
around.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.750
Whether it succeeds in this goal is another
story all-together.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.620
The meat of the game is a clone creation system
that carries a Pokemon-esque 'gotta catch

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.620
em all' component.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.460
You are given a clean slate clone, and using
the professions already at your disposal,

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.890
you try to create new people that can help
run your metropolis.

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.210
Often these new clones have specific buildings
to operate in that need to be placed on the

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.960
map, and to get a clean clone in the first
place, you need to make sure there is suitable

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.450
housing available.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.570
Each building on the map will give you money
at regular intervals, and the more people

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.230
that occupy them, the more money they will
give.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.830
Once two or more occupy a building, romance
can occur in which you have to hold down a

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.160
heart till the heart meter is full, and once
the heart bar is filled up completely bonuses

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.930
are awarded (on top of the random money rewards
that pop up around your city, to give you

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:17.580
yet another thing to tap on when you're waiting
around).

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.500
Land can be upgraded as before long you'll
find yourself running out of room, and often

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.640
your workers will idle and the building will
have to be tapped on to get them to resume

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.570
their money collection duties.

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.950
The game has an isometric perspective that
sometimes makes it hard to tap on the right

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:33.900
building, but the pixel art is enjoyable and
you gain a certain level of satisfaction in

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.140
watching your city grow.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.700
There doesn't seem to be much reason to plan
your city in any fashion (aside from aesthetics),

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.520
so feel free to plonk your buildings down
where-ever you like, but the more detail oriented

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.380
of you will make use of the roads to separate
your homes from let's say the construction

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.060
yard or city hall.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.280
And special mention does need to be given
to the music which creates a certain hustle

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.490
and bustle, but does so in relaxing tones.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.560
Truth be told, with all the bonuses, idling
workers, and the romance going on (as well

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.479
as crafting your city), the tedium associated
with waiting around for clones to arrive or

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.200
buildings to finish is cut down, but not eradicated.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.989
Just the idea that you need to wait around
to continue your game or pay money is a pretty

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.319
abominable concept to many gamers no matter
how well the idea is streamlined, but for

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.499
those of you who enjoy this style of game,
there is a solid sense of progression, and

00:02:19.499 --> 00:02:23.050
the clone creation system is pretty addictive,
as you combine pairs and see what you're going

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.050
to get.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.629
As freemium titles go, Pixel People isn't
half bad, and that's about all you can say

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:36.019
really.
