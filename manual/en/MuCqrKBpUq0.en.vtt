step by step instruction on how to draw this

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.210
glorious nerd.........Just pause the video
at the end of each step and follow the instructions

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:22.590
and I will show you how to crack the art geek
algorithm. Step 1: This is where nerds store

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.890
their smarts. In this caricature, we are going
to make the top of the head slightly larger

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:33.710
in proportion to the bottom of the head. Take
your time and draw these three shapes as accurately

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:41.370
as possible. Step 2: According to Charles
Darwin, nerd eyes and ears have mutated over

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.050
time to enhance the nerds senses for activities
such as shopping at Radio Shack and watching

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.510
Star Wars. The eyes and ears are very important
to this caricature. Make the glasses and ears

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.920
oversized, compared to the bottom of the face.
Usually the ears will be as long as the length

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.449
from the top of the eyes to the bottom of
the nose, but we are ignoring that rule in

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.299
this drawing and making them identical to
the height of the glasses. Dont forget the

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:16.409
eyebrow shapes above the glasses. Step 3:
Draw the nose shape and the wrinkle lines......

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:22.610
Then, complete the outline of the face. Make
sure that you keep the bottom of the face

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:31.630
smaller than the top. Step 4: Draw a half
circle for the mouth. Then add the details.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:40.479
Here is a close up. Step 5: Add the lines
to separate the teeth. For a realistic portrait,

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:49.930
you dont want to go dark between each tooth....but....
For this caricature, it is ok. Step 6: Draw

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:55.909
in the braces. Please note that the braces
are just small rectangles over each tooth,

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:04.810
connected by wire. Step 7: Draw in the eyes.
Notice that they are close to the upper frames

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:13.510
of the glasses. Try to draw exactly what you
see here. Step 8: Draw in the pattern for

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.370
the hair. Dont stress, there is no way that
you will get these lines perfect. Close enough

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:46.989
is ok. I will show you a cool trick in the
next part. This is part 2 of my tutorial on
