00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:02.880
"The Grasshopper and the Ants" 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.920
An Aesop's Fable with a focus on vocabulary.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:13.400
One warm spring day, a grasshopper was
playing in a grassy green field

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.860
when he noticed a line of ants marching
along carrying some seeds.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.560
"Where you going with that big load?"

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.120
the grasshopper asked one of them. 

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:27.280
"We're taking these seeds to our nest," 
squeaked the ant.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:30.930
"But it's such a beautiful day," said the
grasshopper.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.640
"Come and have fun with me."

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.040
"No," said the ant. "I think you should come
work with us.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.220
it's going to be a long winter with lots of snow.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.110
You had better start storing your food now!"

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.760
"Why worry about the winter? It's only spring, and there is lots of food everywhere,"

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.379
said the grasshopper as he chewed on a
large blade of grass.

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.710
All through the spring the grasshopper
did nothing except

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.509
eat, and sleep, and play. He became quite fat.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.750
One day, during the summer,

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:13.000
the grasshopper saw the long line of ants again. They were all carrying grains of wheat.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.840
"Where you going with all that wheat?" the grasshopper asked.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.360
"We are taking it to our nest to save for
winter," said one of the ants.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.860
"You should gather some wheat, too." 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.510
It's going to be a long winter with lots
of snow."

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.200
"I have all the food that I need right
now," 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:37.270
said the grasshopper. "Why worry about
winter?

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:40.570
It's still summer!"

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:43.799
All summer, the grasshopper did nothing
but eat, sleep, and play. 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.170
 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.659
He became even fatter!

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.570
One day, the grasshopper noticed that leaves were falling from the trees. 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.340
Autumn had come! Among the leaves

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.070
he again saw the long line of ants all
carrying

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.650
kernels of corn. "Where you going with
that corn?" the grasshopper asked one of the ants.

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.700
The ant replied,

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.700
"We are taking it to our nest to save for
winter. You should gather some corn, too.

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.460
It's going to be a long winter with lots
of snow."

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.900
"That's too much work," said the grasshopper.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.090
"Winter is not here yet, and when it comes, 

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:32.370
I am sure I will be able to find some food."

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.880
A few weeks later, winter came, and the
snow began to fall. 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.160
Just as the ants predicted, the snow
was very deep.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:44.160
This was not a problem for the ants,
though.

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.470
They were all snug in their nest with
lots of good food to eat.

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.040
The grasshopper, however,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:57.650
had trouble finding food. He was very
hungry and very miserable all winter.

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.630
By the time winter had ended,

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.830
the grasshopper had learned a valuable
lesson:

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.140
It is important to prepare for the future.

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:14.770
Moral of the Story: Work today for what you will need tomorrow.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.770
The End
