00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.389
Today we're talking about prosthetic pieces.

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:14.509
What we've used for this makeup guide is the
fake nose and the chin, spirit gum (which

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:19.970
comes with its own brush), and remover. You
will need the remover.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:26.970
We've also used water-based face paint, a
powder puff or piece of cotton wool, some

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.280
talcum powder, and of course you'll need a
sponge. So it really is simple.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.500
Let's see how it's done.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:43.040
To start sticking the pieces, we need to know
where we want to put the glue on the skin.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.360
Slide the nose into place, and you can see
it wants to stay there. Then with talcum powder,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.360
or any kind of powder on a pad, press it into
the skin around the edge of the piece. Then,

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:05.870
when you take the piece away, you have a line
where you need to apply the glue.

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:13.259
Apply the glue just to the edge of the piece,
and just inside the line. We're going to remove

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.520
the powder later when it's dry; we're only
using it as a guide for where to stick it.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:35.820
When the glue goes on it feels like water
- you'll believe that it'll never stick anything...

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.820
but you're wrong. Wait until both sides of
the glue become tacky, and then put the piece

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.620
in place and hold it down.

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.810
Using the powder, mark all the way around
the chin piece. Apply glue to the thin edges

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.790
only, and to your skin, wait until they're
both tacky, and stick the chin in place.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.640
Give the pieces a few moments to dry, and
then paint your face. We're using a water-based

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.060
makeup, and applying with a slightly damp
sponge.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.379
Squeeze the paint out on to a plate, and use
the plate like an artist's palette. If you

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:27.670
wish, you can add shading, lipstick, or even
eyelashes, once the paint is dry. But, for

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.349
the purposes of this demonstration we're concentrating
on the prosthetics only.

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:38.620
Ensure that you take the makeup down below
the collar line, and then when you do up your

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.620
costume you won't get a line of pink. Take
the makeup into the hairline or across the

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:55.359
ears if they're going to show. In our case,
we don't have to worry about that.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:14.319
When you've finished having a good time, take
off your wig and then remove the pieces. The

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:20.129
spirit gum is designed for your skin, but
whatever you do don't just rip it off!

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:27.129
Take a piece of cotton wool and soak it in
the spirit gum remover. Lift the edge of the

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:34.489
piece and then work along with the remover,
lifting the piece away from the skin until

00:03:38.309 --> 00:03:45.309
it falls away. Clean the glued edges with
remover, give the piece a wash, powder it

00:03:51.809 --> 00:03:58.809
lightly with talcum powder and put it back
in the box, and it'll last for years.

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:14.189
This is water-based makeup, so we can wash
it away with soap and water - and that's all

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:28.490
there is to it.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.630
Come back soon and see what else we've got
in store for you.
