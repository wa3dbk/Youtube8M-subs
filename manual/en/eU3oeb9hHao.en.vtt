Setting up an enclosure for an aquatic turtle
and taking care of it properly, before you're

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.630
able to do that, you need to know what species
you're dealing with, and what its natural

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.200
environment would be like.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:24.520
There are over 285 species of turtles in the
world, and they all have very different behaviors

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.660
and requirements.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.360
The first thing of course that most people
thing of when setting up an aquatic enclosure

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:34.739
would be a fish tank of some sort, and this
is pretty standard when you first purchase

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.230
a small or young aquatic turtle.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:45.230
Often aquatic turtles, though, grow, and after
five or more years, you can end up outgrowing

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:52.350
your average size fish tank, and you may need
to upgrade into a larger plastic storage bin,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.900
or even some type of outdoor enclosure.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.940
When you have an aquatic set up, obviously
water quality is very important.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.309
You want the water to be of an adequate depth
for the turtle to swim, and submerge itself

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.360
and be able to exercise.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.890
Generally we're looking at heating the water.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.030
There are water heaters that can be purchased
that go inside the tank.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.270
You're also looking at, generally, water filtration.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.430
Turtles are messy, and it will be very difficult,
especially with a larger tank, to be changing

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.780
the water everyday, which we need to do without
a filter.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.600
All aquatic turtles generally still require
the ability to come out onto a land area and

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.070
bask.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.549
So this is where they come out, they warm
themselves up generally in their natural environment

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:46.500
under the sun, but in a captive environment
we often provide them with special lighting

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.080
and heat.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:57.060
So the most common are incandescent bulbs
and obviously our UVB producing bulbs.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.380
Aquatic turtles should still be provided with
a source of ultraviolet light, and a good

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.030
heat and basking source.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:12.470
Many aquatic turtles are omnivorous, meaning
that they eat both animal and plant matter.

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:18.480
Again, you want to look up what your species
of turtle is, and make sure you get the diet

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.480
correct.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:24.310
There are my types of commercial foods for
aquatic turtles, they can also be supplemented

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.569
with things like small fish, crayfish, snails,
and aquatic plants.
