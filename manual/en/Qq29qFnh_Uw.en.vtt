00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.310
Hey hi, I'm Tim Gipson. I'm going to talk
to you about how to repair a ceiling fan.

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.940
Now, ceiling fans are pretty much maintenance
free with a couple of exceptions. Now, if

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:17.699
your ceiling fan is not working at all it's
probably something extensive to do as far

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.099
as the brushes or in the motor. And typically,
if it's not coming on at all, and it's not

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.710
a; if you've checked your circuit breaker
and your circuit breaker's fine, and it's

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.949
just not running, and you know it's got power
to it it's probably a good time just to replace

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:36.251
your ceiling fan. The cost of repairing a
ceiling fan if it has something to do with

00:00:36.251 --> 00:00:40.940
the motor is going to be more, it's going
to be cost prohibitive compared to just buying

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.250
a new ceiling fan. Now, something that is
easy to fix and repair on your ceiling fan

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.400
is a lot of times what we run into is our
ceiling fan, as it's running, will start wobbling

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.040
back and forth. And what that means is that
means that your blades have gotten out of

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.970
balance; you have one blade, or maybe two
blades that are heavier than the others. So,

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.500
how we determine that is what you want to
do is take a ruler, and you can place it up

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.899
here on your ceiling, and then what we'll
do is we'll measure this first blade, and

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:22.049
this first blade is sittin' at ten and three
quarters. And then, we'll rotate to the next

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:36.530
blade. That one's at ten and three quarters.
Now, this one's at eleven, this one's at eleven,

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:42.920
and this one's at eleven, so actually I've
got, in this particular ceiling fan I've got

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:49.810
three blades that are at eleven, and I've
got two blades that are at ten and three quarters.

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:57.530
So, if that was causin', and that's most likely
what will cause the fans to oscillate is when

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.139
you have a couple blades like that. So, these
three blades over here are heavier. These

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:06.579
three blades are actually lighter because
the ceiling fan is sittin' down. So, what

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:11.690
we want to do is we want to add a little weight
to the top of these blades to balance em'

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:19.060
out. And how we can do that is just take a
penny, and take a penny at a time and we would

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:24.700
tape those, either using regular tape or a
double stick tape works very good, to the

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.890
top of these two blades. So, we start out
with one penny, and then again, let it rotate

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:37.440
a couple times, and then come back and measure.
And what you want to do is you want to add

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:44.700
the pennies to the blades that are higher
until all the blades, when you go around,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:49.870
they're all at the same height. So once you
do that; you have your fan blade, they're

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:56.490
all balanced out, and then you should eliminate
any wobble whatsoever in your ceiling fan.

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.621
So, I'm Tim Gipson, and that's how to fix
a ceiling fan.
