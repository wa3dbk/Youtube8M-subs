00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.830
Now we're going to talk about the profession
herbalism. Herbalism is one of the thirteen

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.839
professions in the World of Warcraft, three
are secondary skills, ten are regular professions,

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:17.180
and this time we're going to talk about herbalism.
Herbalism is very much like what it sounds.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:22.190
When you have a garden in the real world or
whatever, and you grow flowers and plants

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.640
and things that have different properties,
you know, you eat fruits and vegetables, and

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.930
you have herbs to spice up your chili and
so forth. Well, there's herbalism in the World

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:40.320
of Warcraft as well. What it is, is basically
gathering resources from the woods and the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.780
swamps and things. Much like an herbalist
would do in the real world. You will find

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.760
flowers and plants and things that have special
properties, and you pick them. The reason

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.140
you would do this is not only do you sell
these things to people who want to use them

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.010
for other professions, but you can use them
for your other professions as well. Herbs

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.780
can be combined to make potions, and those
potions can be used to like in many fantasy

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.899
games, World of Warcraft is similar, now you
can make healing potions, and mana potions,

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:21.130
and things that give you special abilities,
and you need to do that in order to do a lot

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:27.350
of the, it's just a good way to get more out
of the World of Warcraft, and so what you

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.469
do is you would go get the profession herbalism,
and you would go around and you would find

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:36.039
flowers, and you would find herbs, and you
would find other plants and that sort of thing,

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:44.159
and you would pick them and then you would
use them to make potions and things. See,

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:51.670
we're picking the herb right now, we're picking
this flower, now we have the flower, and we

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.909
can sell that flower, or we can use it if
we had alchemy to make potions.
