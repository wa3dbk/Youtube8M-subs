It's obviously an icon 
for the mountain

00:00:29.534 --> 00:00:31.244
just the symbol of it

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.559
You don't have a lot of opportunity 
in life these days

00:00:37.633 --> 00:00:42.195
to have 10 or 12 minutes alone

00:00:47.008 --> 00:00:50.083
Some people think when they come here
and then ride the chair

00:00:50.083 --> 00:00:51.944
it's a lonely ride

00:00:51.996 --> 00:00:54.097
I never really thought of it that way

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:02.081
Mad River was founded by a guy named
Roland Palmedo

00:01:02.081 --> 00:01:04.049
because he wanted to start a ski area

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:07.167
where sport and not money 
was going to be the overriding concern

00:01:07.273 --> 00:01:09.968
He built the single chair here in 1948

00:01:09.968 --> 00:01:12.599
and then somebody figured out quickly
that a double chair

00:01:12.599 --> 00:01:14.953
was just as easy to build 
as the single chair

00:01:14.953 --> 00:01:16.753
The single chairs went away very quickly

00:01:16.753 --> 00:01:20.701
and this thing has hung around 
for a long time

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:43.997
You're forced to really focus
on what's going on around you

00:01:43.997 --> 00:01:44.865
to look down

00:01:44.865 --> 00:01:47.075
just watch some of the skiers having fun

00:01:47.199 --> 00:01:48.406
and when you get up there

00:01:48.406 --> 00:01:50.984
you can look across the valley 
into New York

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.492
As the ski industry changed over the years

00:02:01.492 --> 00:02:02.746
this place hasn't

00:02:02.746 --> 00:02:06.114
Everything that we do shouldn't work
but it does

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.227
There's not a lot of ski areas
in the world where

00:02:09.642 --> 00:02:11.840
the skiers are donating money 
to build the lift

00:02:17.065 --> 00:02:20.298
There's something about 
waiting in line in the corral

00:02:20.298 --> 00:02:22.634
and you're going back and forth

00:02:23.074 --> 00:02:26.450
and you're saying, "Hi people"
and you carry on multiple conversations

00:02:27.434 --> 00:02:32.090
This is the real friendly vibe that
it's not like a hashtag campaign

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.015
where we're trying to create 
a community

00:02:35.065 --> 00:02:36.447
It's already here

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:44.234
Sitting on that single chair
is like coming home
