00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:43.090
You always look up at me

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:52.060
Just like a child would

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:00.640
You’re always so blunt with your feelings, just like a cat

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:09.630
But still, you’re kind when it counts

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:27.270
You and I walk together, hand in hand

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:45.600
Matching our strides, with the sunset at our backs, as far as the road takes us

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:53.950
When I try to wrap my arms around your neck

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:03.350
I can’t reach you without stretching

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:11.720
True feelings and appearances, everything’s turned inside out

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:20.670
You keep your feelings locked away

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:38.660
Like the difference in our heights

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:56.050
The distance between us will never change

00:03:50.320 --> 00:04:07.320
You and I walk together, hand in hand

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:26.570
Matching our strides, with the sunset at our backs, as far as the road takes us
