00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.910
My name is Stanley Ingerman. I'm 66 years

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.180
old. I have peripheral vascular disease.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:20.250
The hospital that I was going to decided they
didn't know what to do with me anymore. I

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:26.960
had had several operations and the artery
in my right leg shut down again, clotted,

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.650
and I went in and they essentially told me,
"We've done everything we know how to do.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.790
We're gonna send you to Stanford."

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.520
As an academic vascular center, we take care

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:41.450
of patients with abdominal aortic aneurism
disease, carotid artery disease, venous disease,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.910
peripheral arterial ischemia, which is blockages
of the arteries in any locations.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:52.940
For arterial disease, the biggest contributor
is still smoking, smoking and diabetes. So,

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.410
Mr. Ingerman is a patient with smoking history
who had had peripheral arterial disease for

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.440
quite a number of years.

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.860
He had originally been treated with a surgical
bypass and over the ensuing seven or eight

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.579
years had multiple procedures to maintain
the circulation in his right leg.

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:16.310
We evaluated him, identified a long segment
blockage, severe compromise to his circulation

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.870
to a degree that we know that his risk of
amputation was significantly high if we didn't

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.610
do something.

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.360
Going to Stanford, just the reputation of

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.560
the, of the hospital and the school was enough
to put me at ease.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:36.020
My impression of Dr. Mel was that the man
was...great bedside manner, explained fully

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.170
what he intended to do, made sure that there
was no doubts in my mind about what was going

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.630
to happen. It made me very comfortable.

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.370
So, this, this is a CT angiogram of Mr. Ingerman

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.610
This is his right leg and this is his left
leg. The left leg, the circulation is normal.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.640
On the right leg, the main artery from the
groin, which is here to the knee, which is

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:01.610
here, is completely gone. There's no circulation
at all. So in order to improve the circulation

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.990
to his lower leg and his foot, we took a vein
from this side and plugged it into the artery

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.590
right here in the groin and then plugged it
into the artery down here below the knee so

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.700
that blood could now travel through our new
conduit and into the foot.

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.569
The hospital had me on my feet and walking

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:25.760
the next day. And, after I got home, I started
a regimen of walking for ten to fifteen minutes

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.440
after every meal, and expanded that by five
minutes a day until I got up to a half hour,

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.790
and then I started going outside.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.360
By having a successful revascularization,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:42.920
his symptoms have now resolved, he's able
to walk as much as he could beforehand without

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.690
pain and he has no limitations to his activities
of daily living and his risk of amputation

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.140
has been markedly diminished by the fact that
his circulation has been restored.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:56.470
It's been a real learning experience having

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:02.680
this happen to me. At the time that the original
clot took place, I was pre-diabetic I was

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:08.129
overweight. Now I walk thirty-five miles a
week. I watch the foods that I eat. It was

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:12.959
a wake-up call. I'm much more aware of what
my body feels like and my health from day-to-day.
