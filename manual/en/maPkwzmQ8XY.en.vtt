00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:08.570
One of the first things we want to do when
we're up and getting things together for working

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:15.429
that night is we want to prepare our lunch
bag or our snack bag. We want to make sure

00:00:15.429 --> 00:00:21.980
that while working at night, that we take
snacks that will be somewhat healthy for us

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:31.070
so we don't pick up so much weight working
at night. I love to take oranges and other

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:37.380
fruit because they're good for you, they have
natural sugars in them, and they help give

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.640
you energy, which is what you're going to
need when you get tired working at night.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:49.809
Apples also. I just pack a couple. You never
know. You may get hungry in the middle of

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:58.420
the night, and it's best to eat piece fruit
than it is to eat potato chips and other bad

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:04.180
food. I also like hot chocolate because hot
chocolate is so easy to make. All you need

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:12.229
is hot water in a cup and it's another liquid
that can give you a boost of energy. It's

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:17.159
something that I always take just in case.
You never know what you'll feel like or what

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:28.719
you'll eat or drink. This is an emergency
pack. The other things you want to pack in

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:35.120
your bag is whatever lunch you prepare for
yourself. I try not to eat very heavy at night

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:41.579
like high grease, hot dogs, hamburgers, French
fries. Those kinds of things I try not to

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.140
eat in the middle of the night. Things that
you can eat that will be great is if you make

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.340
sandwiches. Peanut butter and jelly is actually
really good on wheat bread. Have those kinds

00:01:52.340 --> 00:02:00.710
of things available. I try to eat my meal
before midnight. That's just what I try to

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.340
do and I snack the rest of the night, just
because when you're not working, your body's

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.890
not going to want to eat a whole meal in the
middle of the night. In your lunch bag, you

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.790
have all your little snacks. You can take
vegetables. Carrots with ranch dip is really

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:23.819
good and it's so convenient and it's a great
snack. Whatever else you like to snack on

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:32.069
that may be healthy and your lunch, whatever
you're going to eat for that night. Go ahead

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.920
and pack your lunch for your night schedule.
