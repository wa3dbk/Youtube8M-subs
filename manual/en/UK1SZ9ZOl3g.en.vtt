"Chronic Headaches and Pork Tapeworms"

00:00:07.403 --> 00:00:10.958
Neurocysticercosis 
is the infection

00:00:10.958 --> 00:00:14.639
of the human central nervous 
system by pork tapeworm larvae.

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.393
Little baby pork tapeworms 
invading one's brain

00:00:18.393 --> 00:00:21.804
has become an increasingly
important emerging infection

00:00:21.804 --> 00:00:27.329
in the United States and it is the 
 #1 cause of epilepsy in the world.

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.228
It is the most common parasitic 
disease of the human brain

00:00:31.228 --> 00:00:34.973
and used to be only found 
throughout the developing world

00:00:34.973 --> 00:00:37.337
—with the exception of 
Muslim countries of course—

00:00:37.337 --> 00:00:39.926
but that all changed 
about 30 years ago

00:00:39.926 --> 00:00:43.302
and now it's increasingly found 
throughout North America.

00:00:43.302 --> 00:00:47.808
Besides seizures, the pork 
parasites may actually trigger

00:00:47.808 --> 00:00:52.381
brain tumors, 
cause an aneurysm,

00:00:52.381 --> 00:00:56.460
or psychiatric manifestations 
like depression,

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.860
but who wouldn't be depressed 
having worms in their brain?

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.192
Can also result 
in dementia,

00:01:02.192 --> 00:01:06.026
but the good news is 
with deworming drugs

00:01:06.026 --> 00:01:07.240
it's often 
reversible.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.353
Only rarely do you have 
to open one’s skull

00:01:11.353 --> 00:01:13.525
and extract the 
larvae surgically.

00:01:13.525 --> 00:01:16.254
Once they get into 
your eyeballs though

00:01:16.254 --> 00:01:19.063
you really do have to 
remove them, dead or alive.

00:01:19.063 --> 00:01:22.354
I've talked about 
pork tapeworms before,

00:01:22.354 --> 00:01:24.494
but what's new is 
that we now know that

00:01:24.494 --> 00:01:27.395
they may present as 
chronic headaches—

00:01:27.395 --> 00:01:29.443
either migraines or so-called 
tension headaches—

00:01:29.443 --> 00:01:33.163
even when the worms 
in your head are dead.

00:01:33.163 --> 00:01:35.096
What they think is 
happening is that

00:01:35.096 --> 00:01:37.996
our body tries to chip away 
at their calcified bodies

00:01:37.996 --> 00:01:41.710
and it may release bits of them 
into the rest of our brain

00:01:41.714 --> 00:01:45.350
causing inflammation that could 
be contributing to headaches.

00:01:45.353 --> 00:01:46.550
Now it's still rare,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.060
and even if you live 
in an endemic area,

00:01:50.065 --> 00:01:53.590
you can avoid getting infested with 
an adult tapeworm in the first place

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.630
by cooking pork 
thoroughly,

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:58.360
but what does that 
mean exactly?

00:01:58.362 --> 00:02:02.560
Well, first of all it's found 
in some parts of pig carcasses

00:02:02.562 --> 00:02:04.130
more than others and...

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:06.360
you can freeze the 
little suckers to death,

00:02:06.363 --> 00:02:09.090
no matter how infested 
the muscles are

00:02:09.098 --> 00:02:12.830
by storing pork cut up into 
small pieces for a month

00:02:12.836 --> 00:02:15.090
at subzero 
temperatures,

00:02:15.093 --> 00:02:18.260
and then cook the meat 
for more than 2 hours.

00:02:18.263 --> 00:02:21.180
That is one well-done 
pork chop.

00:02:21.187 --> 00:02:24.130
The New England Journal of 
Medicine recently featured

00:02:24.133 --> 00:02:27.920
a case of some guy who must have had 
thousands of pork tapeworm larvae

00:02:28.328 --> 00:02:29.850
wriggling through 
his muscles—

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:31.700
see all those little 
white streaks?

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.440
Each one is a 
baby tape worm.

00:02:35.444 --> 00:02:39.400
But that's why you can 
get infected by pork,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.800
since it gets 
in the muscles.

00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:43.840
So cannibals might want to 
cook for two hours too.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.200
Not all parasites are associated 
with meat, though.

00:02:48.205 --> 00:02:52.270
An anxious but healthy 
32-year-old physician

00:02:52.273 --> 00:02:54.620
presented to the 
family medicine clinic

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:57.880
with a sample of suspected 
parasites from his stools,

00:02:57.884 --> 00:03:01.500
which had been retrieved from 
the toilet that same day.

00:03:01.503 --> 00:03:03.710
And... here they are.

00:03:03.714 --> 00:03:05.640
Look to be about 
an inch long.

00:03:05.646 --> 00:03:07.710
He had previously 
traveled to India,

00:03:07.717 --> 00:03:09.770
had Chinese food 
the night before—

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:11.400
who knows what they were...

00:03:11.404 --> 00:03:13.330
maybe it was 
hookworms?

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:17.860
The sample was sent to the microbiology 
laboratory for analysis.

00:03:17.862 --> 00:03:22.330
Later that day, the microbiology 
physician called to report

00:03:22.338 --> 00:03:25.100
positive identification 
of Vigna radiata

00:03:25.106 --> 00:03:29.730
previously known as Phaseolus aureus, 
in the stool sample,

00:03:29.738 --> 00:03:33.800
or in common parlance, 
a bean sprout.

00:03:33.805 --> 00:03:35.550
They were bean sprouts!

00:03:35.558 --> 00:03:39.500
"The patient was called 
and gently but firmly"

00:03:39.507 --> 00:03:41.250
"informed of the diagnosis."

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.590
"Given the nature of 
the identified specimen,"

00:03:43.594 --> 00:03:46.900
"the information was presented in a 
non-judgmental, respectful manner"

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.130
"so as not to offend the sensibilities 
or sensitivities of the patient."

00:03:51.137 --> 00:03:55.680
Their parting advice to fellow 
physicians in cases of this nature

00:03:55.686 --> 00:04:00.000
would be as follows: "as comical 
as the findings might seem"

00:04:00.005 --> 00:04:05.090
"try not to laugh!"
