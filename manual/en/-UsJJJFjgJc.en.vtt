00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:05.666
- I am a tea taster and blender

00:00:05.666 --> 00:00:08.499
and I spend a lot of my
time trying to produce

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:09.999
the perfect blend.

00:00:11.439 --> 00:00:13.051
But why do I bother?

00:00:13.051 --> 00:00:14.812
Why do we blend teas at all?

00:00:14.812 --> 00:00:17.517
Why not just leave them
as nature intended them,

00:00:17.517 --> 00:00:21.909
as the skill of the factory
manager intended them?

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:25.847
The answer is that sometimes
we want to appreciate the tea

00:00:25.847 --> 00:00:29.049
as a variable product that, like wine,

00:00:29.049 --> 00:00:32.305
varies with the land it was produced on

00:00:32.305 --> 00:00:34.212
with the weather that
has been experienced,

00:00:34.212 --> 00:00:37.629
with the quality of the pluck, et cetera.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.972
But more often than not, we
want our tea to taste the same.

00:00:42.972 --> 00:00:47.413
When you go into the supermarket
and buy your favourite blend

00:00:47.413 --> 00:00:50.060
you want it always to taste the same.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:54.348
If you run a cafe and you
become known for your tea

00:00:54.348 --> 00:00:56.863
you want it always to taste the same.

00:00:56.863 --> 00:00:59.858
Sometimes, the tea I buy is fantastic.

00:00:59.858 --> 00:01:03.089
Sometimes, it's not possible
to buy the same quality

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.214
and we need to try and average
out those inconsistencies

00:01:06.214 --> 00:01:08.723
and produce a single named blend

00:01:08.723 --> 00:01:11.140
that people can always enjoy.

00:01:12.786 --> 00:01:15.532
That's not to say that we shouldn't also

00:01:15.532 --> 00:01:18.865
sell teas on their own as what they are.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:23.113
I, for example, often sell
tea from the Holyrood Estate

00:01:23.113 --> 00:01:26.863
in Sri Lanka which is a favourite of mine.

00:01:26.863 --> 00:01:30.062
And we do that, too,
but generally speaking,

00:01:30.062 --> 00:01:33.189
we want to blend teas to
smooth out the variations

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:35.861
and produce one standard
blend that people,

00:01:35.861 --> 00:01:38.605
be that consumers or cafes or whatever,

00:01:38.605 --> 00:01:42.483
can rely upon for doing the
job that it's supposed to do.

00:01:42.483 --> 00:01:44.882
Portsmouth tea, for
example, Hampshire tea,

00:01:44.882 --> 00:01:47.180
you know, my two main blends,

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.065
people know what they taste like

00:01:49.065 --> 00:01:51.709
and they want them to
always taste the same.

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:53.729
Now, that's easier said than done

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.846
and it involves tasting
hundreds of different teas,

00:01:56.846 --> 00:02:00.327
buying some of them and
then tasting them again

00:02:00.327 --> 00:02:03.365
and blending them in varying proportions

00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:06.708
always to produce the same result.

00:02:06.708 --> 00:02:10.045
It's like the number game
on the Countdown show

00:02:10.045 --> 00:02:12.211
with Carol Vorderman.

00:02:12.211 --> 00:02:14.946
You know the number that
you want to end up with,

00:02:14.946 --> 00:02:17.575
but what goes into it changes

00:02:17.575 --> 00:02:20.867
and you have to try and
combine those numbers correctly

00:02:20.867 --> 00:02:24.013
to produce the right result.

00:02:24.013 --> 00:02:27.014
The real challenge is
that we don't always know

00:02:27.014 --> 00:02:29.950
the result either when we're
developing a new blend.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.463
We don't always know what
we want to end up with

00:02:32.463 --> 00:02:34.271
so we end up with two unknowns

00:02:34.271 --> 00:02:37.038
and it's a very interesting
game and that's what I spend

00:02:37.038 --> 00:02:39.099
quite a large part of my time doing.
