President Obama:
I just want to thank the business owners, as well

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.300
as the Mayor, and the
Governor and First Lady

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.400
for talking with Thad and myself.

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.700
As you can see, this
is a spectacular beach.

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.133
We've got Missy, who is the
owner of a wonderful inn,

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:19.500
the Edgewater Inn and,
George (sic), he's got

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.266
a great restaurant -- what's
the name of the restaurant?

00:00:21.266 --> 00:00:22.533
Mr. Weinberg:
The Blow Fly Inn.

00:00:22.533 --> 00:00:27.867
President Obama:
And Missy was mentioning she
has already seen a 40 percent

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:33.900
drop in her occupancy
since this crisis occurred,

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.533
partly because of cancellations
of large groups that were

00:00:36.533 --> 00:00:38.000
planning to stay there.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.667
It just gives you a sense -- and
those folks who were going to

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:44.033
stay at Missy's would have
been eating at George's (sic),

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:47.100
so it gives you a sense of
the kind of potential economic

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.834
impact that a crisis like
this could have on individual

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:53.834
business owners.

00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:55.900
And, obviously, they've got to
make payroll and they've got

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:58.800
employees -- it trickles
down and has an impact on

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.633
them as well.

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:05.233
So we are going to be working
with business owners like this,

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:08.900
with governors and mayors to
make sure that they are made

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.867
whole as a consequence
of this crisis.

00:01:11.867 --> 00:01:15.867
But we also want to make
sure that we are in this

00:01:15.867 --> 00:01:17.600
for the long haul.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.000
And the full effects of this
may not be known immediately.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.166
They may not be known three
months from now and may not

00:01:28.166 --> 00:01:31.700
be fully known for another
six months or a year.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.333
We just want to make sure we
got structure in place so that

00:01:34.333 --> 00:01:39.433
people like Missy and George
(sic) are adequately dealt with.

00:01:39.433 --> 00:01:44.467
That's going to be a top topic
of mine when I meet with BP

00:01:44.467 --> 00:01:46.000
officials on Wednesday.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.967
And so I just want to say
how much I appreciate them

00:01:48.967 --> 00:01:51.567
sharing these stories.

00:01:51.567 --> 00:01:53.200
All right? Thank you, everybody.
