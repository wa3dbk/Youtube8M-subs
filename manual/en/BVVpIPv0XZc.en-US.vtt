00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.110
let's talk about GM may have been in the
news a lot lately and generally not for

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.390
good reasons and

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.429
it continues they are recalling 2.4

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:13.950
million vehicles to fix or separate
think it was this comes right on the

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.650
heels of just recalling 2.6 million cars

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.369
a earlier this year I had last week they
recalled had five separate recall

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.670
up for over 3 million vehicles so over
1.3

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:32.940
million Buick Enclave Chevy Traverse GMC
Acadia both sides crossover SUV is

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.969
from 2009 2:14 and Saturn Outlook from
2009-2010

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.739
I we've got over a million vehicles that
were added on April 29th recall to fix a

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:44.829
transmission ship

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.840
indicator cable back and wherein failed
to indicate the correct here

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:53.399
and then there were a Chevy Malibu is
from 2004-2008

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.590
Saturn Aura is Pontiac g6 I meet a
target stuff

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:02.219
and just one would you want to get the
fax was the prime

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.240
save the lap belt cables can wear out
due to people moving around while

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.100
wearing the belt

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.400
GM told dealers they can't sell new or
used version to be a cause

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.640
until they are repaired so basically

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.659
GM at this point in 2014 has 20

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.990
nine recall your own this year this has
been bailed out GM accords

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.080
I am I think that's where the NPS place
to start I

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.890
resorted to only and only yes I own a

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.140
a link in which is owned by Ford are
yeah which falls under Ford

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.900
but this is a really disaster story not
just because of all the different

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:40.860
recalls but

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.229
the reason why now you're seeing apply
to recalls from General Motors is

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.030
because

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.110
they had to pay a hefty fine ball not
really that have to be biking on break

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.100
now that Mary five billion that yes
thirty five million dollars

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.719
just give me a sense of how ridiculously
little that is they made

00:01:56.719 --> 00:02:00.450
$37 billion dollars in the first quarter
this year

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.680
so that was like paying a parking fine
is one lawmaker pointed

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.740
arm and the issue was over this

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.900
ignition switch law and apparently being
new to RB ignition switch claw

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.670
a decade prior to actually acknowledging
it

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.830
right and so they didn't do recall when
they found out that this what happened

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:21.760
and as a result

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.020
there were 13 deaths the ignition with
switch off

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.410
which meant that their power steering
would go out there breaks would go out

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.410
air bags would work with the crash your
air bags would work I mean that the

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.489
complete and utter disaster and for a
company to know that this was going on

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.310
for ten years

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:39.400
and they didn't do the recall is
absolutely egregious

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.110
and then to add insult to injury they're
fine is so minimal

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.540
now they're gonna face a bunch a similar
issues a budget civil cases

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.599
and they're gonna have to pay out more
money as a result of that but again they

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:51.840
got laid off pretty easy considering

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.640
what they did yeah they're going to take
a $400 million dollar charge against

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.720
their first quarter or

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.790
earnings for all these recalls which is
double what they had done

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.530
for the five previous recalls I am don't
give me this is a

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.239
is not be surprised be company their
cover up stuff and then they're gonna

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:09.970
pay it off

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.209
and you know at the end of the day
somehow we paper that not surprise I

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.430
mean this is dis is corporate culture
Dave this is a book in fact the arm

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.400
you know there are the culture at at
general motors at that time to be

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.970
profitable at all costs in fact they're
even going to the supplier's

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:28.560
and saying okay well you know that
contract we have you have to we're gonna

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:29.980
pay you half as much

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:33.150
and you start to deliver so they work
incredibly

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:37.480
you know squeezing their suppliers and
also culture of you know if there's a

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.390
problem here

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:42.230
don't tell us yeah that was the call to
Reggio yet to get into that

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.060
to the don't tell us apart what they
were really didn't what was their

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.799
employees talking about this stuff

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:51.299
so they sent out a list of over 60 words
and phrases that they didn't want their

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:53.349
employees emailing about we got a couple

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:56.590
we just like the couple Korea so they
didn't want to put into words safety

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:58.670
problem defect chaotic

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.310
evil fine save at any speed unbelievable
engineering screw up gradually

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:04.819
disfiguring

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:08.180
and we don't maker cup or DNS

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.819
neither just to buy this is literally 10
up the over-sixty praises

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:14.489
but they were told not to put in their
emails because they don't want any these

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:15.220
emails lead

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.229
so when you have to put out emails
warning your people

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.290
not to write about certain words
penalties are pretty specific gorky and

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.850
ask

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:27.040
through you know I that should also go
to just under the general idea that the

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.270
cover-up percent

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.449
but just the general corporate
atmosphere I love

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.930
we're not gonna really just busy there's
no transfer

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.360
and there's no accountability yep that's
the bigger problem and now it's not

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.110
transparent but there's no
accountability Pete no one's paying a

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.729
price

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:45.300
but they look at the bottom line like
this well what do you think will have to

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.889
pay out in lawsuits

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:50.259
and how much do you think it would cost
is to recall it well that the lawsuit

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.350
numbers lower than the number would be
the big the problem

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.650
build this will fix the problem in the
wall at eleven people died

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:00.360
because it'll be cheaper for us the pain
eleven people are then it will be to fix

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.669
this problem so it's even that nefarious
know how bad they are

00:05:03.669 --> 00:05:06.789
this stuff like this you guys think it
makes the bailout look completely

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.090
ridiculous that

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:11.449
you know maybe people should have the
libertarians would have said well let GM

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:12.340
disappear

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:15.539
yet instead we bail them out we
artificially keep them alive and then we

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:19.509
see what the result address available on
every company this is not just germane

00:05:19.509 --> 00:05:22.539
to general motors it might just be
happening a little harder at General

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:23.080
Motors

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.830
because they were under such pressure to
be profitable at that time because they

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:27.610
were bankrupt

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:31.100
they were going so maybe but people been
pollo to just had the same thing they

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:32.400
are recalling day

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:36.610
a they had at best accelerators that
would you take a right to know about

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:40.620
so I mean it misses injustices
corporations and what she says about the

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.970
word

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.590
to libertarians would say wait a minute
they're going to make sure that there's

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:47.639
no problem with their cars because if
there is no go on to bigger than normal

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.000
in the AM and I'm gonna go out of
business I

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.210
yet to be they're going to be making
more money because they've got this is

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:54.669
the ring they got lawyers

00:05:54.669 --> 00:05:58.259
and the people who get injured don't
have the money that by hired a lawyer to

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:00.530
do that are you saying that the
government

00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:04.669
and corporations are two closely aligned
is that what you're saying here cuz I'm

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:05.130
shocked
