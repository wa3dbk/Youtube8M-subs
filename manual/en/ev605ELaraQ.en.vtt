Hello I am Sarolta Eke. Hello I'm Tamas Kassai,
we are here on behalf of Expert Village. We

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:18.310
are going to show you how to dance Waltz.
Tamas will show you how to dance this Waltz

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:27.300
whisk. 1-2-3. It's only 3 steps, but the leading
will be more difficult which we will explain

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:35.649
to you later. Okay, the foot positions for
this step is left foot forward, right foot

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:49.350
to side and left foot crosses behind the right
foot. Thank you! The foot technique for this

00:00:49.350 --> 00:01:03.211
step would be heel toe, toe, and toe on both
feet and then lower on your heels. Thank you!

00:01:03.211 --> 00:01:13.190
Now the rise and fall of this step, commence
to rise on 1, continue to rise on 2, continue

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:44.150
to rise on 3 and at the end of three lower.
Thank you! 1-2-3, once more 1-2-3 and once

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:59.030
more, just be careful to make it continuous.
1-2-3.
