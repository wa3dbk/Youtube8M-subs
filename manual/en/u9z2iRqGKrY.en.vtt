Daddy Clay: &nbsp;Hey, and welcome to the lab.

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:05.089
We're here at Finley's Barber Shop here in
Austin, Texas for some great ideas for last

00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:07.859
minute Father's Day gifts.

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:15.410
[music]
Daddy Clay: &nbsp;Now, for a lot of guys like

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.640
me whose hair doesn't require a lot of styling,
we've gotten use to settling for this driveâ€‘through

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:27.079
mass produced haircut mills where we pay $8.95
to get someone to run a razor over our heads.

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:29.339
But we don't have to settle for that anymore.

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:34.570
We've noticed a trend across the country of
new full service barbershops emerging like

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.559
Finley's here in Austin, Texas.

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:40.780
Now here at Finley's, when you get a haircut,
every time it's a full experience.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.829
They offer services in addition to a plain
haircut with things like hot towel treatment,

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:48.660
straight razor shave on your neck, a little
shoulder rub.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.410
It's a fantastic experience.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.750
You can even sip an adult beverage while you're
having your haircut.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.890
We're not calling it pampering because that
word, well, it doesn't sound quite right.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.160
Let's call it manpering, shall we?

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.539
For that experience there is nothing to beat
it.

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:05.129
Now, you add a full shave onto the experience.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:14.570
The whole thing is 70 bucks and it makes for
a perfect Father's Day gift certificate.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:39.730
[music]
Daddy Clay: &nbsp;Whoa, now that is a shave and

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:40.810
a haircut.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:49.000
It may not be good for your everyday haircut
but as a special treat on Father's Day, it's

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.150
good.

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.030
It's really good.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:56.759
As long as we're taking care of ourselves
why not pick up some Dove Men Plus care products.

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.490
They've got face and body wash.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:00.509
Also antiperspirants and deodorants.

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.719
Makes a great bundle for Father's Day.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:05.340
Also, think about maybe giving the gift of
time.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.780
78 hours, as a matter of fact, is a great
figure.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.780
That's 30 minutes three times a week.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:14.510
You know one of the first things that goes
away when baby comes in the house?

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.370
It's time to take care of ourselves and get
exercise.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.239
So give dad the gift of time to take care
of his fitness.

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:23.790
Want to motivate him a little bit more?

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.210
Give him the gift of an entry fee into a local
race.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.280
Maybe a 5K or a 10K.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.300
Worried it might hurt his feelings to encourage
him to take care of his fitness?

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.760
Don't worry about it.

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:34.950
We don't roll like that.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.950
It's not going to hurt our feelings.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.700
If it's got to be a gadget think about the
Jawbone Jam Box.

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.160
This tiny little unit pumps out the sound.

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:47.420
It's great for a backyard barbecue beside
the pool, in the back yard, any time dad might

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.879
have to be a DJ.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.890
It's a great gift.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.680
If any of these work out for you, let us know.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.849
