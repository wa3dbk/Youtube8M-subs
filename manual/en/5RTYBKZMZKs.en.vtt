00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.560
Then a tutorial

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:13.120
on how to cut and recompose headphones

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.400
I hope you like it

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.980
the effect:

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.760
Hello friends, today we do

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:39.400
some magic with headphones.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.640
I'll look around the center of the cable

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.580
it is more or less around here

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:57.140
if we cut through here, it would not be half

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.140
and here either

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.800
but he himself would be the center of the cable

00:01:03.217 --> 00:01:05.217
I'll get my scissors

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.530
I have in my pocket

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.160
and I cut the cord clear

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.160
It is already cut!

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.800
I'll cut some more

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.240
another bit more here and here

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.100
and a little more here

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.660
Now, I will try to rebuild the cable

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.180
I put all the headphone cable in my hand

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:44.200
and I'll have a bit of magic out of my magic salt

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.220
pulling the rope slowly

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.750
headphones were recomposed!

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.800
a perfect restoration.

00:01:59.639 --> 00:02:01.639
so long!

00:02:06.052 --> 00:02:10.212
tutorial

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.000
to perform this magic trick

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
we need a piece of wire of the same color

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.460
that the headphone cable

00:02:25.944 --> 00:02:27.944
and a false thumb ("FP")

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.700
This piece of wire we hide in the "FP" as well.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.920
if we move the hand, and went well into the audience

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.860
the false thumb goes unnoticed

00:02:48.688 --> 00:02:50.688
By lifting the handset

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.040
we take it so for half

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:00.160
so let the false thumb

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.280
and extract the hidden piece of wire

00:03:05.825 --> 00:03:07.825
from behind it is well

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.660
Now we can teach our hands clean

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.600
to make it look not hide anything

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:16.600
Cable noted several points

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:19.500
saying this is not the center

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.220
and in the last movement, saying the center

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.660
again put our finger false thumb

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.260
We teach our empty hand fleetingly

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.900
and take the trijeras we have in the pocket

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:36.040
We deposited in the pocket false thumb

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:39.080
and took the scissors

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.000
We cut the loop

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.440
we cut several times

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:51.900
to get rid of all tests

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.540
we do our magical passes

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.960
or give a touch with the magic wand

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.500
and headphones appear restored.
