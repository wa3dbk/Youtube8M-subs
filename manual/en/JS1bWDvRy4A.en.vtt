00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.830
If you want to breed your snakes, of course,
you're going to have to sex them and sexing

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.650
snakes is not the easiest thing. The number
one thing is that you're going to want a professional

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.460
do it. You sexing a snake, if you're not use
to it, you can injure your snake. So, definitely

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.290
have someone who knows how to do it show you
how to do it. Now, you're going to need some

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:27.300
instruments here, these are sexing probes.
They come in all different sizes for all different

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.490
sized snakes. And, what you're going to do,
for this little one, I'm going to use this

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.970
smallest probe and I've already dipped it
in some lubricant. I'm just using a little

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.950
Vaseline right there. Now, you have to locate
the snake's cloacae. The protective scale

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.510
right here is called the anal scale. In some
snakes it's divided, in Hognose Snakes you

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.990
can see it's a divided scale. In some snakes,
it's not divided; it just looks like a fingernail

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:56.001
or another ventral scale. What we're going
to do is bring the snake's tail back and go

00:00:56.001 --> 00:01:07.569
gently underneath its cloacae, which it's
not going to like.

00:01:07.569 --> 00:01:16.369
Be very, very gentle with it. We're going
to put that probe in there. On some snakes

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:22.659
it's easier to do than on others, obviously.
The smaller the snake, it's not easy to do.

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:33.840
Here it goes. You can see that this probe
is going some distance inside the cloacae.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:44.570
Which means it's going into a Hemipene. There
it goes. So this is how far it's going in.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:51.130
It's going into an inverted Hemipene, which
means that this is a male. If was going half

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:57.689
that distance it would mean that it's a female.
In male snakes the Hemipenes are inside the

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.950
tail and they're inverted. When the snake
uses them to mate, to copulate, it pushes

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.520
blood through them and it's kind of the equivalent
of us putting our hand inside a tube sock,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:11.700
grabbing it, and pulling it out. They have
two Hemipenes, they only use one at a time,

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:16.550
but when the probe goes into a Hemipene, goes
in some distance, you know it's a male. If

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:20.320
it only goes in half the distance, of course,
it's a female because she does not have those

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:21.090
Hemipenes.
