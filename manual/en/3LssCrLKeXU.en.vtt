00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:08.330
Hi, I'm Steve Jones. And I'm going to define
some gearing ratios for you. First of all,

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:15.180
let's understand what gears are. This is a
wheel and on it are a set of teeth. There

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.820
are certain number of teeth. In this case,
there's eight teeth. Here's another smaller

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:29.130
wheel, four teeth. Each is on an axle in the
center. Allowing it to rotate. We're rotating

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:37.710
this one anti clockwise. Automatically, the
one with four teeth is going to rotate clockwise.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:48.350
Now if I rotate the one on the left, anticlockwise,
once. It's got eight teeth. Each tooth engages

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.820
with a tooth on this wheel. And this means
that although, this rotates only once. So

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:09.319
I'll say, it rotates once. This one will rotate
actually, twice. Now normally, when we're

00:01:09.319 --> 00:01:18.689
defining ratios. We put it down as say, we
can say the ratio here is 8 to four. But of

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:29.670
course, we can simplify that. And in fact,
the ratio is 2 to 1. We would say, that if

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:39.279
this is the drive. We'll call this one the
drive. And this is the driven gear. Then what

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:54.810
we've got is a gearing up of 2 to 1. However,
if this was the drive gear. If this was the

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:04.009
one I was turning. I will find that this one
will turn slower. And then I would say, a

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:16.319
gearing down of 2 to 1. So don't get confused.
We either gear up or we gear down. Whatever

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.730
happens, it's the number of teeth on the wheel.
That tells me, how fast one wheel will go

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.870
compared to the other. It's very simple. Keep
it simple.
