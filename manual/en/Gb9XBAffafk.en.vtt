00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:03.409
Welcome back to The Game Collection!

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:28.270
I am SuperDerek and this is Persona 3: The
Answer.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:33.579
The Answer is a notoriously difficult second
campaign for Persona 3 that is included in

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:34.730
Persona 3 FES.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:40.070
It was intended to shed some light on the
aftermath of Persona 3 and clear up some mysteries

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.770
surrounding the ending, but the prospect of
another 30 hour investment in an even more

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.149
difficult campaign has fans wondering “Is
The Answer worth playing?”

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:55.190
A question that I’ll try to help you answer.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.440
The Answer assumes that you have finished
playing through Persona 3, and for the purpose

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.410
of this review, so will I.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.439
But here’s a button to skip past spoilers
if you would still like to know whether or

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:10.969
not this should be a factor in your choice
between Persona 3 FES and Persona 3 Portable.

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:11.969
Go ahead and click it, I’ll wait for you.

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.250

Okay, is everybody gone?

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.479
Ok, good.

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.670
I’m not really sure how I felt about the
ending of Persona 3.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.179
It’s been over a week since I finished it.

00:01:22.179 --> 00:01:26.569
I was hoping that after mulling it over for
a bit, I could come to terms with the death

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:30.349
of my character, but that hasn’t happened
yet.

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:35.119
Maybe I’m just a softy, but I’m a fan
of happy endings, and Persona 3 felt like

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:36.959
anything but.

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:41.709
The game spells it out that he discovered
the answer to the question of life, and that

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:44.450
answer was death.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.439
Using the power of this answer, he was somehow
able to stop Nyx from destroying the world,

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.479
but then died a few short weeks later.

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.520
How exactly that is though, this game intends
to answer.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.869
In The Answer, the remaining party members
from the Nyx Annihilation Team have started

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.630
growing apart, and are dealing with their
own feelings of confusion and loss.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.629
Aigis has requested to go back to the laboratory,
and the team are relinquishing their evokers

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.090
as they prepare to move out of the dorm.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.629
It seems as though the main character was
the lynchpin that held the team together.

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:23.180
Set the stage for catastrophe.

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.540
As the clock strikes midnight on their final
night in the dorm on March 31st, the team

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:31.840
finds themselves stuck inside their dorm,
unable to leave.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.760
To make matters weirder, everything seems
to indicate that March 31st is starting over

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:38.760
again.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.840
Then without warning, an anti-shadow weapon
bursts out from the floor and starts going

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.840
wild.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.760
This is Metis, and she’s Aigis’s sister,
apparently.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:51.959
And she knows a thing or two about what’s
going on.

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.250
After being subdued, she informs the team
that they are stuck in a time loop, and the

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.091
only way to escape it is to get rid of the
Abyss of Time.

00:03:00.091 --> 00:03:01.091
In The Answer, you play as Aigis as you lead
your team through confronting shadows in the

00:03:01.091 --> 00:03:02.091
Abyss of Time in order to allow time to start
moving forward again.

00:03:02.091 --> 00:03:03.091
As a game that is not so subtly about overcoming
grief and coming to terms with loss, it’s

00:03:03.091 --> 00:03:04.091
no surprise that there will also be a bit
of not-so-subtle symbolism.

00:03:04.091 --> 00:03:05.091
But if you could overlook the heavy-handed
symbolism in Persona 3, then I doubt this

00:03:05.091 --> 00:03:06.091
is the kind of stuff that would bother you.

00:03:06.091 --> 00:03:07.091
In The Answer, you play as Aigis from Persona
3, and you lead your group of friends through

00:03:07.091 --> 00:03:11.120
the Abyss of Time, a massive root system of
dungeon corridors that happens to be this

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.610
game’s analog to Tartarus.

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:18.819
And when I say analog, I mean that it’s
pretty much the same exact thing.

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:21.450
It is Tartarus, just upside down.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.260
Randomly generated floors with randomly dispersed
loot, same as before.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.769
Only now things have been made a bit harder
in a couple of ways.

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.400
Enemies have been grouped together in such
a way so as to make it harder to take out

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.519
groups of enemies in a single move.

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:41.269
So for instance in a group of enemies weak
to fire, you’ll also have enemies that might

00:03:41.269 --> 00:03:43.020
absorb fire spells.

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:44.020
That kind of thing.

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.870
And this applies doubly so for boss battles.

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:51.170
Boss battles are made tougher still because
every boss you fight that has a weakness to

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.150
exploit also has skills to dodge that element
of magic, which means a lot of wasted turns

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.530
and skill points.

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:04.299
Really, these seemingly small changes are
what make up most of the big jump in difficulty.

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:09.700
I should also probably further clarify that
when I say difficulty, I really only mean

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.330
tedium.

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:15.969
Even when I died, it never felt like I could
or should have done anything differently in

00:04:15.969 --> 00:04:21.500
order to succeed, I only needed to roll the
dice a dozen more times in order to get the

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:24.000
luck to finally land in my favor.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000
This aspect was largely due to that dodge
skill that every boss seemed to have.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.950
That’s not to say that it wasn’t frustrating
though.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:37.310
Persona 3 made me rage quit a few times, but
The Answer had me seriously contemplating

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.729
whether or not I wanted to finish this review.

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:46.050
*sigh* the things I put up with for you guys…

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:49.990
Something else worth mentioning, is that there
is nothing beyond the Abyss of Time to hold

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:51.240
your attention.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.990
There is no calendar system, no social links,
and no secret dungeons, there is nothing worth

00:04:56.990 --> 00:04:59.490
your time beyond the Abyss of Time.

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.500
And that means that The Answer is missing
what is easily the better half of Persona

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.500
3.

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.160
And the “needs work” parts of Persona
3 are cranked up to 11.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:16.660
Speaking of things that need work, the game
dialog also has a serious case of “Him Syndrome”.

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:20.530
Since you could change your character’s
name in Persona 3 to whatever you wanted,

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:25.780
the game would refer to the main character
from Persona 3 as “He” “Him” “They”

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.030
and so on.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.889
And when you notice it, it screams at you
that they’re not saying “his” name.

00:05:31.889 --> 00:05:34.220
It becomes distracting.

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:35.220
Even when the parts aren’t voiced over.

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.720
Come on, my character’s name was Derek,
not Voldemort.

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:45.520
Just call him something, like Minato from
the manga, or something!

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.979
I do however have to give this game some props
for one thing they improved upon, if even

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:52.060
only a little.

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:58.240
The Abyss of Time, while still monotonous,
at least had the decency to change up the

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:02.250
floors design every 5 to 10 floors or so,
rather than every 30 to 60.

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:03.699
Most of the floor designs were reused later
on in other parts of the Abyss, but I really

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:04.699
didn’t mind that so much, since I knew I’d
only be seeing that for a short while.

00:06:04.699 --> 00:06:09.631
I also felt like the floor areas were slightly
more inspired than Persona 3, but only just.

00:06:09.631 --> 00:06:10.631
In The Answer, the music that you hear is
pretty much more of the same from Persona

00:06:10.631 --> 00:06:11.631
3.

00:06:11.631 --> 00:06:12.631
Everything felt like a remix, which isn’t
really a terrible thing, but it did seem a

00:06:12.631 --> 00:06:13.631
little lazy.

00:06:13.631 --> 00:06:14.631
But in the US we can’t be too disappointed
by this, since it was just included in Persona

00:06:14.631 --> 00:06:15.631
3 FES, as opposed to being released as a standalone
game in Japan.

00:06:15.631 --> 00:06:16.631
And now here’s my Answer to the question
of whether or not The Answer is worth playing:

00:06:16.631 --> 00:06:17.631
No.

00:06:17.631 --> 00:06:19.900
I would say not.

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.229
Even if it weren’t for the frustration of
living and dying by the roll of a pair of

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:29.639
dice, even if there were some distractions
beyond the Abyss of Time to hold your attention,

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:35.262
and even if it gave me an ending that I could
go home happy with, I’d say no, it’s not

00:06:35.262 --> 00:06:40.389
worth playing because if you are playing The
Answer, you probably loved Persona 3.

00:06:40.389 --> 00:06:45.340
And I wouldn’t want this game’s portrayal
of your team members to stain your memory

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:46.850
of them.

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.470
This is the real heart of the problem for
me.

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:55.419
I spent 90 hours playing Persona 3, maybe
a quarter of that was spent interacting with

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:58.259
my party, getting to know them.

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:03.600
And seeing what The Answer did to their characters
was more frustrating than even a few of the

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:04.600
bosses.

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:09.280
I couldn’t help but feel like the writer
of the dialog for The Answer read the cliffsnotes

00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:15.650
version of Persona 3 and figured that was
good enough.

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:16.650
It wasn’t.

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:22.640
My recommendation to you is to play Persona
3 however you like, then if you’re really

00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:27.000
curious about the ending, watch the cut-scenes
on YouTube or something.

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:32.199
Persona 3 was great but The Answer is just
not worth it.
