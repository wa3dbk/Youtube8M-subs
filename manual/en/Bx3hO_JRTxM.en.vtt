Hi, I am Jessica with Paper Mart.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In this video, I am going to show you how to make a really beautiful gift basket.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Paper Mart (www.papermart.com) has many baskets already in stock and ready to ship.  

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
I picked out this cute Rosa Honey Willow Basket. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We have fabric covered baskets, bright colored baskets, seagrass baskets, and more. 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
You are going to need gifts to fill your basket.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
You are going to need filler or basket shred. 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
I have choosen this iridescent shred for our basket.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Paper Mart also has krinkle cut shred and other colors of shred to pick from.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
You need a pair of scissors,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
A beautiful bow to tie it off,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Twist ties to help tie the basket,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:52.000
To bring the basket together, you will need to use cellophane, cello bag, or shrinkwrap.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
We are going to start making our basket now.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Add scrap paper on the bottom of the basket to give your items volume. 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
This helps with displaying your items inside.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Add your largest item in the back of the basket.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I am going to place the box on the side of the wine bottle.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Sometimes it helps to use glue dots to keep your items from moving.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I will finish my basket off with putting the candy in the front.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:54.000
To cover up the scrap paper, stuff your basket with shred.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:08.000
We are going to go ahead and cut our cellophane off the roll with scissors. 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
How much you cut depends on the size of your basket. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
The cellophane needs to wrap all the way around. 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:34.000
I love these great big cello rolls! You can cut to practically any size.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Center your gift basket in the middle of your cut cellophane.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
I hope everything stays in place!

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:02.000
And then we will grab the cellophane at all corners and bring it to the top of the basket.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:13.000
Tie the it off with twist ties. These are so helpful.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
This is a twisty tie test!

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Once we are finished, we will tie a gift bow in the front. 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
This gift bow has ties that make it easy to tie on. 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Just wrap the ties around the front of the basket to the back and tie.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000
There we go. We have a nice beautiful gift basket for a special occasion, for a friend, or a birthday.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I hope you guys enjoyed making this.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
