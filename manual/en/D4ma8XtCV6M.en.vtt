00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:08.879
This is one of our most requested dishes of all time. It's an ice cream sandwich. Arrrggghh!

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.240
So for this ice cream sandwich we're going to use all the usual suspects for a cookie

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:18.090
and make our very own chocolate ones with cocoa

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.570
and then use them to sandwich together home made ice cream that's lemon in flavour

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.630
and that's made with lemon curd, mascarpone and custard. Sounds too good

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:26.170
to be true.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:28.109
ice cream sandwiches, first of all,

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.070
in the UK are not that well known

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.100
Because an ice-cream sandwich says to me 'bread and ice cream'. Ice cream sandwiches are very much an American thing and our subscribers have been asking for them.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.940
so here they are. Butter...

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:38.850
into a bowl

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.829
and then if you can just beat that together with a little bit of vanilla extract and two types of sugar.

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.739
We've got brown sugar

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:52.199
So beat that together until its smooth. Nice. And white sugar. So two sugars mean you get an extra chew and very sweet obviously but an extra

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.460
chew

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.199
and then rather than whole eggs its actually just the egg whites we want so crack them

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:04.360
and then pass the yolk from shell to shell. Then as soon as you're left with just the yolk

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.300
give the white to Barry

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:06.960
As easy as that Mike.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.360
Nicely done Mike.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.820
Thanks you. Right, are you ready for my white. Do it.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.290
So beat that in as well. And once we've got our wet ingredients into the bowl and nicely combined we can add the 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.770
dry ones. So what we have is some bicarb, which is our raising agent.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:22.900
Some cocoa powder

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.890
This is a really rich, chocolatey biscuit. Fit. And some flour.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.820
Which obviously is going to combine the whole thing together. So if you can mix all of that together until we have a nice paste. 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.040
Do you want to have a go at stirring Mike? Errr... yeah, go on then.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:42.450
That looks incredible. Can I? Yeah, go on then.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.780
Put dollops onto our tray...

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:46.470
about that big.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.070
just less than a tablespoon. The important thing is that they all have to be equal

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.760
and fairly well spaced out because they will spread. Now obviously we've got enough here to make 12,

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:57.310
but we'll start with just 6. Can you pop those into our oven.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.920
Thats 180 degrees C for 10 to

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.579
12 minutes until they're 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:03.479
completely round and spherical and when you touch them

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.170
they just spring back. In the meantime, we can make our ice-cream to go in the middle.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.090
Now, we've made lots of ice creams on this show and this is another version

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.669
with mascarpone cheese.

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:15.400
I love that. If you can beat that in.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.449
with lemon curd, which is a really really

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:19.999
fresh and lemony

00:02:19.999 --> 00:02:24.579
kind of zingy ice cream going on with the juice of a lemon. Please Mike.

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:28.899
And do it through your fingers so you don't get any pips in there. So this is a real

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:30.360
cheats version of ice cream?

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.819
'Cos you do not do it like this normally. Do you?

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.930
No, a normal ice cream would use an egg custard.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:39.140
It takes ages. And it can take a long time. And once that's all combined, I said an ice cream normally

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.810
uses a custard. So does this one. Except this is straight out of a carton

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.609
So mix it in. We then need to freeze that down and it's the best lemon ice cream... ever.

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:49.620
If you say so.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.760
Our biscuits are on the oven and they need 10-12 minutes in total, they've already had a few.

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.819
Our ice cream needs to go into a container and into the freezer for a couple of hours to set.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:03.969
Then we'll let our biscuits cool and then we can sandwich them together.

00:03:03.969 --> 00:03:07.849
So we've now made all of our biscuits from the mix and we've let our ice-cream

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.209
set. You put a face in it.

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.089
Who put their face in it?

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:16.589
Put your face in it if you're not careful. Now it's time to sandwich them together.

00:03:16.589 --> 00:03:20.559
If we take one each. All we need to do is grab two halves. It's nice soft ice cream.

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:24.069
Once it's frozen up you might have have to take it out again to soften at room temperature. Just for a few minutes

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:26.750
so that you can actually work with it. Put as much in the middle as you like

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:27.919
but about much

00:03:27.919 --> 00:03:30.799
is kind of right for the ratio of chocolate to lemon.

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:31.999
Put the other one on top

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:34.559
and then you need to try and neaten it up a little bit

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:39.279
by just kind of scraping around the outside. Now when it's this soft it will try and squeeze out everywhere

00:03:39.279 --> 00:03:40.210
but that's fine.

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:43.070
Because then they can go onto a plate and at this point they go back

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:46.740
into the freezer again to set them up so they are easier to eat. They can stay in the freezer

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.659
for up to a month and are always there when you need them.

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.769
And here... are the ones we did earlier.

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:53.499
Who'd have thought it?

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:56.989
There we go. Three. Just perfect for the three of us. It's our ice cream

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.559
sandwich... SORTED!

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:03.869
Go on then Mike

00:04:03.869 --> 00:04:05.199
Dig in, which one do you want?

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:08.949
I'll have the littler one... you have the big one, you've done some work.

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:12.809
A bit difficult to eat, but WOW.

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:17.180
OMG. That chocolate and lemon... magnificent. 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:18.669
Really rich chocolate.

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:23.110
The biscuits are soft as well. Kind of a soft chew. Well done America!

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.550
Yeah, that was a really good request and if there's anything else you want to see us make

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.810
Please let us know in the comments below.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.340
Make sure it's nice stuff!
