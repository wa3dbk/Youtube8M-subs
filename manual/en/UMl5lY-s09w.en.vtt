00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:05.930
Okay, now we want to cut our picture; crop
our picture and decide where to put it on

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:13.550
our plaque. You don't want to cut your picture
without having a pattern first so we'll make

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:18.860
a pattern. I'm going to make, I want to make
a heart inside the heart and I want it to

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:26.070
be symmetrical so I fold my paper in half.
I'm just going to estimate what I think will

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:35.360
work and cut that out, and see how it; it
looks there, now it looks a little bit big

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:41.410
for me. I also want to take a look at how
it, it will cover the photo; now it's a little

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:53.410
high here so now I'm going to adjust my cut
out and you just cut out if you, if you make

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:00.030
a mistake you'll just re-cut. But okay, so
now this covers both of the, the people that

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:08.600
I want to be in on my plaque; it covers them
nicely and this is what it'll look like on

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:12.820
the plaque. So when you're satisfied with
what you have then you'll cut your photo;

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:19.280
you place the pattern onto the photo, if you
hold it up to the light you can see the faces

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.340
through it and get the placement exactly where
you want it; and then you'll just cut around

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:32.150
the pattern. Okay, and then all you need to
do is glue that onto your plaque; I'm going

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:42.720
to use the same quick clear drying glue that
we've been using and you don't want to glue

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.439
it on too thickly, I know we've been doing
it very, very thick for everything else but

00:01:49.439 --> 00:02:00.329
this you want to put a thin coating on just
enough to adhere the picture to the plaque

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:09.569
without having it oozing out and you want
to bring the glue all the way to the edge

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:15.119
of the picture; and very carefully place.
