00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:06.319
Hi, I am Shawna Coronado from Gardening Nude.

00:00:06.319 --> 00:00:07.319
And I have some simple tips for you today
on water conservation.

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.319
We are going to do 3 inside and 3 outside.

00:00:08.319 --> 00:00:11.370
The first tip has to do with washing dishes.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:20.689
And yes, we are in the middle of a very messy
kitchen – mine.

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:29.189
And I am going to show you what the number
one water-waster in the kitchen is.

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.390
Are you ready?

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.390
That is it.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.390
It is that simple.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.930
Many people tend to leave this water on and
running.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.960
Stop that.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.960
Not good.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.410
So that is the first tip.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.410
Simple, huh?

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:44.860
Are you ready for the second tip?

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:52.899
I have got the toothbrush and I am going to
brush my teeth without letting the water run.

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:54.760
Like this.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:09.840
We can brush our teeth without letting the
water run and that saves like a lot of water,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:16.290
especially for children, you know what I am
saying?

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.290
So for Pete’s sake people.

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.630
When you are brushing your teeth, do not let
the water run.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.630
All right.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.250
We are back in the bathroom again for tip
number 3.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:26.310
I will show you the view right now.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.310
This is a toilet.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.490
Buy a water-saving toilet and help reduce
water consumption.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:29.770
Tip number 4.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.320
Plant similar style of plants together.

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.270
For example, both of these plants are fairly
drought-tolerant and this is good news.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.350
I try to plant them all together.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.360
Here, I planted several plants together that
are drought-tolerant.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:53.590
For example, I mixed the Proven Winners heucheras
all through this section in with my already-existing

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:54.590
hostas.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:00.740
The idea is you will save water if you plant
all the plants together that have the same

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:01.740
water requirement.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.060
Back over here is my vegetable garden.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.899
And most of this section, it is late in the
afternoon, most of this will be sun, hot sun,

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.079
full sun, all day.

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:13.699
And vegetables require a lot of water.

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:17.549
Notice I planted the vegetable garden closer
to my watering area.

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:21.829
That is my rain barrel up there so I am able
to just pull the hose right down and water

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:22.829
in this area.

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:24.740
5th idea – mulch.

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:25.920
Mulch, mulch, mulch.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:31.769
It is really important if you want to conserve
water to put a compost or a mulch on top of

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:32.769
your soil.

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:35.900
And it helps retain the water and you do not
use as much all summer watering.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.150
And the best idea of all – composting.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.230
Compost allows your soil to absorb and hold
more water.

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.291
And how cool is that?

00:02:47.291 --> 00:02:49.350
Here, let me show you my composters.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:52.570
I have two of them right here.

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:55.750
Here is a composter that is a top bin opening
style.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.760
See my compost in there.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.560
And over here I have a tumbleweed twister.

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.280
And the tumbleweed is one that you turn and
spin.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.680
So there you have it.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.620
Six really awesome ideas that conserve water,
both inside and outside the house.

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.879
Do it today and make a difference.
