00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:10.320
Hey everyone!

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.380
Jaystepher with Arctic Snowmobile by Lego City.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.500
Set number 60032.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.820
Contains 44 pieces.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.420
Recommended building ages are 5 through 12.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:28.400
So it appears we get a snowmobile

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.080
with an ice boulder.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:35.820
Looks like a minifigure is possibly included.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.660
Let's open up this box and see what's inside.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.340
You have to tear it open.

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.040
Okay.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.100
Nothing else in the box.

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:57.240
So we have a folded printed instruction manual

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.840
and two bags of elements.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.260
Let's see what the Arctic Snowmobile looks like

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.900
after it's assembled.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.400
That was a quick easy build.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.020
Off to the left, we have one minifigure.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.360
Let's take a look at him.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.820
His torso and pants are printed.

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:28.180
He's got a head warmer as
well to keep his head warm.

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:31.200
Blue gloves.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.700
The print work does flow to the back of his torso.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.800
He does have a single-sided head.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.340
Let's have a quick look at the snowmobile.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:59.730
The logo on the hood of the snowmobile is printed.

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.320
Have large skis to keep the snowmobile stable.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.300
On this side we have a radio.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.080
We have a sleigh at the rear,

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.300
and it's attached with a chain

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.120
This can be removed.

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.470
A bit difficult to get it on and off.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.160
And on the sleigh, we have an ice boulder.

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.300
Top does come off.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:44.380
It does reveal silver.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:55.110
On this side of the snowmobile, we have a small hammer

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.110
to help possibly crack open the ice boulder.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.520
The snowmobile is scaled for minifigures.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.800
Let's let this gentleman have a seat.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:15.120
The handlebars do appear to be a little high.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.780
They could have been lowered a bit.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.660
Can't seem to get his other arm down.

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.170
This is one nice little set.

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.180
It is perfect to add to a Lego city,

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.580
a Lego winter theme,

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:44.940
or as a source for spare parts.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.580
This concludes the review for Arctic Snowmobile

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:50.380
by Lego City.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:53.340
Thank you all for watching!
