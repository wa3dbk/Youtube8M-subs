00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.266
&gt;&gt; Android itself began
two years ago,

00:00:26.266 --> 00:00:32.367
and since then it's really begun to marry
the software world with the hardware world.

00:00:32.367 --> 00:00:34.467
Android on its own is just software,

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:36.867
but by working closely with our partners,

00:00:36.867 --> 00:00:41.133
what we can do is create an integrated
hardware and software experience

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:42.934
which for the market establishes

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:47.734
what the latest and most advanced
capabilities of a phone are.

00:00:47.734 --> 00:00:49.633
The Nexus One
in my mind really does that.

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:52.834
The Nexus One really brings together
a lot of the great innovations

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:54.700
in both hardware and software

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.600
and sets that high water mark.

&gt;&gt; A lot of what ends up defining
the personality of the phone is the CMF.

00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:33.967
The final finish we ended up
using is called soft touch,

00:01:33.967 --> 00:01:36.734
because it has this
almost suede like feel.

00:01:36.734 --> 00:01:42.734
It sits very comfortably in your
hand but has just enough grip.

00:01:42.734 --> 00:01:47.133
We knew from past product releases that
many customers prefer a large display.

00:01:47.133 --> 00:01:52.200
At 3.7 inches the screen is very conducive
to uses for long periods of time.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.800
&gt;&gt; Early on in the design process,

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.300
audience was brought in by HTC to
integrate our noise suppression technology

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.834
to elevate that quality of voice
communication on the Nexus One.

00:02:07.834 --> 00:02:11.300
We had precious experience working
with HTC on various project

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:14.166
and that proved really valuable
in integrating our two microphone

00:02:14.166 --> 00:02:17.200
advanced voice processor chip
solution into the phone.

&gt;&gt; The two microphones
working with a voice processor

00:02:28.834 --> 00:02:31.233
mimic the functions of
the human hearing system,

00:02:31.233 --> 00:02:34.033
measuring loudness and
timing to identify sounds.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.800
The audience chip in the phone
takes all the sound in the two mics

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.734
and isolates your voice signal while
cancelling out background noise.

00:02:54.734 --> 00:02:58.667
like the noisy street and nearby
conversations for example.

00:02:58.667 --> 00:03:01.967
The result is clear voice for the person
on the other end of the line,

00:03:01.967 --> 00:03:06.300
as well as the ability to take or make
calls regardless of surrounding noise.

00:03:15.967 --> 00:03:19.100
&gt;&gt; We added three dock connectors
on the bottom of the device

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.433
which connect with three pins
that sit in the optional dock,

00:03:22.433 --> 00:03:23.800
By working closely with Google,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.934
we were able to implement a design
that can fully take advantage

00:03:26.934 --> 00:03:32.033
of the latest advances the enbridge
software has to offer,

00:03:32.033 --> 00:03:35.400
&gt;&gt; The Nexus One is really
the latest step in bringing

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.800
that sort of close marriage of
hardware and software together.
