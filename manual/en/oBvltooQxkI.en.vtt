00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.830
Plants need light to grow.

00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:02.610
This we know.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:06.150
Plants use light to turn CO2
and H2O into sugar in a process

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:07.525
called photosynthesis.

00:00:07.525 --> 00:00:09.150
And plants then use
this sugar to grow.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.490
So many plants try and
maximize the amount of light

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:12.090
that they get.

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.280
Some plants do this by
growing bigger leaves.

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.620
Other plants do it by
bending towards the sun

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.900
as it moves across the
sky through the day.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.720
And still others do it through
a process called phototropism.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.390
Phototropism is when plants
grow towards a light source.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.460
For demonstration purposes,
let me introduce you

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.720
to my basil plant.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.680
He's a little sad.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.540
Sometimes I forget to water him.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.732
If you notice, all the leaves
are facing in one direction.

00:00:36.732 --> 00:00:38.190
And that's because
this is the side

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.040
of the plant on my windowsill
that faces the window.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:43.358
The plant is so bent
towards the sunlight

00:00:43.358 --> 00:00:45.150
that some of the leaves
even press right up

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.110
against the glass.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.930
So if we do an experiment, turn
the plant around, and leave it

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.420
for a little while, over
the course of a few,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.910
days this perky plant actually
changed its direction growth

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.952
so that it was facing
towards the sunlight again.

00:00:55.952 --> 00:00:57.870
This is an example of
positive phototropism,

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.940
because the plant was
growing towards the light.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.530
Plants use a
hormone called auxin

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.270
for this sort of
directional growth.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.430
Plants use hormones for
growth and maturation

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:06.660
much like animals.

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:08.010
Didn't know plants had hormones?

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.218
Well, you've obviously never
tried to grow an orchid.

00:01:10.218 --> 00:01:12.450
I swear, mine's not
flowering of pure spite.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.850
Auxin collects on the
dark side of the plant

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.000
and causes the cells on
that side to elongate.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.750
This means that the
cells on the dark side

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.917
are growing faster than the
cells on the light side,

00:01:20.917 --> 00:01:22.320
causing the stem to curve.

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.230
Auxin can respond in similar
ways to gravity and water,

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.690
helping stems to grow
up, roots to grow down,

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.950
and some roots to grow
towards water sources.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.280
Another really cool plant
hormone is ethylene.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.380
Ethylene is involved
in fruit maturation.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.560
And it's the reason why
you can take unripe fruit,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.910
put it in a paper bag
with a ripe apple,

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.010
close it up, and get ripe fruit
faster than if you had just

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.110
left the two things
sitting out on the counter.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:51.162
The ripe apple gives
up ethylene gas,

00:01:51.162 --> 00:01:52.620
which gets trapped
in the paper bag

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.690
and stimulates ripening
in the other fruit.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.940
It's thought that even the
ancient Egyptians harnessed

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:58.050
the power of ethylene.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.900
They would cut unripe figs, and
the figs would produce ethylene

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.270
as part of the wound response.

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.820
And this ethylene would
help them to mature faster.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:05.780
Go forth.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:06.440
Do science.

00:02:10.412 --> 00:02:11.370
What if I could juggle?

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.450
I cannot juggle.
