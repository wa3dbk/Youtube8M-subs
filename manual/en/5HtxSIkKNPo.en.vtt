00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.370
It might not look like we're still in the Intel
booth because we're looking at a car dash

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.600
right now, but we are. And it sounds like Intel
is working on some really, really cool in-car

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.870
technology, you were just giving me the brief
rundown on it and it sounds pretty ambitious,

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.670
and just like almost everything else that we're
seeing. I mean the Atom processor has become

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:35.040
so much in the for-front, all of sudden this year
it's all you're hearing about, and this is

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.000
an Atom powered, sort of a concept here 
that you guys are working on, right?

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:43.360
- Absolutely. This is an Atom powered processor
built into the actual dash. It has full 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:47.770
connectivity of your mobile broad band as well
as a new research that we're investigating on

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:50.960
called VLC, which is called 
Visual Light Communication. 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.140
That's LED light stock to LED lights. 
So car to car communication,

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.960
where if you're driving in front of me and you
happen to brake, and I'm falling to close to you,

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.960
well essentially it can send me an alert, says
you need to be back off, if not, it automatically

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.530
does the car system and brakes for you. 
- Well, that's great, because it seems like such 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.100
a simple solution really. Because you probably 
were trying to figure out how do you get all these

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.110
cars to communicate with each other.
 And you guys have come up with the idea, 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.800
the simple idea of using LED lights, 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.630
so that you have direct car to car 
communication, right there.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.430
- Absolutely. Absolutely, and if you can see from
the back here you see some LED lights lit up.

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:25.870
And that's actually 
passing traffic right now. 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.070
These are prototype LED lights,
passing data traffic to our sensors, 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.670
so that's car to car, 
that's street light to car,

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:36.600
that's signal lights to car, restaurants hotels, 
as well as shopping industry, where they can

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.900
give you essentially coupons...
 Provided to your heads-up displays,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.200
as well as advertisement, anything that happens.
For instance, if somebody bought some

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.090
5 pizzas and they never picked it up, well as
you drive by, it can automatically give you 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.800
like, hey, within half an hour, if you come in and
get a pizza from us we'll give you half price off.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.970
- Oh, that's incredible. So now, advertisers will
have the ability to change their messaging 

00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.490
in real time, deliver it to cars as they drive by,
and it adds all these safety features 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.110
of being able to slow a car down if it senses
braking, and take control of the car if need be.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.930
- Absolutely. And there's one other thing that
we want to talk about, and it's kind of a vision

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:13.800
that Intel has, which called 
Carry Small Live Large, 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.730
and what that is,
 is that your hand held device. 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:18.100
Everybody carries a cellphone or a mobile
device, right? - Absolutely. 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:21.540
- And when you're at your home or when you're
in your office, essentially it has a profile 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.230
of who you are, where you shop, where 
you've been, music that you listen to.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:28.750
Well imagine this concept, is that when you walk
to your car, the car automatically detects 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.500
the car's sub system, it automatically 
syncs to the sub system.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:34.270
So now it becomes its leverage in the 
processing power, from the car 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.600
as well as the connectivity. And then
 it automatically loads your music,

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.870
all the custom, and all the filtering
 of the advertisement only

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.040
becomes with you,
 and not everybody else.

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.800
So you don't have to be bombarded
 with a bunch of advertisements.

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.300
- Very cool. Anytime I can put in a screen 
in my car with an Atom processor, I'm down.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.160
Very cool in car technology. Thank you very
much, appreciate it. - You bet.
