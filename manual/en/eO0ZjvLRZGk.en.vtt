Hi! I'm Karen for Expert Village. We are going
to flip under about 3/8's of an inch of fabric

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:20.830
and press that so it is like that. It finishes
the edge so that it doesn't fray. So if you

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:32.369
flip that under. If you want, you can flip
it under and put a pin in there. Let me show

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:45.510
you that. Flip it under and put a pin in and
move around and flip that under somewhere

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:55.330
between 1/4 inch to 3/8's inch you want to
flip under. If you have an over lock machine,

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.739
you could just over lock the edge and that
will finish the edge so that it won't fray

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:13.180
but if you are using a straight stitch machine,
this works fine just flipping that under and

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:24.650
you can pin it in place or you could just
press it. Now we are going to press. It makes

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:35.500
it a lot easier doing the sewing if the fabric
is all pressed and in place and then flip

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:47.159
it over. That pin got me. Got to take that
one out and as soon as it is press, you can

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:53.850
remove the pins. Be careful they might be
hot after pressing. Remove the pins and now

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:01.170
that is ready to be either hand hemmed, straight
stitched hemmed or blind hemmed.
