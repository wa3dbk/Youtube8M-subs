00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.927
"Lifestyle Medicine Is the Standard of Care for Prediabetes"

00:00:05.927 --> 00:00:09.029
For people with prediabetes, 

00:00:09.029 --> 00:00:14.269
lifestyle modification is now considered 
the cornerstone of diabetes prevention. 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:18.803
Diet-wise that means individuals 
with prediabetes or diabetes diabetes 

00:00:18.803 --> 00:00:23.770
should aim to reduce their intake of excess 
calories, saturated fat, and trans fat.

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:29.183
Too many of us consume a diet with too many 
of these solid fats as well as added sugars. 

00:00:29.183 --> 00:00:34.669
Thankfully the latest dietary guidelines aim 
to shift consumption towards more plant-based foods. 

00:00:34.669 --> 00:00:41.125
Lifestyle modification is now the foundation of the 
 American Association of Clinical Endocrinology guidelines, 

00:00:41.125 --> 00:00:44.850
the European Diabetes Association guidelines, 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.187
as well as the official standards of care 
for the American Diabetes Association. 

00:00:50.187 --> 00:00:53.170
Dietary strategies include reduced intake of fat, 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:58.504
and increased intake of fiber, meaning 
unrefined plant foods including whole grains. 

00:00:58.504 --> 00:01:00.937
That’s based on research like this. 

00:01:00.937 --> 00:01:06.300
We’ve known eating lots of whole grains is associated 
with a reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes. 

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.299
This recent study took it further, 
demonstrating that whole grain consumption 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:13.134
may also protect against 
prediabetes in the first place.

00:01:13.134 --> 00:01:17.211
To help prevent diabetics from dying, 

00:01:17.211 --> 00:01:23.799
recommendations should focus on the reduction of 
saturated fat, cholesterol, and trans fat intake, 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.767
which is basically code for meat 
and dairy, eggs, and junk food, 

00:01:28.767 --> 00:01:33.167
and increases in omega 3’s, 
soluble fiber, and phytosterols, 

00:01:33.167 --> 00:01:36.086
all of which can be found packaged 
in flax seeds, for example, 

00:01:36.086 --> 00:01:39.908
an efficient but still uncommon 
intervention for prediabetes. 

00:01:39.908 --> 00:01:43.060
They found that about 2 tablespoons 
of ground flax a day 

00:01:43.062 --> 00:01:46.960
decreased insulin resistance, which 
is the hallmark of the disease.

00:01:46.961 --> 00:01:51.630
So if the standards of care for all 
the major diabetes groups says 

00:01:51.631 --> 00:01:53.920
that lifestyle is the preferred 
treatment for prediabetes 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.630
because it’s so safe and highly effective, 

00:01:55.628 --> 00:01:58.050
why don’t more doctors do it?

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.380
Unfortunately, the opportunity to treat this 
disease naturally is often unrecognized. 

00:02:03.381 --> 00:02:07.200
Only about 1 in 3 patients report ever 
 being told about diet or exercise. 

00:02:07.197 --> 00:02:11.330
Possible reasons for not counseling 
patients include lack of reimbursement, 

00:02:11.328 --> 00:02:14.160
lack of resources, lack of time, lack of skill.

00:02:14.164 --> 00:02:17.320
We’re just not teaching doctors how. 

00:02:17.325 --> 00:02:22.830
The inadequacy of clinical education is a consequence 
of the failure of health care and medical education 

00:02:22.832 --> 00:02:26.830
to adapt to the great transformation 
of disease from acute to chronic – 

00:02:26.831 --> 00:02:29.800
from broken legs to broken hearts. 

00:02:29.804 --> 00:02:33.520
Chronic disease is now 
the principal cause of disability, 

00:02:33.518 --> 00:02:36.300
consuming three quarters 
of our sickness-care system. 

00:02:36.297 --> 00:02:41.180
Why has there been little academic response 
to this rising prevalence of chronic disease?

00:02:41.182 --> 00:02:44.960
Maybe it’s because doctors aren’t getting paid to do it. 

00:02:44.961 --> 00:02:49.060
Attempting to change to a rational chronic 
care model is practically unthinkable 

00:02:49.063 --> 00:02:51.990
in the absence of radically changed compensation. 

00:02:51.988 --> 00:02:55.830
Why haven’t reimbursement policies been modified? 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.930
One crucial reason may be a failure of leadership 
 in the medical profession and medical education 

00:03:00.929 --> 00:03:05.230
to recognize and respond to this 
changing nature of disease patterns. 

00:03:05.228 --> 00:03:08.510
How far behind the times is the medical profession? 

00:03:08.512 --> 00:03:11.880
A report by the Institute of Medicine 
on medical training concluded 

00:03:11.876 --> 00:03:19.430
that the fundamental approach to medical 
education has not changed since 1910.
