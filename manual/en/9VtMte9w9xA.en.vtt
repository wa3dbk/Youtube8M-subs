00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.290
Hi, my name is Jonathan Wilson on behalf of
Expert Village.com, and we're learning thirty

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.780
must-have blues piano licks. We're in the
first ten, which is the easy set and we've

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.270
made it to number five. Now, this one is a
little like number three. It's sort of a descending

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.870
quarter note pattern and there's a little
turnaround at the end, with some eighth notes.

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:28.100
Again, like number three, this has the option,
if you want to, of interspersing offbeat Cs

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.800
between the quarter notes that are descending.
You can leave them in if you want, or you

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.560
can just omit them, it's up to you. I'll play
them in the examples, but remember those offbeat

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:43.710
Cs can be left out and it works just fine.
Here it is very slowly with the metronome

00:00:43.710 --> 00:01:06.240
and the notation. Okay. Again, pretty easy!
Technically, maybe a little bit more challenging

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.709
because you've got a full octave reach there
between the C on the top and on the bottom.

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:15.590
But, still, we're doing pretty good. Just
practice; work with your metronome, if this

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.889
is becoming technically challenging for you.
Same kind of thing, any time you're going

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:25.270
back and forth over the course of an entire
octave. Many times you can get an advantage

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:30.079
by using your wrist and your arm instead of
your fingers. Don't try to reach the whole

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.630
octave if you have smaller hands. You know,
play the top notes and then move your hand

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.979
down. Kind of rotate your hand. It makes it
a lot easier. It keeps your hand relaxed.

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:44.189
You don't get as tired. It's a good technique
for playing longer stretches like that. Now,

00:01:44.189 --> 00:02:16.750
let's take this lick full speed with the band.
Here's how it sounds in context. Okay, that's

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.860
lick number five. Still pretty cool, pretty
easy, but pretty cool. Now, we're going to

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:26.450
keep things going. Next, nice easy one, lick
number six is coming up.
