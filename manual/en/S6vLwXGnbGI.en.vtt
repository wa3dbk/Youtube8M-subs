Side Buddha by Marcelo Supertramp

00:00:45.001 --> 00:00:54.000
The big hint about the side Buddha, especially for those who wear shoes to ride

00:00:54.001 --> 00:01:00.000
is to begin twisting your ankle while standing

00:01:00.001 --> 00:01:06.000
Try twisting your back foot first, while still standing, just like the drop knee

00:01:06.001 --> 00:01:14.000
And then hold your weight with your back leg, to also twist your front foot

00:01:14.001 --> 00:01:24.000
Remain with your body aligned, straight up, focusing in front of you, using your arms to balance

00:01:24.001 --> 00:01:33.000
And then, go down slowly, balancing, until you can sit on your feet

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:44.000
I usually sit on my back foot, and support my knee on my front foot

00:01:44.001 --> 00:01:58.000
This way, your whole body is supporting itself, everything is balancing as one single piece, so it is easier to control

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:10.000
In this position keep your body straight up as if you were standing, using your arms to balance,

00:02:10.001 --> 00:02:22.000
After you manage to balance here, you can begin twisting your body and changing your point of focus, and make a pose for a photo :D 

00:02:22.001 --> 00:02:37.000
To go out of it, there is a way I like to do, focus the end of the line again, slide back your knee and you are already on the drop knee

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I think it helps stabilize the move, and I think it is easier than go back up again slowly

00:02:45.001 --> 00:02:54.000
It requires strenght in your legs, and your feet are already in a difficult position to balance, so if you do a drop knee before it, may be easier

00:02:54.001 --> 00:02:58.000
I will try to repeat it one more time, drop knee included

00:03:02.001 --> 00:03:04.000
Balance

00:03:05.001 --> 00:03:08.000
Twist your feet since up here

00:03:08.001 --> 00:03:11.000
Go down, balance

00:03:11.001 --> 00:03:15.000
To go out of it, turn you body a little bit, and you are on the drop knee

00:03:15.001 --> 00:03:20.000
From here it is easier to go back up again, bend your body forward a bit, and go up

00:03:20.001 --> 00:03:28.000
When you are pretty confident in doing the Side Buddha

00:03:28.001 --> 00:03:34.000
This trick is very beautiful to end some combos 

00:03:34.001 --> 00:03:50.000
If you do a 360, freefall, mojo, turn this way, that way, it may be cool to end your combo with a Side Buddha right after a bounce

00:03:50.001 --> 00:04:09.000
After a butt, a chest, or whatever, go up, hit the line with your feet twisted, dump the bounce using your knees, go down slow and end your combo

00:04:09.001 --> 00:04:11.000
I will try it one time
