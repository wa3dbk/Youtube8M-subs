Folded Or Hang A Shirt - Advantages Of Hanging
Dress Shirts - Advantage Of Folding Men's

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:02.480
Shirt

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.480
Hi!

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.540

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.820
I've got a very important subject to cover
today, so I'd like you to stop everything

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.469
you're doing and let's look at the big debate.

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.369
Should dress shirts be folded or should they
be hung?

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.490
That's right.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.119

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.670

that one right down there as well.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:02.010
The question that came in, a gentleman's asking
me, "Antonio, should I fold or should I hang

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.480
my dress shirts?"

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:12.250
Honestly, I just can't take a side here because
each of them serve their own purpose.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.570
Let me go into the details here.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.570
ADVANTAGES OF HANGING DRESS SHIRTS

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.570
Dry shirt

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.580
If you want to hang up your shirts, here are
the advantages of hanging up your shirt.

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:26.450
If you hang up your shirt, you know that it's
going to be dry, and why is this important?

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.250
Because most shirts are made out of cotton
and if you put away a shirt damp or wet or

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.000
there's somehow moisture getting into your
drawer, you will get mildew and it will eat

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.270
and destroy the cotton.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.460
It's one of the few things.

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.610
You don't have to worry about moths with cotton,
but you do have to worry about mildew.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.600
So if your shirt is hanging up there, most
likely it's going to be dry.

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:50.700
Wrinkle-free

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.740
If the shirt just came back from the cleaners
or you just ironed it and it looks great for

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.090
the week, you put it on a hanger and most
likely, unless your three-year-old gets a

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.810
hold of it and pulls it down and uses it as
a blanket, it is going to stay wrinkle-free,

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.429
so another great reason to put it on the hanger.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:10.899
Easier to sort through

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:11.959
Let's say you've got a jacket.

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.569
You want to see, "Okay, I really want to wear
this jacket or this tie," and you can then

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.680
hold it up to all of the shirts looking through
your wardrobe, so there's another reason.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.209
Easier to put away

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:27.840
Let's say you wear this shirt for an hour,
a couple of hours, and it's perfectly clean.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.840
You take it off, easily put it back on the
hanger.

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.190
That takes a couple of seconds.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.230
ADVANTAGES OF FOLDING DRESS SHIRTS

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:36.540
Now, why would you want to then fold your
shirts and put them away?

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.189
Let's step to the other side.

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:41.900
Are you guys ready for this?

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.900
Okay.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.290
If you're going to fold your shirts and you're
going put them away, these are the advantages:

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.659
No stress on the points

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:56.840
Speaking of, if you want your shirt to last
longer, you don't want it to hang on a hanger

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.400
because eventually, hangers are going to form
indentions on your shirt.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.469
Even though cotton does kind of go back over
time, you will start to get little points

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:07.939
there.

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:12.079
It takes a long time for that to happen, but
it can happen.

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.700
Less closet space

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.459
Not all of us have walk-in closets.

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:21.709
A lot of us have just chest drawers and we
don't have as much room to hang up our shirts,

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.590
so by folding them, you take up a lot less
room in your wardrobe.

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.950
Easier to pack

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:33.540
If it's already folded, if you travel a lot
and your shirts are all folded, you could

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:36.750
pick them and quickly put them in your suitcase.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.370
You don't have to spend time folding them

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.560
Those are the big advantages of folded versus
hung.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.109
I'd like to hear from you guys.

00:03:45.109 --> 00:03:48.159
This is a pretty hot debate.

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.049
Keep it civil there in the comments.

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:54.150
One thing I would like to hit on, guys, avoid
wire hangers.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.430
You've heard this.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:56.430
Avoid wire hangers.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.720
I'm going to link you down to Kirby's Hanger
Project.

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:00.099
He makes awesome hangers.

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.709
They're a little bit pricey, but they're the
best hangers out there especially for -- I

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:09.819
mean, if you've got a $1500 or $1000 jacket,
you want to put it on a good suit hanger.

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:16.570
I didn’t really touch on suit hangers, but
for shirts, most hangers are going to be fine.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:22.890
I use a wood cedar hanger that's made specifically
for shirts and not only do I use it because

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:28.760
it's cedar and it helps give my closet a nice
smell, but I also like that it's got a little

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.240
bit thicker area for the shoulders.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:35.910
I also like that it's got the metal hook,
so whenever I'm traveling, I actually use

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.930
a garment bag and I can then take them, and
because it’s metal up there, it doesn’t

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.470
-- plastic can be kind of bulky.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:47.970
But for most men actually, plastic hangers
are going to work fine especially if you let

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:51.870
your shirts -- you pull them out of the washer
and you just put them on the hanger to let

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:52.880
them dry.

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:54.530
The plastic is fine.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:58.950
Otherwise, sometimes if the wood has got a
bit of coloring, it could transfer to a light

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.980
colored dress shirt, so be careful when you're
letting your shirts dry that you don't have

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.000
them on a colored wood hanger.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.200
All right.

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:07.200
That's all I can think of.

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.530
I'd love to see what you guys want to add
in the comments.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:15.640
Don't forget, if you've got more questions
on men's style, go to our new website, mensstyleqa.com.

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:16.640
I'll see you there.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:20.470
The best questions and answers are rising
to the top and that's where I'm going to be

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.710
taking questions and answers and making videos
out of them.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.730
Okay, I'll see you guys in the next video.

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.900
Bye-bye.
