00:00:04.267 --> 00:00:08.267
True pilots never stop because they know that it is speed

00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:10.233
which keeps their aircraft in the air.

00:00:10.333 --> 00:00:12.000
This is “Follow the Leader”!

00:00:22.133 --> 00:00:25.100
As usual, let’s see first how our players managed

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.533
to complete the route from the previous episode.

00:00:27.633 --> 00:00:31.400
The task wasn’t easy, but players showed some impressive results.

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.433
We even decided to change our distribution of gold prizes among the winners.

00:00:35.533 --> 00:00:40.867
Now, even those who were only few seconds behind the leader can still get the main prize.

00:00:40.967 --> 00:00:44.433
Gold prizes will be distributed among the winners the following way:

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:49.467
you can find the replays of the players who were the fastest to complete the route in the description.

00:00:49.567 --> 00:00:52.400
There were plenty of spectacular crashes, of course.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.867
The masters of the artistic “lawn dart” receive one thousand gold each,

00:00:56.967 --> 00:00:59.733
and we now proceed to a new challenge.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:04.367
This route was sent to us by the player

00:01:04.467 --> 00:01:06.867
whose nickname you can see on your screens now,

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:10.233
and he deservedly pockets 6000 gold.

00:01:10.333 --> 00:01:14.567
Take your Heinkel He. 112 to the skies of the Harbor map.

00:02:11.933 --> 00:02:15.567
You need to complete the task as accurately as possible.

00:02:15.667 --> 00:02:17.533
Also, follow the list of key elements.

00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:19.833
You can find it in the description to the video.

00:02:19.933 --> 00:02:20.733
Good luck!

00:02:20.833 --> 00:02:21.900
That’s all for now.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.467
Our e-mail address is the same: tryrepeat@wargaming.net.

00:02:26.567 --> 00:02:30.367
In the e-mail subject, you should put the number of the Follow the Leader episode,

00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:33.533
your nickname, your region – North America or Europe,

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:38.467
as well as the time it took to complete the route or mark it as a “Fail”.

00:02:38.567 --> 00:02:41.167
There were many mistakes in arrangement of previous e-mails,

00:02:41.267 --> 00:02:43.000
so, please, be attentive.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.867
We’re waiting for your replays and your feedback on the new show format.

00:02:46.967 --> 00:02:48.167
See ya!
