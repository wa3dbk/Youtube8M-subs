Hi, this is Gary with MacMost.com.

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:09.460
Let's take a look at Interactive Charts in
Numbers.

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.849
I'm using Numbers version 3 and I'm going
to show you Interactive Charts.

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.050
Regular charts are just static graphics that
appear on the screen.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.679
You can animate them and have them grow.

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:25.359
For instance, you can select this one here
and say create a chart, like a 2D chart, and

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:26.359
there we go we got a chart.

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.119
We have all the data from that in one big
chart.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.949
But sometimes you have data like this where
you want to make it interactive because you

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:35.660
have more than one dimension.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.330
Here we've got, say, the number of sales in
January 2011.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.540
I'd love to be able to go and compare 2011
to 2012 to 2013 to see how sales have grown.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:51.649
So I'm going to select this whole table here,
create a chart, but create an interactive

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:52.649
chart.

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.719
Do an interactive bar chart there.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:01:01.359
I'm going to bring this up and what I get
is there is 2011, and 2012, and 2013 in January

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:02.929
and there is the number of sales.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:06.630
I've got this slider here at the bottom that
I can move.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.230
See there is February, March, April, etc.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.580
So I can move along this bottom here and change
the data in the chart so I can kind of see

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.100
it change over time.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.120
But this isn't quite what I wanted.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.250
What I really wanted is to be able to compare
years.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.050
So I'm going to enter data references here.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:28.960
At the bottom left I can swap things.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.500
Now I'm going to get a chart that shows me
the entire year of 2011 and then I can go

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.590
to 2012 and 2013.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.410
You have basically all the same options as
you have with the regular chart.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.570
Being able to have a Title on, change the
Legend, change the Font, things like that.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.240
You have a few extra options like you can
have Slider and Buttons or just Buttons Only.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.880
So you can just use these right here which
makes more sense if you are talking about

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.490
three years.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:56.960
There are four different styles of interactive
chart.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:00.380
You saw there when I created the chart I had
four choices.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.170
I can change them here.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.250
So I can go to Interactive Bar instead of
column just to view it that way.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:15.519
I can do a Scatter which doesn't make as much
sense for this and I can do a Bubble as well

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.459
which again doesn't make as much sense for
this particular set of data but it is good

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:19.739
to know it is here.

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:23.239
Now the big downside to Interactive Charts
is when you export them to something else,

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:26.080
like say a PDF, they are not going to be interactive
anymore.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.420
So you have to use them inside of Numbers.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:34.739
But since Numbers is available in IOS and
Mac and for PC users via Numbers iCloud then

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:36.469
it becomes a little more useful.

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:40.659
But in general it is kind of useful for you
to be able to see the change or to be able

00:02:40.659 --> 00:02:45.560
to show somebody during a presentation where
you can bring up Numbers and walk them through

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.209
a chart.
