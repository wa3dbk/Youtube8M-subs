00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.729
Easy to grow, Healthy &amp; Delicious when fresh

00:00:04.729 --> 00:00:06.640
Let's look at growing okra

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:13.080
[music]

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.410
So we will be growing two okra varieties today

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:21.140
Emerald and the other variety is called Louisiana
Green Velvet

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.759
And both these varieties are not only very
delicious but also very easy to grow

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.339
So this is our site where we will be growing
our okra

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.020
Its a 4'x4' raised bed

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.290
And what I have done is I have sowed the seeds
directly on these raised beds

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.890
Okras don't like to be transplanted

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.800
Its best if you sow them directly

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:52.260
So you can grow about 25 okra plants ib a
16'' square area

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.670
So at 20 days you can see all the seedlings
have emerged

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:04.460
And you can thin the seedlings so that there
are not multiple plants growing at one place

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.659
But I have noticed that with okra, its OK
to leave a few areas with a few plants

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.689
This is how the plants look like once they
have grown a little bit more

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:21.700
And this is really the time they need to be
fed really well to develop their leaves and

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:22.700
stems

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.359
Now if you are using organic fertilizers,
they take time to decompose

00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:33.020
So you might want to start a least 3 moths
in advance before you reach this stage

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.079
If you are using synthetic fertilizers,they
are readily available to the plants

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:40.780
You could either use a slow release fertilizer
like Shake n Feed

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.619
Or you could use an instant fertilizer

00:01:45.619 --> 00:01:49.409
The instant fertilizers need to be reapplied
every 15 days

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.289
If you are going organic, just make sure you
use a variety of organic matter

00:01:54.289 --> 00:02:00.149
And that's going to supply all the nutrients
that your plants need

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.020
For this raised bed, I went mostly with organic
ingredients

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:08.350
I used an all purpose or balanced fertilizer

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:14.590
And that seemed to do a really good job for
this okra bed

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.440
So as you can se the okras have now started
emerging

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.180
And okra pods will keep forming as long as
the temperatures are good

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:31.440
You need warm to hot temperatures for okra

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.770
And if you've seen our earlier video on growing
okra

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:42.000
You might have realized or known that cool
weather is not a good thing for okra plants

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.840
This is an okra flower

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.950
And okras have no problem with pollination
at all

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:53.530
I never had to pollinate any of my okra flowers
and they all set fruit

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.030
So its now grown to a size where we can harvest
the okra pods

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:05.120
So let's go ahead and do that

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.870
So from a 16 inch square area of growing okra

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:14.960
You can get a lot of pods every day throughout
the growing season

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:20.680
So I would suggest that for a family, a small
family, these many okra plant

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.720
Like about 20 to 25 are quite enough

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.420
Now some of these okra plants did get aphids
and some other insects

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.020
That disfigured some of these leaves that
you see here

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:43.950
But for this batch of okra I never used any
insecticides, including organic ones

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.590
All I did was wash away the aphids that were
sitting on the okra plants by using a water

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.590
hose

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:55.770
That's all I did for getting rid of the insects
om the okra plant

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:01.200
And other than aphids I did not see any other
insects attacking my okra plants

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.590
You can see here the okras are now forming
really well

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:08.950
And soon you will see that all plants will
have a lot of pods

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:11.340
And you will have a big supply of okra coming
up

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:55.570
[music]

00:04:55.570 --> 00:06:27.680
Okra is one vegetable that I always recommend
eating fresh

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:30.370
They just taste so good when they are fresh

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.139
They are nice, crispy and you can make a lot
of things out of it

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:38.490
Now I wanted to show you the difference between
the two varieties that we grew

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:40.680
This is the Emerald Okra

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.219
Its a little bit fatter and less long

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:48.389
This one is the Louisiana green velvet

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:52.680
Long pods, very slender and silky

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:57.189
So bot of these are great varieties to grow;
they are just different

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:02.270
So at the end of the season, the okra plants
that I am growing are about 10 foot tall now

00:07:02.270 --> 00:07:07.199
So I had to cut off some of the tips so I
could harvest them easily

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:09.919
And okra is a very prolific grower

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:13.580
At least these two varieties grow really well

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:16.669
As long as you take basic care of it

00:07:16.669 --> 00:07:21.339
So I hope you enjoyed this video on growing
okra in raised beds

00:07:21.339 --> 00:07:25.389
And I hope this inspires you to grow okra
in your garden

00:07:25.389 --> 00:07:27.099
I'll see you again soon...

00:07:27.099 --> 00:07:28.099
Happy Gardening!!

00:07:28.099 --> 00:07:28.100
