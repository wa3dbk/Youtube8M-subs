00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.180
Welcome back to the Hobby Shop Studios
here in Los Angeles. We're continuing our

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.450
series on tips and tricks and how-to
videos for the Sonic Port VX.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.900
This one's gonna deal primarily with
recording drums, which might sound like an

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.910
odd thing,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.940
but many famous drum tracks were
recorded with just one microphone.

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.140
"Are You Gonna Go My Way" by Lenny Kravitz is one example. So we've got a drum kit here

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.550
and we're gonna actually mic it up using
just the Sonic Port VX microphones.

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:30.380
Okay, so now we're ready to record some drums. My friend Till Richter is here to play

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.480
some drums for us.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:35.300
Hi Till! Thank you. There are a few things to keep in mind when you're trying to

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.040
record an entire drum kit

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.110
with one single mic – either a mono or a
stereo mic – there are few things to keep

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:41.860
in mind.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:44.720
For one, the entire

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.190
sound of the drum kit is something you
have to take into consideration, and in

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:52.260
these situations it's often not a good
idea to play a lot of splashy

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.400
cymbals because they can be louder than
the entire drum kit.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.260
As well oftentimes you can get a very
big sound by

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.519
not hitting the drums quite so hard so
the transient is about the same level

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.719
as the sustain of the drum. 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.040
So, when you're positioning the mic

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.430
to capture an entire drum kit like this,
it's critical that you know exactly where

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.960
to put the mic based upon what you wanna
hear.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.140
Changing the position of the mic just
a little bit will affect the sound a lot

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.700
so

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.840
one the ways you can do this is by
sticking one finger in your ear

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.550
and listening to the entire drum kit
with only one ear and this basically

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.690
means that you won't be hearing any
bounce off of the back of the wall.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.390
So you'll be hearing more like what the
mic will actually be listening to you as

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.170
you move it, so

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.870
to simulate this I'm gonna have Till play, and I'm gonna move the mic around in a

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.250
couple different places so you can hear how much the sound changes

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.170
from place to place. 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.240
So I'm using the mic in stereo mode. I have the mic pre at about 5,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.479
and I'm running into the RØDE Record
app which is kinda cool because it'll actually

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.970
write wave forms in real time for me in
stereo so I can watch it. So if I push

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:58.520
record...

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.360
Now it's recording, and I'll ask young Till to play a groove.

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:40.110
Okay so you can tell there's a huge
difference between all those mic

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.280
positions.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.600
So as the mic is closer to the floor you
get much more kick drum. As the mic is

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.600
raised in the room you get more of a balance of kick, snare and hat.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.300
So your job is going to be listening
with that one finger in your

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.840
ear to decide what balance of the instruments you want. Maybe you want

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:55.940
a lot of kick drum on one thing,

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.020
or maybe you want it to be a much more
balanced sound. So one of the things that's

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.610
common to do in the studio

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:05.910
is to process drum tracks like these
through various effects. One of the things

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.620
that this responds to very well is
inordinate amounts of compression.

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.730
So I'm gonna have Till play again and
this time the audio you'll be hearing –

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.320
still recorded with the Sonic Port VX – but it will be processed through a plugin

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.700
for extreme compression at the end.
So let's see what that does.

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:23.080
We're recording.

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.140
Here you go.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.040
So you can see that the drums really
benefit from all that extra compression. It

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.200
helps glue all of those individual drums
into one sort of

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.420
smooshy rock sound which is a very
desirable sound for lots of modern

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:57.090
record making.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.450
Now there's something else you can do. As opposed to doing that in post-production

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.360
you can do that right on the fly

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:05.660
by running Sonic Port through Mobile POD
first

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:09.800
and into something like GarageBand or
Cubasis or Auria or something like that.

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:12.740
So you're processing and making those
choices on the way in.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.540
So now I'm going to set up the iPad for Mobile POD, and we're going to do the same thing only

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.799
processing it with the guitar sounds in
Mobile POD, as opposed to

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:25.000
some sort of post effect. So now I've got the iPad set up to record the output of Mobile POD

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.080
into GarageBand.

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.090
and I'm gonna use a traditional rock guitar
sound to process the drums.

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.770
So you can see from the signal here I've got a Plexi-ish kind of an amp.

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.950
I've got a 4x12 cabinet and an EQ

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.610
to add some lows and low mids to help beef up the kick drum.

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.820
So now when I push record, you're gonna be hearing

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:47.830
the output of Mobile POD process the drums.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:49.330
So,

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:51.380
back into position.

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:52.480
Here we go.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:07.850
So you can see that recording drums with
one stationary microphone isn't as crazy

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:08.940
as you might have thought,

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.420
and adding crunch with Mobile POD for
some of those rock-and-roll room sounds

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.960
can really add dimensions to recordings.
So check out all the videos in the series

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.170
and then head down to your store

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.530
and pick up a Sonic Port VX today and get
recording. Thanks and cheers.
