00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.270
Naval warfare in the future could be waged
by robotic eels.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:08.350
And scientists at the University of Colorado
have discovered an invisible doughnut-shaped

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:14.740
shield roughly 7,200 miles above Earth - comprised
of high energy-electrons and protons that

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.359
protect us from "killer electrons!“

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:23.529
Vsauce! Kevin here - this is Mind Blow.

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:29.060
Every password you use can be replaced by
your eyeball. Myris converts the one-of-kind

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:35.469
characteristics of your iris into an encrypted
code unique to you. The device stores no data,

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:40.190
not even an image of your eye, so you won’t
have to worry about someone stealing your

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.890
password. And it features a significantly
lower false ID acceptance rate compared to

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:51.730
voice recognition, fingerprints or facial
recognition at 1 in 1.5 million. So no more

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.789
usernames - no more passwords - only eyeball.

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.850
This Lego Body is controlled by an implanted
worm brain. The Open Worm project has mapped

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:08.850
the connections between the worm’s 302 neurons
and simulates them in software. The Lego robot

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.409
mimics the behavior of an actual worm, ceasing
to move when its nose sensor bumps into a

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.880
wall, avoiding being touched, and moving forward
when its food sensor is stimulated. This could

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.329
someday lead to technology that simulates
a human brain, which would revolutionize computers

00:01:25.329 --> 00:01:27.079
and artificial intelligence.

00:01:27.079 --> 00:01:34.079
An 800 page book from 1692 contains a hand-painted
archive of every color. Created by someone

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.880
known simply as “A. Boogert” it was intended
to be an educational guide on how to mix and

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.210
identify colors. Find the link below to view
the entire book in high res.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.950
Ultrasound creates 3D objects that can be
seen and felt in mid-air. Developed at the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.210
University of Bristol - it focuses complex
patterns of ultrasound and these shapes can

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.030
be felt and manipulated in real time. Potential
for this includes allowing surgeons to explore

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.270
a CT scan by feeling a disease such as a tumor.

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.069
Eva is the world's first smart shower device.
Designed to save water, it can be attached

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:16.290
to any existing shower head, and uses motion
sensors to adjust how much water flows depending

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.040
upon how close you are. They claim it save
up to 50% of water usage and it can also monitor

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.160
water temperature so the shower starts exactly
as warm as you like it.

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:33.340
Electric eels discharge electricity similarly
to a taser. They stuns their prey with high

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.459
voltage 10-15 millisecond pulses, and can
use electricity to force hiding animals to

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:44.390
give away their locations. They overwhelm
the nerves that control the muscles, causing

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.959
them to involuntarily contract. They're basically
biological tasers.

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:54.319
Full facial transplants are possible thanks
to 3D printing. A 3D model of a patient’s

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:59.489
head is constructed using CAT scans and then
printed which tells surgeons where the vessels

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:05.489
are to match the tissues perfectly - which
is integral in the healing process of transplanting

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:11.489
a new face. And nine of these procedures have
occurred in the US since 2011.

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.530
Researchers in South Korea have developed
an artificial skin designed to mimic real

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:21.159
human skin. The stretchable polymer features
networks of sensors made of gold and silicon

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:26.959
that senses touch, pressure, and moisture.
It could give artificial limbs feeling and

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:32.470
even has a layer of actuators that warm it
up to the same temperature as human skin.

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:38.239
Stanford University researchers have created
a climbing system to scale walls like a gecko.

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.330
The sticky-pads were inspired by gecko toes
which are extremely sticky due to being covered

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:49.689
with thin, long spatula-shaped structures
that increase surface area and amplify electrical

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:54.909
attractions between the toes and a surface.
This adhesive could be used to make grippers

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:59.470
for manipulating huge objects without the
need for suction power or chemical glues.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:06.069
Finally, VeloX 3 is a human-powered bicycle
capable of reaching 83 mph and the team at

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:09.629
Delft University is currently working on breaking
their own record with VeloX IV.

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:16.789
I am holding a stainable chain in my hand. This is a special chain developed by DSM. The rollers, are made of a stainable plastic.

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:24.860
To lower the friction, and steel to steel friction is higher than the steel to plastic friction. So what we have 1 like 1% in efficiency.

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:27.640
This will contribute definitely to getting higher speeds.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:32.620
I’m gonna leave you with a virtual reality
game inspired by lucid dreaming - and as always

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:34.190
- thanks for watching!
