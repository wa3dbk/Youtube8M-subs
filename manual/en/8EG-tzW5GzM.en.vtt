00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.560
Analogue. To the right, isn't it?

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.120
Yes, until it clicks.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.360
Until it clicks.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:07.960
Children who watch this won't know.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.560
Hi, I'm Melissa, On The Beat for you today,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.040
not at boring Friedrichstadtpalast,

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.360
but at Lomo Caterpillar in Berlin.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.080
Let me show you what we're doing here.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.160
How stylish. You can wear it as a pendant.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.560
You may have seen the clip on the website

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.600
of what we're doing today.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.000
This event is global,

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.560
it's happening in all our gallery stores,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.400
in London, in Paris, in Chicago, New York...

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.640
I have several cameras like this.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.800
And we pass one camera from the back end

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.520
of our caterpillar to the front.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.160
I think I blinked. Can we check and delete it?

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.920
No, that's not possible.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.880
You have to take what you get.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.640
The special thing about analogue photography

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.760
I think is that you never know what happens.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:21.280
Right. You can't check

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.240
if you look bad and delete it.

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.480
That's right.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.240
Sometimes people make more of an effort

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.560
to make a friendly face or...

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.600
not grimace like they normally do.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.080
Grimacing is great. Let's grimace.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.120
Berlin can be so pretty when the sun is out.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.920
I'll set the camera again and you point it

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.280
at your feet before you pass it on.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.960
-4 degrees Celsius.

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.520
I can't find the shutter release. I press

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.720
the wrong button. Tell me, digital or analogue?

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:21.960
Both.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.480
What was your best photograph ever?

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.800
Your winning shot? Naked women?

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:29.240
No, of the last ten the best one is...

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.040
me at the TV tower.

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.800
It's a bit like a school trip.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.240
We should march in pairs and hold hands.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.560
I'd say let's form a queue,

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.480
and take a picture of the person in front of you.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.720
Then the Brandenburg Gate is in the picture.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.320
How often are you at the Brandenburg Gate?

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:55.360
Hardly ever. Maybe twice a year.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.640
True Berliners rarely come here.

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.400
What would they do here? Smack tourists?

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.200
What's your best photo grimace?

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.880
My best photo grimace?

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.000
What's so cool about analogue photography?

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:12.800
The surprise element.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.600
You never know what you get.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.680
Let me explain it for those youngsters

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.880
who may not get it. It's like Instagram,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.880
but for real. You can't see what you took,

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.480
you have to wait. You have to take it

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.880
to a lab for developing with secret liquids.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.480
They'll mail them to you or you collect them

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.800
and only then you see what you did.

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.200
There, you have to turn.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.360
Where?

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:07.880
Up here, the silver one.

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.600
Thanks for watching. This was On The Beat

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.520
at the Lomo Caterpillar. I hope you had fun.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.160
Subscribe to the channel and let me know

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.160
about your best picture ever.

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.360
I want to know. See you next time.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.680
To do life-sized self-portraits,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.000
60x200, is unthinkable,

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.920
it's impossible with normal photography.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:44.800
And it's instant, too.

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.800
