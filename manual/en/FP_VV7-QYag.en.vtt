00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:05.520
Pitching drills.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.930
There are a number of different pitching drills
pitchers can do to improve their performance.

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.690
Many of them involve being on the mound, and
others involve being off to the side.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.470
For instance, there is the towel drill.

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:20.800
Where a pitcher will hold the towel between
the pointer finger and middle finger, go through

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.020
his delivery, and smack down upon a partners
glove, or a bucket to work on an effective

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:27.800
follow through upon delivery.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.210
Another effective pitching drill is long toss.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.270
Where pitchers start at 50 feet apart, and
progress further and further away, until they're

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:39.620
2 to 300 feet away from each other, extending
the distance of throwing that long toss.

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.550
Another drill is spot drills.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.880
In spot drills, pitchers will partner up from
20 to 25 feet away, and work on throwing a

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:52.080
fastball, curveball, and change up from 20
to 25 feet away to a partner.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.490
Another effective drill would be therapeutic
bends.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.719
Therapeutic bends enable pitchers to improve
their arm strength, and maintain a healthy

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:04.840
arm by doing a variety of drills, including
internal and external rotation.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:08.240
The balance beam drill is a drill in which
pitchers will balance themselves, either on

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.290
a balance beam, or a bleacher, and hold the
balance point position to master effective

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.979
fluid balance point.

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.789
The ball up drill is a drill in which pitchers
will watch their arms as they release the

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:26.789
ball from the glove, or separate their hands,
and get into an effective arm.

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:31.810
Pitchers can do this in front of a mirror,
or watch as they lift the ball above their

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:34.670
shoulder in various grips.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:39.289
Medicine ball drills will enable pitchers
to incorporate their hips more effectively

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:44.170
in their delivery, and allow them to pitch
deeper into their games, as well as, throw

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.959
higher gun speeds on the radar gun.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:50.400
Pitching drills are the key to becoming a
better player.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.289
It's not enough to throw off the mound in
a game or practice.

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.399
Pitchers can work on these various drills
to improve their performance, to achieve higher

00:01:58.399 --> 00:02:01.570
pitch velocities, and better command of each
of their pitches.
