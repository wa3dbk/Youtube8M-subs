00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.969
Bob: Hey everybody. Welcome to Know Your PC. I'm Bob.
Malou: And I'm Malou, and today

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:14.130
we're going to to show you how to perform a
recovery on your computer and we'll

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.380
demonstrate that with the HP TouchSmart PC,
this beautiful iq500 series.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.410
Bob: Now this recovery process will also work
with any HP desktop that's pre-installed

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.320
with Windows Vista.
Malou: Alright so why would you want to perfrom a recovery?

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.189
Bob: Good question.

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.210
Malou: Okay, so if you've

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.239
added any files that maybe have corrupted
your computer, maybe some viruses, or

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:34.940
maybe you added some things that you
don't want anymore and you want to take it back

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:37.989
to where it was when you first bought it. A recovery will help you take your

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.180
computer right back to the way was out of the box.
Bob: Now this is a last resort okay?

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.550
so make sure that you try other
options, which we can show you

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.390
in another segment, before going all the
way to the full system recovery. So

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.580
I'm going to talk to you guys about the
factory image.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.090
So I'm going to press Start,

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:56.390
and I'm going to go to

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.420
Computer

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.889
and

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:01.449
you'll see it says Factory Image. Now this
is a partition in your hard drive.

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:05.420
You will be able to recover your
computer back to this factory image,

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.390
which again as Malou said, is just like
if you take it out of the box and start it up

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:09.300
for the first time.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.500
For some reason,

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.219
maybe that image gets corrupted, which can
happen.

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:15.930
We'd recommend getting recovery discs.
Now you can

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.210
create them, which we created in another
segment, or you can buy them from hp.com.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:22.549
Malou: So you're showing us the partition because 
we're going to show you how to recover

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.240
your system through that factory image.
So before you get started make sure

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.039
that everything is unplugged, all the
peripherals, you want to make sure the

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:32.369
scanner is not plugged in, or any external hard
drives, or a printer. So let's start with that.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.420
Bob: So I'm going to unplug our external hard drive and our printer
Malou:  Just an important

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.610
reminder that a full system recovery
will delete all the files,

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:43.280
all the programs, documents that
you added to your computer

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.860
after you bought it. So make sure that you 
back everything up before you do this.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:49.950
Bob: An in detail written description 
of what we're performing

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.530
is in our limited warranty guide for
the HP TouchSmart,

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.130
and your troubleshooting and maintenance
guide for HP desktop so if you want to

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.960
read more about what we're talking about

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.380
you can get them in these manuals. 
Malou: Now there are a

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.630
few ways that you can perform a system recovery.
Bob: One way we showed in another

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.699
segment was to create recovery discs,

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:08.720
and you recover from these discs.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.959
You can create them yourself or 
you can also get them from hp.com. If you're

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.160
going to recover from the discs, make
sure that your computer is on, insert

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.259
your disc into the drive,

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:20.309
restart your computer, and when the
computer starts up it'll go right into

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:23.879
your recovery wizard and follow those steps.
Malou: Two other ways that you can launch the

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:25.419
system recovery manager -

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:28.839
First, I will show you one with the
computer being on as you see right here.

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:32.959
Okay so I'm going to touch the Windows
icon right here in the left corner here. From there

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.889
I will go to All Programs,

00:02:35.889 --> 00:02:37.559
PC Help and Tools,

00:02:37.559 --> 00:02:41.809
then you'll see Recovery Manager. Okay, so
there I will touch Recovery Manager.

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:45.719
It's asking my permission to continue. I will click Continue. 
Bob: Permission granted.

00:02:45.719 --> 00:02:46.839
Malou: Thank you, Bob.

00:02:46.839 --> 00:02:49.879
Then we see "Welcome to the Recovery Manager." 
Alright so on the screen,

00:02:49.879 --> 00:02:52.900
there's a button here that says advanced
options. Look at the list right there of

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:56.280
the advanced options. There might be
something in there that you want to try

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.760
that you maybe haven't tried before, that
will fix your problem. Now I'm going to go ahead

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.509
and take you back to the recovery here,
so I'm going to take you to the wizard.

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:06.739
Just wanted to show you advanced options.
"Welcome to the Recovery Manager".

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.769
From there we will touch Next.

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:11.849
Then it's going to ask you a series of
questions, okay? So the first one right

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.040
here says "Reinstall software programs that came with your computer?" 
Bob: No, we do not

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.940
want to do that.

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:18.330
Malou: No, we don't want to do that. So I'm going to touch No.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.230
Then you touch Next. Next question says
Reinstall hardware drivers that came

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:22.399
with your computer.

00:03:22.399 --> 00:03:26.259
Bob: No we don't want to do that either.
Malou: We don't want to do that either. So I'm going to touch Next. 

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:27.969
Alright the next question here

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:31.879
says "Microsoft system restore. Now this is important. 
Bob: It means do you want to go

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:34.959
back in time to an earlier point,
which your computer saved,

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.399
and start running your computer from that
point. We don't want to do that.

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:41.840
Malou: We want to recover, so that's a completely different thing. 
So we're going to say No.

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.090
This is the screen that we were looking for. 
It says "Recover your computer to its

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:46.769
original factory condition."

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.679
I'm going to touch Yes. That's exactly what
I want to do. So I'm going to touch Yes,

00:03:50.679 --> 00:03:54.159
and then I would touch Next, but
I'm not going to do it here because Bob's going to show you

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.009
another way to launch the

00:03:57.009 --> 00:03:59.180
recovery manager.
Bob: That's right. So I will cancel out of this.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:02.600
Now let's say that your computer turns
on, you get an image,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.339
but it will not launch into your
Windows home page.

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:08.240
So you can't press Start there's
none of this stuff going on,

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.370
so you can't do what Malou here showed you.
Malou: It a different challenge for you, Bob.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.420
Bob: It's a different challenge. I'm going to restart the
computer to pretend like we're turning

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.579
to the computer on and we can't get to where we want to go.

00:04:16.579 --> 00:04:17.879
So I'm going to press Start,

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:21.999
and I want to go to the arrow key. I'm going to press Restart.

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:24.789
Malou: So maybe this is what you're seeing for the first time, right?
Bob: Right, so  it will

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:29.690
turn on, there will be this blue screen that says HP, and it really doesn't do anything else after that.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.910
So get your figure ready because you're
going to press the F11 key

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.500
on your keyboard and you're going to need to press it repeatedly once this blue HP sign

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.890
comes on. Here we go. 
Keep pressing F11.

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:42.919
So I'm pressing F11. It says right
here "System Recovery".

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:44.319
That's where we want to go.

00:04:44.319 --> 00:04:48.439
And again this is if you can't get to
the system recovery the way Malou showed you

00:04:48.439 --> 00:04:50.460
because you don't have access to your
Windows.

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.500
Again we'll take another chance to say
backup all your files,

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.510
Do not do a system recovery without

00:04:55.510 --> 00:04:56.860
backing up all your files.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.479
We'll stop pressing F11 when the page
comes up the says recovery manager.

00:05:01.479 --> 00:05:02.720
We're almost there.

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:03.340
Here we go.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.440
It says "Welcome to recovery manager." It looks a lot like the

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.090
thing that

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:08.130
Malou just showed you.

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.870
You'll see also down here in advanced
options. Let me...

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.740
wait a second. Touch is not enabled on this screen.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.269
You have to use the mouse.

00:05:15.269 --> 00:05:20.139
Click on the mouse and there's fewer 
options in the Advanced Options button.

00:05:20.139 --> 00:05:24.210
One of them is pretty key though. It says
Microsoft Startup Repair Tool. Maybe

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.169
your computer's fine, but something's wrong
with trying to get it started up. So if you click that,

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.990
try and repair that startup issue. If that
doesn't work,

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:32.800
full system recovery.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.430
I will get back to the wizard by pressing back, and then I will go to Next.

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:39.520
It's going to ask about that Microsoft system
restore. Again, that's going back in

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.580
time to an earlier point in the computer.
We don't want to do that.

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.210
We're going to restart the whole thing.

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:48.340
So I will press No I would not like to
do that. I want to see other options. Next.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.479
It says system recovery. Do you want to do a system recovery? Yes, and I'll click Next and

00:05:52.479 --> 00:05:56.659
then again it says "Backup all your files
first (recommended)", or "Recover without

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:58.550
backing up your files". We already did that,

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.150
but you guys, again, make sure you
backup all your files.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.540
So then I will push "Recover without backing up your files"
and then you click Next.

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.710
Now this will take about 15 minutes
so you're going to want to stick around. You don't

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:12.070
need to go shopping or something like that.
Malou: And make sure you don't touch the computer at all,

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:13.840
don't turn it off. Leave it on.

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:16.480
Bob: So we'll see you after we fast for this
segment,

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:19.089
and we'll come back and show you what
happens afterwards.

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:21.610
Malou: Okay now we're done. It says "Recovery is complete".

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:25.580
Click on finish and you're back to where you  started
when you got your computer right out of the box.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:28.059
Bob: I love everything all fresh and clean and new.

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:31.389
That also means you have to go back
through your startup pages again get all

00:06:31.389 --> 00:06:33.599
your settings back the way you had them,

00:06:33.599 --> 00:06:37.030
make sure you get your anti-virus
software reinstalled, make sure you put

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:40.490
back any programs that you might have
downloaded or have on discs, and of

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.939
course

00:06:40.939 --> 00:06:45.219
put all them crazy files back on. Your
music, your pictures. Have fun. Get your computer

00:06:45.219 --> 00:06:47.970
back up and running to its original place.

00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.919
Malou: Hopefully you'll never have to perform a
recovery but if you do,

00:06:50.919 --> 00:06:54.979
now you know! If you have any questions
just log on to our website at hp.com/support

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:59.199
Bob: Or you can watch more
of our videos at youtube.com/touchsmart

00:06:59.789 --> 00:07:02.769
Thanks again for watching. I'm Bob.
Malou: And I'm Malou. We'll see ya next time!
