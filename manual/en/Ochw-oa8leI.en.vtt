Waddup people! Welcome to "Without Alcohol"

00:00:01.568 --> 00:00:02.060
i'm Mike

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.745
and today we'll be making the Pi単a Colada

00:00:03.745 --> 00:00:06.467
only this is Without Alcohol so it's the Pi単a CoNada

00:00:06.467 --> 00:00:07.087
Let's go..

00:00:08.821 --> 00:00:11.447
Let's start again with everything you need for this drink

00:00:11.447 --> 00:00:14.135
and this time that's a Pineapple

00:00:14.135 --> 00:00:14.724
BAM!

00:00:14.724 --> 00:00:17.317
but if you can't find a fresh one, just use canned pineapple

00:00:17.317 --> 00:00:19.936
and uhmm.. i was smart enough to not have a can opener

00:00:19.936 --> 00:00:21.359
so i have to use the fresh one

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.627
next to that we need coconut milk.. you can find it in a can
or bla bla bla bla...

00:00:24.627 --> 00:00:26.801
crushed ice, a cutting board and a knife of course

00:00:26.801 --> 00:00:28.050
to cut the pineapple

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.305
and a blender

00:00:29.305 --> 00:00:31.148
and let's begin with the drink

00:00:31.821 --> 00:00:34.252
the first thing we do ofcourse is cut the pineapple

00:00:34.252 --> 00:00:37.460
grab the pineapple, put it on the board and take your knife

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.174
or that thing that's made specially to cut a pineapple

00:00:41.174 --> 00:00:43.331
first thing to do... cut the top off

00:00:43.331 --> 00:00:45.082
like this.... bam!

00:00:45.082 --> 00:00:47.331
you put that to the side, and safe it for later

00:00:47.331 --> 00:00:49.113
as decoration or something like that

00:00:49.113 --> 00:00:51.239
and then you put like this

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.663
and then you slowly cut the peel off

00:00:55.944 --> 00:00:58.727
make sure you cut away all these brown pieces

00:00:58.727 --> 00:01:01.369
or else it will mess up your mouth from the inside

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:03.872
so just take it off from every side

00:01:03.872 --> 00:01:05.763
till the peel is all off

00:01:05.763 --> 00:01:06.544
yeaaah...

00:01:06.544 --> 00:01:09.755
and just cut it till its..........

00:01:10.878 --> 00:01:12.878
........nice and edible

00:01:13.378 --> 00:01:15.127
and make sure you washed your hands

00:01:15.127 --> 00:01:17.127
ow! and don't forget to remove the bottem

00:01:17.736 --> 00:01:19.344
you should have done that at beginning of it

00:01:19.344 --> 00:01:21.344
then just throw all peels away

00:01:21.657 --> 00:01:22.646
and then you'll continue cutting it

00:01:22.646 --> 00:01:24.646
first you cut it in half

00:01:24.646 --> 00:01:26.646
from top to bottem

00:01:26.865 --> 00:01:28.660
and actually we only need half right now

00:01:29.068 --> 00:01:31.006
and then we cut it again through the middle

00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:33.466
then one of the more important things 
is that you cut off the inner part

00:01:33.466 --> 00:01:37.386
this piece... cause it's hard as hell... and you can't eat it

00:01:37.386 --> 00:01:42.577
bla bla bla (nonsense talk) 
- something about a clock and a house -

00:01:42.577 --> 00:01:45.033
and yeaah.. this all is totally edible

00:01:45.033 --> 00:01:48.831
and ofcourse like the other pieces you remove the inner part

00:01:48.831 --> 00:01:50.847
and then we'll just cut the pineapple again

00:01:50.847 --> 00:01:53.880
just small pieces or cubes.. i dunno

00:01:54.386 --> 00:01:55.071
boom!...

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.111
and the other part as well

00:02:00.424 --> 00:02:03.030
and if you're done with that, just put it in the blender

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.093
so just pick it up and throw it in! voila!

00:02:07.064 --> 00:02:08.540
and also the other pieces... voila!

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.714
and then wash your hands

00:02:09.714 --> 00:02:12.420
and when the pineapple is in, grab the coconut milk

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.765
and open the can

00:02:13.765 --> 00:02:17.499
i already opened it.. cause i cooked with it... it's nice...

00:02:17.499 --> 00:02:19.995
and then just pour it in..

00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:23.876
around 200ml to a half of a pineaplle

00:02:23.883 --> 00:02:25.883
and then just add the crushed ice

00:02:26.225 --> 00:02:27.701
just like this..

00:02:28.016 --> 00:02:30.643
fill it up... and i'm dropping it all on my floor, but who cares!

00:02:30.643 --> 00:02:33.069
and then just put on the lid and let's blend!

00:02:34.643 --> 00:02:37.559
- annoying blender sounds -

00:02:40.842 --> 00:02:42.842
.....and that's the most important of course... don't forget!

00:02:43.034 --> 00:02:46.256
so you blend it till it's all liquid, and then you pour it in

00:02:46.256 --> 00:02:47.453
only i forgot my glass

00:02:47.453 --> 00:02:48.477
so GRAB a glass

00:02:48.477 --> 00:02:50.912
take this thing off and pour it in the glass

00:02:50.912 --> 00:02:52.912
ooooooooooooehyeaaaah...

00:02:53.911 --> 00:02:55.529
then you finish it with a straw

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:57.679
and ofcourse a piece of pineapple on the rim

00:02:57.679 --> 00:02:59.679
and KABLAM!! the Pi単a CoNada

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:01.596
and then my favorite moment.... tasting it!

00:03:01.597 --> 00:03:04.201
i can't wait people... here we gooo

00:03:04.762 --> 00:03:06.460
oww... ow yeah!

00:03:07.581 --> 00:03:09.581
woeeh... so tropical

00:03:11.332 --> 00:03:13.205
allright... brain freeze!

00:03:13.205 --> 00:03:15.205
but it's really nice and tropical

00:03:15.205 --> 00:03:17.954
cause you just taste............... tropical

00:03:17.954 --> 00:03:20.573
and it's this yummie... i drank it in one go

00:03:20.573 --> 00:03:21.773
but thankfully i got more

00:03:28.148 --> 00:03:30.026
but this is all.. another episode of "Without Alcohol"

00:03:30.026 --> 00:03:31.611

00:03:31.611 --> 00:03:33.089
