00:00:00.963 --> 00:00:05.130
- Here's your consumer robot,
batteries not included.

00:00:06.419 --> 00:00:09.836
(electronic dance music)

00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.918
Forward Thinking attended CES 2015

00:00:14.918 --> 00:00:17.807
Consumer Electronics Trade
Show that's all about

00:00:17.807 --> 00:00:19.606
incorporating the tech of tomorrow

00:00:19.606 --> 00:00:21.329
into the products of today.

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:23.302
What did we discover while we were there?

00:00:23.302 --> 00:00:25.302
Come along and find out.

00:00:26.629 --> 00:00:30.256
You know, one of the
biggest stories at CES is

00:00:30.256 --> 00:00:31.434
all about robotics.

00:00:31.434 --> 00:00:34.904
I'm here at ABBs booth
and the robot behind me

00:00:34.904 --> 00:00:38.686
is the same sort of robot
that welds car doors onto cars

00:00:38.686 --> 00:00:40.233
I mean it has incredible precision.

00:00:40.233 --> 00:00:41.907
But now it's kinda moved up in the world.

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:43.984
It's all in show business you see,

00:00:43.984 --> 00:00:47.000
it has software that maps the
images on the screen to the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.566
robotics's arm motions
so that you can create

00:00:49.566 --> 00:00:52.528
an incredible eye-catching display.

00:00:52.528 --> 00:00:55.231
You know the real story about
robotics in the consumer world

00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:57.655
is that we often focus
on the cutting edge,

00:00:57.655 --> 00:01:00.583
the leading information
on artificial intelligence

00:01:00.583 --> 00:01:02.136
and robotic movement.

00:01:02.136 --> 00:01:04.668
But here we're seeing the
building blocks for what robots

00:01:04.668 --> 00:01:07.978
are really going to be
like in our everyday lives.

00:01:07.978 --> 00:01:10.615
We've seen a lot more
robots that are meant for

00:01:10.615 --> 00:01:12.185
interpersonal communication,

00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:15.432
interacting directly
with humans here at CES.

00:01:15.432 --> 00:01:19.002
For example, Future Robot has
this one that can track your

00:01:19.002 --> 00:01:23.173
eye motion and react to
your facial expressions.

00:01:23.173 --> 00:01:24.788
I think she digs me.

00:01:24.788 --> 00:01:27.514
And this little guy from
Opobotics captured our hearts

00:01:27.514 --> 00:01:29.286
by fetching us a soft drink.

00:01:29.286 --> 00:01:32.460
But beyond that, we've seen
a lot of robots specifically

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.411
dedicated to education.

00:01:34.411 --> 00:01:37.443
Our friends from Modular
Robotics are back and once again

00:01:37.443 --> 00:01:39.708
they showed off their amazing robotics.

00:01:39.708 --> 00:01:41.961
These little modules
represent everything from

00:01:41.961 --> 00:01:45.371
battery power, to sensors, to actuators

00:01:45.371 --> 00:01:47.773
and when you put them all
together you can make a robot do

00:01:47.773 --> 00:01:51.230
pretty much anything your
imagination let's you do.

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.807
Over at Ozobots these super
cute little guys actually teach

00:01:54.807 --> 00:01:58.226
a valuable lesson in logical sequencing.

00:01:58.226 --> 00:02:01.234
They follow different colors
of lines but then you can

00:02:01.234 --> 00:02:04.062
create the rules they follow
so when they encounter

00:02:04.062 --> 00:02:06.877
a different color they
change their behavior.

00:02:06.877 --> 00:02:09.405
It teaches kids logical sequencing.

00:02:09.405 --> 00:02:12.030
It gives them a love of
programming early on so that they

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.541
pursue that later in
life, I love this idea.

00:02:15.541 --> 00:02:18.594
Then over at Actobotics if
you want to build a robot,

00:02:18.594 --> 00:02:20.383
they've got all the parts you need.

00:02:20.383 --> 00:02:23.519
Everything from gyroscopic
robots that can stand upright

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.041
on two wheels to, well pretty
much your imagination's

00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:28.299
the only limit there.

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:31.252
Now I think the most
important robot I encountered

00:02:31.252 --> 00:02:33.753
was from Five Elements Robotics

00:02:33.753 --> 00:02:36.005
because it let me carry my coat around

00:02:36.005 --> 00:02:37.707
without me having to hold it.

00:02:37.707 --> 00:02:40.361
It would just follow me
around the show floor which is

00:02:40.361 --> 00:02:41.779
pretty awesome.

00:02:41.779 --> 00:02:45.926
We're seeing sensor technology
and motion technology

00:02:45.926 --> 00:02:49.032
come down in price so that we
can actually incorporate them

00:02:49.032 --> 00:02:51.926
into robots that you and
I can get our hands on.

00:02:51.926 --> 00:02:53.899
Now you might think some of
the robots we've covered today

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:56.557
are silly or superfluous
but I'm here to tell you

00:02:56.557 --> 00:02:59.781
these are laying the foundation
for robotics in the future.

00:02:59.781 --> 00:03:03.549
The accessories, the
sensors, the actuators

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:05.804
are all coming down in price
so we're finally getting

00:03:05.804 --> 00:03:08.835
to access something that
used to be bleeding-edge

00:03:08.835 --> 00:03:11.420
research and development
just a couple of years ago.

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:13.690
This is how the future happens.

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.496
I'm really excited and who
knows, maybe at CES 2016

00:03:17.496 --> 00:03:20.276
I'll finally get that robo-butler
I've been waiting for.

00:03:20.276 --> 00:03:21.725
But I've got a question
for all of you guys,

00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:23.891
if you could design a
robot of your very own

00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:25.007
what would it do?

00:03:25.007 --> 00:03:26.631
Let me know in the comments below.

00:03:26.631 --> 00:03:28.536
