00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:07.240
We generally have two kinds of yeast. We have
one that is called dry yeast. This application

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:16.830
is the dry yeast. This application, this kind
of yeast, is designed to work in the breads

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.950
where you want a quick result. You are in
a hurry. You want to make the bread rise fast.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:33.480
It is easy to transport. It doesn't go bad
and it is easy to work with. It is recommended

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.060
to be dissolved in water before you put in
to your dough but you put in the dough dry

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:46.410
as it is. It is very very easy to work with.
Has a little bit of a funny smell to it and

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.440
is for a fast track making bread. Then we
got another kind of yeast that is called a

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.120
fresh yeast. This yeast, you got to be very
cautious to work with it. It has to be refrigerated.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.360
If you want to keep it for a long period of
time, it has to be frozen. It could be extremely

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.681
toxic very fast. So, if you ever use this
at home, you got to be very careful how you

00:01:12.681 --> 00:01:18.740
manage this. A bad yeast, a raw yeast could
really get you sick. And this is what you

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.200
call a natural yeast. This is a little bit
harder to work with because this is recommended

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:31.170
to be dissolve in warm water with just a pinch
of sugar at times, if you want to. Dissolve

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.210
it so it will get all over the dough rather
than just part of the dough. So this is an

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:44.440
more authentic yeast for breads such as baguette
or the ciabatta that I mentioned. Or breads

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.829
that need to sit for a long time, like our
ciabatta sits for 18 hours. Long time you

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:56.290
want to used the slower paced yeast which
is the natural yeast. Sometimes they call

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.829
it the wet yeast. That sits in there and slowly
works its way and your bread gets an extremely

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:10.889
delicious flavor. The breads that get created
in a long making process, needs to have fresh

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:16.180
yeast. To have that flavor, that taste in
there. You can not create that taste of a

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:23.309
nice baguette or a nice ciabatta with a quick
rising yeast like this or a dry yeast like

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:33.809
this. You can buy this from your baking supplier.
You could buy it from a specialty baking store.

00:02:33.809 --> 00:02:39.559
Not everybody has that. It is a very selective
people use this yeast.
