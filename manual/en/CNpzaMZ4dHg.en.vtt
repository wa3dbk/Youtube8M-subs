00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:07.120
Hey, my name is Erin and I'm a former U.S.
Junior Olympic certified swim coach and personal

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.570
trainer and fitness is my passion.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.910
So, I cannot wait to share it with you guys.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:24.740
A question that I often get is what is the
difference between cardio and strength training,

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.960
which is better and how do I incorporate both?

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.820
There's no easy way to answer that question,
but the difference between cardio and strength

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.890
training is that one is aerobic, which is
cardio and one is anaerobic.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.570
During aerobic exercise, the body draws on
glycogen and/or fat for energy.

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:54.640
During anaerobic exercise, the body cannot
draw easily on fat stores.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:01:01.079
The mistake that people often make is that
they'll do their cardio workout before their

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.470
strength training workout.

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.360
If you think about it, from a common sense
perspective, why is that bad?

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.979
Well, if you exhaust your legs by running
or on the elliptical or whatever, then you

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:17.369
try and go lift heavy weights or do squats
or any other weight bearing activity, you're

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.950
already going to be fatigued from doing your
cardio first.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:24.259
That said, you should always warm up, but
you only need five to ten minutes.

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:31.850
Now, if you do your cardio after your strength
training workout, the body is depleting its

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.930
glycogen source.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:35.749
So, it's drawing on glycogen because it can't
draw on fat.

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:39.539
Okay, great, you power through your strength-training
anaerobic workout.

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.090
Now you move on to your cardio.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.680
But what's going to happen is because you've,
hopefully, depleted your glycogen stores when

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:51.149
you were doing your anaerobic workout, when
you go to do your aerobic workout, the body

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.140
goes, "Hmm, let me go to the fat stores for
energy."

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.189
Ideally, in the best case scenario, that's
what's going to happen.

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:04.670
During your anaerobic strength-training routine,
if you're working on a specific muscle group

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.300
or a specific body area, let's say you're
working on your lower body, you're doing some

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:14.180
heavier leg work and there's weights involved,
and your legs are tired after that strength-training

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.680
workout, for your cardio following that, if
you're going to do cardio following that,

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.540
you don't want to go do high intensity interval
sprints.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.379
Because your legs are already tired and that
can increase your risk of injury.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:30.590
Ideally, you want to separate.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.909
The cardio that you do, you don't want it
to be focused on the same body parts that

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.430
you just worked during your strength-training
workout, if you're going to do those two things

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.540
back to back.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.459
If you're working on your upper body, don't
go sit on the rowing machine afterwards because

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.390
your upper body is already tired.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:48.930
So, just use common sense.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.319
That's a little tip.

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:54.390
Aerobic activity isn't just for burning fat.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.569
There are different types of cardio that you
can do.

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.830
You can do high intensity intervals.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:06.159
For fat burning, you can do long lengths of
running.

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.580
If you're a marathoner, half-marathoner, a
lot of people who do that.

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:15.409
That's not something that's necessarily for
fat burning, or muscle toning, but that's

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:20.189
more to increase your endurance and stamina
exercise.

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:22.519
There's different types of cardio that you
can do.

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.680
There's high impact cardio, which would be
running, and there's low impact cardio, which

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.060
would be something like swimming, which is
safe for anyone and great if you're rehabbing

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.970
or you have an injury.

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.900
So, lots of different types of cardio to do.

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:40.859
Obviously, you saw on our other videos, lots
of different types of strength training that

00:03:40.859 --> 00:03:48.489
you can do to increase muscle mass, you can
do strength training to burn fat, you can

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:53.560
do strength training just to get stronger
and more fit.

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:59.980
So, there's no one reason to do any of those
things and that's the beauty of it.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.530
You need both cardio and strength training
to round out your fitness routine.

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:07.170
One is not better than the other.

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.170
They're just different.

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:11.090
Your body responds differently and you need
them both.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.409
So, get to work.
