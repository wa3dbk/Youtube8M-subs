00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:13.130
BMW's next generation of coupes has a new
number to distinguish them from their 4-door

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:14.179
counterparts.

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:22.550
Longer, lower and wider with its own specific
chassis tuning, this 2014 BMW 435i is a sports

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.500
car worthy of a numeral higher than 3.I admit
BMW has lost me of me late with some of their

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:37.480
new body designs, but this new 4-series is
downright sexy with classic BMW coupe proportions

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.140
and a welcome voluptuousness to its curves.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:48.120
Even in the understated though extra charge
Mineral Gray, this 435i M Sport garnered a

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:56.629
lot of attention this week.Offered in familiar
BMW argot -- the 428i with its 2.0-liter turbo

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:04.239
and this 435i powered by BMW's bread and butter
3.0-liter 6-cylinder turbo, the 4-series can

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:11.229
be left in its organic rear-drive layout as
it is here or fitted with BMW's xDrive all-wheel

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.249
drive for an additional $2,000.435iAnd when
you go shopping for one you'll be facing the

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:23.530
choice of 3 different lines -- starting with
the Luxury, then the Sport and this, the top

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.479
of the line M Sport.

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:31.889
It includes aerodynamic enhancements such
as larger air intakes, side skirts and a rear

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:33.969
bumper with diffuser.

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:40.520
The high-gloss Shadow line trim adds to the
sporty look while other M-specific enhancements

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.210
such as these optional 19" wheels, door sill
finishers, leather steering wheel and sport

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.079
seats further the M Sport atmosphere.

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:56.419
On the mechanical side, my tester upgrades
to the $1,000 Dynamic Handling Package adding

00:01:56.419 --> 00:02:02.189
Variable Sport Steering -- a feature that
goes beyond the standard speed-sensitive Servotronic

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.069
system by continuously adjusting the steering
ratio depending on how far the driver turns

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:14.170
the wheel, providing even greater connectedness
-- and the lowered adaptive suspension which

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.840
electronically controls the dampers to best
suit road conditions.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:25.219
With this feature, the driver can also switch
into a bevy of holistic driving modes affecting

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:31.690
both the powertrain and suspension components
ranging from a gas saving ECO PRO mode all

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.620
the way to the raciest and least intrusive
Sport +.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.280
Optional M Sport brakes lighten the load while
shortening stopping distances.Even this M

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:48.719
Sport model with all of its racier bits and
its adaptive suspension turned all the way

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:54.519
to Sport + never asks you to trade in ride
comfort for athleticism.

00:02:54.519 --> 00:03:00.409
And because it possesses the lowest center
of gravity of any car in the BMW lineup hustling

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:07.129
through your favorite country roads just got
easier.The 8-speed Sport automatic transmission

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:14.460
works hand-in hand with the high revving 300-horsepower
inline-6 to accentuate rather than hinder

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:22.370
performance aiding in the fastest 4-series
acceleration, reaching 60mph in only 5-seconds

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:26.280
while producing deep breathing sounds between
shifts.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:32.810
If you'd rather, a 6-speed manual is a no-cost
option but this one gets the best gas mileage

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:40.739
with an impressive return of 22mpg city/32mpg
highway on premium.The Coral Red interior

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:46.579
makes an oh-wow statement when you get in
and the rear seats are truly adult-friendly,

00:03:46.579 --> 00:03:51.450
so this is a coupe you can count on when you
need to drive others around or when getting

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.069
that oversized item at the store.

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.980
The trunk opens low and wide with a full pass
through to the rear.

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:06.129
But as is the case with BMW, nothing comes
cheaply and my car adds the Technology, Premium

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:15.099
and Lighting packages leading to an as-tested
MSRP of $60,625 after starting life at about

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:16.099
$47,000.

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.020
And guess what?

00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:23.270
There's still no heated seats, heated steering
wheel, backup cam, side blind zone alert or

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.150
remote start in here.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.830
And I understand that Bimmer loyalists love
the heritage styling integration of modern

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:36.660
electronics but there's a fine line between
'classic' and 'outdated' and for me, BMW crossed

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:44.000
it years ago.The 435i is a looker with a wide
dynamic range and everyday friendliness at

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.630
a not-so friendly BMW price.
