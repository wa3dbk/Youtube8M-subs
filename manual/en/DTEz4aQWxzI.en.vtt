00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
Stair rails are for looks and safety…and whether
it’s time to replace your current railing

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:08.336
or you just want to change up the look, 
it’s something you can do on your own.

00:00:08.336 --> 00:00:12.098
So stick around for this episode of Around 
The House and we’ll show you how.

00:00:12.098 --> 00:00:22.872
[Music]

00:00:22.872 --> 00:00:25.890
Today we are here with Scott Feroni from Colonial Elegance.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:28.770
Now Scott how easy is it to put in your own railing?

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.414
It’s very simple Jake. Today we’re going to show 
you very simple steps from colonial elegance

00:00:33.414 --> 00:00:37.082
on how to install a beautiful, 
elegant staircase in your home.

00:00:37.082 --> 00:00:40.426
Start by counting the number of 
steps you have in your staircase. 

00:00:40.426 --> 00:00:44.083
For most residential staircases, 
count each step as one foot, 

00:00:44.083 --> 00:00:47.438
then add an extra foot to figure 
out how long of railing you’ll need.

00:00:47.438 --> 00:00:52.500
For example, for 12 steps, you should 
purchase at least 13 feet of railing. 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.169
You’ll need a newel post at the bottom, 
another newel post for each turn or landing,

00:00:56.169 --> 00:00:57.934
and a half-newel where it meets the wall.

00:00:57.934 --> 00:01:03.646
You’ll need one short baluster for the front of the 
step and one long baluster for the rear of the step.

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:06.339
Also measure the distance of any straight sections.

00:01:06.339 --> 00:01:10.083
If the old stair treads are worn, 
now is a good time to replace them. 

00:01:10.083 --> 00:01:15.163
Colonial elegance offers a wide selection 
of replacement stair treads and risers.

00:01:15.163 --> 00:01:19.598
First drill pilot holes in the half newel. 

00:01:19.598 --> 00:01:23.638
We’re using three inch construction 
screws to anchor it to the wall studs. 

00:01:23.638 --> 00:01:28.189
The bottom screw is covered with a plug. 
The top screw is hidden by the handrail.

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:31.626
The height of the handrail depends 
on the height of the balusters. 

00:01:31.626 --> 00:01:37.988
For 36 inch balusters the center of the handrail should 
be positioned 35 and a half inches above the floor.

00:01:37.988 --> 00:01:43.890
For 39 and a half inch balusters the center 
of the handrail should be at 39 inches. 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:49.090
It may be necessary to trim a few inches off 
the bottom of the half newel and newel posts so

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.730
the handrail is positioned approximately in 
the center of the flat section as seen here.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.380
For this installation we trimmed 5 and a 
half inches from the bottom of the newels. 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.040
To find the location of the bottom 
newel we take the width of the newel, 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.460
in this case three inches, add half 
the width, another inch and a half, 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.430
to give us a total of 4 and a half inches.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:14.210
Measure 4 and a half inches from the front 
of the step and the same amount from the side. 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.760
This is where the center of the post 
will be. Now drill a pilot hole.

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:25.680
A double-ended lag bolt is screwed into the bottom of the 
newel and then into the stair. Make sure the post is level.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:33.160
Then, lay the handrail section on the treads of the stairs 
and mark both ends at the correct angle to meet the posts.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.760
Carefully cut the handrail at this angle. 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.590
Next, three-quarter inch holes are drilled 
in each stair tread to receive the balusters.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.560
For this particular installation, each hole is 
drilled 3 and one-sixteenths inch from the front and

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.740
back edges of the step to give us a 
4-inch space between each baluster. 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.410
The holes are set back so they’re 
centered with the bottom newel post.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.840
Check your local building codes to make sure 
the spacing between balusters meets requirements.

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.180
Then, attach the handrail 
to the bottom newel post. 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:08.730
For 36 inch balusters, measure up 31 and three-quarter 
inches from the stair to the bottom of the handrail. 

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:13.280
For 39 and a half inch balusters, 
measure up 35 and a quarter inches.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.770
Attach the handrail to the bottom 
newel with a rail fastener. 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:23.330
Drill a pilot hole in the newel post at the 
same angle as the handrail. Install the bolt. 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:27.680
Then, in the hand rail, drill a pilot hole 
for the bolt and a larger hole for the nut.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.350
Apply glue and slide the rail 
onto the bolt and tighten the nut. 

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.970
Attach the handrail at the top with finishing nails.

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.850
Next, insert the baluster into the hole in the 
step and following the bottom edge of the handrail, 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:43.380
mark the angle where you will 
cut the top of the baluster. 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:49.970
Cut each baluster a sixteenth of an inch longer, so it
fits into the groove cut in the bottom of the handrail. 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:56.430
Cut all the balusters to the proper length. Before 
installing, check for level, then glue and nail into place.

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:03.250
Finally, the fillet pieces which fit under the handrail 
between each baluster are cut and secured into place.

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.850
For straight sections of railing, cut the hand 
rail to the correct length, install the bolts 

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.170
into the newels, set the balusters 
into place and install the handrail.

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:18.390
Clean up any excess glue, the railing should be 
allowed to set for 24 hours for the glue to dry. 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:23.220
