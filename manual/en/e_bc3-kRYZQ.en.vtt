00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.450
Hi this is Megan with Beadaholique.com and today I'm going to show you

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.039
how to make these

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.230
beading wire and Katiedids earrings

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.349
and this specific earring that I'm going to make is

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:25.010
the Mojito earrings in our free beading projects page and that'll give you all

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.330
the

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.679
materials and step-by-step instructions
as well

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:34.550
and so what you're going to need are

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.579
some Katiedids and I have here

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.840
a two-hole curved silver plated Katiedid

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.670
and then I have some fine white Soft flex
beading wire

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.430
it does show here and I like that white color with my

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.640
bead choice there. So you can choose a
color that matches your beads

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.859
It comes in a lot of colors

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.820
it's kind of a fun option and then I have some
4mm

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.920
Miyuki cube beads and that's what I'm
using

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:14.149
to fill in the Katiedid and then to finish my beading wire

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:19.390
I have some crimps with a loop and I have an earring hook and a jump ring

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.270
the first thing I'm gonna do

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.970
is measure a piece of

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:33.970
beading wire, three and a half inches
long

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:46.689
I'm gonna actually go ahead and crimp one of my loops

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:52.299
onto the end of the wire. Now when you're
using a crimp with a loop

00:01:52.299 --> 00:01:55.729
you want to make sure that your only crimping the

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:00.000
end that's further away from the loop and there is going to be

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.950
a little bit of the crimp tube left over that you're not crimping

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.060
don't try to do the whole thing because
otherwise

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.610
it will a lot of times the loop will come loose.

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.830
Crimp the loop and insert

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.830
one end of your beading wire end and
crimp down

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:29.579
and complete the crimp. We do have a whole
video on using crimp beads hand tubes and if

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:33.290
you're not familiar and you see a little bit more

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.160
and I'm going to take

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:40.319
my beading wire, the loose end and put
it through

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.489
one of the holes on the end of the Katiedid

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.379
and then

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.209
I've already experimented and seen that I
can fill

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.380
7 of these beads into the Katiedid and I just placed them in before I had my wire to see

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.519
how many I was going to use

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.599
so I'm just going to string

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.260
seven of these randomly

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:11.260
onto my wire

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.440
and I'm going to take the other end

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.409
at the end of the wire put it through the hole

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:26.409
on other end of the Katiedid. Just like that.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.660
make sure that your beads sit nice in there

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:39.100
now I'm going to attach the crimp to the other end of the wire

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:45.470
and I do find with these, it's easier for me

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.880
personally if I line the crimp up in the

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.660
pliers and then put the wire instead of trying to it get them lined up

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.990
correctly with the wire in there

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.630
and I want to make sure that the

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.410
folded side of my crimp is to the back

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.150
of the earring. Crimp

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:23.400
crimp the other direction. Now you should have this little

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:30.400
U shape. You'll need a couple of

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.419
chain nose pliers. I have a chain nose and a round you can just use whatever

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:44.419
two pairs of pliers you like to use, open up the jump rings

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:48.069
I'm going to catch both

00:04:48.069 --> 00:04:52.210
loops on the ends of your crimps

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:59.210
you're going to catch the loop on your earring hook

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:04.840
and close the jump ring back up

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.139
and that's it. There's a really quick and
simple to make.

00:05:08.139 --> 00:05:11.880
and they're great for summer in this color scheme or you could do a totally

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:13.530
different color scheme and make them

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:15.830
really suited for any occasion.
