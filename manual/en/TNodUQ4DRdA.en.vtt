So he's literally (and we can do with
makeup) half red half blue

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:10.450
and wherever he goes he represents kinda
like the polarization

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:15.250
of the political landscape. Oh yeah! You
know the problem is because they're for the web

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.400
you know the pieces have to be short,
and they can be provocative like

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.990
we can push the envelope with them too.

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.039
Like anything goes - Anything goes yeah
basically. Okay.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:26.339
Uh - I got a pitch then. Okay.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.220
So this ***** moves in to town right?

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:37.820
Super **** totally **** he's got six ****
located different strategic places on his body right?

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.500
One here just kinda flapping around, one there kinda flapping around, one in the normal place

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.839
one behind this guy has ***** everywhere!

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:48.640
Everyone in the neighborhood ***** because he *****

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.879
&lt;flopping noises&gt;

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:55.649
and they're all ***** as they should be ***** because this guy

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.930
is a ***** man with a ***** past

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.299
he's the ***** being alive and of course *****

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:06.350
***** some Community College right? because it's
a small suburban town that's near like a

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:10.350
*****  ***** ***** they're probably putting up a

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:15.299
production of Teenage Mutant Ninja
People? This is a smart man - 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.689
He is a smart ***** man and he gets on ***** *****

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:22.810
in a diaper, he *****

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.940
He goes to the moon 'cause global warming is a huge *****.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.530
 - get to the moon they realize "Oh no!" That *****

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:33.730
is the Mayor of the Moon. That's as far
as government goes when you're on the moon.

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:37.050
it's just the mayor level... 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.240
I mean I think it's...

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.040
...that's a lot especially if you

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.320
include the school kids in that. I think... yeah... including the kids

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:53.530
Um... &lt;sniff&gt;

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.530
Um for me...

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:00.869
personally, that crossed a line.
Yeah - if there was like a dream book for pitches,

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:05.320
and you looked up some of the stuff
you were saying, it would probably speak

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.229
highly to like, maybe a sociopathic
tendency or something.

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.749
Okay not the first time I've heard that!

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:20.599
