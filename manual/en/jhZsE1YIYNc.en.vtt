00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:06.940
Let's talk about using an electric tuner.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.270
It's probably the best way to tune.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.360
It's the easiest, but a little more expensive.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.360
Right?

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.150
We have a little guitar pedal here.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:17.590
And this is probably about 100 dollars at
your local music store, so that's quite an

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:18.590
investment.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.700
But you can use this when performing on stage
and inside your house.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.590
So you're just going to hook it up to your
electric guitar.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.650
You're going to put the cable into the input.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.590
And then from the output to your amp.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.780
So I'm going to start with the six string.

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.910
Right?

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.640
And it already says, oh, you're tuning the
six string.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.410
So I see the six there.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:41.410
Right?

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:46.680
And my whole idea here is I'm trying to get
these two arrows to both light up in the middle

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.290
and these flashing lights to sort of stop
flashing.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.090
So, I'm just gonna.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:57.620
You know, this arrow on the left is telling
me, okay you're going to have to tighten the

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.700
string, you're going to have to go a little
higher.

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:02.640
There you go.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.640
Right?

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.250
Now my sixth string is in tune.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.430
Then I can move on to the fifth string.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.430
Right?

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.140
So it should pick up that I'm on the fifth
string.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.390
And again, it's telling me I have to go a
little higher.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:17.250
So I'm going to go ahead and bring it up slowly,
right?Little by little.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.250
And there you go.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.630
The two arrows light up, and the lights have
stopped moving.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.630
Right?

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.780
And then I'm going to go ahead and go to the
fourth string.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.450
And it knows, right?

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.770
But, this time I have to lower it.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.560
That arrow is telling me that I should lower.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:33.560
Right?

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.360
So slowly, and there it is.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.360
Right?

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.610
So now I'm going to do the third string.

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.770
And so I'm going to play the third string,
and there it recognizes the third string.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.770
And that's pretty close.

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:43.770
Right?

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:44.770
So I lucked out.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:45.820
That one's right on the money.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:46.820
Right?

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.799
And then I'm going to go ahead and go to the
second string.

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.979
And this is telling me to raise it.

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:54.979
And there it is.

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.260
And then finally, the first string, and this
is telling me to raise it.

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:01.270
So I'm going to go ahead and raise it.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.990
Now, the other thing to remember is you can
get a little crazy, and you can try to get

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.470
it so perfect.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.470
You don't have to.

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:09.470
You know.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.840
If it's close, that's pretty good.

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.560
Guitars are funny that way.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:15.230
It doesn't have to be perfect, perfect, perfect
in order for you to get it.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:18.739
So you don't have to spend a lot of time trying
to, you know, make sure that it's perfectly

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.000
in tune by what that says.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Right?

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
You can just use your ear a little bit.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.720
There you go, there's your G chord in tune.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.129
So that's how you might tune with your electric
tuner.
