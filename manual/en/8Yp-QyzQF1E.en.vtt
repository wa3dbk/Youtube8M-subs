00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000
 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Hi, I’m Mindy from Close To My Heart.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
On today’s episode of Artbooking Made Easy

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
we’re going to be exploring the shapes and titles

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
on the Travel Mini Album keys

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
found on pages 38 and 39 of the Artbooking Booklet.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
So looking at these keys

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
you can see that there are half pages,

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
full pages, overlays, and titles

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
that are very traveled centered.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But there are other elements such as this overlay,

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and the "HELLO" sentiment,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
that don’t have much to do with travel

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
and you could use for any of your projects.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000
I’m going to show you a couple examples of both.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So let me show you this Craft Mini Album.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
This is a good example of the 8 by 8 inch

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
that the keys are designed to create.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Here you can see that all the cut outs I’m going to show you

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
are cut at the recommended 8 inch size.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
So here we have these little pinwheels

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
that can be used just as shapes,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
you could use them as sun cut out,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000
an orange slice, whatever you want.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
Let’s take a look at some of these pages on the inside.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
You can see the "Just Be" title,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
our little half page here

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and the overlay that has the

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
airplanes and the clouds on them,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
obviously a travel themed cut out.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
I’ve also used some of the journaling cards

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
from the My Crush Assortment,

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
just to give me a little extra room for journaling.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Now here I’ve taken the cut outs

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000
from the overlay and used them on their own here,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
which is a nice way to not waste

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
any of your cut outs from the overlay.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Um, I have also tied the little half page

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
with this cute Topiary Mini Chevron Ribbon,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
as well as used that to bind the book together.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000
So you can see

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
also we have this fun arrow

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
from the cut outs, as well as this "EXPLORE" title.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Now one of my favorite elements is this Date Title.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It’s really simple

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000
but I think it adds a-lot to the album.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.000
All I’ve done is cut it out in Craft Card Stock

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.000
and then laid it on top of White Daisy

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
and it gives it that nice pop so we can add the date here.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
I also love this fun border on the side.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
of just a really basic mini album

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000
that you can create using these keys.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
So this album has a really overt travel theme,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
but you can use these cut outs for projects

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000
that don’t have a travel theme.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
For example this card,

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:39.000
you can see it’s just a nice friendship card

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
that are found on the, in the Craft Mini Album.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
For example this overlay

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
was cut at the recommended 8 inch size.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
For my card however

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.000
I’ve scaled it down to three and a half inches Real Dial Size,
0:02:57.000,1193:02:47.295
doesn’t have anything to do with travel
61
00:00:40--&gt; 00:00:42
but it uses a lot of the same elements

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
so that it fits nicely on my card.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
I’ve done the same for these two borders.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
These were cut at the recommended 8 inch size

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000
but these ones 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
I’ve cut at a half inch Real Dial Size,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
it's so that they fit on my card.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and you can see the result

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000
is just a nice friendship card that has nothing to do with travel.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Now I’ve shown you a really basic Mini Album

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000
and a card that you can create using these keys,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000
but if you have tons of photos,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
more journaling, and lot’s of keepsakes

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
that you want to include it’s totally fine

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
to go for this more layered, eclectic, colorful, look.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
I’m going to show you a little bit of this album,

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000
but first let’s take a look at the cover.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
You can see that I’ve cut this overlay

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
using Ruby cardstock but it doesn’t have the cut outs

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000
that we’ve seen in the other album.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000
This is what the overlay looks like

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000
as intended on the keys,

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
however you can use Cricut Craft Room
0:03:58.000,1193:02:47.295
then all I’ve done is backed it with a Neutral Cardstock

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
and use the hide contour feature

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
to eliminate the shapes in the middle,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
that way you’re justleft with this cute boarder around the edge,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000
then all I’ve done here is used a stamp set

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.000
to stamp my clouds in the background,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000
kind of gives it a different look

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
but still has that element of fun with the boarder here.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000
So you can see how by just adding more layers,

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000
choosing a more distinctive color scheme,

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
and using lots of embellishments

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000
can just take your project up a notch.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Let me just show you some of here,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000
again all of these shapes are cut out from the same

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.000
the same Travel Mini Album keys

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
but here they’re not used used at the linked eight inch size.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000
You can always use the Real Dial Size

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000
to size them to whatever size you, you want.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000
So here we see the, the arrow again,

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000
the airplanes,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000
we see some, some, stamp feature but also the overlays,

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.000
again the overlay from the front cover 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
just as it was intended,

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000
with some arrows and here we have the clouds

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.000
and the airplanes again from the overlay,

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.000
just cut at a larger size like  I said.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.000
Another fun thing about this album

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.000
is the little pockets you can use

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
to include some of your keepsakes from your trip.

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000

I hope that something you’ve seen today

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000
has given you inspiration for your own projects.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
You can use the Travel Mini Album keys

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000
to scrapbook all your favorite get-a-ways,

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
but with a little imagination they can work for just about anything.
