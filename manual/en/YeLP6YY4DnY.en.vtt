00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.020
When I saw the words “The Oregon Trail”
on this game cartridge, I almost came down

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:24.920
with dysentery just from the excitement.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.270
I’m not even sure that’s how dysentery
works, but at that level, excitement can cause

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.520
all kinds of problems.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.530
It’s been three decades since the first
edition hit the Apple II, and The Oregon Trail

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.500
is still one of the best edutainment games
of all-time.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.360
So to play a new version with fancy 3D graphics?

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.930
Geez, caulk the wagon, repair the axle and
sign me up for another journey on The Oregon

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.390
Trail for the Nintendo 3DS.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:04.930
Too bad the trail is a lot bumpier than it
used to be.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:10.930
This remake was brought to the 3DS by Red
Wagon Games, a company that—given their

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.090
name—you might expect to have a pedigree
for making games that use wagons.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.760
Unfortunately, their name seems to be nothing
more than a coincidence, because it’s been

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.750
a long time since I’ve seen such a sorry
excuse for a game with wagons.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.610
Let alone just a wagon.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.290
That thing looks like a loaf of stale bread.

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:36.820
So if you couldn’t tell by now, this new
version is awful.

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.960
But structurally speaking, the game is at
least reminiscent of the original.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:46.509
You have to lead your family from Missouri
to Oregon, embarking on a long and difficult

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.740
journey up the famous Oregon Trail.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.200
You head west with as many supplies as you
can carry, but that 2,000-mile road through

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.670
untamed wilderness has a way of sapping those
supplies in a hurry.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:04.050
The objective is to get to Oregon with your
wagon in tact and your family alive.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.369
The original game was all about management.

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:11.910
The wagon moved automatically, time passed
with every moving pixel and events were essentially

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.110
out of your control.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.130
So the game was in how you responded and how
well you could recover.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:22.090
I’m not ashamed to say I never made it to
Oregon in the original, but I tried hundreds

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.090
of times.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.790
I didn’t make it to Oregon in this one,
either.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.389
But that’s because it was too terrible to
keep playing.

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:30.510
I voluntarily buried my family in this.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:45.699
It was like the Shining with oxen.

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:50.109
This game makes a pretty fundamental change
to The Oregon Trail formula.

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:54.540
Rather than watching as your wagon moves automatically,
you actually have to move it with your circle

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.829
pad on the 3DS.

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:01.920
It basically turns into an obstacle course
game, with the road providing rocks, trees

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.580
and anything it can to make your trip difficult.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:09.270
The idea is nice, but the problem is that
it sucks.

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:13.090
The wagon always wants to go in a certain
direction, so you never feel like you’re

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:14.090
in control.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:18.549
You want the wagon to go left, but it’s
veering to the right...and your thoughts veer

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:24.979
into, “I think I’d rather actually die
from dysentery than steer this **** wagon.”

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:29.460
Manual movement adds another element to the
management aspects of the game in the same

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:32.970
way a broken axle adds another element to
your driving experience.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.810
It’s just a pain in the ass that isn’t
even remotely fun to deal with.

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.160
And frankly, it’s not even done well.

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.180
You can pick up repair supplies, but it’s
hard to steer into them.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.519
You can stop along the trail to interact with
other travelers and even hunt and fish, but

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:55.430
steering a stick figure in eight directions
and firing a large square pixel was immeasurably

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:57.730
more fun than this.

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:06.310
This...this is crap.

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.980
The Oregon Trail is not some brave new trip
down a familiar road.

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.170
It’s like returning to a place you remember
from childhood and finding they’ve put a

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:16.889
junkyard on top of it.

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:22.500
This is one of the all-around worst titles
you can find on the 3DS, a product that makes

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:34.650
you wish video games would’ve stayed on
floppy disks and green monitors.
