hi I'm Chris from Fibre Glast

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:13.360
today we're going to show you our number
188 orange tooling gel coat

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:18.640
that we carry on Fibre Glast dot com our
number 188 is an abrasion resistant

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.080
tooling gel coat for making molds where
gloss retention and superior hardness

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.980
is key when making molds you want a
perfect surface

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.349
durability and a long life it's
extremely important to use high-quality

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.400
tooling gel coat to end up with a high
quality mold

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.600
our tooling gel coat stands up to the
most demanding applications

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.620
our number 188 orange tooling gel coat

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.190
is engineered specifically for mold
making orange tooling gel coat

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.740
is chemically identical to black tooling
gel coat which you choose is a matter of

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.920
personal preference

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.490
like all polyester products there are
inexpensive versions that are not first

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.090
quality

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.560
Fibre Glast tooling gel coats are highly
formulated isophthalics

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.860
which ensure the highest performance and that there will be no batch to batch

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.100
variations

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:10.360
our tooling gel coats are typically used
in the building of female molds from

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.560
plugs in a hand lay-up environment

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.240
when using orange tooling gel coat to
make a long-lasting mold

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.260
it's important to properly measure your
gel coat and MEKP

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.250
number 188 is catalyzed at one and a
half to two and a half percent MEKP

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.140
once catalyzed spray your tooling gel coat
and begin the mold building process

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.750
to further increase the gloss and
performance of 188

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.480
you can add Duratec Hi-Gloss Additive
this will improve gloss retention

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:44.570
thin and reduce surface porosity thanks
