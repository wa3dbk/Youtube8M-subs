00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:09.870 position:75%
The moon... it's our closest celestial neighbor.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:14.750 position:97%
And yet more than 40 years after astronauts first set foot on the lunar surface,

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.180 position:63%
there are still many mysteries to solve.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.180 position:97%
NASA's twin Gravity Recovery and Interior Laboratory spacecraft...

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.170 position:97%
known collectively as GRAIL... are ready for their lunar assignment.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:30.090 position:97%
The spacecraft will look at the moon's gravitational field to determine the structure of the

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.540
lunar interior, from crust to core.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.170 position:97%
Scientists hope what they learn from GRAIL's mission will advance understanding of the thermal

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:41.190
evolution of the moon.

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.320 position:97%
The United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket that will launch the GRAIL spacecraft

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.260 position:97%
began to take shape at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station's Launch Complex 17B in April.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:58.380 position:98%
The rocket's first stage arrived at the pad on April 7 and was lifted into place.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:03.960 position:98%
Later in the month, the nine solid-fueled boosters were delivered to the launch complex and

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.390 position:58%
attached to the rocket's first stage.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:12.800 position:98%
Workers transported the Delta's second stage to the pad in May and hoisted it atop the first stage booster.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:22.760 position:97%
May also marked the arrival of the Air Force C-17 cargo plane carrying the GRAIL spacecraft.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:28.330 position:97%
The plane ferried the spacecraft from Lockheed Martin's Denver plant where it was built to

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:33.330 position:88%
Florida where it would undergo its prelaunch processing.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:38.150 position:98%
After it was unloaded at the Shuttle Landing Facility at NASA's Kennedy Space Center,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:44.880 position:97%
GRAIL was transported to the Astrotech payload processing facility in nearby Titusville.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.960 position:98%
Once inside the processing facility, the spacecraft was uncrated before technicians

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:53.600 position:58%
attached and tested the solar panels.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.410 position:97%
The electrical power subsystem on each of GRAIL's twin spacecraft includes two solar

00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:03.200
arrays and a lithium ion battery.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:09.090 position:97%
Each solar array is capable of producing no less than 700 watts.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:13.670 position:98%
Shortly after GRAIL separates from the rocket, the arrays will be deployed and remain fixed

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.310
throughout the mission.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.850 position:97%
The next step for the processing team was to move the spacecraft in late July to Astrotech's

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:26.000 position:66%
hazardous processing facility for fueling.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.940 position:97%
With the scheduled launch just a month away, the twin spacecraft were weighed before they were

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.870 position:59%
stacked in their launch configuration.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.890 position:98%
Once attached to the spacecraft adapter ring in their side-by-side launch position,

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.700 position:97%
GRAIL was placed in a protective canister for transport to the launch pad.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:51.710 position:98%
On August 18, the spacecraft arrived at the launch pad and was lifted atop the Delta II rocket.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:59.310 position:97%
Technicians secured the clamshell-shaped payload fairing around the spacecraft on August 24.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.890 position:98%
The fairing -- which will be jettisoned once the spacecraft is outside the Earth's atmosphere

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:08.130 position:91%
-- will protect the spacecraft during its ascent to space.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:13.070 position:97%
The rocket and spacecraft stand ready at the launch pad, set to begin the journey to further
