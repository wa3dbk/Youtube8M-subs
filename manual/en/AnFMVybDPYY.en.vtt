00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:19.020
is that, if you are not
under a very heavy load or if you're operating on a steep angle

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.500
or slope and not a true
vertical environment, the device has a tendency

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.780
Currently we are using the Petzl
I'D Large but you can also pick up the Petzl I'D Small

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.380
or the Petzl Rig.  This trick will
work with both.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.760
Okay. So we are going to load the I'D. Again, we have a diagram inside. We want the rope that is going towards our

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.880
other end of the rope that is coming to the load
coming here out of the bottom.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:49.720
The part that we are going to tend as we belay the
load is going to come out at the top here.  

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.960
So we are going to form the loop.  We are going to introduce the
rope. We are going to close it

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.400
and then make our connection.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.500
Okay. So here our I'D is loaded
and one of the problems that people have with I'D frequently

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.720
is that, if you are not
under a very heavy load or if you're operating on a steep angle

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.380
or slope and not a true
vertical environment, the device has a tendency

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:20.560
to kick over into the panic mode, thereby
making it hard to lower a light load or again

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.660
progress down a steep angle.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.860
So a way that we can get around this, again if done appropriately

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.960
is rather than taking the device in the normal
belay position, which is this, we are simply

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.960
going to leave the device in the unlock position
and still maintaining our brake hand here

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.080
on the end of the line coming out, we are going
to rotate the device 90 degrees and thereby

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.860
allowing the cam to be defeated.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.960
Now it is imperative that when you do this, you don't "death grip" this thing 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.540
because if anything happens, you want this thing to be able to jerk out of your hands

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.160
and into the correction orientation so that it will catch your load. 

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.040
And that is our trick.
