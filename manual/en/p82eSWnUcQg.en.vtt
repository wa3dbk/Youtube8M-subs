Another wonderful fruit that people forget
is a fruit are bell peppers. Sweet, golden,

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:15.049
green, yellow, all kinds of colors, delicious
bell peppers. They're a little tricky to cut,

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:20.630
but once you learn some secrets from catering
tips 101, you won't be afraid. I'm going to

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:26.860
start with a green pepper and a nice sharp
chef's knife and I'm going to lop off the

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:36.320
top. Right here. Okay? What you see here is
the stem part where it grew on a vine and

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:42.940
I just use my knife and I just loosen it.
And now I have an unwasted piece of fruit

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:50.199
that I can actually use. Alright. You see
this seed portion here? This pops off fairly

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.101
easy. Just in your hands. Especially if you
find a bell pepper that's nice and big. Which

00:00:54.101 --> 00:00:59.659
is what you're really going for. I slice it
in half and I can either use my fingers, depending

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:06.460
on how loose it is. Or I can use a handy dandy
paring knife which is a real gift of a tool

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:13.680
and I can use it to clean out the rind inside
or any other little imperfections. This is

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.390
actually a really beautiful pepper. I got
this at the farmers market. If you're lucky

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.640
to have a farmers market in your neighborhood,
I recommend you visit them. Especially in

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:28.600
the seasons that the fruit is prolific. Peppers
are mostly a summer fruit. But you can find

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.450
them thankfully in most areas all year round.
Same thing with the yellow pepper. You just

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.970
reach in and pull out the plug. I put it in
my mulching bag and I'm going to clean out

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.100
some of the seeds. See how nicely those comes
out with the paring knife? Just basically

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:54.420
trace over it. Shake out some of the seeds.
And you have some beautiful peppers to slice

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:59.080
into whatever size you need them for. Now
I'm going to be making a roasted pepper dish

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:04.640
in a little while. So I'm going to cut them
for that. But you can slice them in lots of

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.420
different ways. One wonderful trick that saves
time which I love saving time is to stack

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:16.450
your peppers and use your very sharp chef's
knife, you're going to make long thin wedges.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:22.890
Now that can also be used, right there that
step makes a beautiful crudities size. You

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.569
can even cut them in half in case your guests
want something a little bit small. But isn't

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:33.760
that a perfect size just for dipping and nibbling?
Now from this, I'm going to take that whole

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:39.230
stack of thinly cut peppers and I'm going
to do another cut length wise. So that when

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.090
I roast them, I'm going to have little chunks
so that people can pick them with a fork,

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:50.730
without having to wear them. Cause I'm going
to marinate them. Alright? Yellow peppers

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:57.000
and green peppers. Now you don't have to waste
the ends. I'm just going to stack them on

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:06.030
top of each other and make some cuts. The
same way. Waste not want not. There you go.

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.019
Beautiful, multi colored peppers.
