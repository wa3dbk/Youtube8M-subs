00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:04.009
Here a couple of ideas on how to make
you warm ups

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.780
on the mini court more dynamic. A lot of
players start the training

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.290
and they are just standing there hitting
balls. So,

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.290
if you force them to alternate a forehand and a backhand

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:18.830
it'll focus them on hitting the ball
straight

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.740
to the partner and on moving around to be
able to do the job.

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.590
So hit the forehand, moved to the other side,

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:30.679
hit a backhand.

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:37.679
The players aim straight at their partner. The partner has to move. Of course this drill

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.110
can also be done from the back.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:51.110
This is an excellent way to get the
feet moving.

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.610
Another alternative is to force the players to grab a ball,

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.740
hit the ball, put it down.

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:03.650
Hit the next ball, pick it up. So they

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.900
are alternating in a rally between setting
a ball on the ground and picking it up.

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.720
That'll increase their focus and their
concentration, get them moving their

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:20.340
feet and also forces them

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.680
to hit nice and straight to a partner to
be able to do this drill.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.630
Once the players feel comfortable with
this,

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:33.460
you can increase the intensity by asking
the players to rally

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:36.900
in the alley and at the same time

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.940
place the ball in the middle of the
service box.

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.869
So they are moving to the side, hitting the
ball, picking up the ball

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:48.220
and hitting it again. This definitely

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.549
gets them going, keeps them focused,

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:56.299
forces them to be very precise with their shot, and gets them

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:01.000
hitting and moving.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.329
You can put the ball in many different places, mix it up and have fun with it.
