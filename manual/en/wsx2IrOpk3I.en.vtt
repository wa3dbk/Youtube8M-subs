00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.929
cars.com auto reviews I'm Mike Hanley with cars.com and this is the pontiac g8 gxp

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.400
it's new for 2009 and since my colleague
Jill bruising has already covered its

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.270
performance characteristics in a
separate video I want to take a look at

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.580
how this sport sedan holds up is a
family vehicle the verdict surprisingly

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:29.550
well being that the gxp is a performance
car i was a little worried about how its

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.450
suspension was going to be able to
handle the potholed roads of Chicago but

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.329
I was pleasantly surprised that it
offered the compliant ride does a very

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.989
good job of absorbing bumps and holes in
the road before they have a chance to

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.219
rattle you or your passengers on the
whole it's very livable as a daily

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:54.690
driver the g8 gxp is Pontiacs flagship
performance car so it's a little odd to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.800
see that the manual transmission is an
option in the automatic come standard it

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.989
cost 695 dollars but at least it is an
option because the v8 GT is an offered

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.530
with the manual that's the model right
below this one if you choose the manual

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.790
you get a transmission of the short
throws slightly mechanical feel in a

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:15.869
pretty like clutch pedal and that
translates to good driveability and the

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:22.409
daily basis the front bucket seats in
the g8 gxp offer nice balance between

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:26.640
comfort and sportiness they have soft
cushioning but they're nice and wide to

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.200
so that the side bolsters on them don't
grip you unnecessarily tight but they're

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.310
there when you need them

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.600
the front cushion and it is also pretty
long so that for taller drivers that

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.409
offers goodbye support overall space
otherwise in the front of the cabin is

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.040
good and the car comes to the standard
tilt telescoping steering wheel so you

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.049
can put the wheel that's where you want
it

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.600
family vehicles also have to have a
usable backseat and the ga does thanks

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.219
to its full size dimensions even taller
adults have good legroom and overall

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:01.110
space is pretty decent as well there's
this handy armrest to in the middle and

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.540
pop out cupholders down here

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.930
in terms of cargo space the g8 has a
17.5 cubic foot trunk which is pretty

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:15.850
sizable the opening is nice and big to
in the inside is relatively rectangular

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:16.900
which is nice

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.410
unlike some other cars though it doesn't
have folding back seats but it does have

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:26.260
a trunk pass-through compromises are a
fact of life especially when you're

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.160
shopping for a car because prioritizing
one requirement may mean giving up

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.780
another with the g8 gxp though you don't
have to give up mentally family-friendly

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:38.770
features like a roomy cabin and a
compliant ride to get serious

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:42.610
performance like a 0-60 time of less
than five seconds

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.090
the only thing you really compromising
in all this is the planet though because

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.680
the g8 gxp gets an abominable 13 miles
per gallon in the city and 20 on the

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.680
highway
