00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:02.240
Hi, this is Gary with MacMost.com.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:09.160
Today let's take a look at the Menu Bar.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.919
The Menu Bar is what is here at the very top
of your screen.

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:13.730
It is always at the top of the screen.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:15.799
Never a part of the window.

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.450
New Mac users sometimes get confused because
they are used to operating systems where the

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.890
menus are attached to different windows.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.420
So somebody says go to File/Save and you look
here inside the application for a file button

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.560
or something.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.489
But usually when somebody says Choose or do
a command they mean to go all the way to the

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.050
top of the screen and look here at the Menu
Bar.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.149
Now the Menu Bar always has an Apple menu
here at the top left.

00:00:41.149 --> 00:00:43.859
It has a little apple as a symbol and we call
it the Apple menu.

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:48.359
The interesting thing about the Apple menu
is it's the same no matter what application

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:53.280
you are running whereas everything else in
the Menu Bar will change depending upon what

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.170
application you are running.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.889
Here we see things like About This Mac.

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:59.449
We see Sleep, Log Out.

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:04.790
All general things that apply to the computer
and to the operating system itself never to

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.300
the actual application.

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:10.760
The second menu is always named after the
application you are currently using.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.690
In this case I am using Safari so I have Safari
here and this is one way to figure out what

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.980
application is currently at the front, the
one that I am currently using.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:22.870
The menu items here are very similar from
app to app.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:28.720
For instance the Quit menu choice is always
here and as is usually About and things like

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.790
that.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.950
You also find Hide here and Preferences, usually.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:37.200
But this menu will change depending upon which
app you are using.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.640
So say if we switched applications here we
would see that this menu would change.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.720
Let's go and switch to Maps.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.060
We see now it changes to say Maps instead
of Safari and some of the menu items change

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:48.060
but some are the same.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.350
There is Quit, there is Hide, and Show.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.360
Notice there is no Preferences here in Maps
so that is not listed here.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.120
Also notice many of these other menu choices
are about the same.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.210
There are some standard menus like File, Edit,
View, Window, and Help.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.290
Even if I were to switch back to Safari I
would see those same menus.

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:06.450
There are some new ones.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.590
For instance Bookmarks make sense for Safari.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.910
So you can see some similarities and some
differences.

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.830
When developers make apps usually there are
some standards that developers like to follow

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.569
and one of those is to include things like
the Edit menu even if the Edit menu isn't

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.080
used very much in a certain app.

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.850
You will find similar items there like Copy
and Paste are always under Edit and it doesn't

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:35.460
matter which application you are in you are
always going to find Copy and Paste there.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.480
The same for a lot of these other Menu items.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.120
Now let's look at some more advanced tricks.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.110
One of the things that I do all the time but
a lot of you Mac users don't know about is

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.580
that you don't have to search for a menu item.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.900
For instance say if I were to remember that
there is an option somewhere to show the downloads

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.600
here in Safari but I don't remember which
menu it is under.

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.030
I could start looking and say is it under
File, is it under Edit, and eventually find

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:01.030
it under View.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.810
I don't need to search for it because sometimes
it is very difficult to find these.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.060
Sometimes they are very deep down in submenus.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.200
It is easier simply to go to the Help here
and there is a little search field right inside

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.800
the menu there and start typing.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:19.540
When you do that you will see a list of menu
items at the top.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.550
Simply rollover it and not only will it allow
you to choose it from here but it will show

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.280
you that, for instance this one is in the
View menu and that is exactly where it is,

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.160
and I can just choose it from here if I wanted
to.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.640
So very easy to find a menu item.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.400
You don't need to hunt for it.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.860
Now another advanced trick is to use the Option
key to find hidden menu commands.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.500
I'll give you an example here.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:45.640
If I go to File here I can see there is a
Close Tab feature.

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.300
I will actually open a second tab here so
you can see, Close Tab.

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.720
Now if I were to hold down the Option key
I will see that the Close Tab changes to Close

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:56.720
Other Tabs.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.170
So there is a second command there hidden
and I only see it if I use the Option key.

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.209
There are a lot of different hidden commands
just about in very app.

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:06.069
For instance see where it says Quit Safari.

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.250
If I hold the Option key down it will Quit
and Close All Windows in Safari.

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:14.430
So there is a lot of different things that
you can do here by holding the Option key

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:16.180
down and changing the menu items.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:24.750
Some of the best, coolest features of complex
apps are hidden in these Option menu commands.

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.280
So another cool thing you can do is you can
control menus with the keyboard.

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:35.010
The simplest way to do this is the use the
mouse first to click on any Menu and then

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:36.700
use the down arrow to go and select.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:40.820
You see the cursor stays there at the top
and I'm using the arrow keys to navigate.

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.260
The right arrow goes into a submenu.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:48.630
If I'm on an item that doesn't have a submenu
I can use the right and left to go back and

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.300
forth between these menus.

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:56.880
Then I can choose one and use spacebar or
return to issue that command.

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.750
Now let's say you want to do that but you
never want to use the mouse at all.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:01.300
So I don't want to have to go up here and
click.

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:07.060
Well, under System Preferences you can go
to System Preferences/Keyboard and under Shortcuts

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:12.650
you can go to the Keyboard subset in here
and then look for this one, Move focus to

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:13.650
the menu bar.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.280
The default is Control, not Command but Control,
F2.

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:25.160
Keep in mind also that if you have this thing
set or not set it will change how that works.

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:30.630
You may have to use the fn key in addition
to Control and F2 depending upon how you have

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.790
that toggle set.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:39.699
So here I'm going to go in and do Control
F2 and you can see that the Apple menu on

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:41.350
the top left is selected.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:48.030
I can move over and do what I want to issue
a command from the menu bar without ever touching

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:54.840
the mouse or trackpad.
