Making Money with Shares – Vince Stanzione
gives some top tips

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.339
Fed up of picking the wrong shares?

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:11.679
Then here are a few tips taken from Making
Money From Financial Spread Trading that can

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.469
get you on the right track

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:14.610
Vince Says:

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:15.610
1.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.760
Buy strength, sell weakness

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.290
Everyone likes a bargain.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.290
It's human nature!

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.600
But here’s the truth: you don’t make money
from buying bargains.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:30.540
Cheap stocks often appear to be bargains after
a large drop, but they often continue to fall.

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.150
Buy break outs and sell them higher.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.090
Sell shares that are breaking down.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.450
Never let anyone tell you they are cheap and
can’t go any lower!

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:40.450
2.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.470
Trade active stocks

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.410
Many newcomers don’t realise that while
you have thousands of companies quoted on

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:51.360
the stock market both in the UK and US, most
of these stocks don’t move much.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.270
If you look at the daily volume of share traded
on many companies you, will see that nothing

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.230
has been traded.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.210
Always trade active shares with volume, and
sectors that are active or trending well.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.259
Spreads are the tightest on the most active
shares such as Vodafone, BP, Unilever, BT,

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:12.219
and GlaxoSmithKline.

00:01:12.219 --> 00:01:18.219
By using filters on a website like Sharescope.com,
you can list only shares that are active – for

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:22.139
example those that have moved up or down by
3%.

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:27.990
You can also list all companies that are 20
days or less from their all time lows or highs.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:28.990
3.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.639
Look at shares as if they are people

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:33.249
Stocks often act like people.

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:34.719
Each has its own personality.

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:39.249
What’s more, a stock can change from one
to another quickly.

00:01:39.249 --> 00:01:44.999
Like people, stocks can be steady, predictable
plodders or aggressive and unpredictably.

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:50.579
Charts and moving averages can help you spot
the personalities which you can trade.

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.740
4.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:52.740
Trade the trend

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.759
Don’t try to be smart and pick the top or
bottoms, just trade with the trend.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.479
Of course the trend will never last forever,
but by using a trailing stop you can lock

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.539
in profits along the way.

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:05.539
5.

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.209
Add to winning trades never add to a losing
trade

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:12.780
You’ll sometimes hear so-called experts
advocate averaging down.

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.439
Don’t listen!

00:02:14.439 --> 00:02:16.069
Never add to a losing trade.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:18.390
Instead, add to winning trades.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.319
If you buy £1 and the stock goes to £1.50,
buy some more.

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.599
For long-term investments of five to ten years,
buying units on a monthly average price may

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:33.110
make sense, but never average down shorter
term trades.

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:34.110
6.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.310
If the trade is wrong, cut it!

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.930
Your first loss is normally the smallest.

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:43.390
If you were expecting something to happen
and it doesn’t, simply cut it.

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.590
Also, if you have a stop set and the share
is heading towards it, don’t move your stop

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.370
unless you have a very good reason to.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:58.270
For example: if you start with £1,000 and
you lose 20%, you are left with £800.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:03.060
You now need to make 25% to get back to £1,000.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:09.400
If you let a trade move 50% against you, you
will now need to gain 100% to get back to

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.629
£1,000.

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:11.870
7.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.489
If you can’t see a trend then don't trade

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.540
Markets and shares don’t always trend.

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.209
In many cases a share could consolidate for
weeks, months and years.

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:27.680
Vince Stanzione likes to trade trends, and
if something is not trending he recommends

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:29.000
walking away.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.349
Come back when it starts to trend.

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:32.349
8.

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:33.349
Let the winners run

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:38.140
For many, holding a winning trade is as painful
as holding a losing one.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.500
The only way you can survive is to let winners
run more than you let losers run.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:47.500
If you have a plant in your garden and it
is growing well and strong, you don’t dig

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:48.769
it up and kill it.

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:51.739
So, don’t do the same with your healthy
trades.

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.300
The majority do of traders do exactly this.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.939
As a broker, Vince Stanzione saw it all the
time.

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:03.680
He says clients often wanted him to sell their
winning stocks, and keep their losing stocks!

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.349
Use a trailing stop to lock in profits.

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:11.200
If you really find it hard to let a winning
trade run then part close the trade and run

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.439
the rest.

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:19.910
