00:00:00.033 --> 00:00:04.338
I have another tutorial this one is probably going to be pretty in depth

00:00:04.338 --> 00:00:06.773
so try to follow along

00:00:06.773 --> 00:00:13.514
What I have here is uh, I don't know what to call 
 it. A thing that goes on the back of the bike

00:00:13.514 --> 00:00:15.048
that you can strap stuff to.

00:00:15.315 --> 00:00:21.589
Lets see in this bag there's some screws some washers and some instructions

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:32.132
Lets see, a top plate. This is my kind of 
 instructions right here. 6 bolts 6 washers, that's it.

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:39.873
So this is pretty easy to do you just take out these 6 bolts 
 and then put this plate on there. Top plate is what it's called.

00:00:39.873 --> 00:00:47.181
and then put these and that's it. So seriously if 
 you bought this and went to do the project

00:00:47.181 --> 00:00:53.320
and were so overwhelmed that you went back into your computer 
 and got on youtube and started searching for tutorials

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.524
on how to install a top plate on your motorcycle

00:00:56.524 --> 00:01:00.694
I'm assuming that you have some tools laying around 
 because you're about to start the project

00:01:00.694 --> 00:01:08.569
go ahead and pick whatever is heaviest maybe it's a big 
 socket or maybe there is even a hammer around

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.270
and hit yourself in the teeth with it

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.144
Because you're are dumb and it isn't fair to people aren't 
 dumb that you walk around with all of your teeth

00:01:17.144 --> 00:01:23.884
looking like someone who is smart. So take something heavy and 
 just bash yourself right in the teeth with it

00:01:23.884 --> 00:01:33.260
and that way you'll give people a heads up. Oh 
 this guy is missing all of his teeth

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:39.266
or like a couple in the front, so when I have a 
 conversation with him. They're not going to mean to you

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:43.870
They're just going to talk to you in a way that you will understand.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:47.640
To get these out you'll need an 8mm socket and

00:01:48.943 --> 00:01:55.750
I have the worst tools on the planet. There are monkeys 
 living in the jungle eating bugs out of trees

00:01:55.749 --> 00:02:01.920
they use little sticks, the sticks they use to get the bug out of 
 the tree with are more high tech than the tools I have.

00:02:01.922 --> 00:02:06.760
Now you can put this on 2 different ways. You 
 can put it like this, or like this.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.600
I don't think there is a right or wrong way. If I'm 
 honest it looks better if this lip is pointing down.

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:19.570
you have this nice flat surface, but if I cared 
 about looks I wouldn't be riding a KLR650

00:02:19.473 --> 00:02:27.550
So I'm going to mount it like this because having this extra lip 
 I think will hold stuff on the plate a little bit better.

00:02:27.548 --> 00:02:32.620
One thing that I have notice is that these hole that 
 I need to put the screws back in 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:38.620
this rubber piece underneath the metal piece is kind of not lining up.

00:02:38.625 --> 00:02:44.800
So don't fight it to much just reach 
 down there and push this piece in.

00:02:44.798 --> 00:02:54.180
see how there's a gap between the rubber and the metal piece? Push 
 that in a little bit and that should straighten it out.

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:04.950
Where in the hell is that...

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.350
Oh

00:03:11.892 --> 00:03:15.760
Well it looks like I've done something wrong 
 because there are 2 holes here 

00:03:15.762 --> 00:03:19.600
and there are bolts down there and I have two extra bolts.

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:25.510
but sometimes you end up with extra pieces.

00:03:25.506 --> 00:03:34.220
Well there it is, I decided to go with 5 bolts until I 
 can get a tap to fix those threads that I destroyed

00:03:35.182 --> 00:03:36.820
but I think it looks cool.

00:03:36.817 --> 00:03:43.760
With these new lids. Oh no my socket.

00:03:36.817 --> 00:03:43.760
With these new lids. Oh no my socket.

00:03:44.057 --> 00:03:51.600
with these new lids with these little things you 
 can strap stuff on too and this thing

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:57.600
I can put a lot of gear on top of this 
 I can make this like a lazy boy back here.

00:03:57.605 --> 00:04:04.740
I like it. It's looking good. It's looking like the kind 
 of bike you could go on a long trip with.
