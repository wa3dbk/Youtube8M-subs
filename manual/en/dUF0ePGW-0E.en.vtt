00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:17.550
Understanding vast forces in space and how
they affect life here on Earth requires comprehending

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:24.160
what's going on out there. NASA is planning
to launch four identical spacecraft that will

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.519
orbit the Earth through the dynamic magnetic
system surrounding our planet, studying a

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.339
little-understood phenomenon called magnetic
reconnection.

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.560
Magnetic reconnection is unique to plasma,
that is, the mix of positively and negatively

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:47.570
charged particles that make up stars, fill
space and account for an estimated 99 percent

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:49.990
of the observable universe.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.820
On Oct. 28, 2003, and again the following
day, massive solar flares erupted on the sun,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.220
sending X-rays zooming through the solar system.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.000
Along with the flares, the sun expelled giant

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.020
clouds of solar material, called coronal mass
ejections, or CMEs.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.300
The CMEs slammed into

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.849
Earth's magnetic field pushed material and
energy in toward Earth. This created what's

00:01:20.849 --> 00:01:27.160
called a geomagnetic storm that can interrupt
the work of satellites we have come to depend on.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:31.750
"You can think of it as kind of like a magnetic
explosion. The reason this is important is

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:38.060
because these explosions drive a lot of the
weather patterns that we see in the magnetosphere,

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.480
so what space scientists like to refer to
as space weather.

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:48.349
NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale satellites,
or MMS, should help scientists understand

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:51.450
and better predict space weather patterns.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:58.260
"The MMS mission is a mission consisting of
four spacecraft which will fly in close constellation

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.660
to measure a process called magnetic reconnection."

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.030
"We need to measure magnetic reconnection
in more than one location. Basically, how

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.730
it varies in space, how it varies in all three
special dimensions."

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.280
Scientists want to know exactly what conditions
-- what tipping points -- trigger magnetic

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:24.900
reconnection events. Much of what we currently
know about the small-scale physics of magnetic

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:30.900
reconnection comes from theoretical studies,
computer models and laboratory experiments.

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:38.980
Better understanding requires observing magnetic
reconnection up close so MMS will make

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:45.680
its measurements in Earth's magnetosphere,
an ideal natural laboratory in which reconnection

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.710
can be observed under a wide range of conditions.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:56.120
But before MMS and its science team can begin
their studies, the satellites must be prepared

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.950
for launch into orbit.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.520
"Once they arrived several things had to be
done: they had to be fueled, they had to be

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:08.540
processed down here. And, remember, there
were four spacecraft, so it took four times

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:09.500
the effort."

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.590
NASA's Launch Services Program has extensive
experience preparing multiple probes for liftoff

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:23.590
on a single rocket. In September 2011, the
GRAIL mission sent two spacecraft to

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.960
the moon. More recently, the twin Radiation
Belt Storm Probe satellites were launched

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:34.840
in 2013. But with MMS, there are four.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.390
Omar Baez is the MMS launch director for the
Launch Services Program at NASA's Kennedy

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.990
Space Center in Florida.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:51.000
"Yeah, it would be simpler to do one spacecraft,
but we're here to do the difficult things

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.270
and that's why this business is so interesting."

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:01.270
As NASA's launch manager, Baez oversees integration
of the satellites with a familiar rocket the

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:02.910
Atlas V.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.709
"The Launch Service Program contracts the
launch service to United Launch Alliance and

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:14.150
this has been a team that has worked together
since the inception of the Launch Services

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:22.210
Program here in 1998. We work very closely
with ULA from the very design of the mission

00:04:22.819 --> 00:04:28.680
from the contract of the mission through the
design through the integration and finally

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.470
through the operations and buildup of the
launch vehicle and final launch."

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:38.750
Once in orbit, the next challenge is deploying
all four MMS satellites.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.840
"To get them in orbit, in the right orbit
and the right place, is the most complicated

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:49.130
flight design challenge our team has had.
Amazing amount of maneuvers we have to do

00:04:49.130 --> 00:04:54.940
with the Centaur upper stage to make sure
we release all four of the spacecraft at their

00:04:54.940 --> 00:05:00.410
right time in five-minute intervals between
release. So, if you can imagine, that first

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:05.130
one pops off and then the second one five
minutes later, then the third one another

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.320
five minutes and so on."

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.300
After months of testing, the quartet of MMS
satellites will be ready to go to work.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.220
"Once they are commissioned after that six-month
time frame, they formation fly in a tetrahedron

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:25.220
formation and they go around the Earth to
pick up these reconnection events we find

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:31.030
on both sides of the Earth where the magnetosphere
of the sun, the sun's magnetic field and the

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:37.530
Earth's magnetic field meet on the sun side
and on the tail side of the magneto tail of

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:40.300
the Earth on the dark side of the Earth."

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:45.050
As the spacecraft fly through such a site,
they will measure the magnetic and electric

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.330
fields present, as well as the movement of
particles.

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:52.220
"We need to understand both of those, if we
want to understand how the magnetosphere works.

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.250
And we believe that both of those scenarios
are also very important for us for other applications,

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:04.250
such as the sun, in the solar wind, in planetary
magnetospheres, and many astrophysical objects,

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.690
as well as in the laboratory."

00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.370
During its first phase, MMS satellites will
travel through reconnection sites on the sun

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:18.669
side of Earth. During the second phase of
its mission, MMS will observe reconnection

00:06:18.669 --> 00:06:24.919
on the night side where that connected field
flows around both sides of our planet to a

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:26.720
second reconnection point.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:31.720
"On the day side, basically you have a situation
where the solar wind is just constantly running

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:37.040
into Earth's magnetic field. And this is really
great for MMS, because we know at some point

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.630
MMS is going to encounter this region. Our
hope is that since this process is always

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:48.340
happening we are gonna get lucky and actually
fly right though the magnetic explosion as

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:49.460
it is happening."

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:53.460
"Now, on the night side, the situation is
a little bit different. So, what happens,

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:58.340
you have a more gradual buildup of magnetic
energy in the tail, and these reconnection

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.169
processes, these magnetic explosions, can
just sort of pop off randomly. We don't really

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:05.460
know when it's going to happen or where it's
gonna happen."

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:11.550
During the MMS mission, scientists will have
their first chance to watch magnetic reconnection

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:18.160
right as it is occurring. By focusing on the
small-scale process, scientists may be able

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:23.979
to open the door to understanding what happens
on larger scales throughout the universe.

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:30.780
Of course, it also will teach us more about
giant geomagnetic storms, thus helping us

00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:32.699
safeguard our home planet.

00:07:32.699 --> 00:07:36.470
"We hope that is going to allow us to improve
our models so that we can put the right physics

00:07:36.470 --> 00:07:40.740
in it and actually make predictions about
where and when reconnection is going to happen,

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.199
and this will help us make our space weather
models more predictively powerful."
