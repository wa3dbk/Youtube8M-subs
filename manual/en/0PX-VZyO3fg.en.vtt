DAVID CLEMEN: Hi, I'm David Clemen on behalf
of Expert Village. And today we're going to

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:13.510
do an abstract painting on a larger scale
on a piece of birch wood. Alright, so there's

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:18.220
lots of texture-tools in the art stores but
you can get creative with that and you can

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:25.340
do, and you can make texture with this fork.
I've got an oyster shucker, I've got the squeegee,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.500
so don't limit yourselves just by--well as
they say, you can make texture wise, you can

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:36.500
use anything. You can use your fingers you
can use your fingernails. So with the squeegee,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:45.610
I can continue to squeegee extra paint here
then I can come in and pull up lines in the

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.670
rock face of these mountains. If the paint
is dry, you can just add more paint. I can

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.010
come in here in and just crosshatch this again.
And then pull the paint out of the way. And

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:05.700
then it will make slicing carves into the
paint. Come in here and then if I want, I

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:17.219
can take and dip the edge into this extra
paint here and just kind of chop it. And then

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:25.619
I can just kinda dab it and make the kinda
motion or movement. If I want, I could take

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:36.490
this fork and just come in here and draw really
thin lines and drag them out. And this is

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.520
going to give it a little bit more three dimensional
feel. And see, I couldn't do these lines with

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.099
a paintbrush. I couldn't go back in and paint
that really thin line but with the fork, I

00:01:48.099 --> 00:01:56.999
could come in here and make these really neat
shapes. And it looks kind of animal-like almost

00:01:56.999 --> 00:02:02.929
but it adds a lot of texture to the painting.
So don't limit yourself on what's in the art

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:08.140
store, you can get creative. I could take
this oyster shucker and just scratch this

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:19.430
out, scratch this out, scratch this out. So
that's adding texture to your abstract painting.
