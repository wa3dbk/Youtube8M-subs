[Intro music]

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.210
Avocado and Shrimp Sauce Cocktail or in French in the text 

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:16.180
avocat aux crevettes sauce cocktail. 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:23.020
To make this traditional, but nonetheless, delicious recipe you  

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:29.050
will need: perfectly ripe avocados, peeled shrimp, 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.060
cocktail sauce, olives and chopped chives. 

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.280
Place the shrimp in a bowl. 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:45.110
Add a little bit of the cocktail sauce, about two tablespoons. 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:51.130
Mix to coat the shrimp. 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:01:03.100
Add a little bit of chopped chives. 

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:11.000
Taste. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.060
Mm, very tasty. I was going to say rectify the seasoning, 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.190
but it's perfect. What can I do?

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:24.080
Prepare the avocado then. 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:38.260
So cut the avocado in half up to the pit. Then twist. 

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:41.000
Great. Beautiful. 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.210
Remove the pit. 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:49.180
Use a pommes noisette baller. 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.060
This is a pommes Parisienne baller. 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.090
The difference is it's the same idea as a melon baller, 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.140
but different sizes. 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.280
In diameters pommes noisetts is 22 millimeters 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.120
and pommes Parisienne is 25 millimeters. 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.000
A melon baller is around 30, so it's bigger. 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Use the pommes noisette baller to make avocado balls. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
My avocado is very ripe, it's perfectly ripe, a little bit  

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:45.130
sticky. And try not to change the shape of the avocado here 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.250
even if I did a little bit. 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:03:01.260
Prepare the other one. Remove the stem. Twist. 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:07.200
Sometimes you may use a knife and remove the pit like so. 

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:14.040
If you're going to serve this hors d'oeuvre let's say in an hour 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.090
or two, you will brush a little bit of lemon juice 

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.170
on the top here to avoid browning. 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.260
Here we are going to serve it right away, 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.050
so we don't need to do that. 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:33.190
Fill the avocado, first of all divide the shrimp in two 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.120
and then in four thus you will know how much you have 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:04:01.130
to use about, just to give you an idea.  

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:10.170
Okay. My avocado is not totally straight so I'm going 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:15.070
to cut it a little bit, just to be able to set it. 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.190
There we go. Perfect. 

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:26.000
Position the shrimp in the center. 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:42.160
Place back the balls around. 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:51.250
Add a little bit of black olive on the top and serve. 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:58.140
Repeat the operation for the other ones. 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.260
Avocat aux crevettes sauce cocktail. 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.070
Bon Appetit. Enjoy this wonderful hors d'oeuvre.
