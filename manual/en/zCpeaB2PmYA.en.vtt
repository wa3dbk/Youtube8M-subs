00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
So when a girl hits a certain
age she starts hearing a clock ticking. tick

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.139
tock, tick tock, tick tock

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:11.070
It gets louder and louder and
it's like it won't stop, tick tock, tick tock

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.720
So it is like something in your
head. Like your body is trying to force you

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.619
to make a baby. I do not want a baby but my
body is telling me to make one.

00:00:20.619 --> 00:00:26.230
Every day it follows me. Where
ever I go. I'll be buying a corn dog or rolling

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.069
a joint and I hear it. Tick tock, tick tock.

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:35.590
Please Kimberly just shut the fuck
up. I mean Jesus Christ, I'm fucking wasted

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:40.980
and I do not want to hear about your personal
issues! Can't we just watch shitty television?

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.730
Jason, how many times did I save
your ass and also save this city? You could

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.380
show me a little respect! Why won't you even
consider making a baby with me?

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.430
Maybe because I don't want a baby!
Maybe I just want to see who will be the next

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:01.870
food network star! Maybe I just want to enjoy
my buzz which you a killing by the way.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:07.000
I am pretty sure the Hispanic girl
wins. Now explain to me why you won't sleep

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.120
with me anymore? Why will you pay a hooker
for sex when I have a perfectly good uterus

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.780
right here?

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.159
The Hispanic girl wins? What the
fuck? That bitch can't even make a risotto

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.520
or poach a goddamn egg properly! I wanted
the gay guy to win!

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.190
The gay guy burns his chicken
in the finals. Now why are you avoiding my

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:33.340
question? We used to bang regularly! Remember
when you, Zack and Alpha 5 ran a train on

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:33.750
me?

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:39.409
Running a train on you is completely
different than purposely making a baby. I

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:44.409
can't explain, It's a guy thing. So how many
more days are we suspended from work?

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:48.650
We go back to work tomorrow and
it's a good thing because I am almost out

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.440
of weed. I still can't believe that bitch
Kat suspended us.

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.950
I always knew that Kat was a spiteful
whore but I'd rather be working than sitting

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.260
here talking about your uterus. Why don't
you roll another joint and I'll mix us a couple

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.790
drinks?

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.869
A couple of drinks sounds like
a good idea. Make them really strong this

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.200
time. Maybe if you loosen up we can talk about
having sex later.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.170
Sure, whatever. But no matter how
wasted I get, I am not making any fucking

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.319
babies. Did you remember to record last week's
Dancing With The Former Porn Stars?

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.650
Yes I did. It's a really good
episode. During the dance off Sasha keeps

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.980
tripping over Long John's junk. Wait a second,
did you hear that?

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.310
I do not hear anything, what are
you talking about?

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:37.890
Tick Tock, Tick Tock, Tick Tock...
