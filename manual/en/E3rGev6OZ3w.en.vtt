00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:11.770
In my church group in Greenfield, Massachusetts
at the age of about 16 or 17, I had made a

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.620
deal with my mom and dad—I was very, very
close to my mom and dad.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:22.859
I'm a real momma's boy and got along with
them my whole life, hardly even rough periods.

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.710
And they went to the Congregationalist church:
The Church of the Covered Dish Supper in Greenfield,

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:28.710
Massachusetts.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.850
Massachusetts is an old enough state that
you could not charter a town without having

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.100
a Congregationalist church and this was the
first one in out town.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.810
I mean, from back 200 years ago.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:49.580
And I made a deal with my mom and dad that
I wouldn't have to go to church services Sunday

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.930
morning if I went to youth group Sunday night.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:01:01.370
So we had a pastor—that minister at that
church—that was fairly hip, you know, he

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.570
was trying to deal with the children, play
a Jim Morrison song once in a while.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.710
Played the Beatles.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:10.840
Far out!

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:21.630
And he sincerely wanted us to do some inquiry
into theological questions and I took it very

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:22.630
seriously.

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.480
I may have been the only in the youth group
that did take it seriously and I read the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:33.799
Bible cover-to-cover and I think that anyone
who is thinking about maybe being an atheist...

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.979
if you read the Bible or the Koran or the
Torah cover-to-cover I believe you will emerge

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:41.770
from that as an atheist.

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.780
I mean, you can read "The God Delusion" by
Richard Dawkins, you can read "God Is Not

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.871
Great" by Hitchens... but the Bible itself,
will turn you atheist faster than anything.

00:01:50.871 --> 00:01:53.510
Question: Why would reading the Bible make
you an atheist?

00:01:53.510 --> 00:02:02.229
Penn Jillette: I think because what we get
told about the Bible is a lot of picking and

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:09.679
choosing, when you see, you know, Lot's daughter
gang raped and beaten, and the Lord being

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:17.341
okay with that; when you actually read about
Abraham being willing to kill his son, when

00:02:17.341 --> 00:02:22.960
you actually read that; when you read the
insanity of the talking snake; when you read

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:31.770
the hostility towards homosexuals, towards
women, the celebration of slavery; when you

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:36.720
read in context, that "thou shalt not kill"
means only in your own tribe—I mean, there's

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:45.660
no hint that it means humanity in general;
that there's no sense of a shared humanity,

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:52.900
it's all tribal; when you see a God that is
jealous and insecure; when you see that there's

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:58.690
contradictions that show that it was clearly
written hundreds of years after the supposed

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.780
fact and full of contradictions.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.750
I think that anybody... you know, it's like
reading The Constitution of the United States

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:05.750
of America.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:07.730
It's been... it's in English.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:10.640
You know, you don't need someone to hold your
hand.

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.230
Just pick it up and read it.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.540
Just read what the First Amendment says and
then read what the Bible says.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.819
Going back to the source material is always
the best.

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:24.790
When someone is trying to interpret something
for you, they always have an agenda.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.060
So I read the Bible and then I read Bertrand
Russell and I read a lot of other stuff because

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.060
in the Greenfield public library the 900's
of the Dewey Decimal System...

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.940
I mean, one of the few people that still remembers
it, the 900's are theology.

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:42.390
They're only about this long but that's all
on camera.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.220
Only about this long, the one armed guy who
caught a fish this big.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.739
They're only about this long and so I read
a lot of them.

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:56.830
I started going go to class and, to his credit,
the pastor who was a wonderful man, wonderful

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.620
man would let me talk to him about this stuff.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:13.940
And finally after—I don't know, it's so
long ago—but after months of this platonic

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:20.590
questioning every night at youth group, the
minister called my mom and dad and said, "You

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:27.180
know, I think maybe Penn should stop coming
to youth group, he's no longer learning about

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:28.710
the Bible from me.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.260
He is now converting everyone in the class
to atheism."

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:38.610
So I was asked to leave—very politely, very
nicely—youth group.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:49.470
And then with the help of Martin Mull, Randy
Newman, Frank Zappa, the idea that these three

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:57.560
men were out-of-the-closet atheists was so
inspiring to me and so important to me.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:59.590
And reading interviews with somebody...

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:06.150
And I remember being somebody in a religious—and
not a religious community like wack jobs,

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:13.650
but, you know, in a community where most everyone
was Christian—having those people in interviews

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:21.830
say the simple sentence "There is no God"
meant the world to me and gave me joy and

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.710
gave me passion and gave me love and gave
me confidence.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.420
And I think the first time I was interviewed,
as presumptuous as this seems—and please

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:36.680
forgive me—I remembered Frank Zappa's interviews.

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:43.960
And I wanted to give a chance for someone
else reading that to not feel they were alone.

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:45.699
Now that's less important now.

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.361
I mean, the population of atheists in this
country is going through the roof.

00:05:49.361 --> 00:05:52.260
I mean, I'm now on the side that's winning.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:58.800
It's over 20 percent by some polls and I believe
if you counted atheism as a religion it's

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.050
the fastest growing religion in the history
of the United States of America.

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:06.500
So now I'm on the team that's winning which
is an uncomfortable position for me.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.320
But back, you know, 30 years ago, 40 years
ago, it still felt like it meant something,

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:24.030
you know, it's... we're several years behind
gay rights but we're following a much faster

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:25.050
path at acceptance.
