00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:10.800
DAN: I'm Dan Rockhill, distinguished
 professor of architecture 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:13.910
at the University of Kansas and 
the executive director of the 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.750
graduate design build program,
 Studio 804. 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.510
This would be Studio 804 13. 

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:23.400
And this is a building 
we've just completed. 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.240
We start, of course, with a potential
 project and  

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.230
that'll vary from year to year. 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.060
In this case I was pretty sure 
that this was a viable option. 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:38.100
We start with design work 
fairly early on. 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.200
In addition to the development
 of the design every student has 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.870
identified an area of specialty. 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.750
Everybody works on everything
 in very different ways, but I've 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.840
got to have one person that I 
can go to for be it concrete, 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.320
or the curtain wall system, and they're

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.390
the ones who are sort of 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.450
spearheading whatever advancement
 may take place in that. 

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.640
They do have a tremendous
 leg up in the employment 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.830
aspect of this in the end and so that's a 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.460
very strong card for them to be 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.100
able to play in an extremely 
competitive market. 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:14.940
It's my responsibility to 
take a leadership role as an 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.640
educator. 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.890
The young people in architecture, 
need to have an example for 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:22.390
themselves. 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.900
So that means that students 
are exposed to this L.E.E.D. 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.090
process. 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.410
L.E.E.D. stands for

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.550
Leadership in Energy and 
Environmental Design. 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.090
There are various levels 
that you can attain. 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:37.400
Platinum is the very highest. 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.230
In fact in this building, 
this would be our sixth L.E.E.D. 

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.200
Platinum construction. 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.440
There are very few of those
 in the country, which is 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.330
testimonial to just how 
difficult it is to achieve. 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.760
What is unique about this 
building is this exterior 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.060
skin that is made of aluminum
 that is by in large scraps. 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.160
Because aluminum is so highly
 recyclable it seemed like the 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.170
product of choice. 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.480
The glass that you see here
 in the interior curtain wall is 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:10.540
glass that we sourced from 
a project that really fell apart in 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.330
Kansas City. 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:17.000
It's another example of ways
 in which we can re-appropriate 

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:20.620
materials that otherwise would
 have ended up in the landfill. 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.100
We have photovoltaics on the roof, 
both upper roof and then 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.370
likewise our porch entry cover. 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.720
We will be returning back to the 
grid 12% of the energy that 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:32.600
we're producing in this building. 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.110
These garage doors 
which are 30 foot long. 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.180
These will be on a controller 
and literally come down at night 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.800
so that we can completely 
isolate the space. 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.730
I think for what we are able 
to do in terms of the quality of 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.170
the building, the quality of the design,
 the time frame in 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.190
which we do it, and this L.E.E.D. 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.800
component that I talked about earlier, 
I think we're the only 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.790
ones in the world.
