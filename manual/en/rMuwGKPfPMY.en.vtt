Easy Bm Chord | Learn 3 Versions of the B
Minor Guitar Chord and Decide Which Is Best

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:02.210
For You

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.210
Hey there.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.410
Has that B minor chord ever giving you a really
bad time?

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.679
Well I know I asked for a lot of my students.

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:10.549
You know, we're gonna put an end to that today.

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.009
I'm gonna show you three versions of the B
minor chord and we're gonna put that to rest

00:00:15.009 --> 00:00:16.290
once and for all.

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.830
Let's do it.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:20.660
Hey there.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.640
I'm Tomas Michaud and welcome to my weekly
update.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.210
The first B minor chord I'm gonna show you
is the simplest and it's a useful chord even

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.170
if you can do the more complicated ones.

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:39.320
It's three fingers, take a look at this.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.350
I've got my first finger on the first string
second fret, second finger on the second string

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:50.500
third fret and then my third finger over there
on the third string fourth fret.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.960
You wanna aim for just the top four strings.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:00.880
It's not terrible if you hit the fifth string
but it's really not part of the chord so try

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:07.939
that with me first finger second fret, first
string now that second finger down second

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:15.090
string third fret and then the third finger
fourth fret on the third string and strum.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.810
You wanna get nice, clear sound for each of
the strings.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:21.929
No buzzing.

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:23.619
No muted notes.

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.759
That's the first one, B minor -- the easiest
form.

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:31.350
Now number 2, we're gonna add just one finger
to that chord.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.100
This is a four-finger chord.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:38.069
Go ahead and put your first finger down, second
finger down now we're gonna put both the third

00:01:38.069 --> 00:01:39.850
and fourth fingers down.

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.990
My pinky is right next to the third.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.369
You take a close look.

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:50.340
You'll see it looks very much like the previous
chord but its a little fuller sound.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.490
It's a very common form.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:54.219
I use this often.

00:01:54.219 --> 00:02:01.069
Okay, let's do it together first finger first
string second fret, second finger that's second

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:07.490
string third fret now I'm gonna stretch over
and skip the third string and put down my

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:12.640
third finger on the fourth string, fourth
fret, fourth string fourth fret, yeah!

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.230
I said it right.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:18.530
Okay, now the pinky right next to the third
string fourth fret -- third string, fourth

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:19.720
fret.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:25.540
Go ahead and try that, that's the sound.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.270
Try it a few times.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:29.909
Get your fingers off.

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:30.909
Shake them out.

00:02:30.909 --> 00:02:31.909
Good.

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:32.909
Put them on.

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:33.909
Come on.

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:34.909
You can do it.

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.430
First finger second finger second string,
stretch over to the fourth string fourth fret

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.569
and then next to it on the third string I'm
putting my pinky down.

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:46.349
Play it.

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:50.510
It's better already.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:56.939
Now for the third form and again this is a
very useful form.

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.530
All three of these are useful.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:00.810
This is a bar chord.

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:08.280
To start, you'll gonna place your finger all
the way across the neck on the second fret

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.120
then you put down the other three fingers.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:15.939
It's a very full B minor chord now the good
thing about this B minor chord is you can

00:03:15.939 --> 00:03:17.090
move it around.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:24.200
By moving it, you can make a different chord
that's a C minor chord, back to B minor, C

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.939
minor, D minor - very practical chord.

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:29.709
Let's do it together.

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:37.359
Bar first across the second fret now I'm going
to put my third and pinky down together.

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:42.129
For me, it's easy to do this in the beginning
and they go right where they were for the

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:44.310
other B minor chord to the second version.

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:50.340
The third finger on the fourth string fourth
fret and my pinky right next to it on the

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.879
third string fourth fret, got it?

00:03:52.879 --> 00:03:59.480
Now we got that second finger hanging there
we're gonna put that down on the second string

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.569
third fret.

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:06.159
I have to admit, I do it more than I actually
look at it.

00:04:06.159 --> 00:04:07.930
Okay.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.049
Try that one more time.

00:04:12.049 --> 00:04:16.880
You might wanna try something that works better
for some people, a small majority.

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.660
Putting the first three fingers down first
and then the bar, you might wanna try that.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.170
Let's just do that for fun.

00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:30.180
Put that third and fourth finger down the
fourth string and the third string, the second

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.010
finger on the second string and then bar.

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:43.980
Either way, you gotta get to practice where
you can just go, all down at one time.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:51.500
When you're playing, you don't have time to
put the fingers down one at a time.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:53.160

experience.

You can do this.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.720

and the right information.
