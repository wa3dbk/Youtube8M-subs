Hi, my name is Dan Kimbrough on behalf of
expertvillage.com, in this clip I'm going

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:09.380
to discuss how to play a hand in which you
have bid nil on. We have here is a hand that

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:21.070
you want to bid nil on. You got the 7, 9 of
hearts, you got the ace, queen, jack, 9, 6,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:30.159
2 of clubs, you got your 10, 8, 5, 4 of diamonds
and the queen of spades. Now you may think

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:35.800
because you got an ace and a queen of spades
that going nil in this hand would be hard

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.320
to do but it is actually not, no matter what
is lead you want to stay low. So if clubs

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:46.260
are lead you want to start at the bottom of
the club list. Even if 4 clubs come out, you

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.640
got all of these that could be get even out.
Now if someone lays the king of clubs, you

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.310
play the queen, your queen is now out of play,
king and queen are gone, you still got the

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:00.740
ace. The next highest is the jack so someone
lays the 10 of clubs knowing that you have

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.860
gone nil, they are trying to force you to
play a high card, you play the 9. Again, you

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.420
try to stay under what anyone is played. The
goal is to eventually everyone is going to

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.350
run out of clubs and you won't have to worry
about this ace until later on and you could

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.470
throw off. Now if you get the lead some how
that means that you gone ahead and you screwed

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.070
up your nil but if your partner gets the lead,
that is a good thing because you are going

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.670
to want your partner to lead something out
here. Say your partner leads a 7 of hearts,

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.530
I mean leads hearts, you deal your 7 that
stays pretty low. Your partner comes back

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.330
again and leads another heart and it stays
pretty low. Your partner leads another heart,

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.420
you have no more and you could play this ace
as a throw off. Rather to use the king to

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.590
cut, throw the ace to throw off and you no
longer have that. You are going to let the

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.530
game progress and eventually spades would
be lead because people know that you have

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:51.780
nil and they are trying to force you to play
your good cards. You wait for the big joker

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.729
to come out and you play your queen. Now the
only thing that you have to worry about is

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:01.830
if someone leads a 2 of spades that is a pretty
high which you are going to hope that your

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.979
partner has one of the jokers. That is something
that you got to be careful of when you go

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.789
nil because spades could come back to haunt
you. It is not always smart to go for nil

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:17.230
when you got the highest spades but if you
only got one it is 10 points or 50 points

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.280
and say you loose 50, it means you would of
only gotten 10 if you have played a regular

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.969
hand anyway.
