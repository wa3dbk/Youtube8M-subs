00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:08.440
&gt;&gt; Are you concerned about living in difficult
times, well check this out.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:13.409
&gt;&gt; Marjory: This DVD training is for those
seeking to grow more of their own food using

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.970
as little store bought feed or fertilizers
as possible.

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.250
The filming has been done on a family farm
where we depend on these systems to grow a

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.920
significant part of our diet.

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:26.839
&gt;&gt; If you’ve ever considered growing some
or all of your family’s food this DVD may

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:27.970
be for you.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.970
It’s a video tutorial to get you started
and a reference to come back to as your skills

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.840
and systems expand.

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:35.910
Learn about water-

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.700
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Different qualities of water depend
on its source.

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.350
Rain water is the best water and is often
called the gold standard for garden plants

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.350
and trees.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.800
Nothing brings your garden to life like a
good rain.

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.550
Pond water is the next best water if the pond
is healthy and contains life and fertility.

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:56.170
The guideline of about an inch of water per
week is also appropriate in the garden.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.640
You can use this same equation to estimate
how much water you will need based on how

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.920
many square feet of garden space you have.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:02.920
&gt;&gt; Vegetable garden.

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.220
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Different layers of soil have
different levels of biological activity and

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.290
the bio-intensive method takes care not to
overly disturb soil layers.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.410
Regardless of your soil type, continuously
adding compost is the main key to fertility.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.640
Clay soils, sandy soils, rocky soils,-compost
fixes them all.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.640
&gt;&gt; Raising rabbits.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.470
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Rabbits are an easy food source
to grow in a very small space.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.240
In our garden we have an eight cage rabbit
hutch.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.300
Each cage has five square feet of space.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.560
One buck and three brooding does take up four
cages and the remaining four cages are used

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.780
to grow up the babies.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.870
You can get about 90 rabbits a year from a
setup like this.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.870
&gt;&gt; Home butchering.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:43.090
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Rabbit fires are harvested when
they are about two months old and weigh somewhere

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.170
between three and a half and four and a half
pounds.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.170
&gt;&gt; Poultry.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.090
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Having chickens in your yard is
a real delight.

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.700
Chickens are a valuable part of your food
production system.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.870
There are many different ways to keep chickens.

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.840
Are criteria of using little or no commercially
bought feed and doing as little work as possible

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.920
shaped the system that we’ve developed.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:02.409
&gt;&gt; Integrating dogs into your system.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.340
&gt;&gt; Marjory: To make sure the dogs have easy
access to every area we need protected, we

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.920
cut this hole into the fence which lets the
dogs through but keep the geese in.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:11.120
&gt;&gt; Growing perennials.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.230
&gt;&gt; Marjory: Perennial plants are bushes, vines
and trees that you plant once and they continue

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.599
to grow year after year.

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.010
Geese are a good complement to an orchard
if you have room for them.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.180
We put fresh water into shallow tubs placed
beneath our fruit trees.

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.290
The geese love it and they bathe and preen,
copulate and of course defecate in the water

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.060
making a good old mess which is wonderful
stuff for the fruit and nut trees.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.330
We rotate the tubs around the orchard and
every tree gets this liquid fertilizer every

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.620
two or three months.

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.620
&gt;&gt; Much more.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.290
&gt;&gt; Marjory: The sweet potato is as efficient
in caloric production and space requirements.

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.129
Amazingly enough, the sweet potato does well
in less than fertile soils.

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:51.909
&gt;&gt; The DVD comes with an additional cd chock
full of reference materials to help you with

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.730
each subject covered in the videos.
