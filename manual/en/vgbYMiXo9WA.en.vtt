00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:15.340
I am Maroles Coenen and welcome to
Glory's technique of the week

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.390
hi everybody my name is Martijn de Jong and I
will teach you some different kinds of

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.009
jobs today today I brought the Robin
von Roosmalen is the glory

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.300
lightweight super star and is going to
help me demonstrate the techniques so

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.829
first we're going to start with the
boxing jab stands a little bit low it's

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.280
a little bit sideways cover your chin with
your shoulder on one side and with your

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.100
hand on the other side and goes fast up
boom this is one so the jab comes from

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.920
low and comes straight up boom this is a
fast jab and usually we use it to

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.170
measure the distance a little bit deeper
the feet are a little bit turned it

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.920
needs a little bit more turned in so
you're here so the jab here comes

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.680
naturally from down here to up here you
see so the boxing jab should hit a

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.790
little bit with the upper part of the
knuckles so it comes from here and it

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:20.380
moves up so this is the way you hit it
from this part of the knuckles

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.820
boxing is good it's fast but for kickboxing is
dangerous because somebody can attack

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:29.509
you with it with a low kick they kick
your leg really easy and then for

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:33.859
kickboxing is not good so for kickboxing
a little bit more up here a little bit

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:39.710
more this way and you can just give the
jab like that so you step in and step

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.119
back again so you sometime if I want to
give them a low kick use some time to

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:52.249
block it so boom block boom look so a
little bit more straight here but it

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:57.649
goes fast as well you measure the
distance is a fast

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:03.740
yeah you're hitting with the front of the knuckles you can
jab jab you can make a double jab you

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:08.090
could just go and move away keep the guy
busy and measure the distance at the same time

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.290
for MMA the distance is even bigger
so I'm because I can try and take him

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.060
down so that this is a little bit farther away
when I'm here he's lower and he's a

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.420
little bit more frontal so when it goes
in you come it goes out right away as

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:27.170
well he punches boom and goes back you
see so I have no time to take him down

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:31.490
or to kick him or to punch him so the distance is bigger so we're here with boxing

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:36.180
we're here with kickboxing and we're
here with MMA so it punches

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.170
see and it's gone again so the third
one is one who comes from up

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.370
to straight, straight under the defense it's
more like a uppercut jab consumed here

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:55.950
the thumb is up it goes fast boom for
under to up one more when somebody as a

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:00.629
has a defense like this he's up up here
so it's a little bit over for me from

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:06.269
the inside so it comes up from boom it's
not an uppercut is it's not really a jab

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:09.480
it's right in between so he comes

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
if you hit them with when your thumb is up your

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.200
thumb is pointing upwards boom comes
right in, comes right through so when I'm

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.900
here
boom it comes right through one more

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.000
boom

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
so Peter Aerts uses this a lot to

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.260
keep somebody at this and especially
when somebody has a good defense comes

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.739
right through it's not a knockout punch
it's just to measure the distance and at

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.000
the same time create an opening

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.560
comes right from from from here underneath to

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.000
an exchange straight to exchange with his thumb up

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.500
so now we can use the front

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:52.880
hand as well the lead hand to stop
somebody moving in somebody's attacking

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:56.790
and he's going to stop me so I have a
little bit bigger distance I come

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.489
forward and boom it stops me here so I'm
here and he stops me here it's a really

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.700
powerful jab and you can even knock
somebody out with it because I'm moving

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.920
forward he comes a little bit forward
and it's like a straight train crash

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.920
And here boom

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.380
boom

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.480
it's when I move in you turn your
thumb a little bit more down so here so

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.860
because somebody's rushing in he can
attack you as well so when you turn the

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.120
thumb down you protect yourself a little
bit more you're automatically when you

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:32.400
turn the thumb down your chin is behind
your shoulder look when I punch like

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.310
this or turn the thumb down see the
shoulder comes up so you protect

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.159
yourself a little bit more you're all
covered up here when somebody moves in

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:41.820
and trying to attack you so we do it
again I move forward he stays there and

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.120
as soon as I'm close he throws the the
straight hard jab so when I'm here and

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.200
see and he's all covered up

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.380
one more
boom

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000
so four kinds of jabs today

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:29.440
so guys train hard I'll see you
next week for a new technique
