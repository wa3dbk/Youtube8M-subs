00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:06.879
This is the King family. Their farm.

00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:11.000
and Andy, the resident llama. The farm family, and llama

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.290
all reside in the middle of Kansas. And the farm,

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.960
well, it's a lot smaller than your
typical Kansas farm.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.419
We currently own about a hundred and
sixty acres and

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.659
rent about 160 acres

00:00:25.659 --> 00:00:28.659
it doesn't take a lot of land to farm, it doesn't take a lot of resources,

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:33.590
it takes creativity. Ken, Robyn, and
Daniel work on the farm full-time, Judy

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:37.449
and Kendra part-time, and, well, everyone helps out in various ways.

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:41.019
and they have some big news. Daniel: This spring

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:44.899
my wife and I are actually taking over the
farm from my parents.

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:49.670
Most farms are family farms and often they get passed
down from one generation to the next.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.210
But what's unique here? Ken: We obviously
started out as a

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.370
the small, conventional farm, and it was
one day when my skid steer was broken down

00:00:58.370 --> 00:00:59.120
and I was

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.249
loading manure by hand and I stopped
and took a break and leaned back and

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:03.949
discovered that

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:07.810
cows have four legs and I only have two and
they're laying there doing nothing and

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.430
I'm doing all that work and

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.470
at that point in time we had this bright
revelation that the cows were going to work for their keep instead of

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:19.180
me keeping the cows. Narrator: With conventional
dairying, cows are kept in smaller, indoor

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:19.850
spaces

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.090
requiring farmers to manage food and
waste.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.990
Basically Ken was tired of shoveling shit. Ken: and
from conventional during we went to

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.270
grass-based dairying, seasonal, and then

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.000
we went without feeding any grain whatsoever, because a dairy cow is a ruminant animal

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.840
and was designed to digest grass and forage and not grain.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.420
And, realizing we were producing a
superior product in

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.720
and shipping it to the dairy who could
care less. They just wanted pounds of

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:49.409
fluid milk.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.390
Narrator: This is a problem that most farmers go up against.
The commodity system doesn't

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:54.490
reward farmers

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:58.070
for better quality foods or more
progressive practices.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:02.110
So, they opened up a store on their farm and
started selling direct.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.820
Daniel: Our store is self-help on the honor
system. Robyn: So we choose

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.429
to sell all of our products of the farm, so 24
hours a day

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.110
they're welcome to come the door is always
open. Daniel: People can come

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:18.330
and go whatever works for them and we
don't have to be around we can spend

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.739
our time doing what we need to do on the farm

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:25.370
The first time a customer comes from the
store and we like to just tell them

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.790
a bit about our farm and how we
produce and that system works for us

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.890
I mean, people want to trust

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.280
in other people and I think they
really respect their farm and they're

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.500
more bought into the idea the farm

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.820
when there's that mutual respect. Daniel: It provides a
lot market stability,

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:48.040
it doesn't fluctuate as much as
conventional markets do.l

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.360
Ken: We expect them to trust us in the way
we're producing product and

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.040
we expect to trust them that they will
take care of us

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.560
and support us. It's an interesting business
because

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.879
tastes change, customers change. You can
only go off what was in demand this year

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:08.190
next year it won't be the same. So there's
always enough challenges in there

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.849
to keep one from getting stale and old.

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:15.280
It's a lot of fun. Narrator: And Andy?

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.819
Robyn: He is a very important in the spring when
we have 140

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.590
little lambs out in the field.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.459
Daniel: What makes him good at predator control is that he's just checking things out

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:30.170
If a coyote comes out, he'll just go check him out,

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:31.260
because he's curious.
