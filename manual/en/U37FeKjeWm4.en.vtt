Hey it's Mei Yu! It's Fun2draw an easy rose, step by step.

00:00:08.844 --> 00:00:13.265
You can draw this pretty rose for your loved ones, friends, or family, or you can send

00:00:13.265 --> 00:00:15.394
them this video to surprise them!

00:00:15.394 --> 00:00:22.394
First, I'm going to start with a swirl, just like this:

00:00:24.575 --> 00:00:26.465
and I'm going to draw

00:00:26.465 --> 00:00:32.465
a bit of the other side, so now this area kind of looks like the letter "Y".

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:36.515
And now, I'm going to draw

00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:39.735
part of the petal like that

00:00:39.735 --> 00:00:41.765
and on the other side, too.

00:00:41.765 --> 00:00:48.135
You can add these little lines in there to make the flower look more natural.

00:00:48.135 --> 00:00:51.635
And now you can layer some of the other
petals... so this one's going to be wrapped

00:00:51.635 --> 00:00:55.865
around like that

00:00:55.865 --> 00:01:01.035
and let's curve out this side.

00:01:01.035 --> 00:01:04.845
There's gonna be another bigger petal,

00:01:04.845 --> 00:01:06.545
just like that!

00:01:06.545 --> 00:01:09.445
Let's add one more.

00:01:09.445 --> 00:01:12.865
After you're done drawing this pretty rose, you can draw the other things on my

00:01:12.865 --> 00:01:14.835
Fun2draw channel, like my

00:01:14.835 --> 00:01:18.855
"5 ways to Draw a Rose" or my Fun2draw "Flower Heart" for Mom.

00:01:18.855 --> 00:01:24.605
Now you can finish up the rose by adding a slender stem.

00:01:24.605 --> 00:01:27.255
I'm drawing a nice leaf,

00:01:27.255 --> 00:01:30.025
right there.

00:01:30.025 --> 00:01:32.515
