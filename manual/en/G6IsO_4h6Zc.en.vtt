00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.990
Today we're actually going to be talking about
the different kinds of glazes that are available

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.650
and these are glazes you can pick up at an
art supply store or paint store.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:21.490
They're really divided into two kinds of glaze.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:29.220
You have water or acrylic based glazes, and
on the other side you have oil based or alkyd

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.600
based glazes.

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:39.399
Now, for the longest time we were using oil
glazes which are not very environment friendly.

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:44.930
But they do impart a beautiful sheen and they
are wonderful to work with.

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:51.780
However, not being very good for you from
a health point of view, it's much better to

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:58.979
use the acrylic or water-borne glazes which
are now becoming very, very durable and have

00:00:58.979 --> 00:01:04.390
been perfected so that they almost are as
good as oil glazes are.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:11.480
One of the things about the water based glazes
is that there are different sheens you can

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:13.090
buy.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:19.610
This is your generic glaze, but if you look
on the cans of glaze that you're buying you'll

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.800
find that some are satin sheen, some are matte
flat, and some are very glossy.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:34.380
So, be sure you know what kind of sheen you
want when you go out to buy your glaze.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:41.060
Now coming to incorporating things in the
glaze, aside from all the color options that

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.370
you have, but you can actually put glitter
into them.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:52.450
You can use metallic paints and put those
into a glaze, and that's a beautiful look.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:03.130
Also, you can use glass beads and incorporate
them into a glaze, and then, as I've done

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.980
here, use them through a stencil.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:17.620
That's a very small transfer in glass bead,
and this is a much larger bead used over a

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.810
metallic base coat.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.889
So, these are the many ways that one can use
glazes.
