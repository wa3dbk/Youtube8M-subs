00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.069
G'day and welcome back to Buildsum and today I want to show you a

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:10.360
Double Brick

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:11.740
construction

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:13.950
building with a timber floor so

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.529
As you can see we're starting starting out very similar to the other

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.320
Videos that have done on these

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.070
construction methods

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:30.719
however for the Observant among you you'll notice that this footing the strip footing here is a lot wider than

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:36.478
The other ones, and that's because instead of just sitting one skin of brickwork on it because

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:41.159
It's double brick construction I've now got to sit two skins of Brickwork on that footing

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:44.699
So that's a little bit wider to start with so that we can get both skins on it

00:00:47.049 --> 00:00:53.579
Of course our strip footing requires reinforcement and again for the observant you'll notice I've now got four

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:02.189
bars across here instead of three because of the extra width of the footing and again that could be just plain old bars or

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:05.009
It could be a four bar Trench mesh that's used

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.110
Again, it's spaced off the side of the trench to allow for your cover, and it's sitting on bar chairs

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.110
So it's not touching the bottom of the Trench

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.309
And once that's in place and inspected we can pour the concrete in there

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.449
again keeping it just below the ground line so I can cover it up later

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:28.829
and we can pour our blob footing just bulk concrete in there

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:36.959
Now the second or the big biggest change if you like is the dwarf wall is now two skins Brickwork

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.519
Still has our vents in it however the back skin

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.209
Don't need to put the physical vent in there can just leave that open

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.290
so the airflow can pass through and

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.489
You'll also notice that in the cavity the bottom half here

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.250
we've actually filled that in with Mortar and we've

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:05.099
sloped that off so that any water that does get into this area will run down here and

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.309
Out through the weep hole here

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.119
that way I

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:17.219
Still have an engaged pier on the back of the dwarf wall just holding up this

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.699
Skin of Brickwork. I'll show you in a minute how I connected to that one

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.239
and we have our engaged pier to take it up here as in joist as per normal

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:37.560
We have our damp-proof course this one's wide enough to cover both walls

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:46.919
also for our engaged pier and our isolated pier and we have Ant cap as well and again this one is wide enough to

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.289
cover both Walls

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.370
Of course our bearer

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.220
And our joists now this time

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.639
We don't need a double joist on the outside because the wall is not sitting on the floor

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:04.680
This is just taking the floor

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:11.220
so if you put a sheet or platform floor the wall is actually going to come up the inside, it'll be brick and

00:03:11.859 --> 00:03:15.119
We won't need the floor to carry any of our wall loads at all

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.939
On the outside we can start to bring our brickwork up and as I said

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.919
We're gonna tie the walls together with these things is

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:28.650
called Morse Ties

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.989
You can see there's a little divot a little bend in the middle so that any water wants to cross the cavity

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.510
It will get to that little divot and then drop off

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.619
And then I'll tie these two courses a brick work together

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:47.069
They can also be used to tie you engage pier back to your main wall as well

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.680
Quite often, so there are Morse Tie

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.899
and then we're going to continue the Brickwork up

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.529
So that's the first part of our

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.350
Double Brick construction timber floor building in the next video

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:12.059
I'll show you more about the wall, and how we tie the roof into it.
