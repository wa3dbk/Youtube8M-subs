POLISH EGG-BUTTER SAUCE

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:13.059
Any dish will have more vivid and rich taste due to the sauces.

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.299
There is a wide variety of sauces,

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.359
each is suited to a particular product.

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:25.279
Some are good with meat and fish, while others - with vegetables, pasta, cereals.

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:30.029
Properly selected sauce complements the taste of food.

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.130
Today I will prepare a Polish egg butter sauce.

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.880
I will need the following products for this recipe:

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.320
100 g butter, 2 hard-boiled eggs,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.500
a bunch of parsley (or of dill), lemon juice and salt to taste.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.660
Melt the butter over a low heat.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.440
The butter should just melt away.

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.280
We melt the butter evenly with a fork.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.380
I melted the butter.

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.380
Cut the eggs to a small cubes.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:49.470
Add the eggs to the butter.

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.020
The second egg.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.350
Finely chop the parsley.

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:26.889
Enough.

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:39.649
We shift it into a bowl.

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:50.979
Add the salt and the juice of half a lemon.

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:54.989
Salt to your taste.

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:59.979
Add the lemon juice.

00:02:59.979 --> 00:03:05.639
Mix.

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:10.379
This sauce is very caloric.

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:14.179
Therefore, it can be combined well with low-fat fish and vegetables.

00:03:14.179 --> 00:03:19.079
Cook with pleasure and enjoy!

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
