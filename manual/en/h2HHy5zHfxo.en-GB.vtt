Hi my name is Freishia and this is The Whack
Basically this is my compilation of some of

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:10.670
the coolest stories that I found on the internet.
Drop one of these in a social situation and

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.550
watch everyone in the room go 'Whoa dude,
where the hell did you hear that?'

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.180
You can tell them that you heard it right
here on the whack. With me Freishia.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.539
Suicide sex cults, and you know who is really
into that? Honey bees!

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:27.320
Like really? Who would have thought, right?
So the male honey bee, he's also known as

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:30.949
a drone.
And poor guy has only two purposes in life.

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.400
One is to make honey and the other is to mate
with the queen bee.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.840
And every time he mates with her and he puts
his schlong into her reproductive organ.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:47.650
The poor guy orgasms so fast and so hard that
his wiener actually falls off and he's left

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.649
there to die.
So every time our madam queen bee goes on

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:56.230
one of her nuptial nights she lands up leaving
this trail of dead bodies.

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:03.530
Talk about like a bad wedding night.
In India we have so many God, Goddesses, Deva

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.650
, Devis, Avatars, so many things that we worship.
I mean we even got temples which we have dedicated

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.000
to Rajnikanth and Amitabh Bachchan.
But this one temple really caught my attention

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.210
because over there in this village in Pali,
they are worshipping a 350cc Royal Enfield

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.170
bike.
Om Banna as this temple is popularly known

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.460
as, legend has it that Om Singh Rathore was
riding his bike one day, met with an accident,

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.829
died on the spot , they took his motorbike
to the police station.

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.110
Next day magically his bike shows up again
under the tree. So they're thinking somebody

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.490
is mucking around they empty the fuel tank,
they take it back to the police station and

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.470
they decide to chain it. Ha ha we will not
be fooled.

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.160
And walla again it shows up under the same
tree. That's when the villagers decided that

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.360
they should not muck around with
whatever supernatural forces going around

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:57.780
and they decided to build a temple around
this tree and this Royal Enfield bike. But

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.759
I am just thinking what do they offer at the
temple? Obviously not Sweets. One litre petrol?

00:02:04.759 --> 00:02:09.713
It's snowing in Saudi Arabia, who would have
thought right? Well that's one of the negative

00:02:09.713 --> 00:02:13.530
effects of global warming.
It's been snowing for the past three years

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.000
in the borders of Saudi Arabia. So alright,
it's snowing, what are you going to do.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.450
So the locals decided to make the most out
of it go out there, have a little bit of fun.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.050
Snow balls, snow men all those things that
you would do.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.280
And unfortunately a cleric has gone and passed
judgement and has said that if anyone is found

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.330
making a snowman they could find themselves
getting

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.239
into a lot of trouble. Shame.
So, my name is. Don't make fun of me. It's

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.200
Freishia Mehelli BomanBehram and every time
I have to write it on a form, I'm just like

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:51.150
'Oh my god'.
But there's this guy and he's gone and officially,

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:58.709
legally changed his name to Kim-Jong Sexy

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.690
So in the description below I have given all
the links to my sources.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:36.340
Credit has to be given where credit is due
and I don't want you to think that I'm full

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.570
of Bovine Feces.
My last story for today. It's not really a

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:38.570
story it's just like this bunch of really
cool thoughts.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:45.790
So here it goes. On earth curiosity drives
scientists, on mars, scientists drive curiosity.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:53.879
Thanks to the internet today boys have probably
seen more naked ladies than all their ancestors

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:57.850
combined.
I hope that you will like, comment and subscribe.

place.
