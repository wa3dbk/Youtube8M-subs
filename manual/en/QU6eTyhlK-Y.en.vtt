00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:07.509
On a snowy day in Kabul, Afghanistan, Afghan
National Army soldiers are getting to grips

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:13.230
with a new weapon: a 60mm mortar.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.279
“These new mortars are lightweight and we
can move them from one place to another quickly

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:19.279
during battle.

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:26.240
They also target larger distances than the
Russian mortars and they also have a trigger.”

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:30.949
This portable mortar is a welcome update to
the Afghan National Army’s arsenal, which

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:36.000
still has legacy weapons from the Soviet era,
such as these D-30 Howitzers, which soldiers

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.899
here in Herat train on.

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.829
Building on the existing assets and experience
of the Afghan National Army with new technologies

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.899
is key, according to members of NATO’s training
mission in Afghanistan.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.590
Leaders say a central part of making new technologies
sustainable - making training itself sustainable.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.719
“We focus very closely on training the Afghan
trainers.

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.519
So we don’t deliver a lot of the instruction
ourselves, what we do is teach the instructors

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:02.519
how to do it.”

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:07.270
Here, an Afghan officer trains younger soldiers
on a brand new armoured vehicle, donated by

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.430
the United States, before heading out to the
field for a live exercise.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.750
With an army that draws on a broad range of
backgrounds, ethnicities and regions, there

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.460
can be challenges, such as differing levels
of education.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.580
“The majority of the drivers are illiterate
but still they drive very well.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.500
But the commander and the gunner are educated
soldiers, like lieutenants.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.210
They also learn a lot during the training.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.860
In the end they will all use the vehicles
properly.”

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.970
Across the board, the Afghan army officers
we spoke to said their troops were ready to

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.070
fight the insurgency with the weapons they
currently have.

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.030
But many worried about the future, where more
sophisticated weapons might be needed to protect

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.030
their borders.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.590
“The Afghans’ appetite for more sophisticated
weapons is entirely understandable, and there

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.720
it’s entirely appropriate that they and
we are beginning to think about more sophisticated

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.890
equipment for them in the future.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:08.110
But this piece of equipment is for now, this
is for them finally to bring about victory

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.269
on the battlefield against an insurgency and
it’s going to do that for them.

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.340
“
Keeping a balance between current and future

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.480
needs, as well as making sure the Afghan army
is able to sustain their weaponry is no small

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.590
hurdle.

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.489
This year will see a test of that, as Afghan
National Security Forces step forward to take

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.790
lead responsibility for almost the entire
country.
