00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
this is stuff you like you can call me
Ursa and Natasha is the member of the

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:10.110
Avengers who gets things done. Oh Natasha
or Natalie or Black Widow, your first two

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.610
names are apparently the same name
because Russian, but regardless. Our first

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.619
introduction to Natasha is when she's
undercover is Natalie Rushman. Rushman

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:26.369
Russian I just got that, and Tony is... well
it's Iron Man 2

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.750
Tony's dying and he's losing his marbles
and he's really just not very stable at

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.070
the moment, so shield sent Nat in to keep
an eye on him. Mostly she gets along fine

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.510
by employing the cunning combination of
1. being really hot "she is from legal

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.120
and she is potentially a very expensive
sexual harassment lawsuit if you keep ogling her

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.710
like that" 2. being really smart
"very very impressive individual she's fluent in

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.399
French Italian Russian Latin who speaks
Latin?"

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.390
and 3. being hilariously competent at
beating up grown men "rule number one

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.519
never take your eye off your" [Thump] "oh my GOD!" In the
Avengers as I said Natasha is the one

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:09.570
who gets things done,
she is one of the main drivers of the

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.040
plot and her character development is
almost incidental. of course the fact

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.119
that Natasha now gets to have a character beyond hot and competent is a good thing too.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.670
Coulson calls her, she digs up Bruce,
she introduces Bruce to Steve, she

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.320
outsmarts a god and we'll come back to that,
she gets Clint back, she keeps it

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.130
together when Bruce Hulks out, she gets
to the portal, she works out how to close

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.299
it, she saves the world. Obviously not
single-handedly because this is, you know,

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.920
an ensemble movie, but she contributes a
lot to the resolution of the plot which

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.549
in the film landscape containing more
than a few boring perfect female

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.860
characters who contribute nothing... it's
always gonna make me happy. she's not

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.200
boring or perfect or disposable she is
ridiculously competent and she does have

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.409
some serious issues "I have a very
specific skillset.

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:05.829
I didn't care who I used it for" Her
thing is outsmarting people, outthinking

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:11.110
them. Her damage seems to be that quite
often she lets them beat up on her to do

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:16.510
it. Like Captain America she's more than
willing to take the hits... almost too

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.280
willing actually. She's chosen this is
her pathway to redemption as her penance

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:25.629
She won't go in for self-flagellation
but there are so many people willing to

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.670
do it for her. And she will let them in
order to get what she wants. And what she

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.930
wants is to save the world, and she will
do it using every trick and skill at her

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:49.720
disposal "so Banner, that's your play" "what?"
she and Bruce have that in common

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.340
they use their weakness as strength when
Banner gets angry he loses control,

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.629
instead of fighting it he's learned to
make it into a strength

00:02:57.629 --> 00:03:02.859
people underestimate Natasha
consistently because she's only human or

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:08.769
because she's only a woman and she uses
that as a strength. how else do you trick

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:12.250
the trickster god even if you know he's
not exactly at the top of his game at

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.099
the moment. You sly dog you got him
monologuing! Avengers Natasha is vastly

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.609
more interesting than Iron Man 2
Natasha for three reasons first of all

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:26.980
because Iron Man 2 is about Tony not
about Natasha, second because the

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:31.540
Avengers is just a better movie than
Iron Man 2, and third because Natalie

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.579
Rushman isn't Natasha. The only thing we
really learned about agent Romanoff in

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:42.069
Iron Man 2 is that she's very good at
undercover work and that not sleeping

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:46.739
with Tony. Oh, and at this

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:53.640
Girl has mad skills. And lack of
character development aside I was

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.560
totally smitten with Black Widow in Iron
Man 2 because first of all she was

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.080
competent
second of all she wore clothes that I

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:06.780
for the most part could imagine wearing
third of all she was ginger and best of

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.250
all four didn't fall for Tony Stark "you
were gonna tell me you really were

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.830
dying? you didn't tell me?" "I was gonna
make you an omelet and tell you" "hey save

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:20.489
it for the honeymoon you got incoming"
I mean Natalie Rushman flirts with him

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:23.790
in an offhand kind of way but she's an
illusory threat to Pepper and Tony's

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:26.720
relationship but we talked about that
already

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:32.820
Avengers Natasha gets much more time as
herself, with hair that makes sense

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.840
seriously I love her hair but who takes
their hair down before an epic battle?

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.020
Nobody, nobody does that. Okay except for Emma Frost, Emma Frost is a special case.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.710
and Black widow's a valuable team member
like Hawkeye in spite of the fact that

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.500
neither of them really have any special
powers or fancy suits. She's my favorite

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.650
because she's as broken and scarred as
the rest of them and because that will

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.450
never prevent her from doing what needs
to be done. "you know what it's  like to be

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:08.880
unmade" "you know that I do" and isn't
that the definition of a hero? next time

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.650
we're talking about the star-spangled
man himself see you soon guys! "it was

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:17.260
quite the buzz around here finding you
in the ice

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.509
thought Coulson was gonna swoon.
Did he ask you to sign his Captain

00:05:21.509 --> 00:05:28.189
America trading cards yet?" "trading cards?"
"they're vintage, he's very proud"
