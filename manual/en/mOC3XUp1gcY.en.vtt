00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:08.290
Remember that you have to have an individual
reference to each article in our textbook.

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:14.700
You can't just refer to the whole book, if
you're talking, for example, about, say, Anthony

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.110
Appiah's piece on racisms.

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:23.000
That means you have to create an individual
reference in your Zotero library for each

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.600
individual article from the textbook that
you want to refer to.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:38.260
The easiest way to do this is to go to Amazon.com
or WorldCat or Google Books and add a reference

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:44.630
to the whole book to your Zotero library and
then turn that reference into a reference

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:48.340
to the individual item, the individual article.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:54.850
So you can see here I've already gone to Amazon.com
and looked up our textbook.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.980
So now I'm going to use the little icon in
the address bar to save a reference to the

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.750
whole textbook to my Zotero library.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:11.130
Now I'm going to turn that reference to the
whole textbook into a reference to the individual

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.270
article.

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:19.850
To do that, you begin by changing the item
type from "book" to "book section."

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:24.340
It's going to ask you if you sure you want
to do this; just click OK.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.510
Now you add the title of the article—the
individual article—in this case I'm going

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.420
to use Appiah's piece "Racisms."

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.530
Then you have to add Appiah as the author.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:48.240
So you can see I already have Kwame Anthony
Appiah in my Zotero library, so I'll add his

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.690
last name and his first name.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:02:00.759
Now I want to move him up as the sole author
of the article, so he will be listed first,

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:10.509
and then you change all the authors of the
book to editors, because that's what they

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:18.200
now are—they are the editors of the book.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.900
Notice that Amazon.com doesn't include the
place of publication, so I'm going to add

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.930
that by hand.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:33.129
Finally, you have to add the pages within
the book that the article appears on—in

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:45.609
the case Appiah's article, it's pages 393
to for 403, so I'm going to add those by hand.

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.140
Okay, so that's it.

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:57.319
You can see now that I have in my Zotero library
a reference to Appiah's specific article in

00:02:57.319 --> 00:02:58.829
the textbook.

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:12.889
So now when I have a Word document and I want
to add a reference, citation, to Appiah's

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:21.749
piece—I'm going to pick Chicago Manual of
Style author-date—Appiah . . . I actually

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:30.620
have quite a few things from Appiah but I
will pick the one from our textbook . . . and

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:31.620
there it is.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.540
And when I add the bibliography, you to see
that the bibliography will now appear as a

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.699
reference specifically to Appiah's piece.

00:03:44.699 --> 00:03:45.369
And there we go.
