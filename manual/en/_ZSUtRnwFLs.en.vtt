00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:05.180
00:01
KEITH: I love attention, I like being different

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.870
and I want to show that being different is
okay.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:11.910
00:10
COMM: Keith Gordon appeared to be your average

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:12.910
family man.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.550
But in the last five years, the 58-year-old
has undergone a radical transformation.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:20.689
Covering his entire head and most of his body
in tattoos.

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.880
00:21
KEITH: I'm very obsessional, once I get started

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.820
on something I just get carried away and just
get obsessed with it.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.210
00:27
COMM: But not everyone is happy with his radical

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.210
look.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.681
00:30
LISA: When I am going out with him like that

00:00:32.681 --> 00:00:34.610
I feel embarrassed.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:39.500
00:37
COMM: The father of four suffers from obsessive

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.750
compulsive disorder, a condition that Keith
believes led him to change his appearance

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.230
radically throughout his life.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.479
00:45
KEITH: OCD has ruled my life for many, many

00:00:48.479 --> 00:00:51.540
years, I'm afraid that's the power of it.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.540
I did have tattoos originally when I was 17
but I had then taken off, and I kind of changed

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:02.040
my image all the way through the years and
now really later on in life I realise that

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:04.580
I should have stuck to my beliefs and been
true to myself.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.620
01:04
COMM: At the age of 45 Keith decided to settle

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.170
down, getting married to his wife Lisa, and
having three children together.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.600
But it wasn't long before the office worker
returned to his first love.

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:15.600
Tattoos.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.010
01:16
KEITH: And since starting with this current

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:23.420
project of getting tattoos five and a half
years ago, I've been going just about every

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.830
month or so, I'd say hours and hours I couldn't
put a figure on it.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.060
It was very, very, very painful.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.980
Certain parts of my head and face just was
like extreme pain.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.280
Y'know the corner of the eyes, anywhere around
the eyes.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:43.190
The lip and also some parts of the ear, specially
inner ear was an absolute killer.

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:46.140
01:44
COMM: Keith who works as an office administrator,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.990
has spent almost fifteen thousand pounds on
his body art, and it's causing tension between

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.240
the family.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:57.490
01:52
LISA: I feel embarrassed, I know he's my husband.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:04.479
I just persevere but really, inside me I feel
embarrassed going out with him like that.

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.644
02:06
RICKY: Everyone else likes it but I don't,

00:02:07.644 --> 00:02:10.120
and he looks a bit evil.

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:12.570
02:10
RICKY: Some people think he's a bit scary

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:14.300
but he's just a regular dad.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.250
02:15
COMM: But Keith says he's never felt or looked

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.340
better.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:19.540
Despite what others might say.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.890
02:21
KEITH: Generally speaking, younger people

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.620
of a certain type tend to really really like
the way I look and I get a lot of really positive

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.050
reactions from it "Hey man, that's really
sick, that's really cool."

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.730
But obviously with the other end of the spectrum,
older ones are not so favourable.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.950
02:36
PETER: Why would you wanna make yourself look

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.720
like a tortoise is what I think.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.680
It reminds me of a tortoise coming out like
that.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.620
02:44
COMM: Thanks to his new look, Keith is now

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:50.730
looking to audition for TV roles where his
hard man appearance may be in demand.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.980
02:51
COMM: And despite his families objections,

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.180
he's pushing ahead with his plans to tattoo
even more of his body.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.959
02:56
KEITH: I've just gone back full circle and

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:09.980
fought my demons, and now I am what I feel
like I always should have been.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:20.890
Me, like this.
