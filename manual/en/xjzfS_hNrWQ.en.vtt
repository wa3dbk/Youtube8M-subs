00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:12.400
&gt;&gt; It's an awesome race. I really like it a lot.
I'm looking forward to coming back

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:13.800
again next year.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.500
[music]

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.000
it's awesome.

00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:27.600

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.700
Well today was a really great race the

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.000
weather was beautiful couldn't

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
 have asked for anything better

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.900
And I came back I missed last year because

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.500
 we were training for the Beijing Para Olympic

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.500
Games and we were just really busy and so I

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.000
really happy to come back this year and to

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
have to win again.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:52.060

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:53.700
This is my second time up here for the

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.300
 Kessler Foundation 10K.  I traveled up here

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.000
 with the team from Atlanta, Georgia.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.350
The Shepherd Spinal Center and we really

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:01.800
 appreciate the hospitality up here.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:02.900
It was a great race and 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:04.000
I look forward to it again next year.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.680
[music]

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:06.800
&gt;&gt; Ah it was awesome. 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:11.300
The pack of chairs went out really
fast together which was nice. Have

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.869
a nice competitive feel. Then we kind of
broke loose at around 2 miles or so but it was a

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:19.399
great race, good conditions today.
It was just an excellent race.

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:26.500
[music]

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.900
It was a good race. I'm pretty happy with
my time although I would have liked to

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.389
 have been a little faster.

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:46.799
[music]

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.700
Proud to be a part of a race with the
Kessler Center. It's an awesome race

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.100
awesome experience and it heightens
the awareness that this too can 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.470
be cool in a wheelchair.
