00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:13.679
I am going to sew the big pieces first. I
take my pins out before I get to them and

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:22.570
don't sew across the pins because that can
ruin your machine. I normally chain stitch

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:33.620
these but since I am working with this one
big piece. I will cut it and sew the other

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:44.040
side. Keeping both the edges together on each
end. Sometimes I sew without a pin in it.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.500
I pin mainly to keep me from sewing the wrong
sides together. If you sew the wrong sides

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.250
together you are going to have to rip out.
I do have a seam ripper in my pocket because

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:06.240
I still have to rip. Now then, I am going
to sew this and I can chain stitch this all.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:14.850
Before I get to my pin, I will take it out
and stitch right along. Now when I get to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:21.570
here, my pressure foot, yea my pressure foot,
tries to push this the wrong way. I want to

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.170
lift this up and make sure that the fabric
is under that pressure foot because I pressed

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:35.710
it that way and I want it to lay that way.
So, I will get the next piece. Take my pin

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.750
out. If you need to keep your pin it, keep
it in by all means. I have been doing this

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.500
a little while so sometimes I don't have a
pin in. Now this time the fabric was laying

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.010
the right way and the pressure foot didn't
push it. So, I didn't have to worry about

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:00.810
that. Sometimes you have a piece on the bottom
that you have to watch too to make sure that

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:06.960
it lays the right way. Now I am clipping this
loose and going to stitch this edge.
