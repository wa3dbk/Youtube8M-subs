Dear Fans and Followers,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.040
The New Year could not have started any better for Opel. 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:22.520
In January we managed to increase our sales in Germany by nine percent.

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.480
The key to this success is our product offensive. 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.040
Proof lies in the latest order figures: 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.820
130,000 for the ADAM family and 110,000 for the new Corsa.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.780
And we have already launched the next stage in our model offensive.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:46.440
The ADAM S and the Corsa OPC demonstrate that we build great cars.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.640
The awards we have received recently also fuel our optimism. 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.360
Since the start of the year, we have claimed pole position at 18 award ceremonies. 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.920
Some of them you can see here.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.240
We are leading the way in the connectivity sector. 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:08.980
As you know, in future every Opel will  become a powerful mobile hotspot with Opel OnStar. 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:15.640
We received the Connected Car Award from Autobild at the Detroit Motor Show for this.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.380
The Opel ADAM is also racing from one win to the next.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:25.420
Our ADAM won the Readers’ Choice Award „The Best Cars” of trade magazine auto motor und sport

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.800
with over 112,000 votes in the mini car segment.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.140
In addition two Opel models took number one spots as value champions. 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:46.020
The Opel ADAM won the Wertmeister 2015 award in the small car category and the Opel Zafira won the compact van category.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:53.500
Our advertising campaign Umparken im Kopf won the Grand Prix from Econ Forum’s Year of Advertising 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.780
for the best campaign of the year. 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.460
And I am especially happy that our new Corsa is on its way to become a bestseller once again.

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:10.340
The new Corsa, for example, was named Most Sensible Car 2015 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.300
by the consumer magazine Guter Rat and lifestyle magazine SUPERillu.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.420
The Corsa has also secured pole position in other European countries.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.900
In Romania and Serbia, it won the prestigious Car of the Year Award. 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.240
In Spain, the Corsa took the Car of the Year in TV award.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:34.120
In Denmark, our popular all-rounder was named Best Car in Class.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.760
And on February 19 I can look forward to a real highlight.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.240
The AutoBest award ceremony in Zagreb. 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:49.600
I will receive the Best Buy Car of Europe 2015 award for our new Corsa.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:57.480
This award makes me especially proud because the jury, made up of experts from 15 central and eastern European countries, 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:01.680
confirmed that we have the best small car on the market. 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.100
Only cars with outstanding characteristics combined with value for money can win this award. 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.940
The award is very prestigious in a market that includes around 300 million people. 

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.840
All of this will give our sales even more impetus.

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:26.280
As you can see, Opel is successful and has made an excellent start to the New Year. 

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:32.240
And I can promise you that I will have more exciting news for you in my upcoming Videocasts. 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:36.080
See you soon, your Karl-Thomas Neumann.
