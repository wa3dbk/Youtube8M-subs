00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.320
Hi. In this video and want to show you step by step how you can teach your dog »Shame on you!«

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:12.220
This is a »no dog needs it but is very cute«-trick.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.280
 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.020
To teach your dog that trick you need a tool.

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.680
There are many tools you could use. For example: thread, post-its, tape, hair tie.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:31.840
It needs to be something that sticks on your dogs nose even if he moves his head.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.400
The easiest, cheapest and adjustable for every dog's snout tool is woollen thread.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:45.060
Measure your dog's snout, add some inches und make a knot.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.560
So that you get a loop.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.800
I train the trick with my dog jimmy in this sequences the first time.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.400
Pull the loop over your dog's snout.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.440
Here you can see how impressed my dog is.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:14.440
He does not care!

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.160
I try to animate my dog by moving the loop. With no effect! ;)

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:34.300
During this video sequences the loop was getting wet.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.300
Surprisingly this had an effect.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:42.320
If your dog is as unimpressed as my dog Jimmy, then make your loop wet.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:50.000
In the beginning I reward Jimmy for every small movement of his paw towards his nose.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.840
And i remove the loop immediately after that.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.180
If Jimmy touches the bridge of his nose with his paw he gets a jackpot: a lot of treats.

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:41.760
As with every other trick: try it in different positions and locations.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.760
We try it now while sitting.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.880
Because it works so well after a short time of training, I introduce the command.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.960
I called it »Nase«. It's german for nose.

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.180
Reward your dog immediately.

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.800
With practice the command should be enough to bring your dog to show the trick.

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:44.640
Then you can remove the loop and just have to say your command.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.340
Have fun!
