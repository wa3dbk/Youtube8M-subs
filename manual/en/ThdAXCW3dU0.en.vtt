00:00:04.354 --> 00:00:06.037
I'm building a little house for our kitties

00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:11.530
and, I'm putting it together

00:00:13.607 --> 00:00:15.748
as I record this. 

00:00:18.197 --> 00:00:20.197
Let me show you. 

00:00:20.968 --> 00:00:25.565
I've taken this out... I don't know how to say it, but... 

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:27.686
I'm doing a dovetail joint

00:00:29.187 --> 00:00:36.694
so I've taken this portion out, and I'm putting this here, 
 and I'm fine-fitting it to make sure it's level

00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:45.116
because this is going to be the floor, and I'm going 
 to put long pieces of wood (lats) here. 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.719
between the beams. 

00:00:49.133 --> 00:00:54.335
I need to make sure the floor is even, so I need to adjust 
 it a little more, you see there's a bit of difference there

00:00:55.576 --> 00:00:57.284
maybe 1 or 2 mm. 

00:00:58.816 --> 00:01:02.243
So this is the back wall here

00:01:03.832 --> 00:01:09.317
It's going to sit on legs, so it's going to have a little terrace

00:01:11.216 --> 00:01:13.216
at the end. 

00:01:14.952 --> 00:01:16.952
It should be pretty nice for them. 

00:01:16.936 --> 00:01:18.705
So that's going to be the back, and this is the front. 

00:01:19.573 --> 00:01:21.573
It's going to be sloped

00:01:21.781 --> 00:01:23.781
so you see, this is bigger than the other one

00:01:24.126 --> 00:01:26.610
The roof is going to come, sort of like this

00:01:27.352 --> 00:01:29.352
from the back to the front

00:01:30.337 --> 00:01:32.337
so the water can flown down it. 

00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:35.451
That's what I'm doing now. 

00:01:35.927 --> 00:01:41.080
So the two sides are put together, and now I'm 
 working on the beams that connect them. 

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:42.930
And so I have to dovetail those together

00:01:45.269 --> 00:01:47.270
to get a nice, even floor. 

00:01:48.905 --> 00:01:50.900
And... there's one of the kitties right now. 

00:01:52.942 --> 00:01:54.940
Hello, Mitzi! 

00:01:55.589 --> 00:01:57.590
How do you do? 

00:01:58.724 --> 00:02:00.720
She's a girl. 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.710
A beautiful little girl. 

00:02:06.967 --> 00:02:08.970
[Romanian] How do you do, you beautiful little thing? 

00:02:20.063 --> 00:02:24.040
So this is one of the two sisters that I'm building this for. 

00:02:30.505 --> 00:02:32.500
There's the other one. 

00:02:40.682 --> 00:02:42.680
She's sleepy, she just had something to eat. 

00:02:45.628 --> 00:02:47.630
sleepy... 

00:02:47.277 --> 00:02:49.280
sleepy

00:02:56.123 --> 00:03:01.970
Funny thing is, she used to be bigger than her 
 sister when she was young, also more daring

00:03:02.973 --> 00:03:05.300
but now it's her sister that's more daring, and bigger. 

00:03:07.068 --> 00:03:12.360
And also, when they were kittens, when we got them, they were about 2-3 
 weeks old, she was the bigger one, the more daring one. &nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:19.480
Now she's more quiet, and she's thinner, and she also had some 
 problems when we were afraid she was going to die. 

00:03:20.133 --> 00:03:28.190
but she's okay now. We put her on vitamin treatments, 
 hydration, serious stuff... but she's okay now. 

00:03:30.187 --> 00:03:31.190
but she's sleepy... 

00:03:31.557 --> 00:03:32.560
Aren't you, little baby? 

00:03:33.275 --> 00:03:35.280
Aren't you sleepy? 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.620
Yes, you are.
