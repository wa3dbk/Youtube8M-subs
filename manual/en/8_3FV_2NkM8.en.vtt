Hi, I'm Natalja from the Red Brick Cafe, and
on behalf of Expert Village, we're going to

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.900
learn how to make properly make popular, gourmet
coffeehouse drinks. So now we're going to

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.630
learn how to make tea-based lattes through
the espresso machine. The first thing we need

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.230
to make note of is that our portafilter needs
to be really clean because the residue of

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:27.690
the espresso is going to taint our tea based
drink, so make sure that it's clean. I have

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:35.120
here a pot of perfect tea scoop, I'm going
to put half of Early Grey, usually its best

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.360
to use black tea because they kind of taste
the strongest, and the drink we're making

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:48.440
is actually called London Fog, so it's half
organic Earl Grey, then we have half vanilla

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.110
black bean. Now the next thing to do is to
actually tamp it, and that's just to break

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.440
up the leaves, and that way when the water
goes through it it's actually going to make

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:11.100
the flavor more potent. Just break the leaves
a little bit, then put it in the machine like

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:18.180
that, and what's really important also is
that we need to fill up the tea up to half

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:25.260
the cup otherwise it's not going to be as
potent. I'm just going to press on manual,

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:35.139
because then I can stop it when I want to.
So we're just going to let it run, and about

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:45.409
halfway through I turn it off. Okay, next
thing I'm going to do is to steam my milk.

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.219
And because this is a latte, you don't make
it too foamy but you want it really liquidy.

00:01:52.219 --> 00:02:19.370
The moment it starts being unbearable to hold
it under with your hand, that's when you stop.

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:43.360
Make sure you clean your wand well. Then we
pour it into the middle, there you go. That's

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.159
a tea based latte, or in this case, a London
Fog.
