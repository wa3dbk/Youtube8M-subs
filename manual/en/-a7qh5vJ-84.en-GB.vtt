00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.451
Hey guys, welcome to MinnieMollyReviews so
today i'm reviewing the awesome line by Zoella

00:00:05.451 --> 00:00:11.081
so it's 'Zoella Beauty' and i'm not doing
the whole line, i'm just doing the fragrance

00:00:11.081 --> 00:00:18.370
and the candle today, these are 2 of my favourite
products from the actual line. So, this is

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:27.221
the fragrance 'Blissful Mistful' 'mist-ful'
if i can say it! So it's a 'body mist' so

00:00:27.221 --> 00:00:34.170
it isn't a perfume, well it is but sort of
isn't! So it's sort of like a body spray/perfume

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.739
sort of thing! But i really like it and i'm
just going to spray it on because i'm going

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:43.399
out afterwards, it's a great fragrance and
i really love the smell of this fragrance

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:51.039
because it's quite simple, it's not too overpowering
at all, it's really floral and actually, Zoella

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:55.949
hasn't released the actual notes of the fragrance
with you but she did say there's a lot of

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.870
florals in there and you can definitely smell
that in here! When you first spray this, you

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.059
obviously don't know what the notes are but
i would definitely say there's a fruit in

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:11.180
there somewhere like in the top notes, i was
thinking it was sort of an apple note. It

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.421
is really fresh and fruity and floral and
i really do like this fragrance, i think it's

00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:21.729
so nice just to wear everyday! The actual
design of it; So it's red chrome which is

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:27.039
the lid and the spray, i think it's a really
nice colour, it's sort of like a pinky-red

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:35.859
and it obviously says 'Zoella BLISSFUL MISTFUL'
and saying that it's a ... ooh, i didn't realise

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:42.350
that it's actually, the actual fragrance itself
is coloured, i didn't realise that, i thought

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.270
it was the bottle! Then on the back it has
her signature polka dots, so there you look

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.499
through and you can see that as the design,
it's sort of like a 3D design with 'Zoella'

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:56.479
standing out, so i think it is really cute
and it is a really simple design and i think

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.189
that does reflect on the fragrance itself
and Zoella! I think it is just a really pretty

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:08.780
design. So the candle has the same design,
so it's got the polka dots in the background

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.310
and it says 'Zoella beauty' and 'Lets Glow'
is what it's called - the fragranced candle.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:18.940
So, she's put on the side of it "Create your
own relaxing space and surround yourself with

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.580
fragrance for a much needed wind down, this
cute and calming candle will help free your

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.690
mind with it's gentle blend of white wood
accents, sweet vanilla and soft floral notes"

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.230
and you can smell them all in this candle,
and i love this candle! Look, you can tell,

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.840
i've only had it a couple of days and i've
used it so much! Because what i normally do,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.420
like in the morning when i'm getting ready
and putting on my makeup, doing my hair, i'm

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.630
just getting ready and i'm sat at my mirror
and i always have a candle to the side of

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:53.370
me, it used to be one that i got for christmas
but i've used that so much now and then when

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.200
i got this i thought 'Great, now i've got
another candle!' and i absolutely love it,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.680
it's just... i light this every day and i
light it every morning and every night when

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.910
i'm sat at my desk! I really love this candle,
i think it's really nice, it smells so nice!

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:14.390
I think in scents, they are quite similar,
they're both quite simple fresh scents, which

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:20.190
are my favourite type of scents, to me, i
actually think my favourite is the candle,

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:24.190
i think definitely scent-wise, i think it's
just a really, like it said, it's a really

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:29.880
calming scent, it's really fresh and it's
really warm! I know it's weird saying a candle

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:36.120
is warm but the actual scent of it is warm
so it is calming like Zoella said! And when

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.950
i watch her videos, and i know she does a
lot of tips with that because of anxiety and

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.470
things like that and i think it is so 'Zoella'
this line, i don't know how to explain that

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:51.530
but it really is! And i absolutely love the
candle, it's my favourite and i love the spray

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.560
as well! I think with this one, i'm going
to be wearing it for a really long time! When

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.690
i can anyway, but it is a really nice fragrance!
And a really nice candle! I don't know how

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.510
to express this enough! So this is such a
total pampering set really and i think it's

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.470
great like when SprinkleOfGlitter did that
video - that was like a really cool advert

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:16.850
where she was getting out of the bath and
she had all of the bath bombs and she lit

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.770
the candle and sprayed on the fragrance, i
think that was a great way to promote the

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:29.160
whole set! But it is just a brilliant line,
it's quite unusual really for a YouTuber to

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:34.670
come out with a line like this, and i think
it's gonna be so popular because Zoella is

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:42.520
so popular on YouTube, but it's like ages
ago Trisha Paytas came out with one, Bethany

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:47.890
Mota and then back in the day VenetianPrincess
came out with a fragrance called 'Tiara' and

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.900
i think she had like 100 bottles made and
did a competition for people to win them!

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:59.520
So it is quite unusual and i think it's going
to be such a popular line, i know all my friends

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:05.221
watch Zoella like I do, she's my favourite
YouTuber definitely, so i know they're all

00:05:05.221 --> 00:05:11.300
going out and getting the fragrance, getting
the bag i really want with the guinea pig

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.080
on it! Cause i actually went into town the
other day, walked into super drug and it was

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:18.520
all there, straight at the front of the shop
as well, it was just all out with all the

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:26.220
'Zoella Beauty' stuff. So! Overall i think
this is a brilliant set to get and my favourites

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.820
are definitely the body mist and and the candle
is definitely just my absolute favourite!

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:35.160
