Hey guys, welcome back, I'm your spokesperson
Joel Rush, here at 3D Printlife. And I know

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.270
we've done some crazy things like dance poolside.
We've been the first ones to go out and hit

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.270
3D printed golf balls at the local driving
range. We've even shown you how 3D printing

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:30.410
works using Easy Cheese. But today is very
very special. I'm with 11-year-old Madison

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.960
Menendez. Madison, how are you? I'm good.
What's happening... sit on down and join me

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:40.460
here. Okay Madison, I just have some questions
for you. Have you ever heard of 3D printing?

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.829
I have not! And a lot of people haven't. But
basically, it allows you to take anything

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.000
from your imagination and actually print it
on your desktop and make it come to life.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000
So right now, I guess in your life, what's
the number one thing you love? This... Niall,

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.050
from One Direction, right? Thank you for getting
it right. So listen, this is normal, I guess

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:11.210
Niall is a huge hit and One Direction is a
huge band. So Maddy, if I told you, you could

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.290
print anything in this world, I'm assuming
if he's your favorite, would you like to print

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.590
an actual statue of Niall? First time for
everything! There certainly is. We had Afinia,

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.610
our manufacturing partner, send us a new H-Series
printer. So how would you feel if I let you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:33.610
unbox it, set it all up, and print Niall for
everybody at home to see? Um, that'd actually

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.460
be kinda cool. Let's go ahead and do it, do
you want to go ahead and get started? Sure.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:44.869
Here we go. Okay Madison, so we just have
the brand new H-Series Afinia 3D printer.

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:50.140
I'm going to help you unbox it, just because
of the weight of it. And you can show everybody

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.020
at home how to connect the wires and you'll
take it from there. Okay. Here we go. There's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:02:01.020
your CD. That will add everything to your
laptop. Afinia always sends a free spool of

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:11.710
filament with every printer they ship out.
This will let you take any idea in your mind

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:30.459
and make it come to life. You Madison are
all set up to take it from here, okay? Okay.

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:57.419
Hey Joel, I think it's done. Perfect. Alright.
Good deal. So how long did it you to put everything

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:59.159
together? About 45 minutes. That's not bad.
Everything is connected right. So let's do

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:02.629
our first print. Do you want to go ahead and
take the driver's seat? As long as it actually

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:09.629
doesn't involve driving. I do not have a license.
Where do I find this thing? Okay, so just

00:03:10.879 --> 00:03:14.419
go to file like you would on a normal document.
Go to open. And then click that? Yes, there's

00:03:14.419 --> 00:03:21.419
the Niall file there. Why is he on his back?
Good observation. Just hit X plus and that

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.010
will stand him up. How do I get him to face
forward? Just go to Z plus and Z axis will

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:42.699
turn him from profile to facing forward. Now
that that's done, how do I actually get him

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:49.699
on that? There's that big button that says
Auto Placement. Click that. And now Niall

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:57.549
is all set. Just go up to 3D Print. And now
hit the magical button print. That's it. Alright.

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:10.629
Five minutes and this will fire up and we'll
have a Niall statue. The extruder tip is starting

00:04:12.339 --> 00:04:18.820
to heat up. It puts that plastic down on the
print bed. It will build a base for Niall

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:23.530
to sit all the other material on. Does it
feel good to you to take something from your

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:29.020
imagination and then put it on to a computer
screen and actually see it come to life? Yeah!

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.740
It's like really cool. I think you'll be pretty
happy. This will take us a couple of hours,

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:42.740
but then you're going to have a six inch exact
replica of Niall. Nice! Okay Maddy, so it's

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:54.009
down to the end. I took some support material
off, but here is your finished product. What

00:04:55.379 --> 00:05:01.560
do you think? Oh my God! This is freaky! What
the hay? Are you happy? I'm more than happy.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:08.560
What the heck? There you have it guys. So
easy an 11-year-old can do it. Until next

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:19.210
time, join us at www.3dprintlife.com where
we invite you to print things with us.
