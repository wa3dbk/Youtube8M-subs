\f0\fs26 \cf0 The next time you find yourself
answering nature's call in the Iowa Memorial

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.970
Union, you might see an unfamiliar sign. On
the third floor of the IMU lies the University

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.709
of Iowa's first gender-neutral bathroom, a
project spearheaded by Associate Director

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:21.460
of IMU Administration and Operations Patricia
Kruse. Gender-neutral would be that anyone

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:27.330
who identifies themselves as male, female,
or other would be welcome in that restroom.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.619
I had several groups that were booking events
here in the building that specifically asked

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.661
for a bathroom to be labeled as "gender neutral."
Anyone who is seeking out a gender-neutral

00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:44.030
restroom is...is able to find that without
assistance, without having to call themselves

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.420
out as being different.\'a0\
Though the change was implemented only a few

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.921
months ago, Kruse has already received feedback.
They've been very positive; people are, are

00:00:51.921 --> 00:00:58.350
happy to see that the University campus is
willing to label a restroom as "gender-neutral"

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.469
and make the environment as welcoming as possible
to all individuals, which is our goal. I mean

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:08.970
we can't judge people by their, I mean, they're
straight, or like, homosexual, or I mean,

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.791
everyone's have the same rights for equal
to use the bathroom, and I think that's a

00:01:13.791 --> 00:01:18.640
brilliant idea.\'a0Other projects are in development
so the University's welcoming vibe can continue

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:25.830
to grow. One that I know of is on the admissions
form, instead of checking just a "male" or

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.501
"female" box, there is the ability to check
"other." Which is new and I think that is

00:01:30.501 --> 00:01:36.340
maybe forward for a university. I think we're
one of the first to have that as an option.\

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:41.130
And for companies or other universities considering
designating gender-neutral bathrooms? I'd

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:47.950
say that you never really know what a person
identifies as. It's an important thing that

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.790
a person feel welcome in whatever environment
that they are, especially in an environment

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.060
where they work, where they're being educated,
they spend a lot of their day. Regardless

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.880
of how they identify with their sexuality,
their sex itself. And so we've seen that there

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.210
is a positive response to that.
