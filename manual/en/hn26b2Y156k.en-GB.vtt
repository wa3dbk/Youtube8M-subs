00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.630
The most important factor to getting better braking
is to remember that your front brake is by

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:08.160
far and away the most effective way to slow
down.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.830
Some people actually advocate using only the
front brake for effectiveness, and the theory

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:16.369
is sound – you get the most effective braking
just at the point at which your back wheel

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:19.919
starts to rise off the ground, when it can
offer no braking force of its own.

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:24.480
Now, that’s all well and good, but there’s
no reason not to use your back brake either.

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.349
For those moments when it is touching the
ground, it will help you slow down, particularly

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.270
when you first apply your brakes and you’re
gauging just how hard you can pull them on.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:36.450
You should almost always apply both brakes
together, although not necessarily with the

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.730
same force - the back brake requires much
less.

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.300
In order to use your front brake safely, you
need to adjust your weight distribution on

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.070
the bike to counter the forces of deceleration.
The harder you brake, the more important it

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.390
is to get your body in the correct position.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.870
When riding at speed I tend to ride on the
drops, and one of the main reasons is the

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.140
extra control we have in this position when
riding at higher speeds, and a lot of this

00:00:59.140 --> 00:00:59.930
is due to braking.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.509
Not only are your hands really secure in this
position, because your body weight is lowered

00:01:04.509 --> 00:01:08.649
you are able to cope much better with the
increased braking forces. The main issue with

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:12.350
braking hard is going over the handlebars,
but by straightening your arms and pushing

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.639
your backside behind the saddle you can counter
that force of deceleration.

00:01:16.639 --> 00:01:20.979
For gentle braking, it’s fine to hold onto
the hoods. Your body is in its most upright

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.560
position here, and you have the weakest grip
of the bars but for most situations in normal

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.200
riding, this is going to be absolutely fine,
and I spend most of my riding time in this

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.859
position.

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:34.020
One of the most important tips to help with
better braking is to develop the instinct

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.479
to release the levers if you feel either wheel
start to skid. Often a skid can happen so

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.340
suddenly that you don’t feel like you have
time to do anything about it, but in most

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.670
cases you do. Just as your car has anti-lock
brakes to improve braking, you can do the

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.560
same on your bike.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.350
You don’t have to release the brake entirely,
just enough that the wheel regains traction

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.609
if it slips.

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:59.490
This action can take a long time to master,
but it is really fundamental to taking your

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:03.700
riding ability to the next level. If you do
any mountain biking you have to get this dialled

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.639
even more quickly, and riding off road can
be a really good way of learning this skill

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:10.479
in a slightly safer environment.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.760
Generally with braking it’s really important
to practice the correct techniques so that

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.360
they become instinctive. When you need to
brake in an emergency, you act on instinct,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.860
so your conscious thought catches up later.
It’s what makes braking technique so important.

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.780
It can really help to work specifically on
it so don’t be afraid to practice these

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.420
skills and repeat them.

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.150
You can also help to dramatically improve
your braking by making a couple of inexpensive

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.520
but incredibly important changes to your bike.

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:39.510
If you’re that way inclined you can get
away with fudging quite a bit of bike maintenance,

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.290
but to brake effectively you need to have
effective brakes. How expensive they are is

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.910
not the issue, we’re talking about function,
and that means cables and pads.

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:53.510
Sticky, gritty cables at best ruin any feel
you get from the brake, and at their worst

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:58.070
are just dangerous. It’s not just power
that you lose, but also modulation. If you

00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.840
have to pull hard at the lever to get any
kind of response from the brake, you can’t

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:03.840
feel what the wheels are telling you.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:08.150
It might cost you the price of about 5 cups
of coffee, but replacing your brake cables

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.520
makes an incredible difference.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.280
The second mechanical advantage you can get
might not actually cost you anything. Make

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.540
sure your brake pads are well set up, so that
they strike the rim in the correct place and

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.670
at the correct time. I’m not a big believer
in expensive brake pads working better than

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.090
stock ones, just make the most of the ones
you have.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.870
Finally, where to brake is the last piece
of the puzzle in improving your braking. Now

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.010
of course most of the time you won’t feel
that you get to choose where to brake, but

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.820
small adjustments can make a big difference.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.040
Cornering is the biggest example. Braking
while cornering is something that should really

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.400
be avoided as it increases the forces on the
tyres and is one of the biggest causes of

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.100
crashes. Too much braking in a corner can
send either the front or the back ends out,

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:56.370
but usually the front. Try to get all your
deceleration done in advance of the corner.

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:00.510
Generally if you need to keep your speed in
check through corners it’s okay to do so,

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.460
but just scrub your brakes gently to moderate the
speed, don’t actually try and slow down.

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.040
It’s also worth being aware of the surface
underneath your tyres. Loose or broken roads

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.260
can dramatically reduce your braking ability,
so if you can, look to choose a smooth patch

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.750
of road on which to brake. Avoid drain covers,
white lines and especially gravel which can

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.270
collect in the middle and at the edges of
roads.
