00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.509
Now I am going to show you how to properly
assemble and maintain your saxophone daily.

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:11.810
First of all I'm going to start off with the
mouth piece. Now, again you need to clean

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:19.470
this mouth piece every time you get done playing
or whenever you think about it. Basically

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:26.070
we're going to remove our ligature and put
on the reed and take our reed, we'll need

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.730
to wet that first of course, just so ever
slightly put that on there and make sure it's

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:37.380
kind of lined up pretty good. Put your ligature
back on. You always want to make sure your

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.300
screws are to the back unless you have a Revenuer
ligature then of course your screws would

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:55.219
go to the front. I'll tighten down real good.
Then you want to check for suction. Make sure

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:01.200
that everything is tight. Next we're going
to go onto our main body and putting our neck

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:09.240
on. Basically when you put your neck on you
just want to drop it in. Make sure the neck

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:18.750
is lined up straight with the body for proper
working of the octave mechanism. Ok. When

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.220
we've got that straight we want to tighten
that down. That's how to assemble a saxophone;

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:32.939
pretty simple. Now I'm going to show you how
to go ahead and daily take care of it. I'm

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.170
going to take our lacquer cloth; every time
you get done playing just make it a religious

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:46.119
thing, so go ahead and wipe of the outside
of your instrument real good and especially

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.200
the keys. They are made of nickel. They will
cloud up and look; your nice pretty shiny

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:03.001
keys will look like clouds, so that is really
not necessarily a good thing. Ok. So next

00:02:03.001 --> 00:02:12.120
we want to take our swab here, hereâ€™s our
swab. Now, this should be done every time

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.620
you get done playing as well. Just for; help
to help keep your bore clean, keep moisture

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:26.120
away from the pads and keep everything in
line so you don't have to; it's really best

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:34.150
that you get your instrument maintained by
a profession once every year; just to make

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.340
sure everything that you're doing is correct
and everything on the instrument. Of course

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:49.160
we just want to go ahead and pull that through
and clean it out. That is how to assemble

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.920
and properly maintain your instrument daily.
