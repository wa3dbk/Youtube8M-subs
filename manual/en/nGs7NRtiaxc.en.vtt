00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:07.670
hello it's jang here with a look at
a lego speed champions set this is the

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.139
Porsche 918 Spyder comes with 151 pieces

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.750
this was another enjoyable and
satisfying deals with

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.100
some elements that are very similar to
what was done on

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.520
other cars from this series in some
elements that are

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.369
quite different I personally feel that
out of all the ones that they've done

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.830
for this first way for 2015

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.319
this is the most accurate looking this
is the most believable

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:36.929
as the actual car you know you look at
the

00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:40.460
pictures are the real car and then you
think I've what they could do

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.299
reasonably with Lego parts you come back
to you look at this and

00:00:44.299 --> 00:00:47.519
at least for me I think be the downright

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.249
if they've they've captured as much as
they possibly could

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:54.409
and it's recognizable there's nothing

00:00:54.409 --> 00:00:57.489
major here that I feel was amiss, or a

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.459
wrong decision there are a few sections
of this build

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:04.839
that are particularly good you've got
really

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.719
nice smoothing around the front they've
really done a great job to around that

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:09.329
often too

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:14.149
to blend that in the best they could I
also very much like what they've done on

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:16.020
the science here that's shaped up

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.469
quite nicely studs on the side
construction couple layers going on

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:20.780
there

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.549
and then really like what they've done
back here on the deck

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.039
above the engine with these in a row
cowlings that come back here

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:34.399
at it's just just nice you know they do
use a bunch of stickers with the set as

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.049
with the rest of the cars from this
series

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.090
and this one also uses a number these
new pieces for 2015 the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.159
two by six piece with the

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.069
to rounded corners on there that have

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:52.259
the radius of two studs their looks

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.939
good used to good effect the use those
on the front as well in gray and

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:59.450
in black nice little shaping underneath
here

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.530
about the best they could have done with
available parts but one sticker

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.560
down there in the center cup stickers
down below

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.890
I think this is well done kept those at
three

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.660
interesting looking wheel covers that
you can swap out also

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.690
with other other ones from this series
they also give you one

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.330
additional set with this set additional
set of

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.560
these wheel pieces so you can use the split

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.680
7 spoke wheels you can call them 14 spokes but they're really

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.730
split sevens this is the smaller

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.000
of the new windscreen pieces that to do
that they've introduced with this series

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.870
and I just left the top completely

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:41.090
open as is appropriate for the style a
vehicle

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.010
that some red elements in there to bring
in just some of the

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.240
the actual colors so that what are the
real interior

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:53.080
options think that's done pretty nicely
and you there are some spots they're

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.460
kinda

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.130
opened but yes figure that most that's
gonna get covered up when you put a

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:58.140
figure in there

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:02.410
speaking of figuring about the figures
here is that many figure included with

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:03.340
this set with them

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.070
break lime green color really really
contrast E

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:11.610
the main tour so pieces is great and
only is just a little bit of the green

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.170
up on that collar there look at this
from the back again just a tiny bit at

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.050
the lime green but

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.130
that makes this fairly usable for other
color schemes you want to do some

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:24.660
some custom Porsche have figures and get
a

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.870
get a few these may be pick them up once
the shop on

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.660
Bricklink the only unfortunate thing
about the figures that when you place it

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.220
next to the car

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.690
it makes it look like you've got hurt
tiny tiny little dude there or a

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:40.840
really huge blown-up version of a 918

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.370
the real car is much smaller than that
lastly they include this little assembly

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:48.110
with a little bit of a fence a little
bit of curbing

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.120
and a checkered flag all told this is a
nice one

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.670
has one other small cheap sets and I
feel like they did a great job of

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:57.709
capturing everything they needed to

00:03:57.709 --> 00:04:01.190
from the original you can look at it and
see oh yeah I see what they're going for

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.680
there

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.770
it's recognizable has the the right
shapes the right

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:08.700
color and just overall I just think it's

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.209
it's well done and I think it's a good
set to get and was also very enjoyable

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:13.989
to build has good pieces to

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:19.190
so just pretty much everything about it
is as good as he can reasonably expect

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.930
released I think so please feel free to
agree or disagree

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:24.950
share your thoughts in the comments
section below

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.600
