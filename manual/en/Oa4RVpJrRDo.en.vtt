00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.320
Grif: BOOM!

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.260
Huge explosion! You wouldn't believe it!

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.140
He just shook it off though, like it was nothing,

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:14.520
and he comes right at us.

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:16.460
Rebels: Oooohhh

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:18.100
Grif: He cuts a rocket launcher in half-

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.600
so Tucker goes in for a stab,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.780
but nothing's working.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.560
That's when I knew what to do.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.320
Rebels: Ohhhh

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.520
Grif: I throw myself on top of him, taking him completely by surprise!

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.140
But he has the strength of ten men!

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.740
No,

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:30.820
ten bears.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.160
Rebels: Ooohhhh

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:34.420
Grif: This guy's invincible,

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.160
it looked like nothing was gonna stop him!

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.140
Rebel 1: What did you do?

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.060
Grif: Huh?

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:38.780
Oh.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.840
Uhh, we tied a car to him and threw it off a cliff.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:44.760
Rebel: *whispers* That is the most metal thing I've ever heard...

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:46.900
Grif: So the moral of the story is,

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.660
you never know when random, seemingly unimportant stuff-

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.420
will turn out to be very important.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.940
Which is why you shouldn't question me when I tell you to build me something. Like a hammock, or...

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.380
A human slingshot.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.140
Simmons: Grif,

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:58.040
what are you doing?

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.100
Grif: Just telling these guys how we took down the Meta.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.660
Simmons: Why?

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.100
P̶i̶n̶k̶  Lightish red rebel: Is it true Simmons?

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.680
Did he really growl like some sort of...

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.700
Monster?

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.340
Jensen: And did he really have the strenght of ten bears?

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.900
Simmons: Uhh, I uh...

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:10.540
Ahem,

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.960
more like, uh, you know, twenty bears?

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.060
Jensen: Wooow.
Pink Rebel: So hot.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.460
Grif: That is why.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.840
Simmons: *sigh* You're spending way too much time with Tucker.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.780
Kimball: (on speaker) Grif, Simmons and Caboose.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:23.720
Report to my office immidiately.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.960
Grif: Well guys, it looks like that's it for the day.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:26.680
Run along.

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.000
Rebels: Aww

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.140
Caboose: I liked the part with the bears.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.580
Caboose: Tucker!

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:33.500
Tucker: If you hug me, I will shoot you.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.840
Caboose: Ah it's okay Tucker, I know you're more into groping.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.180
Come on, let's grope.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.080
Grif: When did you get back?

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:40.060
Tucker: A little while ago.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.740
Simmons: What happened?

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.340
Felix: Oh, I'll tell you what happened.

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:44.100
Captain Tucker here,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.780
decided to disobey orders-

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.960
and took it upon himself to recover a hard-drive full of federal army secrets.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.280
A decision that only cost him the lives-

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.440
of two of his men.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.540
That's a pretty damn good trade, if I do say so myself!

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.100
Tucker: What?

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.100
Felix: Hah, man you should've seen this guy!

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.660
He was all-

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.780
"I don't play by the rules" and fucking James Bond shit all over the place, it was crazy!

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.220
Tucker: Wait, I thought you we're pissed?

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.400
Felix: Oh-oh, do not get me wrong-

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.480
I wanted to beat your worthless skull into the ground until it was paste.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.620
But look where we are now.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.680
You took a risk,

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.660
and it payed off.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:18.480
Tucker: Payed off?

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.940
Dude, two of our guys are dead!

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.220
Felix: And two more will probably die tomorrow.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.000
Seriously, what don't you people get about that?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.760
Kimball: That's enough,

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:25.440
Felix.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.820
Felix: *clears throat*

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.520
...Just sayin'.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:30.460
Kimball: Tucker,

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:32.900
your choice cost two men their lives.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.520
But, it also granted us access to valuable information.

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:40.960
Whether or not this was the right thing to do, is a conclusion you'll have to come to on your own.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.360
I'll leave it at that.

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:45.220
Right now, the six of us need to have a talk.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.940
Grif: Could it not be as depressing as the talk we're having right now?

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.440
Kimball: I know where your friends are.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:51.280
Simmons: You do?
Grif: Whoah.
Caboose: Yay! I have friends!

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.720
Felix: Whoah, when did this happen?

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.920
Kimball: I kept digging through the files Tucker brought back.

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.820
There wasn't much to go off of, but eventually I found them.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.960
And, from the looks of it-

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.360
they've been moved around a bit.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.640
Simmons: Finally! We can rescue Sarge and everything will go back to normal!

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.720
Isn't that great, Grif?

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:07.400
Grif: "Great" is a strong word, Simmons.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.620
I'd have gone with "Tolerable".

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.040
Kimball: Don't celebrate just yet...

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.680
As I said, they've been moving around fairly regularly-

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.100
and from the looks of things, it isn't going to stop.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:18.860
Right now they're help up at a compound just north of a nearby mountain range.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.060
But in about a week, it sounds like they'll be transferred to the capital.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:23.280
A place that is very,

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.120
very,

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.240
out of our reach.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.780
Simmons: So, then we go get them now?

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.040
Is that-

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:29.600
that's a thing we can do, right?

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.620
Felix: The compound she's talking about, is twice the size of the one Tucker and I raided.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.160
Breaking in, would be suicide.

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.640
breaking someone out, would be...

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.760
Like suicide, and a bunch of puppies dying.

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.720
Tucker: How do you know?

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.800
Felix: Because I've tried!

00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:44.220
And, uh, spoiler alert; It didn't go well.

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.500
Caboose: Were the puppies okay?

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:47.560
Felix: Kimball, please talk some sense into these guys.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.580
Caboose: Yes, I'm sorry, can we get back to the puppies?

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.060
Kimball: When I first heard about you four, I envisioned-

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.940
strong,

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.100
daring,

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:55.560
respectible soldiers.

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:58.020
Grif: Buuut?

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:59.200
Kimball: But,

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:00.900
now that I've come to know you,

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.480
I've found that you're something else entirely.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.020
It turns out, you're all a bunch of-

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.640
Simmons: Cowards.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.320
Tucker: Losers.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.880
Grif: Idiots?

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:07.540
Caboose: Space men.

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.320
Kimball: Misfits.

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.420
You're oddballs that don't exactly fit in-

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.740
which is why my men all look up to you,

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.120
and why morale has been at an all time high.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.480
Because they can relate to you.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:22.300
Because togther, we're an army of underdogs, and outcasts.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:26.660
But, as of right now, I cannot authorize a rescue mission of this scale.

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:31.600
Interestingly enough, you work well when you fight together-

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.460
but,

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.860
individually you still haven't shown what it takes to lead others.

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.580
Which is why I'm giving you five days.

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:41.300
Five days to assemble a smaller team-

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.880
one comprised of the best of each of your platoons.

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.640
And if you can convince me that you're ready by the end of those  five days,

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:50.180
then you will have my support.

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:51.520
Tucker: Five days?

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.100
Grif: That's not really a lot of time...

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.660
Kimball: Well,

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.200
it's all you've got.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.120
Felix: Yeah, um, if this is really happening-

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:00.860
I'd like to be payed in advance.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.480
Grif: Five days.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.080
Five fucking days.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.000
My naps take longer than five days.

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:08.700
Caboose: Yeah, and president's day is on Monday,

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.320
so we can't expect people to come in on a holiday,

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.940
because that would be time and a half,

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.540
and- Oh my god, that would be five and a half days!

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:16.900
Felix: Take my advice, gentlemen.

00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:19.100
Live to fight another day.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:21.740
Grif: I think I liked you better when you thought we were supersoldiers.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.920
Tucker: Hey, what's up with that?

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.040
Felix: This is a plasma rifle.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.620
Part of my cut from the hit and run.

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.420
Simmons: Your cut?

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:29.860
Felix: You think these guys have any money lying around?

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:30.780
Yeah right.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.060
They pay me in old, alien tech.

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:35.780
The whole reason Chorus was chosen for colonisation-

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.660
was because it showed promising signs of extraterrestrial artefacts.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.280
Turns out the UNSC was right.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:43.220
Too bad they abandoned the place.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.140
But hey,

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:45.980
their loss is my very shiny,

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:47.580
very valuable gain.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:48.100
Tucker: Wait,

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.080
Why steal weapons and ammo,

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:51.920
when we could just use this space laser shit?

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:53.780
Felix: Because they don't work, genius.

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:54.640
They're busted.

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:56.640
But I'm willing to bet that someone out there,

00:05:56.640 --> 00:06:00.040
would be happy to pay a very large sum of money for these babies.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.660
Caboose: Uh, yeah wait, I'm sorry, uh I'm confused.

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:04.400
are they- are they babies, or are they lasers?

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:05.480
Or...

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:06.960
Laser babies.

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.060
Felix: While we're talking business,

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.860
If you guys are serious about rescuing your friends by the end of the week,

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:15.300
I could always be "persuaded" to increase my level of assistance.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.740
For a one-time fee of course.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.840
Maybe something along the lines of an alien energy sword?

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:20.760
Hmm?

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:22.040
Any takers?

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:23.520
Tucker?

00:06:23.520 --> 00:06:24.960
Tucker: Hmm, I don't think so.

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:26.480
If you like the New Republic so much,

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:28.100
how come you still charge them for your help?

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:29.400
Felix: Because when I retire-

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:31.540
I want a television the size of a billboard.

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.300
Caboose: Well, that's gonna be bad for your eyes...

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.940
Tucker: I'm just saying, you could always help us out - for free.

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.300
You know, mix it up a little.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.640
Felix: Ah, hm,

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:41.380
okay. So, you want me to help you rescue your friends-

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:42.560
because...

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:43.460
What?

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:44.760
It's the right thing to do?

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.300
Tucker: Yeah.

00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:46.960
It's called: "not being a dick".

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:47.760
Felix: Hmpf.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.500
You know,

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.980
if I recall...

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.720
The first time these people ever asked you for help,

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:54.580
you turned them down.

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:58.080
Figured this whole "civil war" thing wasn't your problem.

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:58.900
Heh.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.440
In fact, I bet-

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.520
if your friends had never been captured,

00:07:02.520 --> 00:07:04.260
you'd still refuse to lend them a hand.

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:06.120
Even if it was the-

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:07.380
"right thing to do".

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:10.300
Everyone,

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:11.640
has their price.

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.660
I learned that a long time ago.

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:16.060
And you're no exeption.
