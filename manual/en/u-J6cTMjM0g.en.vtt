My Room Rules Sydney

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.070
My name is Sydney and this is my room.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:16.100
First I love my bed. My bed is really cool because of the color and the design on it.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:20.040
I also really like is that my sheets are lime green.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:35.020
Then comes my night stand. My nightstand is really big. It holds a lot of stuff. I really like my calendar because its magnetic. I also like my clock because it projects on to my wall.

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:50.150
Next there is my big big big dresser. My dresser is quite huge and I love my geoboard on it.  My lamp holds some of my necklaces and I have this flamingo light on it.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:01:05.160
Then I have my keyboard. My keyboard is really cool cause I love to play these random things like.  And then I have my book shelf.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:17.170
My bookshelf is cool because of how its shape see. It goes in waves and stuff.  It holds my books, scrapbooks,my art supplies and my notebook.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:33.260
Then I have my closet. My closet is the more the messiest part of my room. I have my clothes on this part. My stuff is on the shelf and a bookshelf with my printer, my books, my Cds cases.

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:47.090
Then finally is my desk. My desk is my favorite part of my room because above it is my bulletin board. The bulletin board is like a collage of things.  

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:53.190
It has my Pottery Barn Magazine, my pictures of my cat, a picture of my mom skydiving and my calendar

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:59.100
Also what is cool about my desk is my canvas and my pastels and paint brushes

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.240
and my laptop.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.110
And that's basically it. Bye
