00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:07.220
Welcome back we are going to start playing
some music now so let's start off with the

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:15.249
notes that we just played. G,A,B,C,D,E,F,G.
And I want to talk about the left hand technique

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:22.929
just the basic technique. As you notice from
me playing I use the tip of my fingers, not

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:30.689
the pad of my fingers but the tip. It allows
me to arch the finger over and touch the string

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:38.880
and not touch any other string, it is very
important. So try that a few times, also as

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:51.280
I play E,F, and G notice that there is not
wasted motion. I'm not doing this I'm simply

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:59.840
only doing what is necessary it makes like
much easier. You notice that this finger doesn't

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.460
move unless it absolutely needs to but when
I play the G right here there is no need to

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:13.970
move this finger so I don't. Also behind the
guitar my thumb is on the back of the neck,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.070
I'm not grabbing the neck but it is on the
back of the neck and there is pressure between

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:31.790
the thumb and the finger. I'm pitching the
neck of the guitar to create the sound. Alright.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:39.490
So the first three strings again G,A,B,C,D,E,F,G
just go ahead and do the last three strings

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:47.970
really quick. The first the first big string
is just like that little string it is E,F,G,

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.040
the next string the section is A,B,C and the
last string that we have not covered is D,E,F.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.270
So if I just start with this note right here
and go all through the alphabet it will look

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:11.109
and seem really simple hopefully that is E,F,G,A,B,C,D,E,F,G,A,B,C,D,E,F,G
okay. It is going to take some time to memorize

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:16.129
where the notes are that is for you to do
in your spare time while you are watching

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:22.620
tv or whatever. Okay but hopefully you did
notice that between B and C and E and F, I

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.680
only move one fret. If you remember that it
will make life much easier it is very important.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:35.129
B to C, E to F is one fret, everything else
is to okay. Also we are going to play some

00:02:35.129 --> 00:02:41.319
simple chords and I will take to you about
what a chord is in more details a little bit

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.109
later but basically it is a bunch of notes
together. This is a G chord a simple version

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:54.590
and this is a simple version of a C chord,
this is a G7 chord. Let's do those three first

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:58.640
so you got G,G7 and a C chord which I'm sure
you have heard somewhere before.
