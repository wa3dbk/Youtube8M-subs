00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:09.340
Senior Signing Day Yes Prep style is our take
on a ceremony that's traditionally been reserved

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:15.160
for star high school athletes playing big
time Division 1 sports and while those are

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.230
impressive accomplishments, we believe the
accomplishments of the seniors here today

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.590
deserve the same, if not more attention because
each one of these guys represents living,

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:32.279
breathing proof of the hypothesis to any student
regardless of zip code, ethnicity, or income

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.080
level, any student can graduate from high
school, can attend and complete a four-year

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.120
college when they're given access to the same
opportunities and the same resources that

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.030
students receive in great private schools
and in great suburban public schools, and

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.030
these guys are doing that today.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:48.030
Good afternoon! My name is Rupert Longoria
[ph] and this fall, I will be entering Macalaster

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.030
College.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.030
Fernando [ph] College.

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:51.030
The University of Houston.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.300
St. Mary's University.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:06.720
I'm just stunned by what I see here today.
I don't want to get up here and start crying,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.110
but to see what you guys are doing as a team
and to me it's so fitting we're doing this

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.790
in a gym is much as we come to basketball
games and cheer and come to football games

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:22.580
and cheer. No basketball game, no football
game would begin to compare to the importance

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.570
and the magnitude of what's happening here
today. This is what it's all about, it's young

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:31.030
people taking control of their lives, working
extraordinarily hard, and taking that next

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.600
step. This is a family here. This is like
a family reunion, a family gathering and we

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.920
work together; extraordinary things are possible.
President Obama has drawn a line in the sand.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.229
He said by 2020, we have to again lead the
world in pursuit of college graduates. We

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.729
have to educate our way to a better economy.
We have an economic imperative, we have a

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:55.920
moral imperative to fight for education as
these civil rights issue, these civil rights

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.370
fight the struggle of our generation. What
you guys are going to do is you're going to

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:01.520
lead the country where we need to go.
