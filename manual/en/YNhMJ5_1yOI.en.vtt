00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.034
-[grumbles]
It's happening again.

00:00:02.034 --> 00:00:04.595
I'm bored! Bored. Bored, bored.

00:00:04.595 --> 00:00:06.453
Hey! Hey, Salad Bowl!

00:00:06.453 --> 00:00:10.268
-You really need a recipe?
You're making a simple salad.

00:00:10.268 --> 00:00:13.382
Just chop some vegetables, throw
in some dressing, and toss.

00:00:13.382 --> 00:00:15.097
-Hey, Salad! Hey, Salad, hey!

00:00:15.097 --> 00:00:16.427
[rapid slicing]
-Sorry, I can't hear you

00:00:16.427 --> 00:00:20.312
over the crappiest
chopping of all time.

00:00:20.312 --> 00:00:21.970
-Seriously! This guy sucks!

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:23.180
Aah!
[splatters]

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.009
-Eww! What a "hack."
[laughs]

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:28.744
-[spits]
Lettuce got in my mouth.

00:00:31.944 --> 00:00:33.639
[crunch!]

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:35.901
-Please! I don't want
to be a dead thing.

00:00:35.901 --> 00:00:37.014
[groans]

00:00:37.014 --> 00:00:39.848
-You're absolutely
ruining this salad.

00:00:39.848 --> 00:00:42.699
-Really? Well, I think
he's "nailing" it. [laughs]

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:44.344
-Ugh! Don't! Please! No!

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:47.471
No!!
[groaning, splatters]

00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:50.790
-Eww. Tomato's trying
to play "catch-up."

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.958
[laughs uneasily]

00:00:51.958 --> 00:00:53.900
-Please! No!

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.318
[splat!]

00:00:55.318 --> 00:00:57.730
-That is not how
you chop an onion.

00:00:58.745 --> 00:00:59.756
[splat!]

00:00:59.756 --> 00:01:03.094
-Whoa! That's some
eggs-tremely violent behavior.

00:01:03.094 --> 00:01:04.174
[laughs wryly]

00:01:04.174 --> 00:01:05.966
[yolk slopping]
Smasharama!

00:01:05.966 --> 00:01:10.138
-Seriously? Who puts
uncooked rice in a salad?

00:01:10.138 --> 00:01:11.003
[smack!]

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:12.891
Who would put a fish in this?!

00:01:12.891 --> 00:01:13.825
-Looks like he's really

00:01:13.825 --> 00:01:17.037
"floundering" with this recipe,
huh? [laughs]

00:01:17.037 --> 00:01:20.673
-Holy Toledo, this salad's
gonna be the worst.

00:01:20.673 --> 00:01:24.179
-I don't know. Looks like a real
"breadwinner" to me. [laughs]

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:26.320
[smack!]
-Oh good, we needed that

00:01:26.336 --> 00:01:28.788
extra fish.
-Eww!

00:01:29.957 --> 00:01:32.457
-Oh, so now we're gonna
use the bowl? Great.

00:01:32.457 --> 00:01:34.448
-I guess he's taking
a "shining" to you.

00:01:34.448 --> 00:01:36.997
Get it? 'Cause you're shiny!
[laughs]

00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:39.206
-Dressing on a salad--
who woulda thunk?

00:01:39.206 --> 00:01:42.257
-Well, you wouldn't want
to serve it naked. [laughs]

00:01:42.257 --> 00:01:44.966
-Come on,
you're drowning it now.

00:01:44.966 --> 00:01:47.758
[stammers]
Would you quit it with the fish?

00:01:47.758 --> 00:01:50.927
-Maybe it's just trying to
balance the "scales." [laughs]

00:01:50.927 --> 00:01:53.319
Sorry. My "gill-ty" pleasure.

00:01:53.319 --> 00:01:55.438
[laughs]:
Get it? Gill?

00:01:55.438 --> 00:01:58.403
-This salad could not
possibly get any worse.

00:01:58.403 --> 00:02:00.593
-That's what we
were just saying.

00:02:00.593 --> 00:02:03.110
-Totally.
Couldn't get any worse.

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.263
[eggs scream]
-Oh, really? Really?!

00:02:06.263 --> 00:02:10.184
-Oh, Salad Bowl,
you got "shell-acked." [laughs]

00:02:10.184 --> 00:02:12.277
-Little preoccupied here,
Orange.

00:02:12.277 --> 00:02:14.708
This guy is BUTCHERING
this salad.

00:02:14.708 --> 00:02:16.665
-Hey! Hey, Salad Bowl!
Salad Bowl, hey!

00:02:16.665 --> 00:02:19.751
-And I mean, he's probably
not even gonna toss it.

00:02:19.751 --> 00:02:23.707
I mean, is it really that
hard to toss a salad?

00:02:23.707 --> 00:02:25.794
-Salad Bowl! Hey!
Hey, Salad Bowl!

00:02:25.794 --> 00:02:26.679
-WHAT?!

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:28.138
-Toss.

00:02:28.138 --> 00:02:30.770
-[screams, clangs against wall]

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.899
-Ugh.
I guess being a tossed salad

00:02:32.899 --> 00:02:35.810
isn't all it's "cracked" up
to be. [laughs wryly]

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.560
[smack!]
Oh, dude!

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.766
That was totally "un-cod" for.
[laughs]

00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:42.093
But seriously,
are you gonna eat that?

00:02:42.093 --> 00:02:45.845
