Hello, I’m Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.610
[pause]

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:09.470
and welcome to DermTV.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:13.240
At DermTV, I get a lot of questions about
keloid scars and the best news I

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.009
can give you if you think you have keloid
scars is that most people who

00:00:17.009 --> 00:00:21.399
think they have them really don’t, they
really have hypertrophic scars,

00:00:21.399 --> 00:00:26.559
which are much easier to treat. Let me explain.
If you have an injury or

00:00:26.559 --> 00:00:32.329
even a surgical procedure that creates a cut
that’s repaired in the shape

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:37.061
of that line and you get a hypertrophic scar,
the hypertrophic scar is the

00:00:37.061 --> 00:00:41.550
approximately the size or the footprint of
the original injury, it’s raised

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.700
but it’s generally the area of the injury.
If you get a keloid in response

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:50.059
to that injury it’s not only raised but
it has no relationship to that line

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:54.820
so it starts to grow but almost looks like
a cauliflower type of shape, it

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.030
almost acts like an independent autonomous
tumor that grows. In another

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.190
episode I discussed the treatment of raised
hypertrophic scars;

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:08.390
unfortunately those treatments usually do
not work for the treatment of

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:14.119
keloid scars. So just rubbing the keloid scar
with firm pressure doesn’t

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.320
make it better, using over the counter silicone
gels and sheets doesn’t

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.869
help; even my lasers don’t help keloid scars.
The best way to treat keloid

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.490
scars is with injections of concentrated cortisone
right into the scar.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.509
They’re repeated at 2 to 3 week intervals,
they cause the scar to become

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.909
softer when they get softer they absorb more
of the cortisone and the

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.469
cortisone melts the extra collagen, the fibrous
tissue in the scar and

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:46.399
reduces its size. If that doesn’t work then
the only other option is having

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.090
the keloid scar surgically excised but when
you surgically excise it you

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.150
create another injury and people prone to
forming keloids, form them in

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.429
response to all injuries. So, we’re always
concerned that removing the

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:03.859
keloid surgically will result in an additional
keloid. To help prevent

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:08.590
that, during the surgical procedure, we inject
concentrated cortisone into

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.980
the surgical site so the cortisone is there
to help prevent a keloid from

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:17.150
recurring. And after the skin heals, it’s
monitored carefully by both the

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.090
patient and the physician so at the earliest
signs of raising up of the

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:25.280
skin, as if the keloid were trying to reform,
it’s again injected with

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.430
cortisone to drive it back down and to control
it and often that will

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.660
result in a superior cosmetic result. But
keep one thing in mind, if you

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.600
think you have a keloid scar, at home treatments
are not going to help you,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.930
it’s time to see a dermatologist.
