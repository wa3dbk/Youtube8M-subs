Hi, it's Dowell here at the Firehouse Detail
Shop. We're doing an interior detail and we're

00:00:05.842 --> 00:00:10.370
teaching you how to do it like a pro. One
of the things that we get often asked here

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:17.010
is, "the inside of my car smells horrible,"
either it's pet, pet urine, maybe a child

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.140
had a vomiting accident, or you purchased
a car, or had a friend smoke in your car,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:28.740
odor removal is possible, it's not always
easy. The first part is we've got to clean

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.820
the car to remove the things that are creating
the odor. So, if it's vomit, we have special

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:38.500
things like Azapit, it goes in, it's got enzymes,
it's got deodorizers in it that clean vomit,

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.940
that clean up pet urine, child urine. It's
really important that we know what causes

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:49.650
those smells though. The person comes in and
says "my cars smells," you have to ask a lot

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.050
of questions, to try to narrow out what it
is, where it's coming from, and how it's happening,

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.742
so we can attack the problem. If you've got
a smoker in the car previously, and you want

00:00:58.742 --> 00:01:04.129
the smoke done, there's really two options,
the first line of defense is an odor bomb.

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:11.070
We buy these from Budco, we actually turn
the car on, you run the air, you get air circulating,

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.850
you set this on a piece of paper, or a towel,
you turn it on for four, or five, six seconds,

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.420
close the doors, let it fumigate the car,
and then hurry and open it, and turn it off,

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.950
and then you just let the car sit. That goes
in and it neutralizes the odors. The other

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.330
way to do it, if that doesn't work, is you
can go to an ozone machine. We have ozone

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:36.390
machines here, we'll place them inside, it
creates ozone, that ozone permeates the car,

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.220
the filtering system, the air flow and it
goes in and it will actually kill the odor

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.730
causing bacterias and the things that causes
odor in the car. You bought a car, it's smells

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.189
bad, the chances are you're going to have
to take it to a professional detailing shop,

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.009
if you're a professional detailing shop you'll
know how to remove the smoke with the things

00:01:55.009 --> 00:02:00.850
we just talked about. Odor removal is very
important to your customers, or to you and

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.270
that's probably why you're watching this segment.
