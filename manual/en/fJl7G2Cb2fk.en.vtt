00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
This doe came to 15m

00:01:00.322 --> 00:01:07.322
I stalked closer to these two but this was not 
 really interesting young 6-pointer so I moved on

00:01:36.442 --> 00:01:43.440
Another promising young buck, I am looking for a cull or old buck

00:03:17.083 --> 00:03:24.080
He came to no more than 5m but again 
 a bit too nice and young to take

00:03:39.626 --> 00:03:46.630
This one came from behind and I didn't 
 have much time to have a look...

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.910
This is a yearling spiker

00:04:19.073 --> 00:04:26.070
Camera is struggling to keep focused in the morning mist...

00:05:09.014 --> 00:05:16.010
This is a young roebuck with unusual antlers

00:05:22.778 --> 00:05:29.780
No safe backstop

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:55.980
But he's coming closer

00:06:32.789 --> 00:06:39.790
He drops just out of frame after 20m

00:06:43.231 --> 00:06:50.230
Little malform buck
