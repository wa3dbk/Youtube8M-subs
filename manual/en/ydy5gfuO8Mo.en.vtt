Hey I'm Ann Myrick and today I'm going to
show you how to pick art for your living room.

00:00:05.851 --> 00:00:13.200
It really has to do with is your living room
formal or informal, you need to think about

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:25.560
that. Do you, what do you like, do you like
expensive art work, do you like using childrens'

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:32.689
art work and pictures that they have done
in school and then I love dark frames. I love

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:40.410
frames and I love dark frames so if you find
a piece that you want to frame I always think,

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.770
I love black and I love a dark brown. Black
will really anchor a room and I really like

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:51.590
having black in a room so a great big black
frame with a piece of art work in it will

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:58.870
look great in pretty much any living room
or any room. Things I like to do since I tend

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.930
to be a creative person I like to take what
is there and work with it and I love frames

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:12.920
and so you'll see instead of really having
art, specific art for this I just more created

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.520
an architectural piece. This is an old just
kind of gold gilded frame that I found in

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.340
a garage sale for $1 and so I bought this
frame and it would be great to put it over

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:27.670
a mirror, it would be great to put it over
another painting but what I did is I just

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:33.200
propped it on the wall and then I have another
frame that I just tried to create kind of

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:44.860
an interesting architectural kind of shape
within there and then in accessorizing with

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.740
this you can put anything with it which is
a tray or whatever you want to but also let's

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:56.880
go back to hanging on the wall. Trays are
great. These are those old trays and you can

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:06.250
put several trays on a wall and they make
a great look. Using childrens' art work from

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:14.319
school. This was a small picture that my child
did when he was very young and I had this

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:19.469
frame that I, I collect frames, I love frames
and I had this frame so what I did is I just

00:02:19.469 --> 00:02:26.689
used the wall as the at and taped the picture
on to the wall and then just with a small

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:33.129
little nail hung the frame and so if I ever
want to take it down it is just a matter of

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.590
taking the nail out of the wall and taking
the picture down and putting something else

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:44.069
up. This piece again, I collect frames, love
frames and then I just had this old piece

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:51.260
of wood, just an old wood container so I just
filled it full of some texture of like an

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:58.519
old artichoke and just created texture. This
is Ann Myrick and that is how to pick out

00:02:58.519 --> 00:03:00.040
art work for your living room.
