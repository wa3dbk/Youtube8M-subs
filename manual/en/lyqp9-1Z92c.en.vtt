00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.279
Baseball has always been my favorite sport.

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.569
I like hockey and football, and I can tolerate
basketball, but my favorite day of the year

00:00:25.569 --> 00:00:26.890
is opening day.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.550
Well, this year my team got shut out by the
best pitcher in the league, but as baseball

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.850
season is upon us, it got me thinking about
one of the best kids’ game series around.

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.100
The Backyard Sports games were great for kids
who were learning the game but also wanted

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.260
some zany action, not unlike some of the Mario
Sports titles we have now.

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.690
But Backyard Baseball was especially great.

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:48.230
It mixed in simple, kid friendly gameplay
with great characters and crazy fields.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.070
In fact, a Game Boy Advance game was even
made, and that’s what we have today.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.680
This is Backyard Baseball.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.710
So, with the exception of the first Backyard
Baseball game, which was awesome in its own

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.170
right, the series has been known for mixing
the “Backyard Kids” like Tony Delvechio

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.030
and Pablo Sanchez with Major Leaguers as kids.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.800
This game is around ten years old at this
point, so some of the players you’ll have

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:17.250
a chance to play with include Tim Hudson,
Randy Johnson, Derek Jeter, Albert Pujols,

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.390
and one of my favorites, Todd Helton.

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:22.920
Each player is assigned a certain number of
points in 4 different categories to determine

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.440
what kind of a player they are.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.360
Some are really balanced, like Alex Rodriguez,
while others excel in specific areas.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:32.160
Of course, anyone who knows about Backyard
Baseball is aware that Pablo Sanchez is the

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.160
best.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:34.640
Always pick him first.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.390
Power-ups are also a big part of the game,
with the impossible to hit fireball or freezeball

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.429
to the most valued of them all, the aluminum
bat, which is pretty much a guaranteed home-run.

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:46.890
I got the screaming line drive right before
Randy Johnson batted and he hit a first-pitch

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:54.920
home run.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.910
Although Backyard Baseball on the PC can almost
be considered a point-and-click baseball game,

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:01.760
its GBA sibling does have some control issues.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:03.890
For one thing, batting is pretty frustrating.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.160
I’ve been playing a lot of The Show recently.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:09.729
You know, a hardcore baseball game with a
ton of realism; pretty much the opposite of

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.480
this, but I still could not manage to make
contact with the ball without a ton of practice.

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.010
The game has a huge delay from button press
to swing, so you’ll have to press the button

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.060
when the ball is only about halfway to you
and it’s a little bit weird to make this

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.060
transition.

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.980
If you want, you can put it on easy mode and
this won’t happen, but then you’re playing

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.030
a kids’ game on easy mode.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.000
There are only a few different modes to choose
from in this version of Backyard Baseball.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.910
You have a quick-play option to just jump
into a game immediately, a single game option,

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.901
a season option, and this is the one you’ll
spend the majority of your time in, and a

00:02:40.901 --> 00:02:44.050
home-run derby for those of you who want to
see how many you can knock into your neighbor’s

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.050
pool.

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.060
Now, as this is a GBA game, it looks nowhere
near as good as the PC game, but that’s

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:50.060
ok.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.980
Everything looks perfectly fine, although
it can be a little tough to gauge fly balls.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.050
However, while music is also really good,
you only get text between broadcasters Sunny

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:00.420
Day and Vinnie the…um.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.650
Due to the relatively recent change to the
meaning of his nickname, I’ll stop there.

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.440
How did I not notice that before?

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.790
My head is in the gutter, but why did they
name him that?

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.630
Backyard Baseball is best played on the PC,
but this version of the game is definitely

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.900
a good one for kids who want to play it on
the go.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.160
Hopefully some more of these get made, because
the next generation of kids should really

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.900
get a chance to enjoy them.
