00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:23.320
Remember that scene where Winnie the Pooh
wants the honey, so he rolls around in the

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.260
mud and floats up with a balloon?

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.550
Well, this game is just like that...only with
fewer balloons and less mud.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:30.650
And no musical numbers!

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:33.710
You know, there’s no reason these bees couldn’t
be singing something.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.180
I’m sure they’re more than capable.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.890
Although you never can tell with bees.

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.970
It’s To Bee or Not to Bear for the iPhone.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:50.790
So this game was just released to the App
Store.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:54.940
It’s actually the developer’s very first
iPhone game...and although you can certainly

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.300
tell in some respects, it’s actually a really
fun idea that absolutely has its moments.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.430
So the game foregoes all the usual video game
battles.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:09.420
You know, man vs. zombies, soldiers vs. zombies,
plants vs. zombies.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.100
Instead, this one portrays one a battle that’s
been raging in the forests for decades, perhaps

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.940
even longer...that being the struggle between
honey bees and hungry grizzlies.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.190
Now, as the bees work diligently on their
honey, it’s your job to protect them from

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:25.190
the bears.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.420
The bears swing in on ropes to reach the honey,
so you have to cut them down by swiping your

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:30.420
finger.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.810
The thing is, your bees evidently spend all
their energy on the honey making and therefore

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:37.270
can’t fly...so they have ropes, too.

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:43.870
If you cut down too many bees...tut, tut,
looks like death.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:02:01.720
So there are ten levels, and each one turns
into this insane entanglement of ropes.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.910
That’s certainly a cool idea, and there
are even power-ups that appear in the hive...but

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.799
the concept does stumble a bit.

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:13.480
At times, it’s virtually impossible to slice
a bear’s rope without also cutting down

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.760
one of your bees.

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.090
It sucks when that happens.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.890
Another issue I had was that...you know, you’ll
see a bear and quickly cut the rope down,

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:25.680
but as you’re doing that, a bee comes in
from the exact same place.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.980
So you’re killing a bee that you didn’t
even see coming sometimes...which is kind

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:30.980
of inevitable, given the concept.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.700
But still, it’s an enjoyably frantic game.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.079
And when it does click, it can be a lot of
fun.

00:02:37.079 --> 00:02:42.329
The game could definitely be more polished
and refined, but as it is, To Bee or Not to

00:02:42.329 --> 00:02:49.870
Bear is a solid first effort with lots of
challenge...and poorly planned honey theft.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.019
Silly old bears.
