00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:10.160
You know, I am NOT qualified to give specific
Christian advice.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:19.900
Spiritual advice does NOT come from a pastor,
although pastors think THAT THEY are the ones

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.419
that are qualified.

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:31.939
You cannot even get specific spiritual advice
from the Bible, although Christians THINK

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.030
they can.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:45.539
The place you go to for specific spiritual
advice is JESUS CHRIST and you MUST receive

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.120
His HOLY SPIRIT to KNOW what to do.

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.379
When you come to a trial in your life or a
hard situation that you are not sure what

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.679
to do, where do YOU go to?

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:04.070
Do you go to a pastor, or a Counselor?

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.260
Do you go to your parents?

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.300
Do you go to people who you trust?

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.760
Or do you really FIRST go to the HOLY SPIRIT?

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.400
Most people DON’T because they have NEVER
really received the Holy Spirit.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:26.320
They don’t hear the Holy Spirit and because
Jesus is NOT speaking to them they have to

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.200
go to MEN.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.510
So they seek after ALL the counsel from PEOPLE.

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:39.530
But I’m telling you, YOU CAN HEAR FROM GOD,
from the HOLY SPIRIT that JESUS gives.

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:45.600
It is supernatural, it is not the advice that
comes from people, but it is the advice that

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.660
comes from the Holy Spirit.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.390
And that is a GIFT.

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.280
DO YOU want the guidance that comes from the
Holy Spirit that is supernatural, that NO

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.090
MAN can tell you?

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.020
Or are you content with all the advice that
people give?

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:05.700
Where do YOU go to for advice?
