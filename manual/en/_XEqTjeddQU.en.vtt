00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Stopping excess skin oil from being released onto the skin's surface in the first place is the key to stopping acne

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Applied products are largely ineffective because they can only address skin oil after the fact

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:22.000
RoaccutaneÂ®* (isotretinoin) is extremely effective at preventing acne because it shuts down oil production before it reaches the skin's surface

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:29.000
However, it has significant side effects and is only used for extreme cases

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
Vilantae (d-Calcium pantothenate) doesn't dry out the skin by shutting down the pores completely

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
It works to prevent only the excess skin oil from being released in the first place

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:52.000
It is 100% all natural, has minimal side effects, and is a step up from applied products in effectiveness

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Vilantae (d-Calcium Pantothenate) is a revolutionary way to fight acne that is just starting to come into mainstream use

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Knowledge of its benefits have been relatively unknown until 1997 when Dr. Lit-Hung Leung, MDpublished his studies on d-Calcium Pantothenate's effects in preventing acne

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Through years of research, he obtained results that are quite astonishing

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The American medical community and the public have been slow to recognize the great effects of Vilantae (d-Calcium Pantothenate)

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
It has had more success in Asia and Hong Kong where the studies originally began and where the medical industry is structured differently (more info on the research and studies)

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
As a result this may be the first time that you've heard of Vilantae

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The news has been spreading mostly through newsletters, acne message forums, back pages on the Internet, and by word of mouth (links to acne message forums that provide first hand REAL and OBJECTIVE accounts of the great benefits of Vilantae (d-Calcium Pantothenate)

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:56.000
With the power to eliminate the vast amount of acne suffering in the world and protect so many from the terrible side effects of Roaccutane (isotretinoin), our hope is that people and the medical community alike will start realizing the great benefits of Vilantae (why hasn't the medical community started realizing this already)

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
How it works - stopping oil production before it's released onto the skin's surface is the key to stopping acne

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:18.000
While you may have heard that acne is caused by different factors including bacteria, increased levels of dead skin cells, inflammation, stress, diet, the immune system, poor hygiene, etc. the truth is that these are merely secondary-causes

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:30.000
While one could treat the secondary-causes of acne with applied skin products, Vilantae takes the same approach as Roaccutane (isotretinoin) by focusing closer to the root cause, which is why it's so much more effective

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
The ultimate root cause is genetics, but short of genetic engineering we cannot fix this problem. We can however focus right above it

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Without overproduction of oil, acne isn't possible and none of the other secondary-causes can play even the slightest role in acne

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Applied products fail because they cannot successfully regulate skin oils (why applied products yield poor results)

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000
The key to curing acne is stopping the overproduction of oil at its source

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:02.000
That's why Roaccutane (isotretinoin) is so effective, but it has numerous side effects and other downsides

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Vilantae (d-Calcium Pantothenate) on the other hand, has minimal side effects, is 100% natural, and is second only to Roaccutane (isotretinoin) in terms of effectiveness

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So how exactly do genetics lead to this overproduction of oil?
Unfortunately, many dermatologists are not clear about the causes of acne

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.000
It is implied that the exact causes of acne are unknown, but in truth most of the causes are known

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
The mystery lies in why genetics cause an overproduction of oil, only now we have a pretty good idea

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:41.000
The reason too much oil is being released has to do with the lipids and fatty acid deposits underneath the skin not getting broken down and re-circulated into the bloodstream. Instead they are being released as sebum (oil)

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:52.000
What enables our body to break down these fatty acids is directly related to an enzyme called coenzyme A, which is an essential enzyme to the body and is used for fatty acid metabolism

00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:06.000
Coenzyme A is also responsible for other important aspects of the body including sex hormone synthesis

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:16.000
When there is a lack of coenzyme A, the body is forced to choose between using the available coenzyme A for sex hormone synthesis or for metabolizing fats (the breakdown of fats)

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:26.000
Hormone synthesis is given the priority (without it sex organs do not develop) and as result, the body has trouble breaking down all of the necessary fats

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Fats that should have been broken down and re-circulated into the bloodstream, instead become deposited in the sebaceous glands (sweat glands) and secreted as oil. Oil is fat only in liquid form

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:42.000
Because teenagers have the highest hormone production rate, they are also the group with the highest amounts of acne

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:56.000
The body produces coenzyme A from three different components: adenosine triphosphate, cysteine, and Vilantae (d-Calcium Pantothenate)

00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000
Adenosine triphosplate and cysteine are naturally produced within the body through various glands. They are always plentiful so long as the body's not terribly malnourished

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000
Vilantae (d-Calcium Pantothenate) is the only one that must be supplied from outside the body through one's diet

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:14.000
When there is enough Vilantae (d-Calcium Pantothenate) available in the diet, the deficiency in coenzyme A is eliminated

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:12.000
As a result, a person's fatty acids get broken down and the skin doesn't over release oil

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Without the over releasing of oil, acne does not occur

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
The role of genetics

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:35.000
Why does Vilantae require megadosing during the first three months?
Switching to a diet high in Vilantae (d-Calcium Pantothenate) is not enough to help acne and in most cases will do very little

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:42.000
The reason for this is our bodies have trouble absorbing the necessary amounts of Vilantae (d-Calcium Pantothenate) due to our genetic programming

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
In theory, lets suppose a person naturally consumes an average of 500 milligrams of Vilantae (d-Calcium Pantothenate) per a day

00:05:48.000 --> 00:06:00.000
The person has moderate acne because their body does not have enough coenzyme A resources to produce hormones and break down fatty acids at the same time

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:09.000
If that were true the same person who consumes 500 milligrams a day could take 1 gram a day and have enough to produce sex hormones and break down fatty acids at the same time

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:18.000
However, this just isn't the case.The body has trouble producing enough coenzyme A for the breakdown of fatty acids even though the supply of Vilantae may be "adequate" 

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:30.000
It has nothing to do with the other two components of coenzyme A, but is merely a matter of getting the body to absorb the necessary Vilantae and actually produce the coenzyme A

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000
Even though the body is capable of doing this, it doesn't do it efficiently because it lacks the proper genetic programming

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:43.000
Consequently, one must take large amounts of Vilantae through our special Evolution-X Vilantae Supplements in order to be effective

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:51.000
By having an abundance available in the system it forces the body to produce enough coenzyme A allowing for the breakup of fatty acids and the prevention of oil (further evidence on why this is true)

00:06:51.000 --> 00:07:00.000
It's also important to have the nutrients available that assist in the absorption of Vilantae, the allocation of coenzyme A, and the breakdown of carbohydrates

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:08.000
Our supplements are specially formulated with the necessary nutrients, and as a result our Vilantae is more effective than what you'll find anywhere else

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:18.000
Not only do we use superior ingredients, but our compression ratio is far superior allowing for higher concentrations of Vilantae in the given capsule size

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000
On top of that, our prices are the lowest you'll find anywhere

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000
We offer a full 90 day money back guarantee if you don't get results
