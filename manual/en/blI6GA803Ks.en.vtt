00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:35.310
So let's open her up.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.040
Let's see what we got.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.140
Let's see what we got.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.980
Let's take off all the shrink-wrap.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.980
You just got to love the shrink-wrap on these things.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.860
Remember to pull the cardboard out of the back.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.460
So here is the spec sheet. This is the DSB-39 model Stack-On.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.810

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.229
So it looks like we get drawers.

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:18.080
So it looks like we get drawers.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.130
And these drawers are soft rigid plastic.

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.330
So these are flexible. These won't break like the traditional drawers that you would find the older models.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.140
So these are flexible. These won't break like the traditional drawers that you would find the older models.

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:34.030
So you do get nine drawers in the bottom for
bigger knick-knacks and 30 smaller drawers for smaller things.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.310
So you do get nine drawers in the bottom for
bigger knick-knacks and 30 smaller drawers for smaller things.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:43.310
Like Lego pieces, nuts, bolts, screws and down here put some bigger stuff.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.420
Maybe tools or other knick-knacks.

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.820
Maybe tools or other knick-knacks.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.540
These are great for any kind of hobby or Lego building. You can put anything you want in here.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.480
These are great for any kind of hobby or Lego building. You can put anything you want in here.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:57.940
This is a better to organizing parts than just
throwing them in other kind of bins

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.710
Now for the drawbacks of these drawers.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:06.330
They do not come with dividers.

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:09.129
They do come with piece of paper that tells you that you can order the dividers from the manufacture 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:12.499
They do come with piece of paper that tells you that you can order the dividers from the manufacture 

00:02:12.499 --> 00:02:16.189
They do come with piece of paper that tells you that you can order the dividers from the manufacture 

00:02:16.189 --> 00:02:21.849
For like two dollars more I guess to get
48. Not sure how much it cost.

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.540
So I don't understand why these do not come
with dividers. You think at least they would come with some of them but they didn't.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.790
So I don't understand why these do not come
with dividers. You think at least they would come with some of them but they didn't.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.589
So keep that mind when you buy this as they
do not come with dividers for the drawers.

00:02:32.589 --> 00:02:36.879
So keep that mind when you buy this as they
do not come with dividers for the drawers.

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:39.839
Also the back is opened up and you can see that dust can easily fly in here.

00:02:39.839 --> 00:02:43.279
Also the back is opened up and you can see that dust can easily fly in here.

00:02:43.279 --> 00:02:46.289
So make sure you have this up against the wall or something solid.

00:02:46.289 --> 00:02:49.349
Or you can just come in here and put a piece of cardboard or something and just tape it off. That's a smart idea too.

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:53.659
Or you can just come in here and put a piece of cardboard or something and just tape it off. That's a smart idea too.

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:56.949
And make sure you also keep these on something solid or even attach them to a wall because they actually have hooks.

00:02:56.949 --> 00:03:00.049
And make sure you also keep these on something solid or even attach them to a wall because they actually have hooks.

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.089
And make sure you also keep these on something solid or even attach them to a wall because they actually have hooks.

00:03:01.089 --> 00:03:04.709
And the reason why I'm saying that is, is that there has been reports these do tip.

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.769
And the reason why I'm saying that is, is that there has been reports these do tip.

00:03:08.839 --> 00:03:14.579
And you don't want all of your contents on the floor. So keep it on a sturdy surface.

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:18.279
On carpet, it kinda tends to rock around but I would fix these to a wall or something solid.

00:03:18.279 --> 00:03:20.359
