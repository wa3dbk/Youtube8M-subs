00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:05.700
This video will cover the basics of recording
with the Canon Vixia cameras also known as

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.950
the HV20 or HV40. Other than some minor differences,
these two models are virtually the same to

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.910
operate.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:20.429
The contents of the Vixia kits are: the HV
20 or 40 camera, a power supply with a connecting

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:25.880
cord, a remote control, an RCA 3-way to mini
cable, and a "Menu Settings" sheet.

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:35.679
The first thing you need is power to the camera.
Your two options are either battery powered

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.469
or with the power supply.

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.120
The battery is connected to the back of the
camera by lining up the metal contact plates

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:49.140
on the battery to the metal pins on the camera.
Slide UP until it CLICKS into place.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.980
To remove the battery, push the BATTERY RELEASE
button on the bottom of the camera, and then

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.600
slide the battery out.

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.429
A fully charged battery should last you several
hours of recording time. BUT you should always

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:01.440
have a backup ready. . .

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.170
And plug in whenever you can.

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:09.350
Plug the power supply into the DC port on
the back of the camera, and use the connecting

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.259
cable to plug into the wall.

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:15.890
The next step is to insert the mini-DV tape.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.740
Slide the OPEN/EJECT button, while pulling
the door open. Insert the cassette with the

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.119
sprockets facing in and the "label side"
up. Close the compartment by pressing the

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:28.829
inner door where it says "PUSH," then
close the outer door when the compartment

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.250
is all the way down.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:37.119
To record, push the little green button on
top of the camera and slide it towards CAMERA.

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.649
Use either the viewfinder or the LCD panel
to view your image.

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:47.219
The panel can be swiveled in several positions
depending on your angle. Whatever you do,

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:49.869
DO NOT FORCE IT!

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:54.250
Check that the MODE switch, located on the
side of the camera, is set to "Auto." For

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.189
this video, we will use only the AUTO functions.

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.219
To start recording your footage, press the
START/STOP button.

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:07.340
You will see that the camera does a 10-second
countdown. It is best to let this countdown

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:12.610
finish before your action begins. Also be
sure to leave plenty of time AFTER your action

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:19.610
ends. These steps are helpful for the post-production
process.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.769
If you are shooting handheld video, it is
best to have a firm grip on the camera. Not

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:29.910
just for safety reasons, but to also get the
steadiest shot possible.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:34.500
Put your right hand through the adjustable
handstrap and use the left hand for support.

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.129
This also allows you to have easy access to
the record button, as well as the zoom toggle

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:45.129
switch. The zoom toggle switch is pressure
sensitive, to allow you to do slow or fast

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.260
zoom shots.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.019
W means "WIDE" and T means "TELEPHOTO."

00:02:53.019 --> 00:02:58.440
To get as steady a shot as possible, keep
your arms tucked-in close to the body,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.930
and whenever possible, keep
the camera zoomed out all the way.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.790
This camera has a 10-times optical zoom, which
means when you zoom-in onto a subject,

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:13.080
your body motion is amplified 10-times. This camera's steadyshot

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.709
function has been turned on, and reduces SOME
of the shake.

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.459
If you are doing a handheld pan shot, start
with your body in an awkward position, and

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:28.459
finish in a stable stance.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.030
First loosen the tilt knob of the tripod to
allow you to tilt the handle up, and have

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:40.030
access to the legs. Pull the legs out, so
that you can stand it firmly on the ground.

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:46.150
On each leg, release the top locking mechanism,
and pull out the legs individually.

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.709
If you need more height, then you can do the
second stage of the legs.

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.870
You can release the column lock to extend
it even further.

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.090
If you still need more height, you'll have
find something even higher.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.299
To mount the camera on the tripod, you will
need the quick-release plate. Pull the release

00:04:01.299 --> 00:04:05.620
mechanism for the plate, and mount the plate
on the bottom of the camera by lining up the

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:10.110
black pin with the smaller hole in the camera,
and point the "LENS" notation towards

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:14.650
the lens of the camera. Then screw the plate
onto the camera.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.380
Angle the camera down on the head of the tripod,
so that the front edge of the plate is under

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.190
the overhang of the tripod. Press down, so that the locking

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:22.430
mechanism springs into place.

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:30.800
To pan the tripod, you can release the locking
nut beneath the camera. To tilt, you release

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:37.770
the locking nut on the side of the tripod.
You can leave the pan lock loose, but if you

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.540
are stepping away from the camera or want
a static shot, be sure to tighten the tilt lock!

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:48.410
When you are carrying the tripod, please carry
it by one of the legs like this.

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:55.410
DO NOT carry it by the handle, since it could
do damage to the tripod.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.440
For most cameras, the onboard microphone is
not the best option to collect good audio.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.910
You will need some more gear to get better
sound: an external microphone,

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:10.020
an XLR to 1/8-inch cable, and
some headphones.

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:15.210
Connect the microphone to the audio cable,
also known as an XLR. Make sure the microphone

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.080
clicks into place.

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.110
For safety reasons, loop the other end of
the cable around the handle, and then plug

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.130
the 1/8" connector into the "Mic" input,
located under a plastic covering on the right

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.170
side of the camera.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:33.090
To monitor the audio, wrap your headphone
cable around the handle and plug the 1/8"

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.570
connector into the "AV/headphones" jack.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:41.460
If you are hearing a buzzing noise, You just need to adjust a setting in the menu,

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.030
to be able to monitor audio with your headphones.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:53.030
Use the "MENU SETTINGS" guide, included
in the camera kit, to navigate you to this option.

00:05:55.880 --> 00:06:00.850
In order to make sure your tape and footage
are okay, you will want to play back the tape.

00:06:00.850 --> 00:06:04.780
Set the camera into the PLAY mode and then
use the buttons on the front of the LCD panel

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:11.780
to rewind the tape. Hit the play icon and
see if your footage is okay. Again, if you

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.750
are hearing that buzzing noise, it is just
a setting in the menu.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:24.830
