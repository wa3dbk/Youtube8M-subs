00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:03.520
My name is Randy R.C.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.120
Connor, choreographer to the stars.

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:10.870
I've worked with Britney Spears, P. Diddy
Combs, Prince, Mary J. Blige, Janet Jackson,

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:11.870
Jay-Z.

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:16.049
We're gonna just break down some moves, that
you can use at the club, at the parties, at

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:21.060
home, in your bathroom -- just have fun guys,
so let's get started.

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.440
C'mon!

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.670
The first thing, I think, with getting into
hip-hop choreography is first and foremost,

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:28.960
is to believe in yourself.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.320
Then after that, I would say, start working
on your materials.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.690
Start developing your material.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.730
Start working.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.460
Start training yourself.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:44.940
You know, just really focus in on you and
your ability, your style and your choreography.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.130
Then I would suggest that you take classes
- you start going into environments where

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:55.430
there's other dancers and choreographers who
are actively engaged in the business.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:58.010
There's quite a few places, just do your research.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.150
Whatever city you're in, just try to surround
yourself with, with that type of energy and

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:04.150
environment.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.469
Stay focused, and just believe in yourself.

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:11.770
Keep striving, keep working on your material,
and just never stop.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.709
Put yourself out there, and, you know, if
there's any local artists in town, you know,

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:21.399
sometimes you gotta do what's called 'promotional
gigs'.

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:25.009
In my day and time, you know, we did a lot
of freebies, you know.

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:30.240
It wasn't as competitive as it is now, but
if there's an opportunity, just do it.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.200
It's not always about the money.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.021
Whatever opportunities that there are, whether
it's a local artist in your town, and you

00:01:36.021 --> 00:01:41.939
can start working for them, or putting together
stage shows at your local theater, community

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:47.030
or community center, whatever - just get involved,
that way you're active, you're actively pursuing

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.399
your dream, and naturally the doors will open.

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:57.829
Then I say look into trying to get your professional
pictures and resumes done, and whatever little

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:03.380
you can build on your resume, if you're a
new starter, just try to build your resume

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.849
as much as possible.

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:10.229
You know, you start out by doing extra work,
or whatever, just really expose yourself.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.300
'Cause it's a huge world out there, but everything
is done in steps, in stages.

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.880
You have to - it's protocol, you know.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.290
You have to start somewhere.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.080
So anybody can do it - I did it, and I came
from another country.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.000
So, the possibilities are endless.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.670
You just have to believe in yourself.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.500
There are quite a few agencies that deal with
dancers and choreographers.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.090
Most choreographers were dancers first, because
they have to establish themselves as choreographers.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.430
So even if you believe that you are a choreographer
and that's what you want to do, you might

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:46.350
still - if you are starting in the business,
you know, you still want to market yourself

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.340
as a dancer slash choreographer, because you
want to be open and be available for dancer

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.650
jobs, and projects, like, you know, where
you can dance and perform on stage.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.160
That would lead to a choreoraphy job.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:03.260
So there's tons of dance agencies in New York,
L.A.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.310
Most of the major cities now have agencies
that represent dancers, so you can just kind

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:16.160
of look up, you know, talent agencies, there's
backstage online.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.860
And there's a couple agencies - there's McDonald
Selznick Associates, there's the Block Agency,

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.720
there's Clear Talent Agency, there's CSD.

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.440
So there's quite a few agencies that represent
dancers and choreographers, so no matter where

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.080
you're from, you can reach out, send your
postcards, send your pictures, but always

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.540
remember that you have to have a professional
package.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.320
It's a basic headshot, professionally done
and a resume, even if your resume has nothing

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.590
on it but your e-mail and your phone number
and, you know, ""I'm training"".

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:46.820
That's good enough.
