00:00:00.056 --> 00:00:03.143
It seems like every time,
lately, that I hear the news,

00:00:03.143 --> 00:00:05.939
there's something more
about change in healthcare.

00:00:05.939 --> 00:00:08.049
Now, I believe in change
when we're talking about

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:11.508
improving processes, or
creating and implementing

00:00:11.508 --> 00:00:14.593
innovative solutions to
problems affecting patient care,

00:00:14.593 --> 00:00:17.029
and safety, but continuous change

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:18.796
can be demoralizing for people.

00:00:18.796 --> 00:00:21.448
It can be demoralizing for
RNs and other providers

00:00:21.448 --> 00:00:23.326
working in the healthcare system,

00:00:23.326 --> 00:00:26.178
and, in the end, that's not
good for patient safety.

00:00:26.864 --> 00:00:29.388
Registered nurses are
telling us about the stress

00:00:29.388 --> 00:00:31.890
caused by the current
realignment of the RN workforce

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.368
at AHS.

00:00:33.368 --> 00:00:35.331
Boy, we know that layoffs are stressful,

00:00:35.331 --> 00:00:38.248
and they introduce more
turbulence and anxiety

00:00:38.248 --> 00:00:41.015
into an already stressed
set of circumstances.

00:00:41.731 --> 00:00:44.527
Now in the bigger picture, if, truly,

00:00:44.527 --> 00:00:46.374
the goals and the outcomes

00:00:46.748 --> 00:00:49.545
really are more full-time
positions for RNs,

00:00:49.545 --> 00:00:51.893
then that will be a real
benefit to patients,

00:00:51.893 --> 00:00:54.185
in terms of continuity of care.

00:00:54.185 --> 00:00:56.586
We know that when we
create conditions like that

00:00:56.586 --> 00:01:00.617
for better continuity, RNs
do have a better opportunity

00:01:00.617 --> 00:01:03.178
to create the relationships
that are so important,

00:01:03.178 --> 00:01:05.292
especially with the
complexity that we know

00:01:05.292 --> 00:01:06.957
is in the system right now.

00:01:06.957 --> 00:01:09.647
Continuity of care also
reduces the number of handoffs

00:01:09.647 --> 00:01:12.794
between providers, which reduces
the potential for errors,

00:01:13.244 --> 00:01:16.117
but we still need part-time positions too.

00:01:16.506 --> 00:01:18.740
We know that there are
barriers to full-time

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.066
for some nurses, so we
need a better dialogue,

00:01:22.358 --> 00:01:25.462
one that talks about the better approaches

00:01:25.462 --> 00:01:27.292
to address those barriers.

00:01:27.292 --> 00:01:30.643
For example, many younger nurses
tell me that juggling work

00:01:30.643 --> 00:01:33.148
and childcare is really challenging,

00:01:33.148 --> 00:01:35.787
especially with the reality of shift work.

00:01:35.787 --> 00:01:38.885
We need to shift the dialogue
to solutions to those barriers

00:01:38.885 --> 00:01:42.365
that nurses face, rather than
polarizing us on the question

00:01:42.365 --> 00:01:44.162
of full-time versus part-time,

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:47.826
but what really concerns
me is the possibility

00:01:47.826 --> 00:01:50.962
that RN positions will,
or are being eliminated,

00:01:50.962 --> 00:01:54.644
or substituted, with positions
for less-qualified providers.

00:01:55.014 --> 00:01:58.462
Of course, RNs know that we
need collaborative teams,

00:01:58.462 --> 00:02:01.460
with team members doing the
right things to meet the needs

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.876
of the particular population cared for,

00:02:03.876 --> 00:02:05.735
but what we can't lose sight of

00:02:05.735 --> 00:02:09.185
is the important contribution
that RN care makes.

00:02:09.433 --> 00:02:12.176
RNs wrapping together
that complicated care

00:02:12.176 --> 00:02:15.721
into a good care plan, and
having sufficient numbers

00:02:15.721 --> 00:02:18.513
for the vigilance that will
protect patient safety,

00:02:18.513 --> 00:02:20.708
and promote excellence of care,

00:02:20.708 --> 00:02:23.249
that's what the people of
Alberta are entitled to,

00:02:23.249 --> 00:02:25.871
the best quality of care,
and we need to make sure

00:02:25.871 --> 00:02:29.314
that there are enough RNs
in the skill mix to do that.

00:02:29.996 --> 00:02:31.918
I'd like to conclude with
a little bit of discussion

00:02:31.918 --> 00:02:33.835
about the topic of change.

00:02:33.835 --> 00:02:36.873
You and I both know that changes
are needed in healthcare.

00:02:36.873 --> 00:02:39.390
The status quo certainly has its problems,

00:02:39.746 --> 00:02:42.158
and there's now research
that supports what you and I,

00:02:42.158 --> 00:02:43.953
and most of us, have always known,

00:02:43.953 --> 00:02:47.298
the people doing the work,
you, are the best people

00:02:47.298 --> 00:02:50.602
to identify problems and to
find effective solutions.

00:02:50.602 --> 00:02:52.659
We know that when frontline
workers don't think

00:02:52.659 --> 00:02:54.926
they have the power to
change things for the better,

00:02:54.926 --> 00:02:57.507
they become less attentive
and less vigilant.

00:02:57.507 --> 00:02:59.603
That's not good for patient safety.

00:02:59.603 --> 00:03:01.690
The good news is that an empowered,

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.771
engaged nursing workforce,
that owns the issues

00:03:04.771 --> 00:03:08.216
in their own workplaces, can
develop effective solutions

00:03:08.216 --> 00:03:10.250
if they're empowered to do so.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.003
The change we really need is
to empower frontline teams,

00:03:14.003 --> 00:03:16.726
registered nurses, and
all other team members.

00:03:16.726 --> 00:03:18.984
We have to learn to think like teams

00:03:18.984 --> 00:03:21.800
and leverage the
contribution of each member.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.211
Even when staff have really
good ideas about what to do,

00:03:25.594 --> 00:03:27.375
right now, they're feeling
as though, perhaps,

00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:29.600
they're not heard or given a chance

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.031
to implement those ideas.

00:03:31.519 --> 00:03:34.262
A culture of top-down
directives sure won't get us

00:03:34.262 --> 00:03:35.776
where we need to go,

00:03:35.776 --> 00:03:37.818
so leaders have to change too.

00:03:37.818 --> 00:03:40.561
They have to be willing to
adopt a more supportive role,

00:03:40.561 --> 00:03:43.379
enabling frontline providers to identify

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:46.056
and take ownership of
issues and solutions.

00:03:46.056 --> 00:03:48.458
That's not the same as
buying into a solution

00:03:48.458 --> 00:03:50.962
that's been developed by somebody else.

00:03:50.962 --> 00:03:52.251
Don't you think it would
be exciting to work

00:03:52.251 --> 00:03:53.826
in a system like that,

00:03:53.826 --> 00:03:56.211
a system that empowers frontline workers?

00:03:56.212 --> 00:03:58.132
You could really be
engaged in the decisions

00:03:58.132 --> 00:04:00.739
affecting the work you do, and we know

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:03.012
that engaged, frontline care providers

00:04:03.012 --> 00:04:04.568
improve patient safety.

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:08.474
Your engagement really matters,
to you and your patients.

00:04:08.474 --> 00:04:10.646
That's the kind of change I support,

00:04:10.646 --> 00:04:13.721
change that empowers RNs to
really make a difference,

00:04:14.183 --> 00:04:17.574
so we're speaking to employers
about that kind of change.

00:04:17.574 --> 00:04:20.774
We're also speaking to them
about better ways to measure

00:04:20.774 --> 00:04:22.598
and better ways to evaluate.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.327
As your president, I'm looking
forward to this dialogue

00:04:26.327 --> 00:04:28.904
and to continuing to
advocate for decisions

00:04:28.904 --> 00:04:32.115
that empower all of us, the RN workforce.

00:04:32.115 --> 00:04:33.898
I'd really like to hear from you,

00:04:33.898 --> 00:04:36.648
so if you could comment on
this blog, or send me an email,

00:04:36.648 --> 00:04:38.576
whatever works for you, tell me,

00:04:38.576 --> 00:04:40.252
what's going on in your workplace?

00:04:40.252 --> 00:04:42.280
Are there opportunities for input?

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:43.851
What are some of the ways
that we could address

00:04:43.851 --> 00:04:46.287
the barriers to full-time work for RNs?

00:04:46.547 --> 00:04:48.142
I'd like to hear your ideas.

00:04:48.142 --> 00:04:49.892
I'd like to hear your concerns,

00:04:49.892 --> 00:04:52.796
and I'd like to hear your
suggestions for solutions.

00:04:52.796 --> 00:04:54.881
I'm committed to passing those along

00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:56.876
and we have a lot to learn, together,

00:04:56.876 --> 00:04:58.871
to really improve healthcare.

00:04:58.871 --> 00:04:59.880
Thanks.
