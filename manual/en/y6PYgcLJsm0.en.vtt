00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.160
Along with your custom receiver hitch for
the Dodge Charger you will also need a wiring

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:02.160
connector when pulling a trailer.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:03.160
We offer a custom wiring harness that requires
no cutting or splicing and will provide a

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:04.160
flat four pole connector.

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.160
This will power the trailers running lights,
brake lights and turn signals allowing you

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.160
to safely and legally tow your toys, boat
and trailer.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.160
You may also want this to power lights on
a cargo trailer or to use a light up receiver

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.160
hitch cover.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.160
Today we are going to show you part number
118404 which is the T-One Vehicle Wiring Harness

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.160
with 4 Pole Trailer Connector.

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:11.160
It will be installed on a 2007 Dodge Charger
RT.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:12.160
To begin our install what we have to do is
obviously get into the trunk area.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:13.160
I am going take off these wing nuts, one on
each side.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.900
Pull back the cover until we can get to our
wiring covers.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:21.090
The T-One connector will actually plug in
between the light back here and the bar harness

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:22.090
here.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.090
What we need to do is push in this red tab
here then we slide our connector apart.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:30.030
Now we will go ahead and slip on our new connector,
it fits just like the old one.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.990
For our ground we will attach it to this inside
body part here.

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:40.080
Then worry about the screw pointing out as
opposed to the steel right here hitting the

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.080
light.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.160
So we will go ahead and run our screw in this
nice open spot here.

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:52.520
Next we will take our green wire and slide
it behind the panel here onto the other side.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:01:00.559
Then basically we are going to repeat what
we did on the passenger 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:21.610
side 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:22.610
on side.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:02:07.290
Now we will start taking this 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:27.660
side apart.
