00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:02.620
Alright, so I have a surplus
of raspberries here.

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.950
I have eaten just about
as much as I can,

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.960
so I want to preserve those
for the next season,

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.900
so I am gonna use
a canning method here.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:11.129
So, I am gonna show you
a general Canning: 101,

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:13.190
if you will.
The first thing I do is get all

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.530
my mise en place together;
which means, basically,

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.310
everything I need to do
to complete the job right here.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.420
So, what I have got
to start out with is

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:22.840
I got my lids here and
I have got them sitting in

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.140
some warm water,
and I have got it in

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.849
the warm water because
there is a little rubber seal here

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.749
which you need to activate
and get nice and warm

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:33.930
so it makes a nice seal
on the top of your jar.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.600
I have also got my rings
ready to go.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.160
I have got a batch of
raspberries here.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.960
And whatever your recipe is,
there are different recipes out there

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.989
that use different types of pectins.
Some allow you to use no sugar,

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:49.840
this one here I am using
a little bit of sugar.

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.859
We are gonna bring this up
to a boil and then add

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:53.809
our pectin, and then
continue on from there.

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:56.750
Alright, so I have got some jars
in some very hot water.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:58.829
We have washed them,
and then we put them

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.601
in some hot water
for at least 10 minutes.

00:01:00.601 --> 00:01:03.620
We want to make sure that
they are nice and hot and sterile,

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.750
so that when we go to add
the hot liquid into there,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.409
one, they do not break,
and then, but also we keep

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:11.000
that hot change so when I
put it back inside here,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.900
I keep everything nice
and hot throughout that

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.590
whole process.
So I have got my jars here.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.610
And then I have got a couple
different tools here.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.100
This one here I use to grab
all my hot jars out of there,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.509
`cause I do not want to
burn my fingers.

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:26.369
That is a good, useful tool.
And this one right here has

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.070
got a little bit of a magnet
at the end of a stick here

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.250
which helps me to take
my lids off of here and place them

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.899
directly on top of my jars
after they are filled.

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:38.010
Alright, if your recipe,
like this one does,

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.549
is raspberry jam,
uses liquid pectin,

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.820
we are gonna add that to
the boiling sugar and raspberries.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.090
We are gonna make sure
we get all of that out of here.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.829
So squeeze it all out.
And then what you«re gonna do

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.140
is you are gonna have that boil hard
for about one minute.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.740
That activates the pectin
and ensures that it is gonna

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.220
gel up nice in the end.
So now that my jam is boiled

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.939
for that full minute afterwards,
I am gonna take this off

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:09.120
and pour it into a container
that can easily fill my jars.

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.780
You know, at this point,
if you wanted a more refined jam

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.690
over there, you would skim off
the foam off the top.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.640
But I remember Grandma,
she used to pour it right in there

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:19.920
and the kids, we all fought over
the little bit of foam

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.750
in each one of the jam jars.
So, I like to leave that on there.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.550
So now what you do
is you are gonna take your jars

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.160
a couple at a time and
we are gonna fill those.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.600
So one tool that you can use,
you got a little funnel here

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.180
which fits on the inside.
Or a nice container like this

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.580
which gets all of my jam
filled all the way up

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.660
to a quarter inch
of headspace.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.700
That means a quarter inch
up from the top,

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.980
and that is very important.
What that does is that builds

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.870
the correct amount of pressure
in there so when we put our lids

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.510
on there and we boil it off,
it is gonna make a nice seal.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.950
So now we take our raspberry jam
which is inside,

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.100
we can take--if we got
a little bit on the edge,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.350
we can go by and wipe this off
to make sure we have a nice seal.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:07.340
And we take one lid,
put it on the top,

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.990
and all we do is
we screw this on.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.550
But I want you to do it
finger-tight.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.360
Do not crank them down,
you are gonna have issues later

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.550
by pulling them off.
So, each one of these

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:20.491
go inside your canner.
Right in the inside.

00:03:20.491 --> 00:03:23.420
I will do another one for ya.
And then we are gonna boil

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.650
this particular recipe
for 10 minutes.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:29.870
So whatever your recipe says,
that is how long you are gonna boil it.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.180
That makes sure that
each one of these gets done,

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.380
pressurized on the inside,
and we are safe to open it up

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.850
six months later
in the wintertime.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.120
Alright, 10 minutes
has gone by.

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:46.210
Last thing I need to do
is take these guys out.

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:49.510
So, we lift the jars up.
It has a nice, convenient

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.330
handle on the side.
And then take your tool here

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.430
and grab those jars
and pull `em out.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.090
And what I am looking for
is these to come out

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:01.200
and they are gonna sit on
my counter and cool down.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.260
You are not gonna put `em in the fridge;
we do not need to, we canned them.

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.450
You are gonna leave `em out here,
but what you are gonna watch for

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.820
once we get them all out is this
little indentation on the top of this.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:12.750
And you want this to
fall down and depress,

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:15.230
and you can even hear
a little noise go off.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.350
That means that that pressure is
dropping in the center

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.280
and that is sealing that top
of that can on there.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.280
Then after that what I want you
to do is take these screw tops off.

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.970
You are gonna store it
without the screw tops.

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.700
There goes another one.
It is gonna happen

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:32.030
within 24 hours,
as long as they all go down,

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.850
we are fine to keep `em in storage
until we want 'em.

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:37.630
I have got a lot of
different fruits here.

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.500
I can do peaches.
I am looking forward to that.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.900
Some blackberries
and some strawberries.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.970
All you are gonna need is
a couple of these different items

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:46.910
and we sell a kit here with
all those different tools in it,

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:49.321
and another one to get
is this Blue Book.

00:04:49.321 --> 00:04:53.350
Ball¨ makes a Blue Book and
it has got all your different recipes,

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.720
very detailed on the whole process.
I am looking forward

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:57.460
to the whole season.
