00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.680
So I finally got around to watching the new
Agent Carter show, and I’ve got some thoughts

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:09.680
on it.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.420
And also by “new Agent Carter show” I
do realize that I’m about 3 months late

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.620
on this review, but oh well, here I am.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.000
Also, since the show has been out for about
3 months, I’m just gonna be talking spoilers

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and everything.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.759
So yeah, let’s do it.

00:00:23.759 --> 00:00:30.850
*clip*
Now, first things first, I want to preface

00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:32.829
this video by saying that I love the first
Captain America movie.

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:36.301
I know, I know, it has a lot of flaws, but
I enjoy it every time I watch it.

00:00:36.301 --> 00:00:39.800
And the Agent Carter one-shot was really cool
and gave us a quick look at what this character

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.800
was capable of.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.580
Evidently, I was not the only one who enjoyed
both of these things because Marvel decided

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.530
to make a TV show dedicated to the character.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:46.910
And it’s a pretty great show.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.520
First of all, something that I liked with
this show is that it picked up right after

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.520
the First Avenger ended.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.570
We see how Peggy Carter is adjusting to life
after her boyfriend killed himself to save

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.570
the world.

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.741
And Agent Carter is a really good character,
she was one of the best parts of the First

00:00:57.741 --> 00:00:58.741
Avenger.

00:00:58.741 --> 00:01:01.920
Anyway, she’s working with the SSR, which
is basically an early version of SHIELD.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:05.640
And we see how she is underestimated by everyone
since she’s a woman in 1946.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.360
And that is one of the big aspects of the
show, the sexism of the time and how she has

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.360
to prove everyone wrong.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.560
And that’s an interesting thing to play
on, but I think it was touched on a bit too

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.560
much.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.750
Also, her co-workers, the ones that are always
asking her to get them coffee or whatever,

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.360
they weren’t that interesting or memorable.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.940
There’s the one that’s kind of the love
interest, there’s the boss, and then there

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.060
are the others.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.630
They don’t think she can do anything because
she’s a woman, but then she proves them

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.920
wrong, and that was more or less their character
arcs.

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.050
Besides the boss, his character arc also included...uh...exploding.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.640
But besides those guys, the other supporting
characters are really great.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:38.010
We get to see the origins of Jarvis in Edwin
Jarvis, Howard Stark’s butler.

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:42.380
He was a fun and very sophisticated character,
and every time he was on screen I was interested.

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.260
Even though, and I’m not even joking, when
he first came on, I was like, “How can Benedict

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:48.340
Cumberbatch be both Doctor Strange and Jarvis?”

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.990
Yeah, turns out it isn’t Cumberbatch, but
the resemblance is uncanny.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.659
Howard Stark is also really fun even though
he isn’t in the show that much.

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:58.030
You can see where Tony Stark got his attitude
from, and you think while watching it this

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.979
is what Tony Stark would have been like in
the 40s.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.380
Speaking of which, for the most part I really
liked the style of the show, and by that I

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.530
mean the 40s setting.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.450
The music, the colors, it was cool.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.899
Although, some parts of the show did seem
a little goofy and cartoony, but those were

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:10.970
only a couple of scenes.

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:12.170
Other things to touch on: the action.

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.410
The action is good, but I wasn’t that impressed
with it.

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.010
However, I think that might be because I recently
watched Daredevil, in which the action is

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:20.730
incredible, so by comparison this is quite
a step down.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.040
But if I’m just looking at it as a stand
alone thing, then the action is pretty good.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.840
Also, on that Daredevil comparison, this feels
a lot more like a Marvel Cinematic Universe

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.060
thing than Daredevil or even Agents of SHIELD.

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.690
I’m not saying that makes it better, but
just tone and style wise, this fits in a lot

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.690
better with the universe.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:38.400
It’s very fun, there’s lots of humor,
there are a lot of bright colors and subtle

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.480
one liners, stuff like that.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.590
I also wanna mention, one of the show’s
biggest positives is that it isn’t drawn

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:43.590
out at all.

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.830
The entire first season is only 8 episodes,
which is pretty easy to swallow and doesn’t

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.099
mean they have to have time filler episodes.

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:51.930
I didn’t feel like the episodes were getting
repetitive at all, unlike the first season

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:52.930
of other shows.

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:54.959
The final thing I want to mention are the
easter eggs.

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.730
And by that I really mean the two cameo-ish
appearances.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:02:59.030
Firstly, the Howling Commandos.

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:01.970
It was great to see them back in action, and
it was great that they got all of the same

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.349
actors that they had in the movie.

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:04.830
Secondly, the Black Widow training camp.

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.129
In one episode they find this facility where
young girls are being taught to fight and

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.129
kill.

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:10.129
I thought this was really awesome because
little known fact about me, I love watching

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.129
little children snapping each other’s necks.

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:12.129
Not really, but it was great to see where
the deadly assassin that we see in the movies

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:13.129
came from.

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:15.670
I’ve heard a lot of people praising Age
of Ultron for showing more or Black Widow’s

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.990
past, and they did a fine job, but if you
really want to get into what her past was

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.750
like, I highly advise checking out this show.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.459
So overall, this show is a lot of fun.

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.660
It’s not Breaking Bad or Game of Thrones
or House of Cards, you’re not gonna get

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.850
extremely invested or have to dive into dozens
of hours of content that you can’t stop

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:29.850
watching.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.070
It’s a fun action adventure with a strong
female protagonist, good supporting characters,

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.950
good action, and a cool 40s setting.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.660
In the end, I give it a 9/10 and I’d highly
recommend it, especially if you enjoyed the

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.660
First Avenger.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.660
So those are my thoughts on Agent Carter.

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:41.660
I know it was a bit of a short video this
week, but I’ve been kind of busy lately

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.660
and also I just wanted to get my basic thoughts
out on something I think you should check

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.660
out.

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.660
Anyway, what do you think of the show?

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.660
And also, I’m interested to know, how do
you think it compares to other superhero shows:

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.660
Arrow, Gotham, Agents of SHIELD, Daredevil.

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.610
