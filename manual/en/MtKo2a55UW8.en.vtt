00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:06.660
(phone rings)

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:09.610
Yo!

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.400
Hey you got that?

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.760
Yeah, I got you, I'm on my way.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.220
Keep it sustainable, Keep it sustainable

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.310
Keep it sustainable, Keep it sustainable

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.580
Keep it Sustainable, Keep it sustainable

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.660
Keep it sustainable, Keep it sustainable

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.800
Lower carbon footprints, recycle more

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:54.280
take care of the earth,  'cause the world is yours. 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.180
Lower carbon footprints, recycle more

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:01.180
Take care of the earth, 'cause the world is yours. 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.240
Take care of this the earth, 'cause the world is yours.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:09.840
Make a change in this world with me. 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.740
Live a sustainable lifestyle make your world different

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.700
See you can change it, maintain it

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.360
It's your chance to just take it

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:17.880
No waitin', just do it.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:22.240
You will be amazed with what little things can do to the world.

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.360
Make it better for the youth, for the little boys and girls

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.260
Growing up not knowing what nature is

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.200
Come together make our world a better place to live

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.520
The apocalypse prophesied by 2Pac's lips

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.520
We here to prevent this event, reduce our prints

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.780
Take your carbon foot shoe sizes two sizes down

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.130
Put 'em in a new hybrid and ride around

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.350
I'm a clown?  Why you rashin'?  I'm talkin' 'bout rations.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.300
Them new Jordan's isn't important, even by fractional standards

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.060
And it's sad that we call recycling ghetto

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.180
Time to green up.  Ready, set, go. 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:58.620
Oh, hey Sol

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.700
What's up Tabitha?

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.955
Hey, what are you doing?

00:02:00.955 --> 00:02:04.375
Nothin', just chillin about to head home.  I've been skating all day. 

00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:05.695
Oh you want a water bottle?

00:02:05.695 --> 00:02:08.675
Nah I'm alright, I've got my reusable water bottle right here.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:10.240
I keep it sustainable.

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.960
"Keep it sustainable" repeating

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.160
Lower carbon footprints, recycle more

00:02:19.252 --> 00:02:22.452
Take care of the earth, 'cause the world is yours

00:02:22.795 --> 00:02:25.435
Lower carbon footprints, recycle more

00:02:25.435 --> 00:02:28.595
Take care of the earth, cause the world is yours. 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:35.040
Take care of the earth, 'cause the world is yours.

00:02:35.615 --> 00:02:37.935
Step one, let me tell you what to do.

00:02:37.935 --> 00:02:41.035
Get the home energy assessment, no cost to you.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.160
Now let's move to step two

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.500
Shut off your lights whenever they not in use.  Don't you think that'd be bright?

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.120
Right?  That sounds good to me.

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:53.355
As we walk through this beat let's hop to step three. 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.340
You don't even need to use all that heat to be clean.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.420
Cold water can make your bills go decrease

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:02.460
Step four: Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. 

00:03:02.995 --> 00:03:06.035
Step five- check your tires before you drive.

00:03:06.057 --> 00:03:09.177
Use the speed limit, that will also help lives.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.020
Now step six, you down even have to be homegrown

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.400
But you can help your city out and start buying local. 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.000
Now step seven, that should be an easy tactic.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.760
Let everybody know about the energy challenge.            Let everybody know about that energy... challenge.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:26.620
Hi, how's it going?

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.700
Going well. 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.200
Good.  Can I get some carrots and some scallions please?

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:32.960
Sure thing would you like a bag for those?

00:03:33.655 --> 00:03:37.895
Um no, I've got a reusable one right here.  I keep it sustainable. 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:49.020
(overlapping lyrics)

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:52.257
Now let me tell you about a story, I could tell you 'bout a life dog

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.240
That isn't too far and it isn't too bright dog.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:57.700
We used to visit zoos and now it's Zoo York.

00:03:57.975 --> 00:04:01.175
Cold steel, gold wheels, manufactured hearts. 

00:04:01.175 --> 00:04:04.138
When it rains it pours, then floods and storms

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:07.477
Only way you coming up is elevator floors

00:04:07.477 --> 00:04:10.517
Better bright and clean, I've seen the unseen

00:04:10.517 --> 00:04:13.177
'Cause Martin didn't have a nightmare, he had a dream. 

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.820
Replace oil with stream, turn your footprints green

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.800
No need for a manual, dog.  Just a man or two

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.030
Now tell me whatcha tell me whatcha tell me whatcha plan to do

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.115
tell me whatcha tell me whatcha tell me whatcha plan to do!

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:31.940
Hey Solo, how are you?

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:32.940
Good

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:34.300
Good, you have the herbs?

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.860
Yea I got it

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.680
K Good, come on inside. 

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.660
Well I just got home from work, so I'll talk to you later. Alright peace.   

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:56.020
Ashley?

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.900
Ashley?

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.220
Ashley?  What are you guys up to out here?

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:07.060
Hi mom.  It's supposed to be a surprise.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.100
I know you like cooking with fresh herbs and vegetables so we are making you a deck garden

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:14.280
Aww you guys are the best!  Thank you so much!

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:18.060
Well...... we were hoping for something in return!

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:25.900
This food is bomb!

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.660
Mmmm Hmmm

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.760
I never knw keeping it sustainable could be this delicious!

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.120
I'm going to keep on doing my part, what do you plan to do to keep it sustainable?

00:05:35.454 --> 00:05:37.214
Tell me what you plan to do?
