00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.130
From the guy who came “Straight Outta Compton”

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.290
and ended up in “Are We There Yet?”

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.900
Comes the most popular black Friday besides
Black Friday

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.410
and Rebecca Black’s Friday

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:21.080
Friday.

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.580
Before the release of Ride Along,

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.759
lace up your Chucks for another mid-90's classic
you can’t stop quoting...

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:27.759
“Daaaaaaamn!”

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:29.100
“You got knocked the f*ck out!”

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.470
"My neck!

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:31.840
My back!

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:35.270
My neck and my back!"

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:36.649
“Bye Felicia."

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.070
that has no actual plot whatsoever...

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.129
"Anything else happening?"

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.129
"Nope"

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:45.359
Experience a movie without a single guy person
in the cast.

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.440
It’s kinda like a reverse Lord of the Rings.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.920
Meet man-child Craig.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.510
When he’s fired for stealing from work

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:54.100
And his friend Smokey gets caught

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.559
They’ll make things right by stealing money
this guy stole from someone else...

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.430
It’s kinda Robin Hood if he stole from the
poor and gave to a guy named “Big Worm”

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:05.780
"Sup Big Worm?"

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.229
Experience a film that’s like a Spike Lee
joint but with fewer morals

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.040
and more actual joints.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.720
Prepare to learn more practical lessons, like:

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.720
Get high

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.590
"I'mma get you high today."

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.800
Fight dirty.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.410
And don’t get Catfished.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:26.930
"Oooooooh, what's up?"

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.610
"God d*mn!"

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.630
But most importantly...get high.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:33.250
“Ain’t nothing wrong with smoking weed.”

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:34.520
"Put it in your mouth!"

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.130
Watch Ice Cube pave the way for Ludacris,
50 Cent, and LL Cool J as the first good rapper

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.070
to suck at acting.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.930
"Anyway... what you doing up so early?"

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.630
And watch Chris Tucker in the role that launched
him into Rush Hour stardom..,

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:53.200
and post-Rush Hour obscurity.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.170
Seriously what the hell happened to Chris
Tucker?

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.450
Get ready to laugh at a film that would be
super offensive if it were

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.390
written by a white guy,

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:02.390
Featuring:

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.390
Asian stereotypes!

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.940
Latino stereotypes!

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.220
And, of course, black stereotypes!

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.620
"I wanna eat some of them chitlin.

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:15.790
I love pig feet!"

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.810
You want some Kool-Aid?"

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:18.430
"Man you know I want some Kool-Aid!"

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.499
But you don’t have to be from the hood to
love Friday, because this comedy speaks the

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:24.099
universal language of toilet humor.

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:25.099
"Hey!

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.099
Smokey back here takin' a sh*t!"

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:32.980
"Take a look at that paper over there on the
counter."

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.659
So if you love weed,

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:38.540
90’s comebacks,

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:47.719
and slamming metal doors,

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:49.920
then thank God it’s Friday...

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.450
And not the terrible sequels.

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.430
Seriously, those are like, Madea bad...

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:55.430
"Hallelujah!

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.430
Thank God!"

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.800
"You gotta let me go, haha!"

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.680
Wait I take it back!

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.739
Noooooo!

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:02.739
Starring...

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:03.739
Tall Kevin Hart

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:04.769
Left Eye Lopes

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:06.719
Sabretooth

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:07.810
Crackhead Bob

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.739
Michael Clarke Ducnan?

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:10.779
Daaaaaaamn!

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:12.529
#2 Dad

00:03:12.529 --> 00:03:14.610
and Ice Cubed.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.989
Friday.

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:21.060
Yo, I love it when they gave an ice cube to
Ice Cube so you could watch Ice Cube pick

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:22.769
up Ice Cube’s ice cube.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.159
