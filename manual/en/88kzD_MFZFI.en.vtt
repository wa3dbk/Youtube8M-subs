00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:10.570
 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.810
 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.750
 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:20.750
Hi I'm DoggyDan full-time
professional dog trainer and behavioral

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:21.500
specialist

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:25.270
I love dogs. I work with hundreds over
the years

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:28.910
of every shape size a Jamba re as well
as that

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:34.320
often colorful owners from barking
aggressive two hours the territorial pet

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:34.780
bowls

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.900
but dog is causing grief altera drop it

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.830
away with the owners to turn a troubled
old integrate adults

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.860
set

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.600
the connection that I've got with with
dogs is is really day

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.790
I mean it's hard to actually explain it

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.110
I'm a lot of people actually believe I
was a dog in a past life

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:01.180
that's not me saying it that other
people

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.239
I think they really mean it there's not
many dogs lie down

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.479
understand the that in within a couple
of hours later I feel like I totally get

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:08.850
them

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.920
the often I feel like it's the poor dog
I am

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.050
and I feel like the dog gets me that's
the beautiful thing and I guess for dogs

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.740
it is actually

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.729
so often it's so simple dogs are pack
animals

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.400
and they instinctively through nature
follow a pack leader so

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.890
if you are the pack leader the dogs will
follow up

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.020
the secret to my success really lies in
the fact that

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.700
I've come to understand how to be

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.150
the pack leader in a way that doesn't
use any force

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.030
be a more aggression and when you do
that dole's will instinctively follow

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:48.189
you because the pack animals yes that I
was a classic example of 50 kilogram

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:51.540
Malamute who they could not walk on the
lead and been to a couple trying it

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.100
already

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.000
they'd use the force method using a
chine and it was nothing to do with the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.329
actual walk

00:01:58.329 --> 00:02:03.100
that he needed me training on the link
it was a case a win this dog's mind

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.159
inside the house many followed

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.130
and I couldn't believe it I mean there's
no force involved this beautiful dog

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.850
are you know I really felt like I
connected with them at us on a spiritual

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.570
level

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.049
when you connect with the 50 kilogram
wall

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:22.319
look-alike a massive malama any touches
nose with you you lookin right in the

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.720
eyes

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.810
and you know that he said yes all

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.349
following when we understand what they
really need to them they

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.910
transform and will stop following as
without all this need for clickers and

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:34.870
treats and

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.400
you know gadgets &amp; widgets and throwing
changing going

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.440
growling at the dog spice they're
actually incredibly loving creatures

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.519
such beautiful animals crisis things
every die

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:51.099
I hear owners go out every die every
dollar I work with and it's a people

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:53.819
think it's something I don't want to
just keep taking home going well

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.349
explain to wipe saying guess what
happened like

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:02.950
that's what we did when you connect with
an animal that size an alumni chapter

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.920
beautiful thing this is million

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.519
she's roderick soccer in the tournament
will be held

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:16.590
as you can see I was just bad police
arrest man

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.260
either time to have a chat with their
owners and make a plan

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.330
so the key to everything is making sure

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.950
that the little million understands that
you're in charge your order

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:31.940
the decision-makers and after an hour or
so I love working with million the girls

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:33.970

ground by the front door
