00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:03.970
My name is Brandon Sarkis on behalf of Expert
Village. Today I am going to show you how

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.230
to make sugar cookies. So now we are going
to roll them out and you will see we have

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:14.679
a lot less dough than I did a moment ago.
This is only about a quarter of my dough.

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:19.439
I put half in the refrigerator and I am going
to roll out for a different set of cookies,

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.939
so you want to work with a manageable amount
of dough every time. So this is a pretty manageable

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.079
amount. So I take my rolling pin, my cutting
board and I also cleaned up my cutting board

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:34.239
a little bit and I am going to start in the
middle and work my way outward. Why are the

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:43.149
cookies sticking to my Teflon rolling pin?
Why is my cutting board moving around so much?

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:53.070
Maybe that is the question I should be asking.
Whoa, whoa now. I demand a refund. I don't

00:00:53.070 --> 00:01:02.019
need to worry. I'll just keep moving. All
right so we want to make sure we get a nice

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:13.570
uniformed thickness here. Uh oh, it likes
me, it really likes me. What is happening

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:26.860
is my dough got a little bit too warm which
is why it is acting out. Bad dough. All right

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:38.400
so very very lightly.
I am making very small quantity. If you were

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:46.770
making regular small sugar cookies with this,
you could just actually take a piece of dough

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:55.280
and roll it into balls and put the balls in
a sheet pan like this and I'll do a couple

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:07.980
like this or you can cut them in nice neat
shapes. You can come over here and grab a

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:15.030
cookie cutter.
You want to make sure they are even thickness

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.069
when you are doing the cookie cutter. Just
apply the cookie cutter as such. We'll get

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:29.849
a couple like this and this recipe doesn't
call for you to refrigerate the dough at all.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:35.439
Some sugar cookies will ask you to refrigerate
the dough before baking it. These don't. This

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:41.840
recipes does spread out a whole lot so bear
that in mind when putting on pan. So with

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.060
that in mind, let's put these on a pan and
throw them in the oven.
