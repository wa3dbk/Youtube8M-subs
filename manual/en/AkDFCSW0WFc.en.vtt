Acrylic plastic, useful, sometimes difficult,
but we're going to talk about cutting it.

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:18.120
I'm Robert Markey and we're going to talk
about how to cut acrylic plastic. Basically,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:26.740
the idea is when you cut this you need something
pretty fine. We could use a hand saw and we

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:38.199
want to use a fine tooth handsaw with that.
Basically, it's kind of like cutting wood

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:49.629
only

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:59.460
it's cutting plastic. The finer the tooth
you have the better, the nicer the cut. If

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:42.340
we want to use our scroll saw we use the very
fine blade. Again. There we have it. Using

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:50.189
this tends to melt it a little bit as you
can see. If you want to cut it with a skill

00:01:50.189 --> 00:02:03.130
saw or a table saw, again you want to use
the fine tooth blade.

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.969
When you're done cutting it you usually going
to sand, usually get a burr on the bottom

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:15.600
of it from the saw blade going through that
you're going to have to scrape off. I'm Robert

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.930
Markey and we've been cutting acrylic plastic.
