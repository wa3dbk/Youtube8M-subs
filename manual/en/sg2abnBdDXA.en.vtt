00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Toshinaga-kun 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:16.000
The Declaration of Independence

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:25.000
I watched the U.S.Presidential Inaguration.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
President Obama said during his campaign

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.000
"Change!"

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
"Yes, We Can!"

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
A typo on a stamp was a mistake,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
because there's no such country.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
What if I created Tateyama Union...

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000
it's no longer a mistake!

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:53.000
I hereby declare the independence of Tateyama Union!

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
The right is the national flag.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The left flag shows where TU is.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Let me introduce the cabinet members.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Me is the President.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
The First Lady Hyaku-man-goku-chan.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
She has a bodyguard.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Now you see the Cabinet members.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Let me talk about Union's vision.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Our vision is "Akkarism."

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.000
"Akkari" means peace of mind in Japanese.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Akkarism is a concept that 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
both beautiful nature and wonderful jobs are indispensable 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
for our pleasant life.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
In my country, 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
you can see splendid mountains from beautiful ocean.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
On the other hand,

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.000
we have maintained craftmanship 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
for hundreds years.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Thus, we have both beautiful mountains and pleasant jobs.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.000
This is very "akkari."

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Please come to Tateyama

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and see how akkari we are. 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Thank you very much for your attention.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:53.000
I am looking forward to seeing you soon.
