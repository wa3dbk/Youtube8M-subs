00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.140
Okay everyone, it is good to see you today,
Guido, Meido, Beido, and Deido.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.820
We need to get ready for our Christmas concert.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.970
I will have each one of you play in the middle
to see if you know the instrument-a.

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:31.229
(accordion)
Stop, stop, stop!

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:33.140
There is no easy way to put it.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.700
Deido, that was not good!

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.200
Next!
(drumming)

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.950
Stop, stop, stop.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:54.630
Meido, do you know how to keep the beat?

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:58.820
Well, let's keep moving.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.220
Next!
(tuba)

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:12.319
Stop, stop, stop!

00:01:12.319 --> 00:01:17.460
Beido, that sounded worse than the tido.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.799
You need a lot of practice before our concert.

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:25.259
Next!

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.630
Guido, maybe your piano playing can help us
out.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:42.520
(piano played badly)
Stop, stop, stop, stop.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.409
Guido, that was not very good either.

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.819
Oh, we may never be ready for the concert
on time.

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:53.889
Is there anybody out there who can help us?

00:01:53.889 --> 00:01:58.200
Excuse me, but maybe I can be of help.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.579
Do you know how to play?

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:27.310
(guitar played well)
Oh, maybe we will be ready.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:36.220
