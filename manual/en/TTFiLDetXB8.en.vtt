Hi I'm Antoine and I'm gonna show you how to make an airplane with the Snake Puzzle (Rubik's Twist)

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.500
So first you're gonna move this dark blue one down

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.920
and then you're gonna count 1,2,3,4...

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.620
and then this one is gonna go right

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.340
Next, you're gonna count 1,2,3,4

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.920
then this dark blue one is gonna go down

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.160
Now this white one's gonna go towards you...

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.500
Now you're gonna move this white one away from you...

00:00:59.432 --> 00:01:05.212
Now you're gonna count 1,2,3 and then this blue one is gonna go left one time...

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.360
Now this white one is gonna go left.... one time

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.360
 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.880
Now this white one is gonna go right two times

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.680
Now you're gonna move this white one

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.100
so that these two match...

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:43.409
like this...

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.860
Next you're gonna move this dark blue one up
