[Crowd noise, sound of a football being kicked]
&gt;&gt;Well, this is a place-kick study, a biomechanics

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.679
place kick study.

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.449
Not a whole lot of research has been done
in this area.

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:25.240
Kickers are asked to do, are asked to score
many points, and sometimes under very stressful

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.300
conditions.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:32.929
Mechanics for place-kicking is very important,
so we decided to partake in this type of research

00:00:32.929 --> 00:00:45.850
in hopes to help athletes and coaches and
practitioners improve their game.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.100
In this lab we have the motion analysis system.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.930
It’s a real time system, where we’re able
to track body parts in real time and digitize

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:01.720
it into a computer
So our system has an eight-camera array, and

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:10.250
each camera has a pulsating infrared lighting,
which makes it possible for the system to

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.920
track a marker through a known volume of space.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:26.969
We use 32 markers to identify joints on the
body and then four additional markers to identify

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:28.369
the ball.

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.909
&gt;&gt;Ready, go!

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:40.640
Then it’s immediately digitized into the
computer, real-time.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:47.009
And once we do that, we are able to develop
a three-dimensional skeleton model and also

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:55.119
measure a number of biomechanical factors,
including velocities, displacements and also

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:56.920
accelerations.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.130
hopefully through the years we will be able
to quantify and collect research that will

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:08.410
eventually narrow it down to certain factors
where we can actually tell players and coaches

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:14.141
alike, that you have to do this and this to
successfully make a field goal.

00:02:14.141 --> 00:02:14.160
[Football crowd noise]
&gt;&gt;And the kick is good!
