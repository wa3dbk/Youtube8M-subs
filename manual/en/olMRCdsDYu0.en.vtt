Hi, this is Ginny with Simply Beautiful Crafts
on behalf of Expert Village. Since real rain

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.110
sticks have a lot of texture I like to decorate
mine with texture to. There are a couple of

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.470
ideas I'd like to share with you with that.
One way you might want to decorate your rain

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:28.019
stick is with yarn. You could use one type
of yarn or two types of yarn or even a multitude

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:33.281
of different kinds of yarn. To start it, you'll
want to put it on your rain stick with a little

00:00:33.281 --> 00:00:42.910
dab of glue and then use a rubber band to
hold it in place. You can do several different

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:51.219
things with the yarn. One thing that you can
do is to go up and down with your yarn across

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:56.780
the rain stick. It's very damp out here so
my rain stick is collapsing a little. Or you

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:02.750
can follow the lines that are already there
on your rain stick and take the yarn with

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:08.549
you. I like to use two different colors because
it gives it a little bit more of an appeal.

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:15.070
So you would want to go ahead and put glue
on your rain stick. Probably craft glue but

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.360
you don't have to do it ahead of time. You
can always glue it at the end. So you follow

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:31.159
the line if you want it to spiral down your
rain stick.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:37.479
Cut it off and glue it. Then start over again
with another spiral all the way around. My

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:43.040
poor rain stick is not liking this. It's not
liking the rain. That's because it's not a

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.440
cactus. Another really neat way to cover a
rain stick and give it fabric, I think, is

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:54.140
with jute. Because it is a natural fabric,
a natural fiber and of course rain sticks

00:01:54.140 --> 00:02:01.060
were made from cacti. You can do the same
thing. You can follow your spiral down or

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.770
you can put it on, maybe hold it on with a
pen or paper clip to start. Let's try a big

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:18.790
headed big pin and see if that works
and then you can glue this on in a spiral

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.670
all the way around. Not only does this give
your rain stick a nice texture but it also

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.000
muffles the sound a little bit more. Again,
you have even more of a natural sound. When

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.090
you finish all the way around with the jute
you might want to take and extra piece and

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:41.160
tie it with maybe some feathers or something
else natural. And that's the way you can use

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:45.720
yarn or jute to decorate your rain stick and
give it some texture as well.
