00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.600
How to save money and to be less polluting with rain water

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.240
The kit was installed on a BMW X5

00:00:38.241 --> 00:00:42.600
of october 2007, 231 hp.

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:46.680
This system is mounted on a rental car

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.800
I told to the renter I was doing some experiments 

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.880
on a system allowing to save money and to be less polluting

00:00:57.881 --> 00:01:02.440
I can only rely on what I noticed directly on the dashboard.

00:01:02.441 --> 00:01:06.480
I've always been beyond 10L/100km;

00:01:06.481 --> 00:01:09.680
Not by far but always more than 10L/100km,

00:01:09.681 --> 00:01:19.000
and now we're below 10L, so here we notice that's profitable in terms of fuel consumption. 

00:01:19.001 --> 00:01:20.001
However what's certain, 

00:01:20.002 --> 00:01:26.080
I was just talking about that with one my providers,

00:01:26.081 --> 00:01:28.960
is that there is no smell at the exhaust output.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:25.760
Water booster system for diesel engines

00:02:25.761 --> 00:02:28.160
From 10% to 50% of fuel savings

00:02:28.161 --> 00:02:30.760
Opacity decreased by 80%

00:02:30.761 --> 00:02:33.800
Results:
Better engine output
Decrease of the opacity
Reduction of fuel consumption

00:02:33.801 --> 00:02:34.240
Less noise
Easy to install
