00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.380
Okay, today we're going to plate some sample Orthodontic brackets

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.340
and using the Jewel Master

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:19.980
we're going to plate them in a hard, 24K Gold
using Wood's Nickel Strike as an activator.

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:27.940
And it will be a 3 step process where we begin
by electro-cleaning the surface, which cleans

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:33.460
any material and makes the surface hydrophillic
and will wet out and then we'll go on to the

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.620
Wood's Nickel Strike that we've set up with
a bagged Nickel Anode and the final step will

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.860
be plating in the 24K Bright Gold solution.

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.580
Now, we've got the temperature is right about

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:55.239
100 degrees, which is correct, and so we're
gonna begin we'll just drop the part into

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:00.680
the Wood's Nickel Strike first (Electro clean
first) or the Electro clean first

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.840
and we'll leave that in there for probably 15-20 seconds

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.100
just to make sure the parts wet out well.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.200
We'll take it out,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.980
we'll rinse,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.660
just regular rinse water.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.620
And now we're going to go in,

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:32.460
and the voltages and current and everything for these first two pre-treatment steps is automatic.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:37.180
Now we're going to go into the
Wood's Nickel Strike and I'm going to do that

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.140
for probably 10-15 seconds also.

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.720
What this does is ensures that the adhesion will be good with the gold.

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:53.940
Ok, now we'll rinse and
then we'll go into a final distilled water rinse

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:59.040
and then we'll go into our Bright Gold
solution.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.140
I need to adjust the voltage up

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:08.360
to about 2.7 volts

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:17.120
and we're going to do it
for about 4 minutes.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.340
And the 4 minutes will

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.960
give us a good jewelry grade thickness of
gold plating,it should be sufficient

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.400
for the durability.

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:32.480
Ok, the plating has been going
on for about 2 minutes and I'm just going

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.470
to agitate it, move the part around a little
bit, make sure the fresh solution is down

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:42.510
in all the nooks and crannies and actually
I'm going to pick the part up, take a quick

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:47.500
look at it and turn it around just to expose
the other side to the anode. Then we'll let

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.140
it run for another couple minutes.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.160
Okay, now
the plating has been going on for about 4

00:02:54.160 --> 00:03:00.930
minutes and it's important to note here that
this should plate about a half a micron, which

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.550
is a normal jewelry grade thickness of gold,
however if you want it to be thicker for more

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:14.660
durability or longer lasting, you could actually
plate twice as long and get twice the thickness.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:20.520
And the cost would not be that significant
on parts this tiny.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.920
So, I don't know if you

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:29.760
can tell or not but the parts plated very
well and in racking these parts what I did

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:36.170
was, some of the parts had through holes and
so I threaded them onto a fine copper wire

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:42.480
and two of the parts did not have any holes
but they did have protruding parts and so

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:48.390
what I did was I tied a loop in the wire,
an overhand knot and just looped it around

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:51.480
the part and that way they are attached to
the copper wire.

00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.530
So now that we're done I'll

00:03:53.530 --> 00:04:01.360
go ahead and cut the parts off the wire and
we'll clean them and dry them and the only

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:05.040
thing remaining will be a 24K gold deposit.
