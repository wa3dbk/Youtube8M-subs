00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.600
This is Ryan Higa logging in, Day 3.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:04.900
This is less than a week until the world ends

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.650
and there's a global panic happening
right now.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:09.000
*screams*

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.600
Cars are crashing,

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:10.400
*crash sounds*

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:11.900
people are running into streets,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.920
*dinosaur roars and more screams*

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:15.680
things exploding. *even more screams*

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.920
No one is safe.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.060
*atomic bomb sound*

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.540
*explosion*

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.880
*deep breath* And I'm here recording every single event happening.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:29.040
in case someone in the future finds this

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.900
and knows not to make the same mistakes we made.

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:33.420
*light switch flicks on*

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.360
What are you doing in my closet?

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:34.980
Oh,

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.920
Get out! Yup yup, you're right sorry, sorry about that.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.780
Sorry, I...yup, I knew I shouldn't have...

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.000
Okay, so maybe I exaggerated a little bit on the whole global panic thing.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.300
This is how it really looks.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:47.000
Oh...sorry about that, man.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.920
*birds chirping*

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.300
Wait, did I turn off the stove?

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.100
Yes, I did.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.000
*falling missile sound*

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.340
Would you stop that?

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.080
The end of the world is less than a
week away

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.660
and for some reason no one seems to care.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.720
Last year, everyone was making such a big deal about it.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.320
But now that it's less than a week
away, it seems like nobody

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.080
even gives a ship.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:11.460
I give a sh**.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.600
Now clean it up.

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.740
I said ship.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.640
Oh...

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.940
What happened to all you people who said:

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.880
'Uh, December 21st 2012. That's when the world is ending.'

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:22.720
'The Mayans said the world is ending.'

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.240
'An earthquake?! That means the world is ending!'

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.260
'Our voices all sound the same.'

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:27.920
So, where are all those people now?

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.740
They're hiding from us because in about week, they're about to look really stupid.

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.880
I mean either that or they're actually hiding in a bomb shelter which is...

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:36.770
Well, I mean props to you for sticking to your gut even though your gut's stupid.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.060
I'm just kidding. But, seriously...

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:41.660
I mean, I'm not going to lie, there are some signs that show like glimpses of the world ending.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.400
Hey, what are you listening to?

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.060
Ugh, the best boy band of all time,

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.840
One Direction.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.700
Oh, come on they're not the best boy band. What about NSYNC?

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.980
Ugh, NSYNC, they are like wannabe One Directions.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:55.260
Yes, that's exactly where they belong, in the sink.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.680
Okay, Backstreet Boys then? More like dumbass boys.

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.140
Wow, okay, um...

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.020
Okay, what about the Beatles then?

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.260
What's a beetles?

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:05.700
*awkward silence*

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.360
I mean, don't you listen to anything else?

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.900
Uh, duh, what about the only guy that's better than Michael Jackson,

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.720
the real king of pop, Justin Bei-

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:12.980
*gun shot*

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.900
Never, say never.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.940
*epic music*

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.820
But I didn't say never.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.520
Oh, well, I mean... don't say that either.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:25.080
Sorry

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.940
See these are minor signs, but it's nothing to be frantic over.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.820
Frantic, frantic. Such a smart person word. Oh, stop being so frantic!

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.700
Because people with English accents sound smarter so...

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.400
Sorry, ADHD. Anyway,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.400
and for all those people watching out there who are still saying:

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.960
'Oh, Ryan, you can't tell the future either.

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:43.100
You don't know that the world's not going to end. I don't know why your voice is still like this.'

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.700
If you really believe the world's gonna end, let me make a bet with you.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.350
If the world doesn't end you have to

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.500
subscribe to my channel. Even if you're a hater.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.490
And if the world does end, I mean...

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.340
I mean, I guess you can have everything.

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.800
You can have my house, my car,

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.640
my YouTube account. I mean if the world's ending, I don't really,

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.930
I don't really give a ship.

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:59.940
Oh God dammit, Marley!

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.940
heheheh

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.120
TEEHEE
