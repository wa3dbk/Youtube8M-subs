00:00:06.058 --> 00:00:09.328
What are the signs your tattoo is infected?

00:00:09.328 --> 00:00:14.017
Getting a tattoo is a fun and exciting way
to showcase your personality.

00:00:14.017 --> 00:00:19.798
Unfortunately, however, things sometimes go
wrong and you could wind up with an infection.

00:00:19.798 --> 00:00:24.488
If you have a fresh tattoo, it is important
to keep an eye on it for any signs or symptoms

00:00:24.488 --> 00:00:25.968
of infection.

00:00:25.968 --> 00:00:30.188
Here are three common signs your tattoo is
infected:

00:00:30.188 --> 00:00:35.258
Inflammation - Because the tattooing process
damages the skin, all new tattoos are inflamed

00:00:35.258 --> 00:00:37.148
to one degree or another.

00:00:37.148 --> 00:00:42.558
However, the inflammation should slowly fade
over a period of several days.

00:00:42.558 --> 00:00:47.117
If your tattoo is still swollen and inflamed
a few days after getting it, you may want

00:00:47.117 --> 00:00:50.907
to head back to the tattoo parlor to have
it inspected.

00:00:50.907 --> 00:00:55.218
Redness - Again, redness is a common occurrence
with a new tattoo.

00:00:55.218 --> 00:01:00.927
When you think about the trauma the skin undergoes
during the tattooing process, it makes sense.

00:01:00.927 --> 00:01:04.828
However, the redness should slowly fade over
time.

00:01:04.828 --> 00:01:09.338
If you notice that the redness does not seem
to be fading or is increasing, it could be

00:01:09.338 --> 00:01:11.867
a sign that it has become infected.

00:01:11.867 --> 00:01:16.217
Warmth - Infected skin tends to be warmer
than the surrounding skin.

00:01:16.217 --> 00:01:21.007
If you are worried your new tattoo is infected,
try placing your hand on it.

00:01:21.007 --> 00:01:24.738
If it feels hot to the touch, it may be infected.

00:01:24.738 --> 00:01:27.838
Severe infections may also cause fever.

00:01:27.838 --> 00:01:31.908
Try taking your body temperature to see if
it is elevated.

00:01:31.908 --> 00:01:35.287
Infection is something that should always
be taken seriously.

00:01:35.287 --> 00:01:39.567
If you ignore the early warning signs your
tattoo is infected, it can develop into a

00:01:39.567 --> 00:01:41.687
more serious problem.

00:01:41.687 --> 00:01:46.467
The best way to avoid any complications is
by closely monitoring your tattoo for the

00:01:46.467 --> 00:01:49.107
first week or so after you get it.

00:01:49.107 --> 00:01:54.028
Watch for any signs of inflammation, redness,
swelling or warmth.

00:01:54.028 --> 00:01:59.147
Do not hesitate to return to the tattoo parlor
to ask the artist to examine it for you.

00:01:59.147 --> 00:02:04.048
They have the necessary experience to spot
signs of infection and are usually more than

00:02:04.048 --> 00:02:04.777
happy to help.
