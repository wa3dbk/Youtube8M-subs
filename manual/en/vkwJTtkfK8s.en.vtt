00:00:00.289 --> 00:00:03.806
As a child I had suffered from a form of arthritis,

00:00:03.806 --> 00:00:08.476
which is related to what the doctors think then

00:00:08.476 --> 00:00:11.356
caused one leg to be shorter than the other.

00:00:11.415 --> 00:00:15.115
And that, in turn, caused the spine 
to lean over

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:18.165
slightly to accommodate for that slightly shorter leg.

00:00:18.253 --> 00:00:22.223
As an adult, when I started having this decline into ill health,

00:00:22.223 --> 00:00:24.523
it started out with a stomach condition,

00:00:24.708 --> 00:00:26.948
which made me lose weight dramatically.

00:00:27.219 --> 00:00:28.662
So, it was a combination, really,

00:00:28.662 --> 00:00:30.472
of all of these things that brought me

00:00:30.472 --> 00:00:33.262
very quickly to a very weakened state

00:00:33.478 --> 00:00:36.518
where I was losing weight, I was losing strength,

00:00:36.907 --> 00:00:39.127
and I was in a great deal of pain 
at the same time.

00:00:39.272 --> 00:00:42.799
I mean, I literally did try the A to Z 
of all the therapies,

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:44.858
from acupuncture to zone therapy,

00:00:44.858 --> 00:00:46.423
and everything in between.

00:00:46.423 --> 00:00:49.163
Ten years ago, I walked into my first ever

00:00:49.249 --> 00:00:51.889
Christian Science lecture 
as a disabled person.

00:00:51.942 --> 00:00:54.237
And when I found out that this lecture was 
a Christian lecture,

00:00:54.237 --> 00:00:56.047
that it was based on the Bible,

00:00:56.047 --> 00:01:02.167
I pretty much shut it off in thought and didn't want to be a part of it at all.

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:06.329
But I started noticing 
an incredible sense of peace,

00:01:06.825 --> 00:01:10.435
and also the pain 
in all the different parts of my body

00:01:10.556 --> 00:01:12.986
just started ever so gradually melting away.

00:01:13.132 --> 00:01:18.082
It felt almost as if 
somebody was inflating me with air,

00:01:18.295 --> 00:01:21.535
and I was just being pumped up 
into this fuller, rounder,

00:01:21.535 --> 00:01:24.335
more comfortable sense of a body.

00:01:24.335 --> 00:01:27.193
I seemed pretty in a state of shock, really, the following morning,

00:01:27.193 --> 00:01:30.813
when I realized just how significant this healing had been.

00:01:30.983 --> 00:01:34.833
And then slowly but surely I realized that this was the healing method

00:01:35.416 --> 00:01:38.442
that can be taught and shared with others.

00:01:38.442 --> 00:01:43.022
It's not random. It's not unpredictable. 
It's something that you can really rely on.

00:01:43.162 --> 00:01:47.332
And that really got me interested then. 
I really immersed myself in the study.

00:01:47.625 --> 00:01:50.809
So ten years ago, I walked into my first ever Christian Science lecture

00:01:50.809 --> 00:01:52.859
with no expectations,

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:56.589
but when I left an hour later, 
I had no limitations.
