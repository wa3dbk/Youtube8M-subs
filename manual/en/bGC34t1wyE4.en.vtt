00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:11.709
It takes a certain kind of mad clarity to
sit there and take the genre of 'Tower Defense'

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:14.610
as literally as Bad Hotel does.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.790
Conceptually Lucky Frame's game is the same
as it ever was - drop blocks as defenses against

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.960
an onslaught of creatures bent on destroying
your base, but this time around you're actually

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.269
building the eponymous hotel, adding rooms
to accommodate tourists and shoot down sentient

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:31.269
clouds.

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:33.210
I may have lost you on that last point.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.100
See, your task is simple - build a profitable
hotel.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.680
Unfortunately your boss is a racketeer and
is out to claim the insurance on his investment

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.960
by hiring all kinds of 'natural' foes such
as bomb wielding birds, deadly bees, and the

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.940
occasional irate swimmer.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:53.510
I'm still working out how the last one fits
in, but the Art Deco visual style ties it

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.540
all together to create a vibrant and whimsical
atmosphere.

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.250
It's also hard not to miss the cacophony of
sound generated by your tower as pulses of

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.600
light ripple through the tree-like structure
to power the many rooms connected to it.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.940
Initially you'll find that everything chimes
harmoniously - think of it as the 'everything

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.749
is fine' alarm; it's not pretty, but you can
relax.

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:19.350
However, once a building takes damage or worse
still, is destroyed, the pattern changes adding

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.549
flat notes.

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.829
In this way the rhythmical pattern acts as
a sonar, alerting you to threats to your structure

00:01:24.829 --> 00:01:26.950
even when you can't see what's happening.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.880
The concept is nothing short of genius, bringing
in an often overlooked sense in to play and

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.210
making it part of your tactical tool-set.

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.569
Unfortunately the focus on this aspect seems
to have resulted in the tactile sense being

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:40.110
overlooked instead.

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.609
Positioning buildings is as 'easy' as swiping
and placing them around the tower, however

00:01:44.609 --> 00:01:48.850
strict placement rules can leave you confused
as you try to shield a vital room only to

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.439
have it placed somewhere else entirely thanks
to moving a fraction of an inch before lifting

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:54.709
your finger.

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:58.639
This doesn't ruin things though - the intensity
of the challenge is almost as non-stop as

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:00.740
the waves of enemies thrown at you.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.340
From levels that restrict the rooms you can
use to huge 'boss' battles, you'll find yourself

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.039
needing to constantly learn new tactics to
overcome each hurdle.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.099
Bad Hotel is a wonderfully compelling side-evolution
of the tower defense genre and is heartily

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:23.920
recommended for genre fans and those who enjoy
unique game concepts.
