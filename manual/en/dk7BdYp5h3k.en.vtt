00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.380
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;PEGGY: THE NEW BILL IS SPONSORED BY SENATOR
BARBARA BOXER REQUIRES FOODS THAT CONTAIN

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:07.490
GMOS BE LABELED.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:16.269
THE D SPITE A RECENT POLL THAT FOUND 91% OF
AMERICANS SUPPORT GMO LABELING, PROPOSITION

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.289
37 FAILED TO PASS IN CALIFORNIA LAST E YEAR.

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:28.400
HERE ARE MY GUESTS, STEVEN BRIGS AND DAVID
BRONNER, OF DR.�BRONNER'S MAGIC SOAP.

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:29.400
WELCOME.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.900
STEVE, 64 OTHER COUNTRIES REQUIRE GENETICALLY
ENGINEERED FOODS TO BE LABELED.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:41.530
YOU BELIEVE SCIENTIFICALLY THERE'S NO REASON
FOR CONCERN.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:47.610
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: THE SAFETY OF THESE PRODUCTS OF BIOTECHNOLOGY
ARE WELLPROVEN AND AFTER DECADES OF USE BILLIONS

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.499
OF PEOPLE THERE'S NOT EVE AN SINGLE INCIDENCE
OF ILLNESS CAUSED BY ANY OF THESE PRODUCTS.

00:00:52.499 --> 00:00:53.760
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;PEGGY: WHAT DO YOU THINK IT IS?

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.329
WHY DO THESE OTHER COUNTRIES WANT TO LABEL
THIS AND PUT THIS KNOWLEDGE THERE?

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.180
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: IT'S TRYING TO KEEP AMERICAN PRODUCTS
OUT OF THEIR DOMESTIC, AGRICULTURAL MARKET

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.180
PLACE.

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.689
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;PEGGY: DAVID, YOU DISAGREE WITH THIS.

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:10.430
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE CORE ISH OW OF THIS
LABELING DEBATE?

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.469
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: I THINK AMERICANS WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S
IN THEIR FEED.

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:18.950
IT'S ABOUT MORE INFORMATION, MORE TRANSPARENCY,
FOOD LABELS ARE NOT SIMPLY ABOUT HEALTH AND

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.709
SAFETY, THEY'RE ABOUT IMPORT AND PRODUCTION
RELATED INFORMATION.

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:30.289
WHAT COUNTRY DID YOUR FOOD COME FROM, IS YOUR
FOOD GENETICALLY ENGINEERED OR NOT. IS THAT

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:34.729
A GENETICALLY ENGINEERED APPLE OR NOT AND
MAKE AN INFORMED CHOICE.

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.740
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;PEGGY: OKAY, MAYBE EATS RR NOT ABOUT
FOOD SAFETY, BUT DO YOU THINK THERE'S AN ENVIRONMENTAL

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.429
COMPONENT TO THIS?

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:47.319
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: SURE, PERSONALLY I'M VERY CONCERNED
THE SINGLE MOST DOMINANT GENETICALLY ENGINEERED

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.639
CROP IS WHEAT KILLER TOLERANCE.

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:59.119
THIS IS SO THAT PESTICIDE MANUFACTURERS CAN
HAVE FARMERS BLAST MORE WEED KILLER ON OUR

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.719
FOOD CROPS WHICH IS UNSUSTAINABLE, IT'S CREATING
HUGE SELECTION PRESSURE ON WEEDS TO DEVELOP

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.349
RESISTENCE.

00:02:07.349 --> 00:02:11.860
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;PEGGY: LET ME GET A RESPONSE FROM STEVE
ON THAT.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:16.290
THESE ARE GENETICALLY MODIFIED SEEDS I THINK
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SPECIFICALLY, RIGHT, BUT

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.989
THEY'RE WEED RESISTENT.

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.790
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: I APPRECIATE THAT DAVID HAS AN IDEOLOGICAL
OPPOSITION TO THE TECHNOLOGY, BUT I DON'T

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.100
THINK GOVERNMENT SHOULD MANDATE IDEOLOGY ON
OUR FOOD LABELS.

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.260
THE INTEGRITY SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR SAFETY.

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.720
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;PEGGY: WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD LABELS,
THOUGH, OTHER THINGS ARE LABELED.

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.450
ORGANIC FOODS, WHETHER IT HAS ANY ENZYMES
IN IT.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:42.650
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: THAT'S A GREAT POINT.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:50.609
ORGANIC AND GMO FREE PRIVATE LABELS ARE ALREADY
AVAILABLE FOR EVERYONE WHO PREFERS TO USE

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.909
IDEOLOGY AS THE BASIS FOR THEIR CHOICES.

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:01.660
SO THIS WOULD NOT SOLVE SOME UNMET NEED, IT
WOULD SIMPLY IMPOSE THE COST OF THIS NEW REGULATION

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.109
ON ALL CONSUMERS.

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:06.450
THOSE WHO HAVE THIS IDEOLOGY AND THE VAST
MAJORITY WHO DON'T.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.730
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;PEGGY: A LOT OF PEOPLE DO WANT TO KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE EATING AS YOU WERE SAYING.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:16.091
BUT OPPONENTS I HAVE TO ASK YOU, DAVID, THEY
DO SAY LOOK, IF WE DO THIS, IT'S GOING TO

00:03:16.091 --> 00:03:22.370
COST MORE MONEY, DRIVE UP FOOD COSTS BEING
PUSHED BY THE ORGANIC INDUSTRY TO MAKE IT

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:25.970
OR A MORE COMPETITIVE MARKET; DO YOU THINK
SOME OF THAT IS TRUE?

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:26.970
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: NOT AT ALL.

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:30.639
I THINK A SIMPLE LABEL DISCLOSURE COSTS NOTHING.

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:36.680
THE CHIEF OPPONENT OF THE PROP 37 EFFORT IN
CALIFORNIA RAN PROLABELING ADS IN THE UK10

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.950
YEARS AGO.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.000
BASICALLY, THERE IS NO COST TO DISCLOSING
WHETHER OR NOT A FOOD IS GMO OR IF ORANGE

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.270
USE IS FROM CONCENTRATE.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:52.079
STEVE'S POINT, IT'S NOT LIKE JUST BECAUSE
YOU CAN BUY ORANGE JUICE THAT SAYS IT'S NOT

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:59.680
FROM CONCENTRATE, WE SHOULDN'T MANNED� WE
HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.489
OUR FOOD IT IS CALLED THE GENETICALLY ENGINEERED
FOOD RIGHT TO KNOW ACT.

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:12.200
LET ME ASK YOU THIS, STEVE, DO YOU THINK IT'S
A GOOD IDEA� FOR VOLUNTARY LABELING FOR

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:15.330
INSTANCE LIKE KOSHER FOOD IS VOLUNTARILY LABELED.

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:18.349
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: THAT'S THE WAY TO HANDLE IDEOLOGICAL
INFORMATION.

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:22.790
IT SHOULD BE VOLUNTEER AND PAID FOR BY THE
PEOPLE WHO VALUE THAT INFORMATION.

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.560
IT SHOULDN'T BE IMPOSED, FORCED ON EVERYBODY.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.180
ESSENTIALLY THIS IS FORCING THIS HIGHPRICED
FOOD DOWN THE THROAT OF ALL AMERICANS.

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.350
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;PEGGY: WHAT DO YOU THINK, DAVID, ON,
WE JUST LABEL THE FOOD THAT WAS NOT GENETICALLY

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.279
ENGINEERED, DO YOU THINK THAT WOULD BE ADEQUATE?

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:42.830
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;: NO, DON'T.
THIS IS NOT BEING DRIVEN BY THE ORGANIC INDUSTRY.

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:49.349
I'M ON THE COMMITTEE OF 522, YES ON 522.COM
IN WASHINGTON STATE.

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:54.330
THAT'S PRIMARILY COALITION OF SALMON FISHERS,
APPLE GROWERS AND WHEAT FARMERS.

00:04:54.330 --> 00:05:01.780
NOT ORGANIC, BUT FARMER WHOSE ARE CONCERNED
THAT UNLABELED APPLES, UNLABELED GMO WHEAT

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:08.680
WILL RUIN THE IMAGE OF APPLES AND FISH IN
THE MINDS OF CONSUMER AND STOP BUYING SALMON.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.169
IF I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A WEIRD�
&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;PEGGY: THEY DON'T HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:12.169
OF IT.

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:15.919
SO WE CAN GET A WHOLE LOT MORE INFORMATION
ON OUR WEBSITE ABOUT THIS.

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:19.340
DAVID, AND STEVEN, THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING
US.
