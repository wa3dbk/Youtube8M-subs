00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.999
This is Ted the Labrador.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.999
Ted is about to deliver the wedding rings, strapped on his back with in a box,for the wedding vows.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:17.999
Ted is 9 and a half years old.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.999
This is Fabio. Fabio is getting married to Camila.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.999
Ted has been courting Camila for 9 and a half years - the same number of years as Ted's age.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.999
Ted's owners are Fábio and his brother, Claumeleti, from Brazil.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.999
At first, it was thought that perhaps Fábio was using Ted to deliver the rings for the vows to commerate 
the 9 and a half years he had been courting Camila.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.999
However, Claumeleti, who provided the clips used to make this video, insists that Ted's age was a mere coincidence.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.999
Ted is a calm dog, well behaved, and well liked by all the members of the family. 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:09.999
So Fábio, Camila, and rest of the family were confident that Ted could deliver the weddings rings for the vows,...

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.999
...and of course remain with the family during the ceremony.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.999
Traditionally, in Brazil, a young child will carry the wedding rings to the altar for the wedding vows.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.999
However, Fábio and Camila preferred to have Ted carry the rings.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:45.999
This is a view from a different camera of Fábio receiving the wedding rings from Ted.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:02.999
[Pastor Speaking]
-Ted is like a gentleman. In addition to doing what he had to do, deliver the wedding rings for the vows...

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
[Pastor Speaking]
-...he greeted the guests, and I think that he deserves a round of applause, don't you agree?

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.999
Doesn't Ted look smart in his Tuxedo?!!!
