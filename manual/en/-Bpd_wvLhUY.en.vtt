00:00:05.115 --> 00:00:08.015
Jesus loves little children,

00:00:08.115 --> 00:00:11.815
and whenever he could, he helped them.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.278
One day, an important man begged Jesus to come to his house and heal his sick son.

00:00:20.378 --> 00:00:22.436
But Jesus didn't go.

00:00:22.536 --> 00:00:28.315
Instead, he said,
 - Go home. Your son will live.

00:00:28.888 --> 00:00:33.347
The man believed Jesus and went home.

00:00:33.883 --> 00:00:39.474
But before he got there, his servants met him, and said,

00:00:39.574 --> 00:00:42.402
- Your son is well!

00:00:42.832 --> 00:00:46.500
Jesus also helped a little girl.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:49.426
Her father's name was Jairus,

00:00:49.526 --> 00:00:52.423
and he was an important man.

00:00:52.896 --> 00:00:55.357
- My little daughter is dying.

00:00:55.457 --> 00:00:59.351
- Please come and pray for her so she will get well and live.

00:00:59.818 --> 00:01:04.740
But before Jesus could go to the little girl, she died.

00:01:04.911 --> 00:01:08.316
Still, Jesus went to see her.

00:01:08.416 --> 00:01:13.032
With the child's mother and father, and three of his followers,

00:01:13.132 --> 00:01:18.661
Jesus went into the girl's room, and took her hand in his.

00:01:19.676 --> 00:01:22.776
- Little girl, stand up.

00:01:25.697 --> 00:01:30.197
And she did. She was well.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.336
Great crowds of people followed Jesus to see his miracles

00:01:37.436 --> 00:01:41.898
and hear him teach about God's love for them.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:50.050
One day, a huge crowd of 5,000 men and their families followed Jesus.

00:01:50.255 --> 00:01:56.700
It was late in the day when they reached Jesus,
and the people were getting hungry.

00:01:57.546 --> 00:02:06.307
The only one with any food was a little boy
with five small loaves of bread and two fish.

00:02:06.407 --> 00:02:09.027
Jesus blessed the food.

00:02:09.127 --> 00:02:14.227
His closest followers and helpers gave it to the people.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:23.600
After everyone had plenty to eat,
the helpers gathered up 12 baskets of leftover food.

00:02:24.758 --> 00:02:29.157
Many people wanted to see Jesus.

00:02:30.078 --> 00:02:36.190
When Jesus saw how sick and sad they were,
he wanted to help them.

00:02:36.473 --> 00:02:40.481
One day, some people brought their children to him.

00:02:40.681 --> 00:02:44.081
His helpers tried to send them away.

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.672
But Jesus said,

00:02:48.345 --> 00:02:50.548
- Let the children come to me.

00:02:50.648 --> 00:02:52.258
- Don't stop them!

00:02:52.358 --> 00:02:57.640
- You must love and accept God like a little child
if you want to enter Heaven.
