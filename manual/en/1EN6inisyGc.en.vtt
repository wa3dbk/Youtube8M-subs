00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.040
 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.270
My name is Dimitri Deheyn, I'm a marine biologist at

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:10.809
Scripps Institution of Oceanography
and associated with Earth Sciences

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.809
and we are here in the

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:19.809
Hubbs Hall experimental aquarium of Scripps.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.509
These tube worms are called the
Parchment tube worms.

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.910
As you can see here, they build these amazing

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.379
structures. These tubes that are made of a
material

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.610
called the parchment material almost
like

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.970
paper. It's very amazing and interesting, it's soft yet very sturdy

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.089
and inside the tube as you can see there is a
little opening here

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:49.489
and there is also a very little opening
at the bottom here

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.050
and a worm lives in that tube. It builds it.

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.190
And it builds it as it grows. So you have

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.379
when you go diving, just upstroke La Jolla,

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.390
carpet of these tubes with hundreds and hundreds of them

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.160
that basically hold hundreds and
hundreds of worms. But also the worm

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.310
produces very interesting bioluminescence

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.590
through a mucus. The mucus might be responsible for
building the tube,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.390
but the mucus is also bioluminscent.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.420
The light is beautiful and is blue in color, very

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:28.640
unusual. Our goal is to be able to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:31.990
study the mucus and synthesize

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.170
the light production back in the
laboratory. The excitement of

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.330
new light producing compounds

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.810
is attractive from the very fundamental basic

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.380
aspect of research, but also for

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.940
the various applications that such new

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.450
compounds that produce light or new photoproteins provide.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.630
The two papers we published

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.880
address the basic fundamental
biochemical

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.970
demonstration that the light indeed
originates from

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.090
a chemical reaction that is novel

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.520
that is not known and yet still remain to be described.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.790
The light might depend on riboflavin,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.410
which is a vitamin B2, which is a vitamin that you and I

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.000
need and so does the worm. But in this particular
case, the worm

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.550
thing to be using it to produce light.
The process of that

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.780
is still unknown. Does the worm acquire vitamin B2 from

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.840
to diet strictly or maybe from

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.069
symbiosis with the bacteria and all these are
questions that are still

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.310
open.

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.220
 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.290
 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.380
