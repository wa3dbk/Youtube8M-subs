00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.159
hi this is ralph and in this series of

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:03.449
videos i want to go over the

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.009
construction of this small business

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.710
website. In this case it's a fake

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:16.289
cafe. This was a challenge that students

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.960
in both CIS 195 (intro web dev)

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.180
and in CIS 295 (advanced web dev) had

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.130
to deal with. They worked to different levels

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.400
of completion and different features.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.680
This is a pretty small website

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.090
even though we have a little menu appear

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.800
it's a one-page site just the

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:34.140
homepage for a fake cafe called river

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.980
arts cafe and the website is

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.390
mostly a one column layout.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.040
navigation menu in the top right corner

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.660
of the header. a centered headline. a little

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.210
bit of welcoming text with filler lorem ipsum.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.520
text with a graphic representing a food

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.309
item. a background image of a nice

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.350
cafe. some mock text displaying or

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.359
featuring some key menu

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.640
items. and a little bit of copyright

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.409
address and phone number information at

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.960
the bottom. Now entry level students had

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.729
to make this one page and they were

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.820
given a starting file with some of the

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.560
content already on there particularly

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.630
the the lorem ipsum paragraphs and some

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.729
structural elements so they had to

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:19.799
finish the page to this point. The

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:21.330
web development 2 students had to go a

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.430
step further and they needed to make

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.960
sure that this webpage was mobile

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.450
friendly and that if rendered on a

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.299
device 960 or smaller would go to a

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:32.280
mobile layout in which the navigation

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:34.110
menu switches to vertical and takes up

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.270
pretty much the

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.150
full width of the screen the sandwich

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.369
picture is now above the paragraph and

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.670
larger. instead of that background image

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.979
of the cafe we have a new

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.780
map so we have a map showing the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.390
location of the restaurant and our 3

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.979
product items that were before

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:57.000
side-by-side are now one on top of the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.210
other. and of course our footer. so web

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.530
development 2 students had to do the

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.689
desktop version and this mobile version.

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.140
and a step further web dev students

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.619
needed to make

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.090
a print friendly version where the

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.129
sandwich image does not show. the map

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.230
image does show. the header is completely

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:18.430
gone

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:21.069
our product items are still there and

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.629
then the footer information has changed

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:24.010
a little bit the copyright notice is

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.170
missing but we do have larger text

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.720
emphasizing the

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.569
address and phone number. So, desktop

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:34.599
version, print version, and mobile version.

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:36.549
those are the three three aspects of

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:38.500
this website we want to take care of and

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.360
even if you're not in a web development

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.519
course this would be a good example of

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:43.900
really any kind of small business

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.640
website that doesn't require any hardcore

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.260
back-end development.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:49.750
no database or anything like that and

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.549
it's made up of several pages that

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:54.040
probably aren't updated on a frequent

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.290
basis although a site like this might

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.299
still have some social media

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:01.659
While i'm working on this

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:05.560
webpage I will be referring to a set of

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.940
directions. These directions were

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:08.530
provided to the web development

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.109
students.

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.220
They had

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.889
a list of key items to

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:17.079
work on and they were provided some

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:19.150
screen captures visual aids of the

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.849
finished desktop the finished print and

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:24.280
the finished mobile version.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:25.989
I'll run through these steps as I'm going so

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:28.419
so that we can create this finished product.

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:33.970
For my editor today, I'm

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.250
gonna be using the sublime text 2 and

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.750
we'll go ahead start off this opening

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:41.620
video just with getting the basic

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.840
tags that every web page is

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:48.220
going to have. There we go.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:49.750
I paused the recording while typing this up.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.660
Every page you make should have

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.519
these basic elements of course we have

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.709
our doc type definition for html5 up the

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.840
top HTML tag with language attribute

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:01.900
head section includes our meta

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.239
character encoding tag includes a title for

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:05.739
the page every webpage you make should

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.010
have a unique and descriptive title I

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:10.750
did throw in the meta author that was

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.310
not really too essential but i do like

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.489
it for assignment web pages and I'd like

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.659
everyone to get in the habit of doing

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:18.640
this one... this is our meta viewport meta

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:20.540
name equals viewport content

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:24.620
equals width equals device with and this

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.300
is a very critical step for making the

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:28.100
mobile-friendly webpage so even if you

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:29.060
don't think you're going to be making

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.710
the mobile-friendly webpage, you might as

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:31.790
well put this in the head section

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:33.800
because it doesn't hurt that it's in

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:36.020
there and it does help when you do want

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.120
to go mobile. i put in a Meta Description

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.240
every webpage you make especially

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.890
real-life web pages

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.620
should have a good readable

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:47.930
description that explains the purpose of

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.940
this web page this is text that is

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.920
generally used in the search engine

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:54.950
results of a search engine and of course

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:56.810
i do have a link to an external style

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.760
sheet i haven't made the style sheet yet

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.310
i'll get to that soon enough but I'm go

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.480
ahead and put in the link tag to my

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.940
external style and the body of the page

00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:06.500
is pretty empty but i do have the

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.750
all-important outer container or wrapper

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.090
and pretty much every website you make

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:13.280
is going to rely on this especially

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.770
because it's a nice tool used to control

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.180
what is the width of this page going to

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:19.040
be is it fixed is it flexible and this

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:20.540
is how we're going to contain all of the

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.140
visible portions of our webpage so this

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.090
is the start of our HTML and just keep

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.510
in mind where we're making this small

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:32.090
business cafe website with mobile

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.650
friendly version and a printer-friendly

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.630
version and we'll go ahead and start

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.200
working on that.
