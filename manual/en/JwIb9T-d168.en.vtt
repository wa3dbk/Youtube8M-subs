Hi! Welcome to Living Tech.

00:00:02.009 --> 00:00:03.015
In this video tutorial,

00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:05.015
we’re going to show you how to setup a virtual machine

00:00:05.015 --> 00:00:08.009
using Virtualbox from Sun Micro Systems.

00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:10.021
Setting up this virtual machine will provide

00:00:10.021 --> 00:00:12.025
hands on training without the risk of damaging

00:00:12.025 --> 00:00:15.007
the computer system if something wrong happens.

00:00:15.007 --> 00:00:17.003
Since the working environment is virtualized,

00:00:17.003 --> 00:00:19.009
everything we do will reside in its own virtual space

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:21.021
that is separate from the rest of the main operating system.

00:00:21.021 --> 00:00:22.029
To start this tutorial,

00:00:22.029 --> 00:00:25.001
first run the Virtualbox application.

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:26.017
This is what Virtualbox will

00:00:26.017 --> 00:00:28.009
look like after we open up the program.

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.000
As we can see, there are no virtual machines

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.019
that exist inside our Virtualbox, yet.

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:34.010
To create a virtual machine,

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.012
let’s begin by clicking on the New Button.

00:00:36.012 --> 00:00:40.010
Then click Next to continue with the installation.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.016
This is where we can name our virtual machine

00:00:43.016 --> 00:00:46.018
and select which operating system to run inside our virtual machine.

00:00:46.018 --> 00:00:51.018
This dropdown box allows us to install any operating system we want.

00:00:51.018 --> 00:00:55.010
This box allows us to pick which version of the operating system,

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.010
like Windows XP or Windows 7.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.022
Since we’re going to install Windows Server 2008,

00:01:00.022 --> 00:01:04.026
we will name this virtual machine Windows Server 2008.

00:01:08.011 --> 00:01:14.007
Then click on the Operating System Drop Down box and select Microsoft Windows.

00:01:14.007 --> 00:01:17.017
On the version dropdown box, select Windows 2008.

00:01:17.017 --> 00:01:20.019
Click next to go to the next step.

00:01:20.019 --> 00:01:24.019
This screen allows you to set the maximum amount of memory

00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:26.011
that the virtual machine could use.

00:01:26.011 --> 00:01:28.003
You can stick with the recommended settings,

00:01:28.003 --> 00:01:30.017
or increase the memory size depending on your needs.

00:01:30.017 --> 00:01:34.027
In this case, we’re going to dedicate 512MB of RAM to our virtual machine.

00:01:34.027 --> 00:01:37.017
Keep in mind that the more memory we give to our virtual machine,

00:01:37.017 --> 00:01:39.019
the smoother our virtual machine will run.

00:01:39.019 --> 00:01:43.020
If your computer has very little memory, you can stick with the recommended settings.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:46.004
Then click on Next to go to the next step.

00:01:48.024 --> 00:01:53.020
This screen allows us to create space inside our hard drive to install virtual machine.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.012
Make sure the Boot Hard disk option is checked.

00:01:56.012 --> 00:02:00.020
And then click on the Create New Hard Disk option.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.002
Then click on Next.

00:02:03.002 --> 00:02:05.014
Click Next to continue.

00:02:05.014 --> 00:02:08.004
On this screen, we can choose either

00:02:08.004 --> 00:02:10.026
Dynamically Expanding Storage or Fixed-Size Storage.

00:02:10.026 --> 00:02:14.009
The Dynamically Expanding Storage option allow us to automatically expand

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:17.027
our virtual space as we are adding more files, documents and programs.

00:02:17.027 --> 00:02:21.023
Fixed-Sized Storage allows us to specify a fixed amount of virtual space

00:02:21.023 --> 00:02:23.023
that our virtual machine can use.

00:02:23.023 --> 00:02:28.009
It’s best to select the Dynamically Expanding Storage option because

00:02:28.009 --> 00:02:30.001
there is no virtual space limitation.

00:02:30.001 --> 00:02:33.023
Our virtual machine can use more virtual space in the future if needed.

00:02:33.023 --> 00:02:35.027
Go ahead and click on Next.

00:02:35.027 --> 00:02:40.001
Under location box, we can change the folder location of our virtual space

00:02:40.001 --> 00:02:43.001
by clicking on the yellow folder icon to the right.

00:02:43.001 --> 00:02:47.008
In our case, we’re going to keep it at the default location.

00:02:47.008 --> 00:02:50.023
Next, we’re going to specify the amount of virtual space

00:02:50.023 --> 00:02:52.002
that our virtual machine will use.

00:02:52.002 --> 00:02:55.024
In our tutorial, we’re going to use 20GB for our virtual space because

00:02:55.024 --> 00:02:58.014
we want to allow more room for installation purposes.

00:02:58.014 --> 00:03:02.008
This does not mean that our virtual machine will use a certain amount of

00:03:02.008 --> 00:03:05.028
fixed virtual space, but rather it tells our operating system that

00:03:05.028 --> 00:03:08.016
our virtual machine requires 20GB to run.

00:03:08.016 --> 00:03:12.008
Since we chose the Dynamically Expanding Storage option,

00:03:12.008 --> 00:03:15.014
our virtual space will expand if more space is required.

00:03:15.014 --> 00:03:19.008
Click on Next and you will see the summary of the virtual space

00:03:19.008 --> 00:03:20.019
that we’re going to create.

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.021
Go ahead and click on Finish.

00:03:23.021 --> 00:03:27.025
And then click on Finish again to finish creating our

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:30.007
Windows Server 2008 virtual machine.

00:03:31.028 --> 00:03:34.025
When the setup is finished, the section on the right hand side

00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:37.015
gives us details about our computer; such as RAM,

00:03:37.015 --> 00:03:41.003
hard drive space, operating system, video memory and so on.

00:03:41.003 --> 00:03:45.015
Looking to the left, we can see our Windows Server 2008 Virtual Machine

00:03:45.015 --> 00:03:46.021
that was just created.

00:03:46.021 --> 00:03:48.029
Currently, it is in a powered off mode.

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:53.015
Now, we can click on Start button to install Windows Server 2008 to our virtual machine.

00:03:53.015 --> 00:03:56.016
We hope you enjoyed this video tutorial by LivingTech.
