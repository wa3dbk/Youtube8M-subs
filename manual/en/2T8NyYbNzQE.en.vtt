00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.190
One of the difficulties that schools often have in managing and improving behaviour

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:06.900
is getting real consistency in place,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:10.760
and we know that the more consistent teachers are about the systems that they use,

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.039
the better behaviour gets.

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:17.060
So I developed a very simple checklist of ideas that schools can use and adapt

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:21.789
for themselves in order that they can focus on the priorities for the school

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:24.759
that they need to be particularly consistent around.

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:26.789
And I'm here in Whitehall Infants

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.159
looking at the checklist they've developed to see how that's changed and

00:00:30.159 --> 00:00:33.610
improved the management of behaviour in the school.

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.060
So, Katy, how did you develop the checklist here at Whitehall Infants?

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.890
We sat down as a small group of teachers and

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.000
we were going to trial the checklist in our classrooms. We've got lots of things 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.850
embedded in our school in terms of behaviour at the moment anyway so it was mainly just a matter of pulling those things 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:54.250
together and seeing which things were most important for us to embed into our classrooms further.

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.410
How has it been effective in improving and managing behaviour in your class?

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.850
In my class lots of our routines were already in place, but what it does for us,

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.440
it just reminds us

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.330
any little bits that are out of sync - or particularly if somebody else comes in to take the class -

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.680
they know exactly what to do, exactly what our structures are, 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.860
and it really goes much more smoothly.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.460
And how would it be useful for

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.780
other teachers in other schools do you
think?

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.889
I think it could be really valuable, particularly for newer teachers or 

00:01:22.889 --> 00:01:24.549
teachers who are just starting off in a school.

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:28.920
And it really makes it consistent across the school so it's fantastic

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.979
in terms of leadership that they can make sure that there's that consistency across the school as well.

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.229
Because as we know, consistency is one of the most important things when it comes to managing behaviour as well, isn't it?

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:42.370
Yup, and for the children as well, they need that consistency. So this really puts it in place.

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:46.940
So, Christina, how has the behaviour checklist been useful in your class? 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.909
It's been really effective. I make sure they have their carpet places and their  lining up order,

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.140
and that's quite visual as well because I have it up on the door so they're able to see that.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.590
And what about... I noticed you had the attention grabber, What was that all about?

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.590
We use a rainstick and it's quite effective because you're not using your voice.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.590
[Rainstick sound]

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.899
Fantastic, penguins, first time every time today! 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.440
It's a different way of stopping the children: so you just do that a few times.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.920
They all have to be looking up at you. You have to be consistent with it as well, so and

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.790
make sure you're always using the rainstick. You could alternate to different behaviour management strategies

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.069
but keep it the same.
