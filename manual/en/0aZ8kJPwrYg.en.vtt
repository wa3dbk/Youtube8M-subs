00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:06.309
Hi, I'm Jim. I am an advantage gambler,
a sports bettor, a poker player, a blackjack

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:13.309
card-counter, an edge seeker, a value bettor,
an arbitrageur,...

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.300
Hi, I'm Jim. I am an advantage gambler.
That means risking money on games of chance,

00:00:24.329 --> 00:00:29.980
when I have an edge. Like betting on a coin
flip at better than even odds. I am constantly

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:35.170
seeking these opportunities in all sorts of
gambling. That includes sports betting, online

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:40.180
poker and blackjack.
I began with card counting at blackjack tables,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:46.660
then moved to sports trading at betting exchanges,
played online poker for several years and

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.790
ended up investing in US stock markets and
forex.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:56.790
..., an online trader, a stock trader, a forex
trader, a futures trader, a sports trader,

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.600
an analyst, a financial writer, a financial
blogger,...

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.370
Trading also falls under the Gambling category,
although a few admit it. There are too many

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.070
similarities to ignore. From how few people
can make it pay, to how brokers earn commission

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:18.740
like gambling operators earn the Vigorish,
or simply the vig, also known as juice, the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:23.490
cut or the take.
Using risk management skills developed in

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.240
advantage gambling, a gambler is able to beat
the markets. The workflow is almost the same:

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.670
build a system, back test it, and rake in
the profits.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.650
Nowadays though I mostly write than gamble
or invest, fulfilling my creative needs.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.650
...,a web entrepreneur, a web developer, a
writer, a domainer, a blogger, a video blogger,...

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:51.190
Blogging and writing online have been so much
fun. Risking money all day long can become

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:58.010
a pretty lonely and soul-threating task. Writing
has allowed me not only to feel more creative,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.020
but also to get in touch with like-minded
people around the world like you.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.350
That also led me to learn about web development,
domaining and web design, as I launched quite

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.440
a few websites and blogs all these years to
host my articles. Internet marketing and online

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:18.260
advertising followed naturally and long story
short, I have now incorporated all my web

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.150
business in my very own digital publishing
and marketing company! Yes, I too can include

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.520
the trendy word 'Founder' in my Twitter
short bio!

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:35.520
...,a video editor, an amateur photographer,
a dSLR video shooter, a YouTuber, a Vimeo'er,...

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:42.310
Images are worth a thousand words, they say.
Adding them in my articles for better exposure,

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:47.940
forced me to learn about photography and videography.
Although not even dreaming of becoming a pro

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:53.620
in those fields, I truly enjoy the whole process
and you'll find me talking about them from

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.110
time to time.
..., a video gamer, an adventure gamer, a

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:03.260
sim-racing gamer, an RPG gamer, a platform
gamer,...

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.580
I do have other hobbies besides risking money
to make a living, like video gaming. Hopefully,

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:13.200
my random posts and videos about them won't
drive you away.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.200
But, why I do all that, instead of focusing
on a single thing? There's a saying in investing:

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.670
Adapt or die.
I never know what I'll do next. The gambling

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:30.910
and investing world is strange. You can find
yourself on the top of a mountain with a very

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:35.849
successful strategy, only to find yourself
drowning in the ocean, when your strategy

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:41.120
stops working out of the blue.
This world is always changing, always evolving.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.849
Today's winners may be tomorrow's losers.
Many people compete for an edge. Exploiting

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:53.200
a market imbalance cannot happen indefinitely.
Sooner or later you'll have to adapt. And

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:59.390
I prefer applying a universal rule in investing;
risk diversification.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:06.390
But more importantly, having the luxury to
do whatever I enjoy doing is invaluable. And

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:13.800
that's true freedom.
Hi, I am Jim. I am a free man.
