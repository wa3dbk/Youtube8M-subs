00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:10.429
Here I am in Fira,

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:13.540
I've got about an hour to sightsee.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.540
How do you do an hour?

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:15.980
I want to see the volcano.

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:18.369
In the back, there's the volcano.

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:21.009
I want to see donkeys.

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:22.960
I haven't seen any donkeys yet,

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.390
but I have a feeling they're very very close.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:28.610
I want to see the view.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.210
This part of Santorini is known for it's caldera
view.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.440
The buildings are on the side of the cliffs.

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.240
And whatever there is to see.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:37.410
So, time starts now.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.410
So Go!

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:39.890
Let's see what we can see.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.790
Fira is a popular town for tourists and backpackers.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.899
It's ripe with accommodations, cafes and shops
to visit.

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.820
It's also located next to an active volcano.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.490
The streets and pathways.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:59.989
There's a lot of stores and shops and souvenir
shopsâ€¦

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.550
A lot.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:11.110
Volcano stone.

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.280
The red sand beach is something you can't
miss.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.030
The dramatic cliffs and red and black volcanic
pebbles

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:26.720
in the sand make this experience truly unique.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.450
Santo Wines is a well known winery.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.860
It's not far from the main port and

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.830
it's the perfect spot to kick back and

00:01:33.830 --> 00:02:00.290
watch the sunset with a glass of wine.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:13.260
Wow.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.920
So way across there is the port

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.150
where I came into with Blue Star ferries.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.900
I'm in Oia so I'm all the way on the opposite
side.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:31.180
There's Fira in the distance.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.140
So I guess getting all around here,

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.359
took maybe like half and hour or forty five
minutes?

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:43.209
It didn't feel like that long but it sure
looks it.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.310
In Santorini, the churches are privately owned
by families so

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.949
they're not all open daily or are accessible
to the public but

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:51.820
they add to the architectural beauty of the
island.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:52.820
So right now i ..

00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:08.469
feel sorry for the donkey I've been seeing.

00:03:08.469 --> 00:03:16.269
I feel like I'd never want to come back in
my life as one.

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:27.139
Because these stairs, they may be wide, but
they're steep!

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.919
I've seen them pack all that stuff on donkeys.

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:34.060
After climbing these stairs,

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.489
I could never ride on one of those donkey..

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:44.040
Definitely Never.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.239
The best highlights of Santorini are its picturesque
sunsets.

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:49.989
You just can't take a bad photo.

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:52.279
The most dramatic ones are off the cliffs,

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:55.159
facing seaside and towards the sun.

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:03.599
Total god rays.

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.280
Here I have some tomato balls.

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.370
It happens to be the traditional

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:20.000
specialty of Santorini so I had to try it.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.340
So this is a perfect couple's cove

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.210
where you can come to have a cup of coffee,

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.440
so I had to sit here and smooch with myself.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:34.830
Because it's just me, you and Oia Santorini.

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.099
That's the honeymoon.

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:43.560
Okay, that's limp and lame.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:51.189
Let's try it again-- One two three.

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:52.279
Hi.
