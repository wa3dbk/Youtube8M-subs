00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.200
Chris: Our culture is founded on five principles.

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.200
On screen: Five Principles Graphic and List

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.200
Virginia: Quality.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.200
Timothy: Responsibility.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.200

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:11.200
Chris: Efficiency.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.200
Juan: And freedom.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.200
Timothy: Quality is the number-one principle
for Nutro.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.759
Art: There's a reason "quality" is listed
first.

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.800
Chris: Here at Nutro, "quality" is a huge
word.

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.900
Juan: I think quality means everything to
this company.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.520
Type on screen: QUALITY STARTS WITH ME

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:23.130
Lisa: Quality starts with me.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.130
Virginia: Quality starts with me.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.310
Chris: It starts from the time that the ingredients
come into the building.

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.620
Guillermo: We do about 600 quality checks.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:33.150
Virginia: 600 checks is a lot of checks.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.990
Guillermo: That ensures the quality of food
safety of our product.

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.990
Virginia: PV testing.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.250
Chris: Checking, double checking ...

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.250
Guillermo: Protein.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:40.250
Fat.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.250
Chris: Even triple checking.

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.250
Virginia: Moisture checks at the drier.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.730
Moisture checks at the APEC.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.730
Density checks.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.890
Virginia: We also do finished-product checks.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.079
Chris: We hold a daily assessment panel, also
known as the daily "cutting."

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.130
Guillermo: To look at the size.

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:55.920
We look at the texture of the product, the
smell.

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.120
How it looks, you know, from the customer's
standpoint.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:02.559
Virginia: There are certain specifications
that have to be met.

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:04.549
And if they're not, then it doesn't get shipped.

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:05.549
01:05: Type on screen: WE OWN OUR PET FOOD
PLANTS

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.790
Chris: Here at Nutro, we own our own plants.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:08.790
Art: It's made here.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.430
We have 100 percent control of it.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.810
Chris: We are obsessed with being clean.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.530
Art: We get visitors in that, you know, are
wowed by what they see.

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.799
Chris: Every tour that I have ever given here
at Nutro, the tour always tells me that this

00:01:21.799 --> 00:01:39.490
is the cleanest pet food plant that they have
ever been in.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:58.799
Lisa: Everybody here understands that regardless
of whether you're sweeping the floor, or whether

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.030
you're cooking the food, or whether you're
packaging it out, or whether you're the site

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.889
manager ... everybody's job is important.

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:09.690
Chris: We don't rely on a co-packer to help
us make our product.

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.569
Lisa: At a co-packer, you have no idea.

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:13.060
Art: You really don't have that control.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.019
You don't know truly what that co-packer is
doing with your product.

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.160
So, we have that 100 percent control over
it.

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.549
I think (it) gives us just a, you know, fantastic
advantage over our competitors.

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.840
Lisa: We know exactly what's on the label
is what's in the bag.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:30.840
02:30 Type on screen: THE NATURAL AUTHORITY
Natural fortified with vitamins, minerals

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.840
and other trace nutrients.

Art: Nutro is all-natural, no preservatives.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:34.829
Chris: We believe nutrition is found in nature.

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.530
Guillermo: We only use high-quality, natural
ingredients.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.360
Juan: The more natural, the better.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.349
Guillermo: Natural ingredients are healthier,
more nutritional for our pets.

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.629
Lisa: Whenever I feed my pets Nutro, I never
have any doubt what's going in their bowl.

00:02:46.629 --> 00:02:50.040
Guillermo: Pet owners expect the best product
from Nutro.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:51.489
And that's what we provide.

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:52.489
02:53 Type on screen: SUSTAINABILITY

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:56.470
Art: Earlier in the year, my boss approached
me and challenged me with this objective of

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:57.470
zero-landfill.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.260
I was pretty excited about that.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.040
I really enjoy working towards it, you know,
helping the environment.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.040
I care about this.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.620
When you compare this year to last year, the
same timeframe, we've actually reduced our

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:11.060
contribution to the landfill by 82 and a half
percent.

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.370
03:07 Type on screen: 82.5% Reduction in Waste

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.180
Chris: Everybody cares about what we're doing,
and they're very proud of this company.

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.079
Lisa: "Quality" is a word that's just thrown
around from company to company, but here at

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:24.769
Nutro, our name is on that product.

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.250
It's not just a pet food.

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.430
When it's got our name on it, that's us, that's
who we are.

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:32.580
Chris: What we do is highly technical.

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.000
It's scientific.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.359
It's very demanding.

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.370
That's what it takes to make the best pet
food in the world.
