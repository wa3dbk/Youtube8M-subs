00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:06.070
Hi, I'm Tam.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:14.340
I'm going to show you how to make a wrap bracelet
with jump rings, or washers, or any kind of

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.670
washer-type hardware.

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:18.390
So, these I actually got from the hardware
store.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.769
These are actual jump rings from the jewelry
supply.

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:25.509
You can actually use anything as long as it
has a hole in it that your string will go

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:26.509
through.

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:31.289
So basically, it's a braided bracelet and
you wear it like this.

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.680
It's another fun summer bracelet.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.350
So this is what it looks like.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.129
And on the sample I'm going to show you with
two different colored cords so that you can

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.780
see the braiding.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.469
This is three pieces of one yard of any cord.

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.350
So it can be waxed cotton cord, which is what
I'm using, or it can be leather.

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.239
You are going to just lay them like this.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:07.430
I'm going to do the olive green in the middle
with the blue on the side.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:14.890
I'm going to make a knot about four inches
down from the ends, and once again, to make

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:21.659
a nice knot, I keep everything parallel as
I make the knot.

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.460
That gives you a nice, neat knot.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:34.520
I'm just going to pull each one and tighten
it.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.969
So then it looks like that.

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.720
For this you'll probably need a clipboard
just to hold it while you're braiding the

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:42.979
cord.

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.490
So basically, this is just like braiding hair,
but for those who don't know how to braid

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:56.549
hair, you have three strands and you're always
going to bring one over, so the left side

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.930
over to the middle, and that becomes the middle,
and then the right side.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.130
So whichever that you bring to the middle
becomes the middle cord.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.250
Then you just bring each side over.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.750
So you separate the three strands, and we're
going to take the left strand over the center

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:19.150
strand, so that the left strand is now your
center strand.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.140
Then you're going to take your right strand
over your new center strand.

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.310
So basically it's just moving from one side
to the middle, and then the other side to

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.319
the middle.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.400
It's up to you if you want a tighter braid
or a looser braid.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:45.950
That's totally up to you, and depends on your
design.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:52.670
It's just a little hard to manipulate because
you've got to hold everything down.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:03:00.090
You can do something with a lot of washers
or just a few washers.

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:03.920
So these are from the hardware store so the
more you put on, it's a little heavy.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:04.920
They're zinc.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.629
So for something like this, I probably wouldn't
use that many, just because they would be

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:10.780
really heavy.

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:14.370
Okay, so now I'm going to start adding my
first washer.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:22.900
I'm going 
to add to the right side.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:38.819
I'm going to add the washer, and then I'm
going to bring it over to the middle.

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:49.730
Then I'm going to add a washer to the left
side.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:50.750
So here's the tricky part.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:58.790
You want to make sure that they're all going
in the same direction, the washers.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.510
Then I'm going to bring that to the middle.

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.239
So you see how they're all like this?

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:07.260
That's what you want.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:09.079
You want them to look stacked.

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:18.209
Like you can see here, they're all stacked
in a row.

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:29.230
So then I brought that left side into the
middle, and now I'm going to add another washer.

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:37.490
You want to make sure, again, that it's going
to be stacked up.

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:42.680
Okay, so we're just continuing braiding.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:57.320
I'm going to add just one more, and then I'm
going to continue braiding without the washers.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.760
Now, because I'm getting to the bottom of
the clipboard and I need more grip, I'm just

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:17.510
going to move the whole unit up on the clipboard
so that we get a better grip on the whole

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:18.850
thing.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:32.600
And then we just continue braiding.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:40.560
You can decide to leave a longer fringe and
add little beads on them.

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:41.720
That's one of your options.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.370
Then you would stop braiding earlier.

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.960
I'm going to stop it right here for now.

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:52.850
And then you want to kind of straighten it
by pulling it a little bit, just to make the

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.470
tension all even.

00:05:54.470 --> 00:06:02.750
Then you see how your washers are all nicely
stacked.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:17.330
Okay, then just make a knot.

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:31.050
Then you just tie it here.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:36.780
I think this style sort of works well with
these dangles, so that's why I didn't do the

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:37.840
closure.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:43.670
You could use three different colored cords
or the same colored cords, so it looks like

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.670
this.

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:50.850
This one I did graduated jump rings so they're
large, medium, to small, or all the same size.
