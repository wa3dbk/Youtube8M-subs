Friday, November the 1st, 2013.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.300
This Week on GOG: In case you missed it, here's what's new!

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.100
Pixels! sea-monsters! side-scrolling! chiptunes! bullet hell!
submarines! local co-op! milk mining! retro! and kittens!  

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:25.400
No, I did not just shout a bunch of random words at you,
I'm not that crazy. What you heard, was a pretty accurate-
if not very coherent-description of Aqua Kitty: Milk Mine Defender,  

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:32.700
a retro-styled fast-paced horizontal-scrolling shooter. 
Man (umm… Cat?) your submarine and take your part in 
kitty history by helping

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:41.000
to defend oceanic milk mines from rampaging mechanical creatures 
of the deep. That's one small pounce for a cat, but one giant pounce 
for catkind!

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:49.800
Do you know fear? I mean, do you know it personally? Have you ever 
experienced true horror of a life-threatening situation? 

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:59.700
Outlast, a sensational survival horror game based on stealth and 
the player's ability to escape danger, tells a story so terrifying 
and gripping, that it feels a bit too real for some gamers. 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.800
While recording the disturbing images you're watching right now, our 
video intern screamed with fear and we felt kind of sorry for her. . 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:16.000
The story of a mental asylum overrun by murderous, monstrous 
maniacs was probably a bit too much like work at the office 
for her, but will have you screaming as well. You have been warned.
  

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:25.600
If you prefer the odd and strange than gory and unexpected, if you
enjoy small-town atmosphere and narrative similar to David Lynch's
cult-classic Twin Peaks,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.200
and if you love twisted characters in your fiction, you should definitely 
check out Deadly Premonition: Director's Cut. 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:39.700
In this action-adventure horror game you'll be investigating a bizarre 
serial murder case in provincial America, as a special federal agent, 
Francis York Morgan.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:46.000
Entering this one-of-a-kind open-world full of weird events and people
is surely a gaming experience unlike any other. 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:54.900
Any old-school isometric RPG fans in the audience? Of course there 
are--this is GOG, after all. Well, this one's for you. And me. 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.900
Avadon 2: The Corruption, is the long-awaited continuation of 
Spiderweb Software's role-playing saga, that 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.900
feels, looks, and plays just like the best isometric RPGs you 
remember so fondly from the good old days.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:14.400
With a huge open world to explore, great depth of gameplay, and 
multiple endings, this title delivers the best of modern 
computer role-playing experience in a classic oldschool package.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:21.100
In Entomorph: Plague of the Dark Fall we revisit the World of Aden, 
known from the underworld-roaming classic, Thunderscape. 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:30.200
This isn't a direct sequel, though. The game focuses on exploration of 
the surface world, this time around, and the land's struggle to 
overcome the monstrous invading force, known as the darkfall.

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:37.700
With more action-focused gameplay, plenty of puzzles, and a clear 
top-down perspective, this classic light-RPG title is more than 
meets the eye. 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.000
Let's just say there's a squishy center under that chitin coating.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.500
The Lone Survivor: Director's Cut is… you guessed it: a survival 
horror game. Oh, but it's nothing like you think.  

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:54.700
This game isn't aiming to scare you. It want's to mess with your head, 
instead. And not by jump-scare tactics, oh no. It has other ways 
to get to you.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:01.600
As you guide the hero through a dark, plague-ridden world, you begin 
to lose track of what is real and what is just a delusion.  

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.600
This original, retro-looking title full of intense narrative proves to be 
more thought-provoking than most contemporary titles.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:15.800
Let's finish off with something lighter in tone, shall we? A 
heart-touching story of a little girl chasing through a 
storybook-like land after her kidnapped sibling,

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.800
while she's drawn into an adventure of her lifetime--that's Lilly Looking Through.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:29.100
If you're looking for a game that you can play with your kid, or simply 
to pamper your inner child with, you can't go wrong with this gorgeous
title full of dreamy scenery, great animation and fun puzzles.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:38.700
Harness the power of magical goggles and learn to bend reality to 
your needs. Impossible? Not for Lilly, the main character, who's 
a child limited only by her own imagination.

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:41.000
And here's a hint for an upcoming enigmatic release:

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.200
It shall be, as it was foretold. How cryptic is that, right!?

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:49.500
