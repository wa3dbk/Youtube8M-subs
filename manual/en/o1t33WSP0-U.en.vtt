00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.640
I'm here at a fantastic
state school in London,

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:05.720
where I've been watching
some superb science teaching.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:07.720
And the reason why
I'm so glad to be here

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:11.440
is because we're launching our new
strategy for teacher training,

00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:13.280
which is explicitly designed
to make sure

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:17.000
that we can get more
top scientists into the classroom.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:20.480
I think it's wonderful when you see
a physicist, chemist, a biologist,

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.000
who loves their subject,
communicating their passion

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.520
to the next generation.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.000
And that's why I want to persuade
more people with great degrees

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.360
from our top universities
to come into the classroom

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.320
to reinforce the very welcome trend
of the last few years

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.080
which has seen teaching become
a more high-status profession,

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.560
attracting more and more
great people.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.320
We all know
how important teaching is.

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.760
In the past, we've not had enough
physics teachers.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.720
Sometimes,
physics has been taught by teachers

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.600
who don't have a background in
physics. Maybe chemistry or biology.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.480
While they'd be excellent teachers,
sometimes they're not able to

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:00.280
satisfy all the pupils' questions
about physics.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.320
So it's absolutely vital
that the person who teaches physics

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.600
is someone who is an excellent
physicist with a degree in physics.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.040
And that's what, I think,
we're trying to encourage.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.520
This new commitment
by the government to help encourage

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.760
more physics graduates
and top-notch physics graduates

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.880
to enter teaching
is very, very welcome.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.720
At last,
we're starting to see a turnaround

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.240
of more physics graduates going into
teaching as a profession of choice.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.000
Not cos they couldn't
get a job in industry,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.200
which may be better paid, but because
that's what they really want to do.

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.200
We know that as a result
of physicists like Brian Cox

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.960
and Jim Al-Khalili that they're
a growing interest in the subject.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:45.200
And I think everything we can do to
encourage more young boys and girls

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.080
to study maths and physics,
to go onto degrees in engineering,

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.280
we should do that, because there's
a huge demand for their skills

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.440
and it's a route to real
intellectual and economic fulfilment.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.320
I would love to be
a particle physicist.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.840
They just work with
subatomic particles.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.400
They usually experiment by
smashing them together, like in CERN.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.320
I'd just love to be a part of that,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.280
cos it's quite influential research,
I think.

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.200
I think the government's plans
are really good at the moment.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.200
I think they'd encourage more people
to take an interest in physics.

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.600
Because I think it's a subject which
not many people know much about.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.480
There's lots of...
People assume that it's quite hard,

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.520
and so people
usually steer away from it.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.160
But they don't actually realise
how interesting it can be.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:35.600
So I think, if the government
did go forward with their plans,

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.960
it would just encourage more people
to take part, really.
