If you love tomatoes, then growing them home offers a real treat.

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:08.849
Nothing beats the taste of that fresh plucked, home-grown, sun-warm

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:13.200
tomato. Hi, I'm William Moss and I'm going to give you seven easy tips for

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.410
for growing perfect tomatoes.

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:19.439
First let's talk about the types of
tomatoes. There are the larger slicing

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.369
tomatoes,

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.800
which we use for sandwiches, salads...
There are the paste tomatoes,

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.970
that are very good in our spaghetti and our pizza,

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.930
for making those sauces.  And then there
are the cherry and snacking tomatoes.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.300
They're a little smaller but easier to grow,
and they also are sweet

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.460
so kids love them. And they're all easy to grow
with the seven simple tips.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.270
Number one is plant them in full sun. They
want about six to eight hours of light

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.700
that really gives them the energy to make these
big juicy tomatoes.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:53.970
They like a lot of warmth as well so be
sure not to plant

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.940
any tomatoes until after the last frost date.
Tip number two:

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.710
Plant in a good soil. Tomatoes need good drainage to grow their best.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.579
Adding compost improves the drainage and also

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:11.200
increases the amount of nutrients in the
soil. Tip number 3:

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.710
Give them some space. Tomatoes need about
two to three feet of space

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.969
to grow properly. When they have their proper spacing,

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:22.009
they can grow big and healthy, and they
have the proper

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:25.039
air circulation which helps prevent
disease.

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:29.899
Tip number 4:  Stake or cage your tomatoes.
The easiest way to harvest the most

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:32.209
tomatoes is to provide a good support
system.

00:01:32.209 --> 00:01:37.939
Add the cage while they're small and they'll
grow up through it. Tip number 5:

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.400
water your tomatoes. Tomatoes are about
90% water

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.869
so to get those plump juicy fruits, you're going to need about an inch

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.800
a week. And when you water, be sure to
water

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.700
the soil and the roots but not the leaves.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.630
That way you prevent any diseases.
Especially those nasty fungal blights.

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.869
Tip number six: Watch for pests.

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.800
You want to just check your tomato out, turn over a few leaves.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:07.800
And you're typically looking for that tomato
hornworm.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.979
It can eat several leaves in just a night.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.260
It's easy to take care of though. Just pick 'em off or flick 'em off

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.970
into a cup of  soapy water and you'll
be fine. Tip number seven:

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.000
Fertilize your tomatoes. Feed your tomatoes

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.110
with a slow release fertilizer. You want to sprinkle all around the roots,

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.110
that way it'll feed them for a long time. And
there you have it...

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:33.800
seven tips to growing perfect tomatoes. And when you 
have too many tomatoes this

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.390
summer,

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.000
you can pass them right along the neighborhood
you'll be the most popular person on the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.380
block.
