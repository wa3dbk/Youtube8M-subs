Pixel Art Friday!

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.260
Let's build:

00:00:06.280 --> 00:00:09.940
The Puppet (From Five Night at Freddy's)

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:20.080
It's watching you!

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:35.340
It's Friday again which means pixel art! It also means we should announce this week's winners!

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:44.580
On Facebook,  Matt Perez was the last to answer! Congratulations, you are the first winner!

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:53.820
On YouTube, Matt Perez was the last to answer as well! Congratulations, you are also the second winner!

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:02.200
Keep watching till the end of the video to see this week's question!

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:24.960
If you have ideas for future pixel arts, leave them in the comments below or on my Facebook!

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:45.960
You could stop here and call it finished, you can also add some of the 3D-effects I showed you earlier!

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:57.300
This will make it more interesting to look at and a lot creepier!

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:01.880
This week's question is:

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:12.840
Why is the puppet crying?

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:22.080
Answer on both Facebook and YouTube, the last to answer wins!

00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:32.940
Need more spooky pixel art?
