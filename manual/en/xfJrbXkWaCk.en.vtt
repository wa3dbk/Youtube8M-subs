00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.060
-[Curtis Smith] Welcome back, I'm Curtis Smith. Today we're outside Lovington at pumpkin flats market garden,

00:00:10.060 --> 00:00:12.290
where we're looking at some greenhouses.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:15.050
And greenhouses are something important to New Mexicans because they help us stretch the season,

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:20.060
so we can garden year-round. And here at
this market garden is a place where house

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:23.420
plants are grown in the greenhouse, but
also they start some seedlings and things.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.640
And Ginny Stevens has invited us
to come see it.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.680
-[Ginny Stevens] Morning Curtis, how are you?

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.940
-[Curtis] Ginny, you are one of our Lea County Master Gardeners.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.200
And you are gonna share with us your greenhouse.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.180
Which is very interesting because it's a greenhouse made from recycled materials.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.520
-[Ginny] Yes, all recycled.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.320
-[Curtis] And it's homemade.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.840
-[Ginny] Uh-huh, totally homemade.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.840
-[Curtis] And it was actually hand-dug. Because you got it sunk into the ground,

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.080
so you've got less wind exposure.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.940
It's a really interesting greenhouse. And I see it here, and I see you've got a little extra winter protection.

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.420
-[Ginny] Yeah, this is my winter blanket.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.040
This is an old motor home cover that fits perfectly over the top of the greenhouse.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.160
And at night when it gets cold, we put it
over and it helps keep some of the heat inside.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.880
-[Curtis] And if you have to leave it there
for a couple of days, it's not gonna hurt the plants.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.340
-[Ginny] It's not gonna hurt the plants at all.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:05.260
-[Curtis] it'll hurt a lot less than the cold.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:08.840
So you've got this as an extra covering, but you've got a plastic covering on the greenhouse.

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.440
White plastic difuses light very nicely.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.000
I notice it has some holes cut in it.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.660
-[Ginny] Yeah, those were those were cut in by the original owners of the cover.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:19.020
It was given to me by a commercial greenhouse.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.700
-[Curtis] So it is a recycled greenhouse cover?

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.520
-[Ginny] Yes it's a recycled
greenhouse cover, also.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.520
-[Curtis] And so it works good, it's holding together?

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.440
-[Ginny] Right yeah. I've had this cover on for about three years.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.520
-[Curtis] Okay, and then inside
you've got plants growing?

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.760
-[Ginny] Yes I do. Would you like to

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.560
-[Curtis] Yeah I'd like to see it. It's been cold though, so we'll see what things look like.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.980
-[Ginny] Okay, let's walk on the inside
and I'll show you.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.980
-[Curtis] Okay.

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.520
It's warm in here.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.100
-[Ginny] It's really nice, isn't
it Curtis?

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.980
-[Curtis] A greenhouse is supposed to be nice and warm this time of year.

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.180
I wanna keep it closed so the cold air stays outside.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.300
-[Ginny] Yeah, keep a little bit of the warm air in
here.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:00.200
-[Curtis] It is nice, and see the ventilation holes we talked about from outside.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.400
But
it's warm in here. right they're not they

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.640
-[Ginny] Right, they don't make that much difference.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.860
-[Curtis] Okay, really cold windy time, you use the other cover and it's covered up.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.760
Could you tell us a little bit about how you came to build this?

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:12.660
I noticed the first
thing you had to do was to dig a hole.

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:18.100
-[Ginny] Right, we hand dug this. And the reason why we did that was because soil stays at fifty five degrees,

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.600
three feet down. And we figured
that with that,

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.960
we could maintain some of our winter heat inside of here.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.980
Then we lined it with the tires, and filled the tires full of dirt for more buffer.

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.140
-[Curtis] The thermal mass will absorb the heat so it keeps the heat in here.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.960
You could have also used barrels of water.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.760
-[Ginny] Right. Well in fact, I do have a greenhouse that's lined with fifty five gallon black barrels.

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:42.400
-[Curtis] We'll have to take a look at
that in a minute.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.960
But this holds the heat, and things are growing in here.

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:47.700
You've had
some temperatures here down to five degrees?

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:49.520
-[Ginny] Five degrees, yes uh-huh.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.920
-[Curtis] So this has stayed alive and healthy with what you've got, even with that temperature.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.200
Okay and then the structure, the frame.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.620
-[Ginny] Right, well we started off with the middle struts, and then we reinforced them with PVC.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.140
And it's a
pretty sturdy little greenhouse.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.280
Of course being lower, the winds don't bother it
like a higher structure would do.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.820
And then I heat it--supplemental heat
it with my heat lamps.

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.660
-[Curtis] They're nice and warm. On a cool day like this that's nice.

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:15.740
-[Ginny] They feel good, don't they?

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.500
-[Curtis] And that doesn't provide a lot of heat, but it's enough.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.880
-[Ginny] Enough. I've lost a few thing in here on really cold winters,

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.040
but most of the stuff--it slows down its growth.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.320
But I have things
blooming here that seem to like the cooler temperatures.

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:31.500
-[Curtis] Okay, let's see how
you put this together.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.620
I see that you put the metal in, and I see some metal screws that hold things together.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.320
-[Ginny] Right yeah, it's all screwed together with
sheet metal screws.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.660
-[Curtis] That's simple, not hard to do. And it holds up against the wind?

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.900
-[Ginny] Yes it does.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.400
It gets a little bit noisy in here in the springtime when the wind blows really hard, nut its not too bad.

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.860
I've never worried about losing it and having it roll through the pasture.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.370
-[Curtis] Have
you had any problems with hail storms?

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:56.600
-[Ginny] No I never have.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:59.620
-[Curtis] So the hail doesn't hurt--flexible plastic is better than glass for that.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.900
Let's look at some of the plants here.

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.000
We've got all kinds of things from--this
is euphorbia but called pencil cactus.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:11.900
It's doing well. We've got a jade plant, and you've got the hearts and flowers.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.400
And you've got sea lavender here.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.900
-[Ginny] Yeah, I have gotten some of those started.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:18.220
-[Curtis] There is just a wide
variety, so a lot of things.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:19.900
For your personal garden?

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:25.500
-[Ginny] These are--some of these came out of the yard that I keep in containers,

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.660
and I bring them in,
in the winter time, to winter them over.

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:29.700
Some of them are for sale.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.750
-[Curtis] Well Ginny, this one's pretty much bare bones so we can the structure here,

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.080
and it looks
pretty much the same.

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:39.340
-[Ginny] Yes it is Curtis, the only thing different is we used wood for the supports, instead of PVC.

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:42.440
Because we had some old wood that was
available that we could use.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:43.900
-[Curtis] This is recycled plastic still?

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.700
-[Ginny] Right uh-huh. The struts
are recycled and well everything in here is just recycled.

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.900
-[Curtis] And these
are things--the barrels or recycled and they hold water?

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.240
-[Ginny] Yes, we filled them
with water and they retain the heat for us.

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:59.560
-[Curtis] So something simple for anyone to do, is look for what materials at hand

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:02.440
and they can build a greenhouse out of
recycled material.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:06.440
And greenhouses are a good thing to have in New Mexico, so consider that. Thank you Ginny.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.460
-[Ginny] Thank you very much Curtis.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.380
