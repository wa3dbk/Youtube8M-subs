00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:06.100
Hey, Guy Cochran, here today and what we're
listening to are two different

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:07.190
sources.

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.740
One is the RODE NTG3 shotgun that's in my
hand.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.080
We've also got a
Sennheiser wireless lavalier on my chest.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.500
What we're testing out here is
the Tascam DR100 portable recorder.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.740
What we're doing here is we're using
the portable recorder mounted on top of the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.770
Canon 5D Mark II.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.270
Hey, Guy Cochran, here today and what we're
listening to are two different

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:31.370
sources.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.899
One is the RODE NTG3 shotgun that's in my
hand.

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:39.230
We've also got a
Sennheiser wireless lavalier on my chest.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.659
What we're testing out here is
the Tascam DR100 portable recorder.

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:46.890
What we're doing here is we're using
the portable recorder mounted on top of the

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.409
Canon 5D Mark II.

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:53.140
Some of you may have had this issue where
you haven't been able to monitor

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.890
the audio coming into your camera, so one
of the things that's nice about a

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:02.620
portable recorder is that now you'll have
the ability to use headphones.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.960
The trouble is that the output out of the
DR100 is a line level so it's

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.960
very, very hot.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.200
The signal is very, very overdriven if you
feed it directly

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.390
into the Canon 5D or the 7D.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.420
So what we found is a cable that is a line
to

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:23.200
mic level cable, and what we're doing is we're
feeding that into the

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.200
camera.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.039
So now we have a sync track that sounds pretty
good, but because of

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:33.189
the camera's automatic gain control, also
known as AGC, we're going to hear

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:34.630
a lot of pumping.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:39.800
So, if we listen for a second, that's the
noise level

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.659
that we're experiencing with complete quiet.

00:01:43.659 --> 00:02:01.640
With the camera's automatic
gain control, it should have brought it up

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.909
to the sound of the room, which
-- there's hardly anything in here.

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:10.369
It's a pretty quiet room.

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:13.620
The point of this whole video is to let you
know that, if you want the

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:19.010
ultimate in sound, you're not going to get
it just by using any kind of

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.510
third party adapter.

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.400
If you want -- just because of the AGC -- you
can use

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.540
the Magic Lantern firmware hack if you'd like
to get rid of the AGC, which

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.540
will help.

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:30.980
But if you want the really purest, cleanest
sound, you're going

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:34.800
to want to use an external recorder and then
sync the two later in post.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.250
So, thanks for watching.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.760
Catch you later.
