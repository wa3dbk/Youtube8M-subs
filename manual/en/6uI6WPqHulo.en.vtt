unless you do that

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:48.330
et cetera but

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.380
it may be you know it was i was getting out
i think that i've ever seen the endeavor an

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.590
article about the add a whole period way over
my head up my hunch is for her that she was

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:57.830
made insurer

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:59.479
that she was fair

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:00.479
and i'm not don't

00:05:00.479 --> 00:05:03.499
i'm not an indiana don't think of me as a

00:05:03.499 --> 00:05:08.340
like you want you put me in a thriller were
on the

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:14.139

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:16.030
want you can always get away with sent

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:22.129
book is can't be sexual on and burgers is
just fine and buddy mainstream for from that

00:05:22.129 --> 00:05:23.220
tight from thinking

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.129
that this is a

00:05:24.129 --> 00:05:25.920
it'd be an actor actress and that's it

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.820
that right initiates but this is pretty research
so she's already time you know that cooking

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.770
show she's got et cetera but that's what the
bridges is going and i thought it was a star

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:35.920
distilled effort right

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:42.920
in the last one is with a audrey %uh partridge
is that were that i was trying out this

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:45.770
i finish high nandini

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:49.119
acknowledge an articulate everything

00:05:49.119 --> 00:05:55.999
because there is no way and gaining insights
reactions like this

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:11.819
anywhere to carl's junior teriyaki burger
was grown pineapple one in just a piece of

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:12.600
me

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.270
trying right away

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:19.120
de for the worst of the four i would bet hard
first of all i can't stand ad for that people

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:21.490
heating food on the beach

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.460
but nobody even poorer on the beach you buy
that and then drive to the beach parking in

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:28.199
front of park at the beach

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:29.039
that you got like

00:06:29.039 --> 00:06:34.469
so she bought the burger drove the beach part
what ninety minutes blade at a blanket

00:06:34.469 --> 00:06:37.419
stepped out of the incredibly colbert

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:38.280
and with that

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:43.319
midway innocents the some the towel you've
laid down i said this is an old list and in

00:06:43.319 --> 00:06:44.889
the early or

00:06:44.889 --> 00:06:46.540
all right so that's right for

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:50.420
but i thought it would be like any american
luxury to two hundred that patridge coupley

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:51.989
i don't think there's a dark

00:06:51.989 --> 00:06:52.970
what one

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.490
o_j_'s center

00:06:54.490 --> 00:06:54.889
expect

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:58.850
so i i i i don't know what is likely not even
act like it and that but i don't even know

00:06:58.850 --> 00:07:02.029
that you want to be an actress i'm assuming
g

00:07:02.029 --> 00:07:04.330
but she wants to right but maybe a

00:07:04.330 --> 00:07:08.710
now much probably doesn't refute they're all
looking for monday morning yeah

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:13.509
so cooking %uh i don't know i'm twenty that
can make a correction is fantastic i think

00:07:13.509 --> 00:07:15.489
i'm let's put our number one

00:07:15.489 --> 00:07:16.979
and then

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:21.719
%um or more school on parents i know people
go on mental override but that was that's

00:07:21.719 --> 00:07:23.499
what started this whole thing

00:07:23.499 --> 00:07:27.389
it's in a shocker milk would pass at number
two as far as the ads

00:07:27.389 --> 00:07:30.680
i will put pubmed number three which seems
like option would be she should have been

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:33.259
number one and then im go with the

00:07:33.259 --> 00:07:37.129
that that that would create a record number
for that sickly easiest thing in the world

00:07:37.129 --> 00:07:42.100
buttonarray companies of ridiculous but anyway
but audrina is number eight

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.410
%uh are there you have it it's official
