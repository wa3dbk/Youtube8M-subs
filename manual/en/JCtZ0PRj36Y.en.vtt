If you wish to marry by civil ceremony in

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.170
Worcestershire, that is at a Register Office
or other approved premises, you should first

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:13.170
contact us.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.170
However, for a ceremony in an approved premises,
you will also need to make arrangements at

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.171
the venue in question.

00:00:15.171 --> 00:00:17.349
In addition both parties will need to give
in person a separate notice of marriage to

00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:18.349
the Superintendent Registrar for the Registration
District where they live.

00:00:18.349 --> 00:01:01.860
A non refundable deposit is payable at the
time of booking the registrar for a ceremony.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:04.970
This is currently £50 and is applicable to
the booking of any ceremony.

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.520
We are also now able to take bookings for
ceremonies between 12 months and 2 years.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:07.799
There is an additional non refundable advanced
booking fee of £50 which is also required

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:08.859
at the time of booking, which is not part
of the attendance fee for the registrar.

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:09.859

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:11.939

to the Registrar more than twelve months before
