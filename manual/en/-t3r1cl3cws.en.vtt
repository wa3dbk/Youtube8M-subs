00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:02.680
In front of me I've got a pasta salad.

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.740
Of course the pasta is cooked in the coffee machine. 

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:09.060
You wanna take it again? Or what do you want me to do know?

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.060
Coffee Machine Cuisine cooks pasta salad

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.720
I'll start with fresh pasta which I put right in the jug here.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.500
It's a good meal for cooking in the coffee machine.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.260
Oh, and here I found some cat hair.  

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.800
I might have taken too much water. Well, in that case I'll stop it.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.980
Of course I want cucumber.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.060
And some cherry tomatoes..

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:37.260
Other people might like to paint or exercise or whatever.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.660
I like to cook in my coffee machine.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.060
Also, I want the avocado!

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.400
You can almost do everything as you can cook on the stove in the coffee machine.

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:49.740
Just be creative. 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.740
Tuna.

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.180
Also, I've got feta cheese.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.260
I've got to pour some of this oil off.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.200
You want tuna, huh? But you can't have it! 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.240
Okey, then..

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:06.240
I think the pasta is ready.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.300
This funnel with the filter is so smart, it works like a strainer!   

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.560
Then I'll put the pasta in the bowl.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.480
And finally adding all of the ingredients.

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:19.980
Olive oil.

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.600
Balsamic vinegar.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.800
My fingers are all slippery because of the tuna..

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.100
And of course I need salt and pepper!

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.520
The feta cheese.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.400
I'm also adding sun dried tomatoes.. 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.520
I'm pretty good on messing up.. It's a bit messy here.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.520
But it doesn't matter to me.

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.520
Now it's almost done.   

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.740
I find it very funny to make a nice presentation.  

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.360
I mean, you're eating with your eyes as well.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:02.380
Sometimes I manage to succeed and sometimes I'm not. Well, it doesn't matter that much to me.

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.380
I think I'm happy with it now.
