00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.620
Now we have the basic shape of our Spiderman
done. We're going to move on and kind of shift

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:11.999
over to the realm of visional details, shading,
tone. Now start here by the eyes. The eyes

00:00:11.999 --> 00:00:18.990
of Spiderman's mask are not open. Despite
the fact that we've actually captured these

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:25.419
with the lines, drawing a super hero is a
lot more than just replicating the lines.

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:31.169
It's also drawing things in. This isn't so
much about color, it's about shape. See actually

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:34.850
once you draw these in, that looks a lot more
like Spiderman's mask. Now there's going to

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:38.070
be a whole bunch of additional like shading
and contrasts we're going to start adding

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.320
in here. Areas that basically show that the
Spiderman here is you know, kind of back lit

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.430
around his head. There's also going to be
like shading down here along the arms. And

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.520
basically the way you can create shading by
I mean simply kind of dragging your pencil

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:58.630
along there, kind of scruffeling kind of back
and forth a little bit, and then basically

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.790
then up around the side of the arms. And a
lot of times around the side of the arms and

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:06.570
the legs, it's going to be like the primary
area of shading as things come out. But you're

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.270
also going to have shading like around the
outside rib too to kind of define the muscles

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.000
more. It's also going to be muscles underneath
this costume you're going to start to be able

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.170
to see, with additional shading here. I mean
this is basically what this will do is further

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:26.960
outline, exaggerate, emphasize you know, the
rippling muscle that's Spiderman, his physique,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:34.400
his form, which just does not come through
when all you have are the lines of the costume.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:40.010
So we're going to continue this in and around
the body and the torso, down along here along

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.130
the sides and in the legs especially. Because
the legs look, I mean gee, look at the legs.

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.170
Those look pretty blank. But by the time we're
actually done with the shading, they're going

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:56.020
to look much more interesting, as we get like
the knee cap features in here, the top of

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:02.250
the calf muscles, the outside of the shin.
And don't just think these things are going

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.343
to stop like, in terms of like the blank area
of the costume. No, these are going to go

00:02:06.343 --> 00:02:11.299
over all pieces of the costume. For example,
back up here near the spider, we're going

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:21.450
to have like the other, mean breast muscles
that come up here in shading here on both

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:25.580
sides of the costume. There's also going to
be some shading we'll put in here, because

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.990
Spiderman's head is right over here. I mean
it's important to really think of where your

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:35.439
light source is coming from. In this case,
our light source is kind of right about here

00:02:35.439 --> 00:02:39.780
and shining out on to the drawing which means
his head's closer to us which means there

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.560
should be a shadow cast from it. So we're
going to continue with the shading effects

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:52.799
until Spiderman's all the way shaded and we
have all of our lighting effects in here,

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:54.060
before moving on to inking.
