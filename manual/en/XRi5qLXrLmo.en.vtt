Greetings, I'm David Gann I am the CEO of
D&amp;Y Laboratories and here at D&amp;Y Laboratories

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:20.059
we are the manufacturer and the holder of
the trademarks and also the owner of the technology

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.149
behind a product called Double Helix Water.

00:00:24.149 --> 00:00:30.719
Now, I'm asked frequently what is Double Helix
Water, what is this water in this little bottle,

00:00:30.719 --> 00:00:35.090
and there's really no simple one line answer
to that.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.000
And normally I refer people to this book here
which you can find on Amazon or on the internet

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.030
called Double Helix Water.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.660
That's a complete description of our work,
but I realize there needs to be a series of

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:56.850
simple little videos which explain exactly
what Double Helix Water is.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.410
So that's what the purpose of these videos
are.

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.890
So, first thing we've got to understand and
establish is, what is this water about, and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.890
what is double helix about. Well, the best
answer to that question is, it's about you.

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:19.920
Your body, my body the people that are filming
this today, their bodies, everybody's made

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.690
out of water.
We're made out of about 70% water. Our blood

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:31.680
and our lungs are about 90% water. So water
makes up the biggest constituent of our body.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.720
And it's good to understand that especially
from a fundamental point of view.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.760
I'm not talking about some sales line or some
buzz word. I'm talking about actually having

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.420
an understanding of the fundamental of water.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.380
And science for many years has considered
that water was found in three phases. A liquid

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:57.380
like a glass of water, ice the solid form
of water and steam or a vapor which is a vapor

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.659
basically. Up in the clouds we have vapor
that is water vapor.

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:10.659
So those were the known phases. But in 1995
my research partner and I Dr. Shui Yin Lo

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.040
we stumbled over a very strange phenomena
in water.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.470
And we began to look at it, and at that time
there was a microscope that had just, that

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.590
was finally hitting the commercial market,
it was called the atomic force microscope.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:32.020
And we found that we could find a particle
inside of water and upon first we thought

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:38.730
it was a form of ice.
And in 1995 we published this paper in Physics

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:43.530
Letters and this paper was our first paper
that we published and it, this paper talks

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.390
about, we thought it was an ice.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:52.390
But after many more years in 2009 after ten
fifteen years of research we published this

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.580
paper which is also in physics letters and
we said, no it's not ice, it is another phase

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:02.720
or form of water.

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.879
It is a solid particle which forms at room
temperature, very very small but it's there

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.410
just the same.

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:13.680
That paper we made enough of it so you could
actually see it, you'd hold it up to the light

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.430
and you'd say well, what's this powder on
this microscope slide?

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:24.410
And you'd look at it, but then you analyzed
it and you go, wow, it's 100% water. So it's

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.830
another phase or form of water.

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.330
So why is this important?

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:35.330
Well, to truly understand ourselves, and understand
how the body self-heals itself one needs to

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:44.720
understand what the basis the, you know the
biggest part of us is water.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:51.720
So water is important to us to have an understanding
of how we as a human body functions.

00:03:54.170 --> 00:04:01.170
This water is so solely water it is no contaminants
whatsoever in this water, there's no drugs,

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:07.220
it's not a curative agent, it is not a drug
it is not meant to cure something or treat

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:11.220
a disease. We're talking about water, ultra
pure water.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:18.220
If you were to go to your local store and
buy a gallon of distilled water, you would

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:25.560
find that the water inside of this is at least
a thousand times to ten thousand times cleaner

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.240
than that distilled water. So we're talking
about water.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:35.610
These video installments are basically just
little educational purposes to teach you about

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:38.819
this newly discovered phase of water.

00:04:38.819 --> 00:04:39.069
Thank you.
