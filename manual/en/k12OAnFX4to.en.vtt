00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.470
hello viewers welcome to computers to do

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.850
my name is sexy and today in and what to
tell you

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.470
that how to detect but the you detect

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:25.119
or not very easy that stopped go to start
menu

00:00:25.119 --> 00:00:28.550
run type cmd and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.470
okay Ive already opened here so and here

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.780
type netstat -ano

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.140
enter this command represents

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.790
complete connectivity from your computer

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:48.390
to the Internet here we have local
address

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.810
which represent your computer IP with

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:55.000
and my IP is 192.168.1.2

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.470
as you can see someone 127 ips
these ips represents

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.950
Vmware software and it's something
different

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.000
you don't have to worry about its
nothing and your we have foreign address right now

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.090
I am NOT connected to any external

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.520
computer because I'm not using yahoo
messenger

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.040
msn messenger, and I am not browsing

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.180
and safe and totally disconnected

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.960
to the other computers and hear this
stat showing that I'm not connected to anything

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.060
and here we have PID  (process identifier)

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.050
I am gonna talk this about later right
now I'm going to

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:43.050
browse the Internet here

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.670
so

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.340
Ive opened Google and now I'm connected to
the Internet

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.640
so Im gonna go and type again netstat -ano enter

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:06.460
and now as you can see, I am connected it to
the lots of ips now

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.990
where some foreign ips

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:13.250
established to 0.0.0.0 which is nothing to
worry about it

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.020
because this internal IP's and I told you
already its something different and you wont

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:22.890
see this in your computer now here you can see some different IP's connected

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:26.210
to my Lan ip which is 192 and 
here

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:30.020
some ips established to process identifier

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:34.860
3300. Now what is this? again now go to

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:38.810
properties here task manager, process
tab

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.470
as you can see here another PID
column

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.860
which representing numbers

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.270
this is actually process identifier

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.590
which represents applications to
the ips

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:56.670
and to internet if you cant see this

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.760
go to here check this column okay

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.260
now see this, this is

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.550
3300 and you gotta see this same

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.739
number here here is that the same
identify here

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:15.930
this represent AVG which means that I'm
connected to the Internet through a

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:16.580
AVG

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:19.830
obviously I am using firewall thats
why

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:24.520
you might not using firewall or not using any antivirus at all

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.840
so you don't worry about it so

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.870
im gonna disconnect again here

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:37.870
and now typing again I have been
disconnected to

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:41.660
everything so what i mean to say is that

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:45.080
you disconnect everything from your
computer your msn messenger and your browser

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:49.110
everything everthing

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.330
Even then if you are connected to any IP it means that

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.730
someone accessing your computer without your
permission

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.440
you should check the process
identification

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.989
again in the process tab if you find ohh

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:07.170
there was an update client running a
background then toss this

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.560
again check and if you see another IP's

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.910
connected it means that something wrong
you should install new antivirus

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:16.430
you should

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.519
contact your network administrator you
should be contact

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:22.970
whatever computer assistant or something
whatever

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:27.440
you have to do well you have to do what
I mean is just if you feel that

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.960
something wrong

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.790
and someone might be connected to
your computer or

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:36.520
watching or desktop this is not a
100%

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.620
there are a lot of way to trace but its

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:43.540
better than nothing I hope you
understand me

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.170
if you don't please feel free to ask me bye bye
