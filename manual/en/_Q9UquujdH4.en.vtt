Thanks everyone for joining us this morning the opening day of the of the show.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:19.920
This june is going to mark our 30th year since I started making paint in a barn with

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:24.689
My father Sam and my mother Adele and my wife Barbara.

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:28.949
I can't think of a better way to get a jump start on this celebration

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:36.269
Than to be able to celebrate with friends partners in this industry that have made these last 30 years possible.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.319
We started out as just a small with a plan then the plan was to just make paint for some of my father's friends,

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:51.239
and those professional artists for the first five years of the business supported that and turned that plan into a company, and

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:57.899
That small cow barn into an actual paint factory. Since the beginning we tried to create an environment where people

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.469
can thrive because we truly believe if people thrive

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.680
then so will the company. These philosophies led us to start an employee stock ownership program in

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:13.890
2002 so not only where employees are supposed to act like owners to feel like owners,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:20.849
But they were in fact owners of GOLDEN Artist Colors. We just had one of our longtime employees retire from

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:28.618
From GOLDEN Sue Boyce and probably some of you folks have been able to had a chance to speak to Sue,

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.889
Sue was our receptionist for 22 years was the voice of

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:34.650
GOLDEN Artist Colors.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.419
She'd be the one handling all of our customers all of our vendors

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.390
She was the one that was

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:47.939
the person that also was the block so if a insurance agent or an

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.559
Investment broker called Sue would stop him right at the door one investment broker

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.670
got really angry and said Sue I want to speak to an owner and Sue said I

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:02.789
am an owner and you're still not getting through it was that kind of dedication that kind of

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:09.289
Support that kind of sense of ownership that I'm proud to announce that as of April fifth 2010

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.070
The employees of GOLDEN Artist Colors are we're now under new ownership

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.490
GOLDEN Employees are now the majority owners of GOLDEN Artist Colors. We're all proud

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:27.720
To be one of only four thousand other companies across the United States 30 million companies,

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.429
And we're one of four thousand companies that are majority owned by their employees.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.850
It's been an incredible journey for all of us at at GOLDEN, and I think it has truly been a

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:46.079
Great motivation for staff and is heightened the performance for this company for all of us. Over the years

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:49.169
GOLDEN has succeeded in innovating new products

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:54.089
And I hope you get a chance to take a look at the 40 new OPEN colors that we've introduced doubling the line of OPEN

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.830
Products, and we can't help ourselves

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:02.369
We introduced a few new heavy body colors because we love colors where color junkies and will continue to do that and I know it

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.250
Won't fit on the rack, but we'll figure out a way to make that happen, okay

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:08.609
but as proud as I am in our role in innovating new

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.749
Products, I am also proud in our role in innovating

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:16.800
responsible business initiatives because I

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.830
Truly believe they've supported our employees,

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.269
They've supported our local community, they supported dark material industry,

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:29.639
And I think those initiatives have supported in so many ways all the art communities that we've been invited to participate.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.790
In I believe that being a good business is good for business,

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.760
And you folks have been part of that support team, so thank you!

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.380
you
