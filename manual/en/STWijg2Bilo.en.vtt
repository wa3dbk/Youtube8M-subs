00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.880
I like to be structured. I like things to
be the way that they are. If you went in my

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:11.880
closet right now at home, you would find all
my short-sleeved t-shirts that don't have

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.100
a button in one order from light to dark in
color.

LUKE McCOWN
NFL QUARTERBACK

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:28.730
Memories of football that come to mind for
me is in the front yard, and we had these

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.770
hutch helmets and pads, and it was fun. I
mean, we all had different personalities.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.710
At that point, I felt like I was going to
be a linebacker, so Dad would come out there

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:40.680
and Dad would just say, "Hey, if you're
going to get ready to play, you just go run

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.500
into that tree over there. That'll get you
ready to play."

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.270
I like to challenge my mind. A couple of years
ago, I started reading Einstein for Dummies,

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:56.739
just because I've always been fascinated
by the cosmos and looking up at the stars.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:00.670
Einstein kind of decoded all of that with
gravity and his Theory of Relativity and all

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:06.380
that. And so you're kind of hearing my accent
and going, "There's no way you read Einstein,"

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.300
but I like to study things. I love to learn.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:17.200
His strong desire to study and learn made Luke the perfect candidate for life as an NFL Quarterback.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.200
Luke was drafted in the fourth round of the 2004 NFL Draft.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.200
After two years in the league Luke established himself as the back-up Quarterback in Tampa Bay.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.400
Year 2 in Tampa, my third year in the league,
the last practice, on the last day of OTAs,

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:41.619
I believe even the last play of the last period
of OTAs in June, I pull out my knee.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:49.520
IN THEIR HEARTS HUMANS PLAN THEIR COURSE, 
BUT GOD DIRECTS THEIR STEPS.
PROVERBS 16:9

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.469
God did some wonderful things, allowing me
to heal quickly. I worked my way back into

00:01:54.469 --> 00:02:01.469
a position where I can play. At that moment,
we had had our second child, Elijah. Elijah

00:02:03.529 --> 00:02:09.569
has a fall, as most babies do, but he gets
a bump on his head that doesn't go away,

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.760
and it stays there and it actually grows.
The first doctor that we go to says it's

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:20.189
a tumor, and "what took you so long to get
to us?"

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:26.170
He's four months old. What in the world
did he do to deserve this, or what did we

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.989
do? There's no way you can look at it and
go, "Okay, this is what we do next." I'm

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.300
a planning kind of guy; I didn't have a
plan.

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.300
Elijah underwent cranial surgery that was expected to take four hours.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.300
Dr. Yako [sp] comes out about 30 minutes after
he took him back and said, "The hardest

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.469
part's over. We got him under anesthesia
just fine, and they're starting the surgery."

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:55.900
We go, "Okay, now we know that it's going
to be about four hours, three and a half hours

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.879
from now." Well, he comes out about an hour
and a half later and he says "We're done."

00:02:58.879 --> 00:03:04.299
I said, "What do you mean, you're done?
You said it was going to take three and a

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:10.439
half hours." He said, "No, once we got
in there, the tumor was just sitting on top

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:17.439
of the bone, making a depression. We still
have to do the biopsy to decide whether it's

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.969
benign or malignant." But generally, they
can tell just by looking at it, so he came

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:26.670
out and said, "I don't want to guarantee
you anything, but I'm pretty sure that it's

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.400
benign and it's not cancerous."

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.560
Football didn't matter. It didn't matter
if I was the starter, the backup, or #3. My

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:35.500
son was going to be okay.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:41.989
Elijah made a full recovery.

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:47.019
I get a call the next day, and it's Coach
Paul Hackett, and he calls me and says, "Hey,

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:51.260
you're going to start against New Orleans."
It's my first start since I was a rookie.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:58.260
I step right in and I play the game of my
career. I've played the first half 15 for

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:05.870
15 with 200-something yards and a couple of
touchdowns, and I end up throwing a touchdown

00:04:06.749 --> 00:04:09.489
pass to win the game with about eight seconds
to go.

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.590
So to be able to come in and play that freely
after that kind of a year, I think that's

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.720
why I was able to play so freely, is because
when you go through something like that, it

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:25.539
puts it in perspective.

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:33.500
After two season-ending knee injuries, five NFL Teams, and coaching decisions out of his control, Luke has gained perspective.

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:40.500
Whether it be knee injuries or my child's
illness or my coach's decision to sit me

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:46.060
down and not play me anymore or a general
manager's decision to trade me, it's God's

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:52.660
power in and around our lives that move us
and point us in the direction and make us

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.600
who He wants us to be. He's directing those
steps -- not that coach, not that general

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.200
manager, not that injury, not that sickness.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.600
IN THEIR HEARTS HUMANS PLAN THEIR COURSE&lt; BUT GOD DIRECTS THEIR STEPS.
PROVERBS 16:9

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:08.860
It's His plan, not mine. As much as I want to plan, He's the one in control.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.800
