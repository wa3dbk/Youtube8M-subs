We start our game creating process from making concept. I am making graphics too.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:25.000
In this one, I'll make Arkanoid/BreakOut styled simple game.
I am making paddle and ball.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We will use FlashDevelop. As you can see, our game will be made in Flash.
Learning ActionScript3 is our priority now. I am using Flex to make GUI.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Why I am using Flash to make a mobile game? Answer is very simple:
1. Writing game in actionscript is much faster than using Java (Android Natives).

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:55.000
2. Flash project can be wrote once and run on Android/iOS/Desktop and many more (everything that runs Adobe Air)
and in the browser.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
3. Debugging program in FlashDevelop is great.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:25.000
4. There are many more things. Flash is simple and nice. You will love it.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:35.000
Ok, now lets check our tutorial. I am using project that I done before to make it faster.
Viev.mxml is a Flex file. We can make there our GUI and script it.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Let's run our game. It's very simple one. I made it in few hours. 
There is no reason to make something complicated now.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Ball is bouncing and breaking the blocks. We are controlling the paddle on bottom of the screen.
You know how it works.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.000
In our Flex file, I made 2 blocks:
-Script- where i am scripting buttons and stuff
-View- Where I am declaring GUI elements

00:02:50.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Every GUI element is descriped in xml format. Its easy to learn.
