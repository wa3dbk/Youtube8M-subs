00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.500
It is wonderful:

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.000
like bright stars my friends are very close to me.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.700
Now I see their light,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.700
since they are always there for me.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.600
Now I shine!

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.500
Like a rainbow I shine.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:32.500
Like a rainbow I shine.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.400
Friendship can be this wonderful.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.900
One is reliable and vouches for each other.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.800
When the music sounds within us,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
we feel light and ascend,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.900
elated by the tone.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:52.200
In the hearts every chord

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.400
becomes a crescendo.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:01.100
Our world, it brightens at once.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.200
This makes us so happy.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.400
Like a rainbow we shine.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.700
Like a rainbow we shine.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.200
We back each other up,

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:24.100
even though sometimes it's raining.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:26.900
We keep looking ahead,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.200
until the sun brightens us.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.600
In the hearts every chord

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.400
becomes a crescendo.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.000
Our world, it brightens at once.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:47.300
This makes us so happy.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.200
Like a rainbow we shine.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.200
Like a rainbow we shine.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.100
Rainbow.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.800
Like a rainbow we shine.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.500
Like a rainbow.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.800
No... no doubt, Spike.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.400
There is definitely something strange going on at this school.
