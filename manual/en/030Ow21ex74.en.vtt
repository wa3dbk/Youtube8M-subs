00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.189
a lot of people asked me

00:00:03.189 --> 00:00:06.870
how to arrange songs on guitar.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.110
So today i am going to demonstrate the first steps.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:14.620
First, write down the melody.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:18.010
In this example the tune is in the key of C.

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:25.990
For most tunes, the first

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.450
and the last chords are the key chord,

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.100
which is C major in this case

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:37.430
The one before the end is usually

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.520
the Dominant chord, which is the fifth chord.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:43.680
In this case that is G Major.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.120
Now we ‘ ve already found out three of the chords.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.640
Most of the possible melody notes can be

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:58.430
played over either the key chord or the dominant chord.

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.460
That’s really good news. It makes it easier for us.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:11.420
The C major chord is made up of the notes Do mi so.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:16.020
and the G Major is so ti re.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.380
choose a chord

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.380
which includes the melody notes which are on the beat.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:24.720
we normally change the chord only

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.760
at the beginning of the bar.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.460
The next step is to plan the bass line.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.500
Usually the bass note is the root note of the chord.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.360
so when you ‘re playing a C major chord

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:42.240
It’s C

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.950
when you’re playing a G major it’s G,

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.130
and so on.

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:53.560
So this is what it sounds like when we put it together.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:59.720
To keep it simple,I’ll only play the melody and the bass.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:20.960
when you have a bit more skill on the guitar

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.960
you can include other chord notes.

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.140
So now go and choose a tune you like

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.320
put some chords to it

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.300
and have fun
