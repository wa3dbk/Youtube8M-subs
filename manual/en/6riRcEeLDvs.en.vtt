Howdy folks how is it going welcome to my
virgin kitchen I am today joined by my friend

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:15.290
gary bobbet one of the nicest guys I know
except today he is quite nervous right mate?

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:16.529
I am nervous yeah.

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.699
I always use my humour to hide my nerves but
I will try to keep them at bay if I can.

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:24.619
We are making some caramelised banana pancakes
today and I think you are going to love this

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:25.619
right mate?

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.619
I love pancakes!

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:33.110
If you want to have a go at making these pancakes
write all of these ingredients down on your

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.110
screen.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.870
Bobbet is going to be the chef today and I
will help him out.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.670
The basic ingredients for batter are milk,
eggs and flour.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.670
Right?

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.670
Yeah lets do it.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:54.230
First thing we are going to do is sift in
our flour.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:03.320
Going for the old school technique I learnt
at school place and pour.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.220
Give it a little tap like a babies bottom,
little tappy tap tap.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.500
So Gary has sifted his flour like a dream.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.930
I am getting quite emotional and proud so
far.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:23.250
Can you make a well giant food style, yep
in it goes good technique there.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:31.990
Next we follow up with our eggs, 2 eggs here
into the bowl goes the egg.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.020
Here we go, 1, 2, 3 oh yeah!

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.020
No shell.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.780
Alright we have got one more to go.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.830
Oh yeah!

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:56.180
Fantastic we are now at the third stage of
our batter making, the egg is in there.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:04.580
We want to add a little more moisture, so
we will add a sixth of the milk just to initially

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.790
get some milk in there.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.569
It will probably be quite thick at first once
we start mixing it we will just mix it and

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:15.620
it will be thick at first as we say, but we
will mix it together to get as many lumps

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:16.620
out as we can.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.010
Here is your balloon whisk, come on lets do
it.

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.730
It was like tom cruise in cocktail right.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.430
I am not very good at whisking but we will
give it a go.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:37.150
We need to mop the brow of Gary he is doing
well so the milk is added and I can see from

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.120
here it is getting lump free so we will get
all the milk in to expand our batter.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.550
Looking good I am loving it.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.069
Bobbet you have done a fantastic job on the
batter right there the balloon whisk was on

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.900
fire when I put it down just then, smoking!

00:02:54.900 --> 00:03:00.990
So the jug the batter came out of we will
pour the batter back into there, is that ok

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.319
with you man?

00:03:02.319 --> 00:03:07.400
Just to get it easier in the pan so pour it
straight in baby alright, loving that, I like

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.470
it a lot.

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:14.160
So we have got a frying pan that I have lubricated
in oil, we have made an executive decision

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:19.200
that I am going to be the pourer and gary
is going to be the tosser.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.370
That sounds good, some countries may not get
that.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:32.170
We are just going to get about a ladle full
of batter into the pan and if you can just

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.700
work it around the pan gary.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.780
With it being an induction pan we need to
keep it on that source of heat.

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.420
Alright that is even.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:45.760
So can you tell me when is the right time
to flip a pancake.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:48.900
Straight off you will see the pancake is a
lot lighter in the pan it will not be wet

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:52.890
and heavy there will be little bubbles on
top and ultimately you will be able to move

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:55.420
it like a DJ lol.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:04:02.632
So lets have a little look with our spatula
underneath see that golden brown colour baby,

00:04:02.632 --> 00:04:04.080
golden brown texture like sun.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:12.050
So what we are going to do is get gary to
toss it, are you ready to toss gary?

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:14.970
Yeah I am a good tosser, alright.

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:18.090
Here we go, you tosser, lets go.

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.000
The power is in your hands I normally have
a double hand stance and flip but you are

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:32.960
going for the one hander I think it is balance
too so 1,2,3ï¿½.

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.610
R KELLY MOMENT.

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.790
Sorry guys we got a little bit emotional there
but I am proud of you man.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:43.780
That is so cool, to do that on camera too.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.950
If Gary can do it anyone can.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.920
Be a tosser and enjoy it.

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:59.960
So get the pancake down on kitchen towel,
plonk it down with more kitchen towel on top

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:01.780
and just repeat with more pancakes stacking
them.

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.990
So you are going to do more pancakes right
man?

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.990
Yes!

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:09.090
So while Gary is doing that I am going to
caramelise up my bananas by caramelising my

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:13.540
sugar in a pan with some butter, adding the
banana slices, mixing it together to coat

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:17.729
for a couple of minutes and that will go lovely
with our pancakes.

00:05:17.729 --> 00:05:20.830
Gary is getting stuck in there I am about
to join him now but to finish off the pancakes

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.850
I laid down a strip of the caramelised bananas
some whipped cream on top and some maple syrup

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:29.620
all up and down there looking amazing but
you can put anything you want on there in

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:31.910
fact let me know down below what you put on
yours.

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.830
Enjoying that mate?

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.699
You should be proud you made that!

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:42.860
For more pancake recipes there is a pancake
playlist right up there including the first

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.860
time I tossed.

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:52.850
So if I and gary can make that anyone in the
world can give it a go guys, oh my god, easy

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.039
and delicious, really good!
