[Jeff Koons: Potential]

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.970
When I was young, art was...

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.169
it was really a vehicle that gave me a sense
of self.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.220
And, you know, my sister was three years older

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.210
and so I couldn't do anything as well as my
sister.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:31.759
She could always do everything better.

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.270
And then at one time, when my parents saw
me draw something,

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:41.910
they made me feel like I could finally do
something to the level of my sister.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.740
It gave me a kind of feeling...

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.780
"Oh," you know, "I kind of have a place here."

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:59.320
I think that I built kind of a vocabulary
to work with.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.000
I'll make paintings, I'll make sculptures.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.830
Iâ€™ll make public works.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:11.380
Some things are more figurative, some things
are more abstract.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.050
Sometimes I'll play a little game where I'll
think,

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:16.450
"Okay, did I ever make an artwork with a bird?"

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.800
"Oh yeah, there was a bird on 'Buster Keaton'"

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:23.080
and, "Oh yeah, there was a bird on top of
'Stack'."

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.960
What people want to do the most in life is
what they avoid the most

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:38.060
And so the job of the artist is to make a
gesture

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.159
and really show people what their potential
is.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:45.869
And through that, people will live to their
potential.

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.190
They realize that it's not about that object,

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.430
it's not about that image,

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.880
it's what is happening inside the viewer.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.510
That's where the art happens.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.010
The objects are absolutely valueless.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:02.700
But what happens inside the viewer, that's
where the value is.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:09.700
And it's about where they can go from that
moment to achieve their desires.
