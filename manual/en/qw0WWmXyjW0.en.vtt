00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.080
There's a new Mad Max trailer and this time
we're getting knee deep into the story of

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.620
this game.

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.720
Max is a nomad, wandering through the wasteland
trying to avoid all the bandits and scum that

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:19.190
steal and scavenge.

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:24.580
Despite this, Max gets ambushed and forced
into a fight with a group of warboys.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.950
These are the foot soldiers of the Wasteland
Warlord and ruler of Gastown, Scabrous Scrotus.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.820
What a name!

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.570
They steal his pride and joy, the Interceptor
and leave him for dead.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:41.421
The only person willing to help him, is an
unlikely and unsavory companion, a Wasteland

00:00:41.421 --> 00:00:47.550
Blackfinger named Chumbucket, who realizes
that Max is highly skilled in driving, combat,

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.750
and survival.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.690
Together they build a new vehicle, even better
than the last.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.670
Max's Magnum Opus.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.440
Chumbucket is an informant, he helps Max with
insider information on the wasteland and he

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:05.570
also assists Max by manning the harpoon and
repairing his vehicle during battle.

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.500
In this video, Max drives straight into Gastown
in order to compete in a race to the death

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.000
to win the V8 engine for the Magnum Opus.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.370
But there are plenty of henchman standing
in his way.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:22.640
The Mad Max game is shaping up to be a complete
triple A title with high octane action, an

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.550
open world to explore, and even a solid story.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.650
The reviews for the Mad Max movie have been
absolutely stellar and it looks like this

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.530
game will live up to the hype as far as both
story and action.

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.220
This game seems to be one of the few games
that does a really good job of combining the

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.460
story to the gameplay.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.500
The car combat will be a big part of the game
and it's interesting to see how it's not just

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.690
filler when traveling to different areas in
the world.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:53.470
Car combat in the wasteland and even during
the death race is a major part of the events

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:54.720
the story mode.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.520
It's also interesting to see how each town
has different events going on like the death

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.200
race and the last trailer showed hints of
a thunderdome type arena.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:08.830
I wouldn't surprised if Warner Bros launched
this into a major series similar to the Batman

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:10.720
Arkham games.

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.010
When you play Mad Max are you going to focus
on building up your vehicle or fighting in

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.319
close quarter combat?

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:18.319
Let us know in the comments.

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.579
I'll let you watch the complete trailer up
next.
