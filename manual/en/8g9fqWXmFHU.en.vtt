00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:18.500
Now I will be showing you how to reset a handle
escutcheon. What you have got is the sleeve

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.500
and this gets inserted inside. Tighten nice
and snug. Next the escutheon gets threaded

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:35.480
on. Now if your deal was out from the wall
it may be that the sleeve needs to be tightened

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:49.079
up. So anyway tighten that up and now you
are ready for your handle. Insert the set

00:00:53.539 --> 00:01:00.539
screw. The right side is cold generally and
the left side your hot. If you ever need to

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.620
remove it you can just take a flat blade knife
and pick it under the index button and remove.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:15.110
Now is going to be replacing the sleeve and
the escutcheon. With this type of handle we

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.090
can just turn the sleeve like so. We don't
really have to take the entire escutheon off,

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:27.090
the entire sleeve off. Now we can tighten
it down grabbing it here and giving it a little

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
twist till it is tight. Than tighten the escutcheon
against the tub wall until it is nice and

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:43.369
snug. Now we are ready to put the handle back
on. There's the handle. Tighten this up with

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.710
a philips. Than insert your index button.
Hot is usually on the left and cold on the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:59.710
right. And we are all set there.
