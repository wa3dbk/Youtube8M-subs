00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.901
It's cause of you I got this thick skin

00:00:04.901 --> 00:00:06.800
I don't wanna let nobody in

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.800
All the pain just stayed in place

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:19.200
And I kept it all tucked away for so long, so long, so long, oh

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.200
But now, I just wanna yell

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.800
I just wanna throw it all in your face

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.200
It's silly that I've always felt this way

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.500
You'd never know

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.200
I just wanna yell

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.900
You know that I can only take so much

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.300
And I don't wanna keep it bottled up, anymore,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.700
Anymore

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:51.000
Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.600
I was there, hanging on by a string

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.500
Trying to give you my everything

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.000
Yeah, that's what they all sing, yeah

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
You don't know what you put me through

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.100
Trying so hard just to prove to you

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.800
That I got something to say

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.000
But I kept it all tucked away for so long,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.000
so long, so long, oh

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
But now I just wanna yell

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.800
I just wanna throw it all in your face

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:28.300
It's silly that I've always felt this way

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.800
you'd never know, oh oh

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.000
I just wanna yell

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
You know that I can only take so much

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
And I don't wanna keep it bottled up

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Anymore, anymore

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.500
Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.000
I don't wanna keep it bottled up

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Anymore

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Whoa oh oh oh, whoa oh oh oh (Yeah)
Whoa oh oh oh

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Keep it bottled up, hey

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.300
I never talked about the way I really felt

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.100
You put my heart through hell, thought you knew me so well, But,

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.000
Uh-uh, just waiting for me to fail

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.300
But I'm doing the opposite and I can't wait to tell the whole world

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.200
Your the one you said would eat me up

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.600
Remember when you told me that I wasn't good enough?

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.900
And I started to believe you, I felt like giving up

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.100
But, left me with a dream crushed and your empty words stuck to me

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.000
I didn't wanna ever feel like that again

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.800
So I locked up any kind of emotion, but

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.000
I got the key and I'm ready now

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.300
Set the caged bird free, time to let it out

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:37.500
I just wanna yell, yeah

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:41.400
This way, yeah, you never know

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.600
I just wanna yell

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.000
You know that I can only take so much

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.700
And I don't wanna keep it bottled up

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.200
Anymore, anymore, eh
