00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.460
The first generation iPad came out in March of 2011.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:17.440
But, as of today, it is rapidly becoming obsolete.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.160
In fact, it has been replaced by the iPad 2, iPad 3, iPad Retina, and even more recently, the iPad Air.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.620
There are also a ton of other brands of tablets now available.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.360
But, the question is: How obsolete are they?

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.540
Are they still useful?

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.760
Let's find out.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.240
In order to answer that question, I thought it would be appropriate to first compile a list of common tasks used for a tablet computer.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.860
Then address each activity to see how the first generation stacks up.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:54.840
Web browsing is a problem.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.940
The latest iOS and Safari that runs on it are out of date.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:05.260
Safari is as slow as molasses on many websites, assuming it will display the website without crashing, which unfortunately is very common.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:12.280
I found that some third party browsers, like Mercury Browser, are more stable than Safari, but, they don't really improve the speed any.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.220
The main issue here is likely the lack of available RAM.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.180
The first gen iPad has only 256 megs of RAM.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.720
Now, please don't confuse that with the amount of storage.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.820
For example, the iPad was sold with 16, 32, or 64 gigabytes of flash memory.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.440
But don't be confused, this is not RAM and cannot be used as such.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:37.500
Just as a comparison, the iPad 2 comes with 512 megabytes and the iPad 3 has one gigabyte.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.320
So, I'm going to say that web browsing is crippled as it is.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.140
And this is only going to get worse as the years pass by.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.200
Email still works just fine on the first generation and there only minor improvements in the later versions.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.520
Along that same line, iMessage also works just fine.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.840
So, I will give a passing grade on email.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.500
Due to the fact that the iPad 1 has no camera whatsoever, video chat is pretty much out of the question.

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.140
So, for video chat, the iPad 1 fails.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:23.760
Right now, this is not easy to answer because there are vast differences from one app to the next depending on which one you are trying to use.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:33.400
My testing shows the vast majority of apps in the App Store still work to some degree, however, some newer apps won't work at all, because they require a new iOS.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.580
Other apps may run, albeit very slowly compared to a newer iPad.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:46.280
So, despite the fact that there are some games and apps that won't work on the iPad 1, I'm gonna go ahead and give it a passing grade overall, since most apps do work.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:50.420
Music still works just fine, not only from iTunes, but many third party apps.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:56.520
All iPad 1's are equipped with Bluetooth as well, so you can sync an iPad with the stereo in your car, for example.

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.980
Also, the latest version of iTunes still supports the iPad 1 in every way.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:06.940
So, I will give it a passing grade on music.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.660
Movies run fine, even ones in 720p.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:20.640
It can also run apps like Hulu and Netflix just fine.

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:29.200
If you'd prefer to watch on a larger screen, you can connect the iPad to an HDMI television.

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.540
Or, even VGA if needed.

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.020
I'll give it a passing grade on watching video.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.560
The iPad 1 does support Wireless A, B, G and N.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.340
So, it's actually pretty up-to-date as far as that goes.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:51.220
As for the 3G model, it does support Edge and GSM-based 3G networks.

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:56.540
All the LTE networks may be faster, you have to go all the way to the iPad 3 before you can even get that.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:02.140
Along the same line as connectivity, the iPad uses the older style 30-pin dock connector.

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:12.480
However, this was shared by many other Apple devices and so, there are still a plethora of available accessories that use this connector, as well as many accessories such as protective cases.

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:15.140
So, I'll give it a passing grade on connectivity.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:19.620
So, I'll hope this gives you an idea of where the iPad 1 stands.

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:23.840
Some people might ask: is it possible to upgrade the RAM to make it faster?

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.700
Unfortunately, no.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:30.800
The RAM is actually stored completely inside of the A4 chip and cannot be upgraded.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.720
It may be possible to upgrade the flash storage and I think some people have done that.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.780
But the RAM is out of the question.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:41.500
Ok, so you see that I've given the iPad 1 for the most part, a passing grade.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.160
Um, it's you know, it's got a few issues, web browsing is a big one.

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.760
Um, and, you know, no vid - no camera of any kind is - is another problem.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:57.520
So, it's important to point out that, despite it's shortcomings, the iPad 1 can be purchased for around a hundred bucks on the used market.

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.780
I imagine as time goes by, that price will get even lower.

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:07.420
So, um, that is worth considering if it lives up to all of things that you need a tablet to do.
