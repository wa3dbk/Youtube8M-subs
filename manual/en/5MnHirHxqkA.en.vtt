00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.751
Hi. In this segment, we are going to be ironing
a pleat right down the middle of the pant.

00:00:05.751 --> 00:00:10.120
So again, this is a personal choice. A lot
of people like this. It does look nice and

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:15.440
crisp and professional. So what I'm going
to do is I've laid the pant leg flat. And

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:21.640
you can usually see, the manufacturing usually
has a pleat line that they put in. And it's

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.510
still here or it's been here from the last
time I've ironed these pants. They often stay

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.610
for quite a while. So I'm going to pick up
the pant right in the middle. Try to find

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:37.280
that pleat line. Lay the pants in half. An
easy way to tell if you got is exactly right

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:43.620
is you line up the seams on either side of
the pants so that they are matching. That

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.300
way you'll know you have the pleat right down
the middle. That's the most important thing

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.260
because if you don't have the pleat right
down the middle, it's off to the left or the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:01:06.280
right, it's going to look ridiculous. So you
line up your seams as best as you can. This

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:14.550
pant leg I'm just going to gently flop over
there. It's finished. The thing with pants,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:19.590
they don't seem to get as wrinkled as the
shirt does. Once they've been ironed, they

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:32.159
can , they hold the ironing much better for
some reason. So we're going to go right along

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:40.070
the seam right there to get that line in.
I'm just giving it a little wiggle as I go

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:49.329
all the way up. And you might want to run
that several times.

00:01:49.329 --> 00:01:55.399
Go up as high as you can go. All the way up
to you see the zipper. And then of course,

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:06.880
the other side of the pant leg so you get
the back hem line as well. Okay. Right up

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:15.300
in to the crotch area. Then you're going to
flip the pants around. That was the inside

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:19.890
of the pant, I'm now doing the outside of
the pant. Again, any time that you move the

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:30.400
pants make sure that they are still lined
up properly.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:39.660
Some materials are harder to get that nice
line in them. They require you to go over

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:50.040
it several times. Where other ones, it doesn't
take long at all to get that line. Go most

00:02:50.040 --> 00:03:07.291
of the way up the pant. And you should have
our nice ironed line right down the middle

00:03:07.291 --> 00:03:14.430
of our pant leg. You should have it on the
back side as well. As you can see, it's much

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.120
different that than the one that we just ironed
without it.
