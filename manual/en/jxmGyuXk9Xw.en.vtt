00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.881
(rock music)

00:00:02.883 --> 00:00:06.125
- This drink is called
the Paralyzer Cocktail.

00:00:06.126 --> 00:00:06.693
- Why do you think it’s called

00:00:06.695 --> 00:00:07.726
the Paralyzer Cocktail?

00:00:07.728 --> 00:00:09.728
- Because it hits your brain and

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.831
takes your frontal lobe away.

00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:13.166
It paralyzes you.

00:00:13.168 --> 00:00:13.800
- Really?

00:00:13.801 --> 00:00:15.268
- Got real scientific there, but—

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.036
- Oh my God, were you in science?

00:00:17.038 --> 00:00:18.638
- No, I wasn’t.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.873
I just —
- Cause I was thinking

00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:20.106
‘You know what?

00:00:20.108 --> 00:00:21.473
‘This girl’s really intelligent.’ Right?

00:00:21.475 --> 00:00:24.243
- I watched—
- Usually cute girls ain’t that smart.

00:00:24.245 --> 00:00:26.345
- I watched One Flew
Over the Cuckoo’s Nest,

00:00:26.346 --> 00:00:28.381
I retain a lot of information,

00:00:28.383 --> 00:00:29.850
and I was like ‘They were gonna cut out

00:00:29.851 --> 00:00:32.384
‘his frontal lobe to make him paralyzed.’

00:00:32.386 --> 00:00:33.853
So that must mean

00:00:33.855 --> 00:00:35.188
if your frontal lobe is gone,

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.890
you’re paralyzed.

00:00:36.891 --> 00:00:38.391
Which is what this drink does.

00:00:38.393 --> 00:00:39.691
Apparently.

00:00:39.693 --> 00:00:40.993
- You should’ve stopped
while you were ahead.

00:00:40.995 --> 00:00:42.261
You were doing good in the beginning, but

00:00:42.263 --> 00:00:43.430
right now, you know, you lost us there.

00:00:43.431 --> 00:00:44.830
Alright, let’s make this drink!

00:00:44.831 --> 00:00:45.965
(chuckles)

00:00:45.966 --> 00:00:47.400
Vodka, Kahlua.

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:48.601
Okay, so pour with me.

00:00:48.603 --> 00:00:49.870
- [Nikki] Okay.
- [Skyy] Equal parts.

00:00:49.871 --> 00:00:50.670
Go down the side.

00:00:50.671 --> 00:00:51.303
Okay?
- [Nikki] Okay.

00:00:51.305 --> 00:00:52.438
Go down the side?
- [Skyy] Yeah.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.906
I mean, try to go down
the side if you can.

00:00:53.908 --> 00:00:55.275
Not outside the glass!

00:00:55.276 --> 00:00:56.810
In the glass, dammit!

00:00:56.811 --> 00:00:58.211
Stop wasting my damn vodka!
- [Nikki] Okay!

00:00:58.213 --> 00:00:59.845
I can’t do it down the side.
- [Skyy] That’s alright.

00:00:59.846 --> 00:01:01.215
Just pour, just pour it in.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.349
The suckage on this show.

00:01:04.351 --> 00:01:05.251
(Nikki laughs)

00:01:05.253 --> 00:01:06.753
Now we can hit this with some milk, okay?

00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:07.853
- [Nikki] I hate when people

00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:09.555
pronounce it “malk.”

00:01:09.556 --> 00:01:11.023
- [Skyy] What should they call it?

00:01:11.025 --> 00:01:12.725
- [Nikki] Milk, it’s milk.
- [Skyy] Okay.

00:01:12.726 --> 00:01:13.593
Milk.

00:01:13.595 --> 00:01:15.495
- [Nikki] People say “malk” and “pallows.”

00:01:15.496 --> 00:01:16.696
It’s incorrect.

00:01:16.698 --> 00:01:18.331
- [Skyy] Didn’t I just say “milk?”

00:01:18.333 --> 00:01:19.231
- [Nikki] Yeah, milk.

00:01:19.233 --> 00:01:20.068
You said it right.
- [Skyy] Okay.

00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:21.868
- [Nikki] I’m just saying I don’t like it

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.801
when people call it “malk.”

00:01:22.803 --> 00:01:23.803
- [Skyy] I’ve never
heard it called “malk.”

00:01:23.805 --> 00:01:24.971
- [Nikki] You’ve never heard—

00:01:24.973 --> 00:01:26.806
People call it “malk” sometimes.
- [Skyy] Wait,

00:01:26.808 --> 00:01:27.640
what country is this?

00:01:27.641 --> 00:01:30.310
- [Nikki] In America, but
people that just don’t

00:01:30.311 --> 00:01:31.846
say it right.
(Skyy laughs)

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.515
- [Skyy] Pour that coke into the spoon.

00:01:35.616 --> 00:01:36.651
- [Nikki] Sounds illegal.

00:01:36.961 --> 00:01:37.551
- [Skyy] Ready?

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:47.761
Keep going, you can pour more than that.

00:01:48.228 --> 00:01:49.561
Sweet.

00:01:49.563 --> 00:01:52.100
And then you pour some
tequila on top of that.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.433
- [Nikki] Mmm.
- [Skyy] You see that?

00:01:54.435 --> 00:01:55.636
- [Nikki] Okay.

00:01:56.671 --> 00:01:57.871
- [Skyy] Pour some more coke.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:04.110
You kind of have more of a layer

00:02:04.111 --> 00:02:05.045
on this side here.

00:02:05.046 --> 00:02:06.211
- [Nikki] Yeah, you need more coke.

00:02:06.213 --> 00:02:07.180
- [Skyy] No, you can see it though.

00:02:07.181 --> 00:02:08.648
You can see the black,

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:10.883
the white, and then like, the brownish.

00:02:10.884 --> 00:02:11.483
- [Nikki] That’s me.
- [Skyy] Right.

00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:12.951
- [Nikki] That’s my dad, that’s my mom.

00:02:12.953 --> 00:02:14.686
But I don’t want to mix—

00:02:14.688 --> 00:02:15.488
- [Skyy] You have black in you?

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.956
- [Nikki] No, no, Filipino.

00:02:16.958 --> 00:02:19.825
Cause my dad’s, my dad is dark.

00:02:19.826 --> 00:02:20.926
Dark man!

00:02:20.928 --> 00:02:22.395
(Skyy laughs)
He’s a dark man!

00:02:22.396 --> 00:02:23.161
- Nikki darling?

00:02:23.163 --> 00:02:25.200
- Yes, Tipsy?

00:02:28.168 --> 00:02:29.635
- And there you have it!

00:02:29.636 --> 00:02:32.305
That Paralyzer Cocktail!

00:02:32.306 --> 00:02:33.406
Go ahead, take a little sip.

00:02:33.408 --> 00:02:36.743
- You paralyzed me with
your booming voice.

00:02:36.745 --> 00:02:38.411
- Was it very bad?
- [Nikki] Should I stir it?

00:02:38.413 --> 00:02:39.845
- Um, probably not, let’s keep it sexy.

00:02:39.846 --> 00:02:41.413
Let’s just not stir.

00:02:41.415 --> 00:02:42.516
(laughing)

00:02:47.021 --> 00:02:48.455
- I only taste the bottom then.

00:02:48.456 --> 00:02:49.955
- Okay mix it then, fine!

00:02:49.956 --> 00:02:51.025
Mix it up, okay?

00:02:52.326 --> 00:02:53.293
It was so pretty.

00:02:54.595 --> 00:02:55.530
- That sexy?

00:03:00.135 --> 00:03:01.433
It’s a much different flavor.

00:03:01.435 --> 00:03:03.201
(laughs)

00:03:03.203 --> 00:03:05.205
- Uh, is it like ass?

00:03:05.206 --> 00:03:07.240
- No, you know, it tastes like caramel.

00:03:07.241 --> 00:03:08.975
- Really?
- Very caramel flavored.

00:03:08.976 --> 00:03:09.641
Yeah.

00:03:09.643 --> 00:03:10.943
Although I’ve never tasted ass,

00:03:10.945 --> 00:03:13.480
so maybe ass tastes like caramel?

00:03:13.481 --> 00:03:16.548
If so, I would love to eat some ass, cause

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:18.216
this is delicious.

00:03:18.218 --> 00:03:19.685
- You like it?
- [Nikki] Mm-hmm.

00:03:19.686 --> 00:03:20.986
Try it!

00:03:20.988 --> 00:03:22.421
I’m not even joking.

00:03:22.423 --> 00:03:24.356
This tastes better than that other drink

00:03:24.358 --> 00:03:25.325
that I tasted.

00:03:25.326 --> 00:03:27.226
- It’s actually a good taste.

00:03:27.228 --> 00:03:29.061
It’s a weird mix, but
it’s a good tasting drink.

00:03:29.063 --> 00:03:30.596
- I really thought it
wasn’t gonna taste good.

00:03:30.598 --> 00:03:31.630
- I thought so too.

00:03:31.631 --> 00:03:33.098
- Cause you’re mixing vodka, tequila,

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.668
kahlua, and “malk.”

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.870
(laughs)
- But listen,

00:03:37.871 --> 00:03:38.805
don’t mess it up, you know?

00:03:38.806 --> 00:03:40.473
Don’t have the “malk” separate.

00:03:40.475 --> 00:03:41.340
Okay?

00:03:41.341 --> 00:03:42.908
Just mix it all together, okay?

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:44.076
It’s important.

00:03:44.078 --> 00:03:45.311
Mix the “malk” in.

00:03:45.313 --> 00:03:46.245
Okay?

00:03:46.246 --> 00:03:47.613
Tipsy Bartender!

00:03:47.615 --> 00:03:49.015
- Tipsy Bartender!

00:03:49.016 --> 00:03:50.618
- [Skyy] Nikki Limo!
- Nikki Limo.
