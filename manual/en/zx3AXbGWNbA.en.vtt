00:00:08.789 --> 00:00:15.740
Hi, I’m Michael from ETS. And welcome to Inside the TOEFL Test.  

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:19.990
Today we’re going inside the TOEFL iBT writing section. 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.640
Specifically, question 2, the independent Writing question. In the next few minutes,  

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:26.279
we’re going to look at:

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.070
How the question is structured. How to approach the question.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.120
How your response is scored.
We’ll look at a sample response that received 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.879
a high score.

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.940
And we’ll give you some tips for improving your writing skills.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.720
So here’s generally what question 2 will look like.  

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.200
For this task, you are presented with a question, and you have 30 minutes to type 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.579
your response at the computer. 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:52.640
There is no maximum length for your essay, but a good response is usually at least

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:53.950
300 words.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:57.649
So what is the question asking you to do?

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:01.500
The independent writing question will ask your opinion on an issue,

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.680
so often you will get a question such as: 
Do you agree or disagree?

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.350
Which would you prefer? or
Do you support or oppose this idea?

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.700
Regardless of the question, you will be expected to use specific reasons and 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.470
examples to support your answer.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.690
let's look at some sample topics number
one

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.819
do you agree or disagree with the
following statement:

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:28.060
a teacher's ability to relate well with
students is more important than

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.170
excellent knowledge of the subject being
taught

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.649
to some people like to travel with the
companion

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.300
other people prefer to travel alone
which do you prefer

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.869
3 it has recently been announced that a
new restaurant may be built in your

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:44.420
neighborhood

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:51.380
do you support or oppose this plan

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.270
one way to approach your essay is to
make an outline here's how you might

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.780
make an outlined answer the question
about traveling alone or with a

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:59.470
companion

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:02.850
first decide which option you prefer

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.220
let's say you prefer to travel with the
companion then

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.300
think the main reasons why you have that
preference such as it's safer

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.360
it's more fun and it makes travel easier

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.200
then list some specific examples for
each reason

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.750
using an organizing tool I can outline
is important when planning your essay

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.870
don't try to create an essay by
memorizing paragraphs on various topics

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:27.970
before the test

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.140
and then trying to relate them to the
topic you receive because

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.140
the content will be appropriate and
you'll just receive a low score

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.820
before the test make sure you understand
what the Raiders are looking for

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:46.990
and how each question escort the essays
in the writing section will each be

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.470
given

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.970
overall score from 0 to 5 for question
to the independent writing question

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.110
the Raiders looking for three main
things development

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.620
organization and language use first

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.080
development the Raiders are looking for
how will you address the topic

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.550
and how well your details examples in
reasons to support your ideas

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.170
if you just use a lot I've words and
sentences that

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.380
don't really support the point you're
making about the topic or if you develop

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.510
empty ID is not related to the topic
you'll receive a low score

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.440
second organization this basically means
a reader can

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.810
redress a from beginning to end without
becoming confused

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:34.140
you can help the reader follow your
ideas by writing in paragraphs and

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:39.390
using good transitions also make sure
your support points all relate clearly

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:40.340
to the topic

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.760
and avoid redundancy which is saying the
same things over and over

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:48.180
just using different words the third
criterion

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.400
is language use Raiders are looking for
things like

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.000
sentence structure word choice and
vocabulary

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.680
it's also important that you use of
grammar is strong and consistent

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:03.780
though it doesn't have to be perfect to
get a top score you can see exactly how

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:04.950
your essays are scored

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:08.260
by looking at the independent writing
rubric or scoring guide

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.700
the rubrics are found in many ETS test
prep materials

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:18.700
like the official guide to the TOEFL
test or on the total website

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.919
now let's look at a sample response to
give you an idea of what a good essay

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:23.680
looks like

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:28.090
and what our readers look for when they
score this essay was responding to the

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.460
topic about teachers

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.010
the received a score four on a
five-point scale this essay

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.010
has a very traditional structure it
gives the writer's point of view in the

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.050
first paragraph

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.639
then as three paragraphs supporting
points and then a concluding paragraph

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:47.210
the writers for supporting point

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.330
is that relating to students is the job
of a counselor

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.550
not a teacher and that teachers without
content knowledge are

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:56.690
simply not good teachers the point is a
good one and

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.260
generally well stated the second point

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:03.700
is that students wanna take courses from
teachers with special knowledge

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.410
even if the teachers are not
entertaining this is another good point

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:10.479
the third point is interesting but

00:05:10.479 --> 00:05:14.430
it has some weaknesses in the writing
the writer talks about how teachers have

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:17.070
the obligation to pass on what they have
learnt

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:21.690
but there are some errors a word choice
like conceding their knowledge in

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.130
advantaged education and the connection
of ideas is somewhat unclear

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:29.169
for example what's the purpose of seeing

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:33.600
we all learn because we want to become
the better person that this world needs

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.860
so overall the essay is well-organized

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:42.810
and make solid points but given the word
choice and unclear connections ideas

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.950
especially in the fourth paragraph this
as he would receive a score of four out

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:47.440
of five

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.539
now

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:55.760
here are some tips for improving your
writing and getting ready for the

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:57.120
independent writing question

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.520

web-sites that express opinions

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.160
read them and right about why you agree
or disagree

you're making the same kinds of grammar

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:21.960
mistakes

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.310
over and over so learn how to correct
them then

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:28.770
when you write your essay leave a few
minutes to go back and make those

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:29.650
corrections
