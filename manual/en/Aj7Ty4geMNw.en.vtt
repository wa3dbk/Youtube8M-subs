Back-Office Work Wear - Style Advice For London
Man Working At International Finance Company

00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.520
Hi!

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:03.740
I'm Antonio Centeno, the founder of Real Men
Real Style.

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:08.610
Today, I'm going to be giving some advice
to a gentleman who has a back office job in

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.610
London.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.940

I think you'll like it.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.110
And if you enjoy it, please give me some feedback.

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.360
I'd love to hear from you.

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:31.199
This is the letter that came in.

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:36.270
It's actually an older one, so apologies for
taking a few months to get back to you, sir.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.230
"Antonio, I work for an international finance
company in London.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.489
It's a back office job, not a customer facing
job, but we should dress formally.

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.130
Jeans are not accepted, but because it's in
the back office, smart trousers and a smart

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.399
jacket are okay."

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:58.400
Smart, I think for those British guys, it
means it's cool, so just a little bit of translation

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:59.400
there.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.520
"So my question is what kind of jacket would
you recommend?

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.369
I was thinking about a navy blazer because
I like dark colors and dark blue suits my

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.829
complexion, but I would like to have all the
features that may show individual style.

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:18.049
The tailor who made my suit, he can do many
things and he even suggested and for sure

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:21.810
we're going to go with working buttonholes,
but he also said that I could go with contrasting

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.340
stitching on the lapel buttonhole or on some
of the sleeves as well.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.299
What do you think about this whole idea?

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:32.420
Is it going to be too informal to wear to
work?"

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.740
All right.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.740
It sounds like he's a pretty sharp dresser
already.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.259
He has a tailor and his question is he wants
to show a little bit of style, but at the

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:47.639
same time, he's confined to looking and dressing
in a certain way.

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:53.469
Now, he's in London and they've got certain
ways of doing things.

00:01:53.469 --> 00:02:00.310
It's one of the supposedly best cities in
the world when it comes to how the men dress,

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.090
but they're also much more conservative than,
let's say, Italians or the French or even

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.469
us crazy Americans over here.

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.840
Now, my advice at first, since he's asking
this question, would be to hold off.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.090
Even though these are really small details,
he's working in the finance field and it sounds

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.340
like he has a pretty limited wardrobe.

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.800
And when you're building your wardrobe from
the base, you want to go with the simple classics

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:30.900
especially in your jackets because your jackets
are your highest priced items.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.970
It would be better to try to show a little
bit of style with pocket squares, with ties,

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:40.180
with the shirts that you wear because all
of these items are interchangeable in their

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.060
much lower price points.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.140
Now, what he's talking about, the contrast
stitching, that's actually really easy to

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.610
fix, so if he didnâ€™t even like it, he could
have them taken out and go with normal stitching.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.200
So at a later point, if he feels he wants
to introduce that, go for it.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.660
But another thing that you could try, maybe
contrasting buttons.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:01.570
I don't know if you guys noticed, but on this
blue sports jacket -- it's actually not a

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.320
blazer -- I go with white mother of pearl
buttons and they contrast nicely.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:11.330
But in the winter, I could put silver or gold
buttons on this, or even go with some horn

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.850
and it's going to not stand out as much.

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.510
A lot of guys forget that they can change
the buttons.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.890
It's a very easy thing to do.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:27.730
Now, he does want to have a classic blazer
that doesnâ€™t have any of these little style

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:32.350
features, and again, this is because he's
in London and there are going to be events

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:37.110
which are going to be more formal and the
blazer, the classic one, is going to be needed.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:41.540
But what he can introduce is a blue sports
jacket and this would be built differently

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:42.540
than the blazer.

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.510
I would recommend something like patch pockets.

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:48.020
In fact, on my jacket here, if you notice,
I have a patch pocket here.

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.110
A patch pocket is a pocket sewn on.

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.880
I'll link to an article on patch pockets down
below, but these are the areas where you can

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.160
start to have fun.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.270
This has got a little bit of a glen check
pattern in it as well, but from a distance,

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:09.630
it looks like a light or a medium blue jacket
and most people mistake it to be a blazer.

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:12.800
Other jackets that you can introduce, brown
herringbone.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:13.800
Don't go for tweeds.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:18.629
Instead, go for worsted wools that have unique
patterns in them, so you can find worsted

00:04:18.629 --> 00:04:22.290
wools that have herringbones along with maybe
something like hopsack.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:28.819
Hopsack is one of my favorite fabrics, especially
for travelers or men that they work in them

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:31.130
because it's not going to wrinkle.

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:35.939
You can crumple it up and it'll look just
perfectly fine, so consider hopsack, and that

00:04:35.939 --> 00:04:38.410
comes in a wide variety of colors.

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:41.289
But keep everything towards the more solids.

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:47.180
Don't go for anything outlandish because again,
this is work clothing and these are big ticket

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.490
items, especially since I know you're having
them made by a tailor.

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:57.259
So go for simple, go for classic, go for solid
colors, go for weaves that are going to bounce

00:04:57.259 --> 00:04:59.789
right back or not going to show wrinkles.

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:02.479
That would be a bit of my guidance.

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:03.520
Hopefully that helps, sir.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.740
I wish you the best of luck.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:09.389
I'll also link you guys to an article I did
over at Real Men Real Style which there was

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:13.580
a whole lot of sports jacket fabrics, so you
can go out there and get a few more ideas.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:14.580
All right.

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.659
I'll see you guys in the next video.

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:16.839
Bye-bye.
