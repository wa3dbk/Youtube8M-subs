00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:14.770
Hello , my name is Yurin Artem and I am
from Team “Underways”

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.770
Our today’s tutorial cover the trick called
Backflip 360. It is very dangerous and

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.930
difficult to learn it on your own, without
knowledge of technique. This is not a

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:28.220
basic trick, so, before trying it , you have
to do a perfect high backflip on the

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.230
ground,  or even better if you could do it
on a height.

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.490
First Lead-up exercise
High-Jump

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.650
After a good warm-up you need to jump
straight up, with arms swing.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.470
Then , remember how to do a backflip
with perfect tuck position.(группировка)

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:46.040
Concentrate on  your arms swing

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.900
Second Lead-up exercise
Left hand workout

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.320
1. Both hands are raised in the air
2. Left hand begins to go down and at the

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.490
same time your left shoulder-blade goes
backward.

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.050
At that time your elbow bends and goes
straight along your body

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.630
Your left shoulder-blade constantly goes
backwards

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:13.620
Initially, concentrate on technique, and
then try to gather speed. Don’t forget,

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.340
that this movement starts with
shoulder-blade, and afterwards the elbow

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.070
goes.

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.830
Main mistakes
1. Hand is too far away from your body.  If

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.190
you slow down rotation speed, you won’t
get such a fast move.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.710
2. Using only your hands, without your
shoulder-blade. This won’t let you to

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:29.600
rotate your body. Constant
shoulder-blade move gives you the

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:32.050
rotation.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.740
Right Hand
1. Your right hand is raised in the air

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.400
2. With a circle moves you reach to your
left thigh, bending your hand.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.000
3. After that it continues to bend and
press to your body.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:47.740
4. Amplitude dragging of your hands to
your body, that’s what gives the rotation.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.670
Main mistakes
1. Small Amplitude.  You are missing the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.220
circle move with you hands, trying to
immediately press them to your body.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:02.460
2.  Wrong hand movement.  It goes not to
your thigh, but to your shoulder or else.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.170
With this wrong movement you will get a
lot of problems doing Backflip 360.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.170
Mistakes with both hands workout
1. Wrong hands movement. Instead of

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.140
swinging them, you just press them to
your body. Because of this your rotation

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.810
is too slow.
2. Hands are not pressed.   After swing you

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.250
have to press them to your body. …

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:30.570
Third lead-up exercise
Jump-up and 360 rotation

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.410
Now, we are jumping up and, after your
hands are on the top, rotate our body

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.400
Main mistakes
1. Losing body balance. Keep your

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.350
shoulders and body straight. Jump, only
after that begins the rotation. Start with

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:51.190
180 degree jump, slightly getting closer to
360.

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:56.830
2. Small Amplitude in hands workout.
Repeat previous exercises.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.130
3. Relaxed body. Bad landing, no
accuracy, no fast rotation.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:08.680
Fourth lead-up exercise
Backflip without tuck position.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.390
To simplify your task, you need to do a
Backflip without tuck position, bending

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:17.690
your knees a little. Backflip 360 is much
easier to do after this. Or you can try

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.440
Blanche.
1.Same way as a backflip

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.750
2. Pulling your legs in half – is the only
difference.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.660
3.  You are pulling your body the same
way as in a backflip.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.410
4. Avoid arching in your back or chest
5. While you are jumping, your head look

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:40.130
in front of you. Don’t look down and don’t
throw it back

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.790
Main mistakes
1. Throwing head back. It leads to

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:48.410
bending
2. Poor/weak jump. With this mistake you

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.270
are losing height. Wait until you reach the
height.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:04:00.250
3. Huge arching in back or chest.
Unnecessary move, which spoil your body

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:04.370
structure. You lose height and time for
rotation.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:11.580
4. Pulling your knees ahead. Your knees
break, instead of going up, they are going

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.810
forward. And you are doing a very low
backflip

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:25.370
Fifth lead-up exercise
Backflip 360 (Finally)

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:31.270
Now, we have to unite Backflip and 360.
Try to do this only after you have perfect

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:32.760
backflip without tuck position
To simplify your task, try to do it from

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.660
height(2-3 feet) , or to do it in a foam pit,
soft mat or friable sand

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:42.180
It will be easier for you, if someone could
support you.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:45.230
One of the most important rules is that
you are beginning to rotate only after you

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.510
jumped high and started to do a backflip.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:50.510
1. You are doing a normal backflip from
height

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:53.450
2. Catch the moment, when your hands
made a circle swing.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.870
3. Then begin the rotation.  Like in a
previous exercise

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.100
4. As you are doing this trick, you may
change the way you are swinging your

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:02.840
arms. Keep going.
5.There are many variant , that’s only one

00:05:02.990 --> 00:05:06.500
of they (the best actually)
6.  As you are rotating don’t stop doing

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:10.270
backflip
7.Bending your knees a little will help you

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:12.320
to land it
Main mistakes

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:16.310
1. Early rotation. Your hands haven’t
made a full circle. You are losing height

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:25.110
and jump aside.
2. Poor Rotation. Pull your body, don’t

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:30.850
stop the rotation, or you won’t complete
it, even if you jumped high.

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:40.420
3. Wrong hand movement. Repeat 1-3
exercises.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:47.170
4. Wrong shin movement. Your shin goes
back while you are jumping. It leads to

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.090
very serious injury. Keep your legs
strained.

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.880
6.Relaxed legs. Your legs are too relaxed,
hitting each other and hindering your

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.460
movement.  Strain your legs in order to
control movement.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:59.380
7.  Wrong shoulder movement. You are
starting to pull your shoulders back,

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:04.310
without hands swinging. So you land too
far away on all you four limbs))

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:09.600
8. Unequal rotation. Your hands are
working individually, one faster, one

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:17.290
slower. Try to combine both moves.
9.Poor jump. This move has to be fast

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:20.340
and high, as high as you can. Straighten
your legs to reach the top.

00:06:20.470 --> 00:06:24.770
10. You are losing yourself. You jump
high, try to do 360, lose orientation, have

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.530
no idea what to do and land on your back.
You are dong backflip and half of the

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:33.530
rotation. Don’t hurry. Repeat previous
exercises.

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:41.350
11. Strekosat.  Pushing your body up, you
“break” your legs. Your knees go

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:45.170
forward, while shoulders go back. It is
very dangerous, because you can hit your

00:06:45.310 --> 00:06:50.760
head.
12.Late rotation. Don’t be too late As you

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:54.170
are on a maximum height, begin the
rotation. Don’t forget to press your hands

00:06:54.310 --> 00:07:00.630
to your body, in order to catch/spot
landing.

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.000
13. Hands are too far away from your
body during the rotation. It won’t allow

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:10.910
you to gather speed. You just lose
body-control, especially landing.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.200
Good luck.
