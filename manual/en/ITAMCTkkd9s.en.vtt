00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:06.600
Think Volvo, think safety, right?

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.320
That's certainly true for the Volvo V40, which
not only scored the full five stars in the

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.470
EuroNCAP tests, but also achieved the highest
ever rating for pedestrian safety, a record

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.510
that still stands today.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.850
However, safety doesn't have to be boring,
and although the V40 shares much with the

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:28.040
Ford Focus, Volvo's designers have expended
a lot of effort on giving the V40 a look all

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:29.040
of its own.

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.790
It's worked, too, and you don't need to take
our word for it, with the V40 coming second

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.109
only to the XC60 in Volvo's global sales figures
for 2013.

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:43.940
Despite its Focus underpinnings, it's unquestionably
a Volvo, and much of that stems from the strong

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.510
shoulder line that runs from the front all
the way to the rear lights which, by the way,

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.920
feature a rather delicious bit of detailing
in the way they illuminate.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.739
The interior, too, is unmistakably Swedish.

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.359
That means some appealing technical finishes,
some of the best seats in the business, and

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:00.960
a wide range of adjustment.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.260
There's also the now familiar floating centre
stack that still looks fresh and provides

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.000
a little extra storage space, something the
cabin isn't short of anyway.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.430
It looks a bit of a button-fest at first glance,
but everything's logically placed, and we've

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.820
always appreciated Volvo's blindingly obvious
climate controls.

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.820
The dashboard is well laid out, with a clear
focus on the driver, and we particularly like

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.549
the thick-rimmed steering wheel and the chunky
column stalks.

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.320
The instruments are now entirely digital and
they boast exceptionally clear graphics and

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.430
a rather elegant design by default, with two
other modes - Eco and Performance - if you

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:37.939
fancy a different look.

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:42.320
They've spent a bit of time on the animations,
too, with smooth transitions between menus

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.729
and a rather fun silhouette that appears when
you turn the car off.

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.969
Although not standard on all models, Volvo's
Sensus Connect system offers a range of functions

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:56.770
including navigation with full European mapping
and UK post codes, DAB digital radio, Bluetooth

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.890
connectivity, the ability to store tracks
on the built-in hard drive, and an extensive

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.950
array of vehicle configuration options.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.470
One particularly neat touch is that the owners'
manual is built-in to the system so there's

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.830
no need to reach into the glove-box and thumb
your way through the index.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.470
Volvo have opted to move the rear seats slightly
inboard, and this gives rear-seat passengers

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.060
a better forward view and a little more elbow
room, although this does obviously make it

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:24.790
a little tight for whoever gets the middle
seat.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.060
Headroom also is only adequate.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:31.280
Still, there are some neat touches back here,
such as the little space to store your phone

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:36.190
and other goodies, plus a pair of cup-holders
hidden away in the middle seat.

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:40.430
Space in the boot is respectable with 402
litres loaded to the roof with the seats in

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:45.319
place, and although there's a handy underfloor
compartment, it's a £100 option, while the

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.900
space-saver spare wheel and jack the lives
beneath is a £150 option.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.210
Drop the rear seats and total space increases
to 1,032 litres floor to ceiling, and as long

00:02:56.210 --> 00:03:00.870
as you've added the flexible load floor option
you'll have a usefully flat area to play with,

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:05.140
although it's a shame there's nowhere to store
the parcel shelf when it's not in use - it

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.030
doesn't quite fit in the underfloor compartment,
either.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.439
Now, engines, and there's a few to choose
from.

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:15.450
They're all turbocharged, and the range starts
with 1.6-litre four-cylinder petrol units

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.990
with 120, 150 and 180hp, plus a 2.5-litre
five-cylinder with 250hp.

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:28.120
The diesel range starts with the 1.6-litre
D2 unit with 115hp as fitted to our car, and

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.930
moves up to a pair of 2.0-litre units with
150 and 175hp.

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:37.730
The D2 diesel is likely to be of interest
to many because it achieves incredibly low

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.750
CO2 emissions of just 88 g/km making it free
of road tax, with an official economy figure

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.470
of 83.1mpg.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.250
While we couldn't get anywhere near that during
our testing, we notched up a fairly consistent

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.680
average around the 55mpg mark, although on
a longer journey a figure in the low to mid-60s

00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:58.519
should be easily achievable.

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:03.390
On the road, it's a little lethargic below
about 1800rpm but if you can keep it in the

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:08.900
somewhat narrow power band it's a surprisingly
strong performer, with 0-62mph taken care

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:11.959
of in 11.9 seconds.

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.340
The six-speed manual gearbox has been given
a great shift-action that makes stirring your

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.100
way through the ratios a pleasure, but the
'box does feature rather tall gearing, and

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.400
some of the ratios are spaced oddly apart
- presumably in order to achieve those killer

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:28.710
economy and emissions figures - but the net
result is that it's not difficult to fall

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.020
out of the power band and find yourself in
no man's land until the boost builds again.

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.650
That said, once you've grown accustomed to
it, it's not difficult to extract the best

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.080
from it, and I have to say for an engine with
a modest 115hp it does an admirable job of

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.180
keeping up with fast-moving traffic.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.120
It's fairly well subdued while it's doing
it too, with just a few subtle diesel noises

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:55.210
entering the cabin, while both wind and road
noise are also kept at bay.

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:59.400
While Volvos have traditionally been given
a rather stately set of road manners, the

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.320
V40 actually goes about its business rather
well.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:07.289
It's not desperately involving, but there's
just enough enthusiasm behind the steering

00:05:07.289 --> 00:05:11.840
and the body control to keep things interesting,
although we did notice a tendency to crash

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:17.460
into larger surface imperfections and make
a bit of a din when driving over speed-bumps.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:20.860
So, back to safety for a minute.

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.360
All V40s are fitted with the company's City
Safety system as standard, and this applies

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:30.960
the brakes automatically if it detects a collision
is imminent from speeds up to 31mph.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.490
You can upgrade this system by specifying
a £1,900 Driver Support Pack which adds an

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.660
array of sensors including a radar unit in
the front grille and a set of cameras and

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.690
other sensors mounted on the windscreen.

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:47.360
These combine with ultrasonic sensors around
the car to provide features such as blind

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.310
spot warning, cross traffic alert, lane keep
assist, plus a system to detect obstacles

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.050
in your path and warn you via a series of
lights at the base of the windscreen, and

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.630
these also glow threateningly at you like
an angry Cylon if you get too close to the

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:03.090
car in front.

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.199
The system also provides what is perhaps the
best adaptive cruise control system we've

00:06:07.199 --> 00:06:11.150
driven, matching your speed to that of the
vehicle in front, applying the brakes to maintain

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:15.660
a set distance if required, and even allowing
you to change gear on manual cars without

00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:17.630
cancelling the cruise function.

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.960
On automatic models, it will even brake smoothly
to a standstill and pull away again in stop-start

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.960
traffic.

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:26.030
All very impressive.

00:06:26.030 --> 00:06:30.320
You might be wondering how much all of this
is likely to cost you, and the answer is potentially

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.979
less than you think.

00:06:31.979 --> 00:06:39.660
The V40 range starts at £18,995 for the T2
petrol, with the diesel models starting from

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.780
£20,795.

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:46.419
It can all get a little pricey if you spend
too much time ticking boxes on the option

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:52.560
list, with our D2 test car coming in at £31,870
after nearly £6,500 of options.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:58.790
Keep it sensible, though, and the Volvo V40
represents a value for money, stylish, practical

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:11.690
and typically safe alternative to the usual
suspects.
