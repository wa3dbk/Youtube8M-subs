00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Foreign Body

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Um, Leuko .. give me the status, will you?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Roger, Nervy, Let me see, blodd pressure 80 to 120.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.000
That´s fine, isn´t it?

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:19.200
Yes

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Pulse 65 ... Heart: also normal...

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:22.200
Breathing ... heavy.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Body temperature ... oh dear!
37 degrees Celsius and rising ...

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:26.000
What?? That means fever!

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:27.000
Maybe by tomorrow it´ll be ... ?

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.000
No! Let´s not take any chances.
We need medication immediatly!

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.200
How about ZeroP?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.200
Never heard of it ...
Looks alright, though.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Roger. Taking in is being prepared!

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.000
Careful now!

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:38.000
It´s inside. - Good.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Dont´s worry. Tomorrow morning
all will be back to normal.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Stomach! Next Stop: Brain.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.200
Has digestion started yet?
- Its entered the blood stream!

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Excellent!

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.200
Brain! Next stop: Heart!

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
ZeroP! Welcome on board!

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
Hello.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
I´m Nervy. In charge of the nervous system.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.000
This is Leuco, from circulation. - Hi.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:46.200
And that´s Lymphy, from cellular defense.
27
00:01:47,00 --&gt; 00:00:28,20
Feeling not so well today.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.000
I see.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Now let me guess! Is this a human organism?

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.000
It is! - Yes!

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
OK. Rule No. 1 is as follows:

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Keep calm, everybody, and dont ... panic!

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.150
That´s a cough!

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.000
We´ve got a problem!
- Attention! Virus Alarm!

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.000
It´s that you called me in!
Take me right there!

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000
OK. Let´s take the blood stream.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
No! The virus would count on that.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
We should make our way... through the nose!

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
OK! Hold tight.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Careful! It´s slippery here.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Now we are in the sinus of the nose.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
The virus has increased the production of mucus!

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Looks revolting!

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Stop! This is it!

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
These are the lungs!

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.200
Nothing to be seen!

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.000
What was trhat?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Ahh! over there! The A virus!! I knew it!

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
That´s the cough!
Hold tight, everyone!

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So you´re putting up
with being treated like this?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
He´s right! Lymph! Don´t put up with this!

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Come on, Lymph, go for him!

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.000
Show him, Fatty! Go ahead ... that´s it ...

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.000
Our Lymph will do him in.
- I wouldn´t be too sure.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
I think I´d rather return to the brain now.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
Right! Now let ME handle this!

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Incidentally, ZeroP: Just how will you fight this virus?

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000
Ha! Simple! I´ll neutrlize it with my active substances!

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:45.000
Come along!

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
Really? That´s cool!

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Don´t move so fast!

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.000
Stop! Do you hear that?

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000
Sure! That is the haertbeat!

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.000
Look! over there!
- The ventricle!

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Let´s go for another frequence!

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
What does that mean for us?

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:07.000
The blood pressure will go up.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:08.150
Well? So what?

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000
No-one there? Hm.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:30.000
Let´s find out how fit this body really is!

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Ah! Wait a minute ...

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000
What on earth is this?
- Alarm!

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.000
No need to panic!
- That´s what you think!

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.150
The virus ... It´s over there!
It´s taken control!

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.000
Not for much longer!

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:59.000
Just wait til my substances will take effect!

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000
Alright! You come right over here!

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:05.150
OK! You asked for it - take this!

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000
A ... yum yum.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.000
This is sugar!

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000
So now ... I´ll show you who your hero
"ZeroP" really is!

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.000
Hey ... Wait a mi .. what?

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Always read the small print!

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.000
What? A placebo?

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000
"PLACEBO - sugar solution - 
ineffectiveness guaranteed."

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
Exactly!

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
Nervy? What is a "placebo"?

00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000
That´s a ... totally ineffective ...

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.000
.. utterly useless good for nothing substance!

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000
You can´t get rid of a cold as fast as that!

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Attention! Pressure balance!

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000
Noo!!!

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000
Ahh! I´ll be back!

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000
It is ... gone!

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.000
Fever warning lifted!
Temperature back to normal

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.000
Virus has been removed!

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Zerop, you did it!
The cold is gone!

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:41.000
Of course it is.

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:43.000
You are the greatest!

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:45.000
Well - and no side effects whatsoevver! Guaranteed!

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.000
Right!

00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:48.050
From now on - we will take only placebo-medication.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
So that´s is the view to the outside? - Yes.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
That´s cool! Mind if I slip into the controlseat for a sec?

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000
Why not. - Sure.
104
00:06:58,00 --&gt; 00:06:60,00
So what´s this button for?

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000
Noooo!!
