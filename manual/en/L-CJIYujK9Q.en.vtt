00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Yet again the earth has been shaking

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Rising up against human taking,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Nature is seeing to

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Us knowing that it doesnâ€™t like what we do.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
were living on a debt of tomorrow

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.000
little kids crying bitter tears of sorrow

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Why do you not consider

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
the things you do to our future

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Destroying all the things living
Why?

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:27.000
what will happen to the young people
Why?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
We can't wait for help from above.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:38.000
must work to save the things that we love

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
why?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
why?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.000
polluted water, cut down trees,

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:57.000
dreams blown away by exhausts black breeze

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000
we have to be aware of thus

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:09.000
that we need nature, it doesn't need us

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
now it's time to take some action 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.000
let's switch to a better way to live

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000
just talking won't give satisfaction

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
still earth is willing to forgive

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
floods are aggravating our living,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:32.000
nature has been much to forgiving 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
the climate change is proof of our sinning

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.000
it's time to try a new beginning

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000
Why do you not consider

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:57.000
the things you do to our future

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:08.000
Destroying all the things living
Why?

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:20.000
what will happen to the young people
Why?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
We can't wait for help from above.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:32.000
must work to save the things that we love

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000
why?

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000
why?
