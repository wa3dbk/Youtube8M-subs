Hey, how are you doing? And welcome back to
this European Schoolnet Academy course on

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.669
Games in Schools. Well done for getting this
so far. We are now on module 4. You should

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.349
have already completed the 3 first modules
which were “Why use computer games?”,

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.599
“Using games for Thematic Learning”, “Learning
Games”. Module 4 we are on now “What can

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.270
we learn from games?” and more about that
in a minute, and then you have still got 2

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.170
modules to go after this one. “Designing
Computer Games” and “Why is it important

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.300
to teach about games?”. As I have mentioned,
this is module 4. We are going to look at

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.470
a few things in this module. We are going
to have a look at some augmented reality,

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:53.470
I will explain about what that is in the first
unit, we are going to have a look at some

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.720
geocaching, some gamification of traditional
ICT activities, a quick look at Digital Badges

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:04.860
and then there will be some tasks for you
to have a go at the end as well. Throughout

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.440
the course, I will be encouraging you to go
away and to explore things, and to investigate

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.230
things and fundamentally to play with things.
I have put a lot of resources onto the European

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:20.790
Schoolnet Academy portal for you to have a
look at, and just like anytime with any of

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.860
the modules in this course, if you have got
any question, then please get in contact either

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:32.250
by social media or via the portal. What are
we trying to do here? What we are trying to

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.280
do in terms of learning from games is we are
trying to think about how do we take something

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:43.690
which is quite traditional and then make it
more engaging through game play, and I guess

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:52.200
in particular digital game play. Scrabble
is a pretty good example of this. Scrabble

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.080
is a game. It has made into a bit more of
an interesting game because different letters

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.990
have got different value, and depending on
where you place the letters on the board,

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.599
you can double or even sometimes triple your
score, but fundamentally it is a game about

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:12.939
spelling. It is probably one of the longest
lasting educational games that we have got

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:16.909
and it is still very popular. It can also
be very supportive if you get children to

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.629
play working in pairs. It is pretty good for
adults as well. So if thinking how can we

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:27.099
take this traditional game and make it more
engaging? There are lots of different ways

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.049
that you can do that. One way for example
might be that you put it onto a games console

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:37.629
game or you might play it via the Facebook
app, so you are taking the traditional game

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.959
and you are augmenting it by including some
type of digital game play. And that is all

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:46.519
we are going to be thinking about as we move
through the units of this course. How do we

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:52.129
take something which is traditional, and how
do we augment it and improve it, so it suits

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:57.150
more people. That is not to say that the original
of Scrabble is not any good because that is

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:03.180
not correct, it is really good, but digitising
it then you might be able to cater for all

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.829
learning styles and for more people in your
classroom. We will be exploring that in a

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.139
bit more detail as we work our way through
this unit.
