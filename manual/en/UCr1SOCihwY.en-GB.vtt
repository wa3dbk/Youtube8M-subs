00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.200
My great-great aunts lived in a beautiful apartment in Vienna

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:21.660
In 1938, when the Nazis came, they were taken to a concentration camp, to Theresienstadt

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.140
where they died

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:30.380
Jewish families who had paintings and items of value had to make a declaration of wealth

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.060
an intricate list of all, every single item

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.600
there are over 200 items in that list, from portraits to miniatures to statues

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.640
everything is there

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.460
and with that declaration, the Nazis knew what was available, and they were removed

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.000
They had to sell them under duress at ridiculous prices

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.430
in fact, it was theft. They had no choice

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.440
Basically, if the Jews didn’t own anything, how could they exist?

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.020
They took everything from them, annihilating them, really

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:17.860
Restitution gives a person the right to reclaim paintings that were sold under duress

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.040
and so the time became right, and I went to my solicitor in Vienna and said

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.250
look, this is the story: can you help us?

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.220
The Lampi was the first one to come back to the country

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:38.310
It was at the Ministry of Finance in Berlin, and we had to jump through so many hoops with the Germans

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.910
who wouldn’t admit, perhaps, that it was ours

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:48.810
Eventually, and one way or the other, they admitted it, and it came back into the country

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.100
When it arrived at Sotheby’s, we were invited to go and see it

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.060
and they’d obviously hung it up beautifully

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:05.500
As we walked into the room, it was the goose bumps, the hair at the back of our necks, you know tears

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.860
it was so unexpected to see this, and the emotion that it engendered, quite, quite incredible

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.480
and there she was; she was one of us

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.020
It’s like finding a member of the family

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.140
It’s part of your family, of those that loved it and of what they suffered

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:32.260
it’s not just the painting, it’s the emotion that goes with it

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:35.260
You don’t believe there’s going
to be this sort of emotion
