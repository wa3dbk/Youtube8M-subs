Hello, I am Statia Widak and I am from Plainsfield,
Massachusetts and I love collecting glass

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:17.490
it is my hobby and I am here on behalf of
Expert Village. I have over a hundred thousand

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.900
pieces and different manufacturers and which
I know there were over a hundred different

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:33.030
manufacturers from the period of 1900 to the
year 2000. They started very nonchalantly

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.100
because a girlfriend of mine told me to stop
at a yard sale and I did and that was the

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:44.940
first time in my life and that was over ten
years ago. I always loved glass and dishes;

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.160
they were always a favorite of mine. Now this
would be one piece, something like this, it’s

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:57.800
made by Westmoreland and it is probably a
hundred years old and it is an American, I

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:05.309
did find it up and looked in a book by Gene
and Kathy Florence and they figure it is over

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:13.700
a hundred years old. Here is a Blenko, Blenko
glass, that would be in the fifties, it was

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.880
very popular. It is a squeeze bottle. Here
is something that is just the juice pitcher

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:29.200
right here and in the forties and sixties
we used to use this as juice pitchers. I have

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:37.860
books that, different books on glass and it
would show designs and I would fall in love

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:46.579
with it such that it, this here, another little
glass, a brazing shield is the pattern on

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:55.840
it and that was made by Columbia Glass in
1905. Then I have another little tiny one,

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.359
some I pick up big, little whatever, as long
as they have got the feel this has a beautiful

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:09.569
feel to it, it’s got like clover, a four
leaf clover and it’s unusual, I look for

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:18.540
unusual glass too, color, I love color. Today
we, I don’t see as much as I used to, but

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.910
most of these pieces were picked up from around
the area which is Plainsville, Mansfield,

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.090
Rathra, right now, of course people throw
all their junk away, it is not junk, it is

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:40.099
just beautiful but they just discard it. If
they are smart they get in touch with an antique

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:45.260
dealer who comes to the house and he can sell
the glass for money.
