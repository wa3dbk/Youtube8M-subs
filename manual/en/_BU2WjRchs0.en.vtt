00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:09.190
Today, I am going to show you part 3 of how you
can swim. Many people come into the showroom

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:32.369
and ask can I swim in Aquatic III. So I am
going to show you how swimming looks like in

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.870
Aquatic III. Our Aquatic III has a dual temperature being divided. So that it is here 37 degrees

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:55.820
and that side may be 32 degrees, depends on
your desires. The spa part, the hotter part..

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:00.020
we have two lounges. So if I sit in nicely
my body is under water. By the way, I am 1.83

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.629
metres so I am quite long and my legs goes all the way
to the other side of the jacuzzi. You could

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:10.630
see the spa part has two pumps with strong
massage in here.This is a lounge here and on this

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:17.320
side I can lounge as well. And then on that
side I have two seats. So, let's say if there

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:24.479
are four persons, you can sit in here perfectly
in nicely warm water. And at that end, you

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:31.350
could swim and you can get two massage spots
over there. Now I like to show you how we can

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:50.810
swim in the Aquatic III spa. So over here it's a
little bit colder. So I'm gonna exercise to

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.799
get myself a little bit warmer. There are
four pumps on that side to swim in. So, this

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.810
swimspa - I say this swim spa- got four pumps
Very big difference because this swim spa,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.840
you could swim in very nicely. Because of
the four pumps ofcourse. Two pumps are

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.869
holding your body in line. Two other pumps
are giving them power. So two pumps each body

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:33.389
can lie in the swimspa and two pumps give you
either the maximum power for a swimsporter or you can

00:02:33.389 --> 00:02:40.919
adjust it to swim slowly, and you can swim
slowly to train your muscles or whatever. If you

00:02:40.919 --> 00:03:27.290
swim slowly is possible to revalidate or you
want to be the swimming champion of Europe. Just

00:03:27.290 --> 00:04:43.810
here to easy touch. Let me put the power on.
I just did it very quickly, very powerful.

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:45.180
Now I like to show you how you can swim in
nicely and quitly for - you know -to have

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:46.400
a muscle-make or something, or you want to do
it slowly. So either way, you wanna do a nice

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:49.680
slowly exercise or a very powerful sporting exercise.
It's all possible without more experience

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:57.740
with swimming. I think it is about 15 years
that Fonteyn has experience with swimspas. Many different

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:01.419
ways to give you the best swim action that
is available right now in the market. At Passion

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:12.349
Spa, we have four options. So we have a small
one, we have a wider one of 4 metres, 6 metres,

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:18.960
and we have the dual swim- and spa in one. So this one, the dual
temperature is 47 degrees and that one is

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:32.319
30 degrees. And there's a turbine. So the
turbine, you can see on the other side that

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:40.189
is the real sporty one for frontcrawling
or that kind of stuff. This one, you can do

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:48.979
both the relaxing and the sporty one. We have
two other ones: the Aquatic I and the Aquatic

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:58.669
II which are very reasonably priced, while still providing a very

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:12.800
good swim action. So, for everybody we have
something available that fits your needs.

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.120
Here we have the largest swimspa distribution
in Europe. We have many swimspas on stock,

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.949
and I think right now there are 60 swimspas. And thousand of normal swimspas are all stocked.
