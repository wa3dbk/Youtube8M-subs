00:00:08.758 --> 00:00:10.985
Welcome to the Smoke Learning Channel.

00:00:11.734 --> 00:00:13.968
In the previous ConnectFX paint videos,

00:00:14.244 --> 00:00:17.736
the focus has always been 
painting your main colour image.

00:00:18.528 --> 00:00:22.643
This included basics as well as 
cloning on static images.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.667
This video will focus on 
painting on an alpha channel.

00:00:27.401 --> 00:00:31.041
You can follow along with this 
video by downloading the media.

00:00:31.558 --> 00:00:37.733
You will find the link in the YouTube description or
 type the link displayed in your internet browser.

00:00:38.607 --> 00:00:44.257
We are going to use ConnectFX paint to fix an issue
 and then composite it all together.

00:00:45.195 --> 00:00:46.447
Let’s begin.

00:00:46.774 --> 00:00:49.941
I have an open sequence containing the background.

00:00:50.551 --> 00:00:54.992
Select the background and 
press CONTROL+TAB to bring up the FX ribbon.

00:00:55.825 --> 00:00:59.864
Click Create ConnectFX to 
enter into the node compositor.

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:03.215
In the media panel on the left,

00:01:03.417 --> 00:01:07.890
I will click and drag in the clip 
containing the fill and alpha of the talent.

00:01:09.348 --> 00:01:11.352
When working with ConnectFX paint,

00:01:11.893 --> 00:01:16.075
you can either work with the fill and alpha in a 
combined matte container,

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.511
that is what you see here.

00:01:18.715 --> 00:01:22.921
Or you can work with separate clips for 
the fill and alpha channels.

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:27.156
It is not an issue which method you use to 
import the media.

00:01:27.985 --> 00:01:34.186
Now select the source clip in the ConnectFX schematic
 and hover the cursor over the result view.

00:01:34.702 --> 00:01:38.910
Press F4 to toggle between displaying the 
fill and alpha channel.

00:01:39.738 --> 00:01:45.383
Now this alpha channel has an intentional hole cut
 into it for the purpose of this lesson.

00:01:45.956 --> 00:01:50.574
However you will encounter this type of scenario 
when you are keying a subject

00:01:50.574 --> 00:01:53.564
who has a colour the matches the keyed background.

00:01:54.242 --> 00:01:58.740
Or perhaps you need to paint an alpha for 
a logo that has been provided to you.

00:01:59.303 --> 00:02:03.464
There are other scenarios and 
multiple ways to tackle the challenges

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.366
but we will focus on alpha painting.

00:02:06.958 --> 00:02:11.262
Hover over the matte view and 
press F4 to see the result view.

00:02:12.055 --> 00:02:16.421
Placing the cursor over the 
ConnectFX node bin and pressing P

00:02:16.421 --> 00:02:21.134
will highlight all nodes beginning with
 P including the paint node.

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:26.480
Click and drag the paint node and 
drop it into the ConnectFX schematic.

00:02:27.331 --> 00:02:31.805
Now connect the source clip fill into 
the front input of the paint node.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:38.528
Also connect the alpha output from the source clip
 into the matte input of the paint node.

00:02:39.552 --> 00:02:44.932
The source clip updates its thumbnail to 
show you that both channels are being accessed.

00:02:45.658 --> 00:02:50.233
Double-click on the paint node to bring 
up the paint tools in the main interface.

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:56.526
If you start painting in the result view, 
you are painting on the fill of the talent.

00:02:56.846 --> 00:03:03.056
But if you hover over the result view and 
press F4, you will see the alpha output.

00:03:03.555 --> 00:03:09.812
With the alpha being displayed in the viewer, you 
can now start painting directly on the alpha channel.

00:03:10.585 --> 00:03:12.942
Depending on the movement of your subject,

00:03:12.942 --> 00:03:20.224
you can paint on just the current frame, from a
 particular frame or paint a stroke on every frame.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:25.163
Scrubbing the time-bar, 
we can see that the talent is clearly moving.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:28.795
So it is best to paint on one frame at a time.

00:03:29.617 --> 00:03:35.030
You can now start painting on the frame and 
than use the left and right arrows on the keyboard

00:03:35.333 --> 00:03:39.291
to advance forward or go backward as 
you paint through each frame.

00:03:40.134 --> 00:03:45.180
With this technique, 
no tracking is available in ConnectFX paint.

00:03:45.813 --> 00:03:51.461
But it is not such a big deal since you are only 
painting on the alpha channel with pure white.

00:03:52.279 --> 00:03:56.454
With that now complete, 
the alpha channel is repaired.

00:03:57.298 --> 00:04:00.914
We’ll quickly use one more node to 
bring everything together.

00:04:01.665 --> 00:04:06.782
Hover over the ConnectFX node bin and 
press B for the Blend and Comp node.

00:04:07.633 --> 00:04:11.382
Drag the node out of the bin and 
drop it into the schematic.

00:04:12.031 --> 00:04:15.869
You can choose either to use 
the talent’s original fill clip

00:04:16.244 --> 00:04:22.955
or the fill result from ConnectFX paint node as 
first connection into the  RED front input.

00:04:23.692 --> 00:04:28.869
If you have not painted on the fill than 
it really doesn’t matter which one you choose.

00:04:29.658 --> 00:04:33.589
For the alpha, take the Blue Matte output from 
the paint node

00:04:33.589 --> 00:04:37.594
and connect it into the first BLUE matte input.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.623
To finish off, connect the background clip into 
the GREEN background input.

00:04:43.595 --> 00:04:49.567
And take the output from the Blend and Comp node and
 connect it to the CFX output node

00:04:49.567 --> 00:04:52.404
that leads back to the sequence.

00:04:52.811 --> 00:04:55.597
If you would like to 
see the same challenge again

00:04:55.597 --> 00:05:01.882
but using the Desktop paint instead of 
ConnectFX paint, please click the link now.

00:05:02.186 --> 00:05:08.042
More ConnectFX paint videos will be 
posted soon showing workflows with paint.

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:14.540
