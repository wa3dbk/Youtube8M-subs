[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:26.768 --> 00:00:28.810
Just the fact that I was
able to learn about what

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.115
Corbin Hill was
doing, and that we

00:00:31.115 --> 00:00:32.990
have professors that
are out in the community

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.230
doing hands-on projects, and
are able to engage students--

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.500
and being involved in that
work is really special.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.060
I think I'm very fortunate
to have had that experience,

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.890
and to have learned
about Corbin Hill

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.080
through my connection
with The New School.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.960
Today is about,
really, a community

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.360
reaching out and
meeting their farmers,

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.090
because Corbin Hill is a
hub where we all gather,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.090
not just food, but people
upstate and downstate.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.150
Corbin Hill is a network of
rural and urban communities

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:03.380
with a goal of supporting
local New York State farmers

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:05.960
and eradicating food
deserts in New York City.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.600
[MUSIC - GHOST, "REVERIE"]

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.220
The students are
involved because they

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.230
come to The New School
with the understanding

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:22.000
that we are a
progressive school.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.030
And we're doing a number
of things across the board.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.920
Students are very
educated about what's

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.010
happening with food, what's
happening with sustainability,

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.360
what's happening with health.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.630
I grew up in an
underserved community

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.790
relying on government assistance
to feed myself and my family.

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:45.430
I didn't realize that the
issues that I faced growing up

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.430
would be similar issues to
someone in the city would face.

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:51.120
I found I needed to do
more to get involved.

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.620
They're actually seeing how
the vegetables are grown.

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.850
They meet the farmers.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:56.020
They connect with them.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.535
They bring that information
back to the classroom.

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:00.160
And then they take
this information out

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:01.870
into the world as their careers.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:05.170
The reason why I went to The
New School in the first place

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.050
was because I wanted to
help make a difference,

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.720
really focus on urban
communities that didn't really

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.230
have a lot of the opportunities
that other places do.

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.470
This is my first year as
the Operations Manager.

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.570
And I'm very happy that
all of you are here.

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.650
So that was really my motivation
for studying urban policy

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.450
specifically at The
New School, because it

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.820
has a reputation
for being focused

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:30.850
on those types of issues.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:34.060
Corbin Hill
represents a movement

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.208
that communities have to make
for their own betterment.

00:02:38.208 --> 00:02:39.250
People will be healthier.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.900
Children will grow healthier.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.910
They'll be able to
perform better in school.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.390
And it's a pretty
broad-based thing.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.230
The ability to be at different
sites, to listen to people.

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.750
Listen, listen, which
is the thing I always

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.250
drive with my students.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.740
If you don't listen,
you don't know anything.

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.180
Knowing that we're
going to places

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.440
where there is food deserts.

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.070
And fast food, local bodegas,
and convenience stores

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:04.810
is what you see everywhere.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.595
And then seeing people respond
positively about eating fresh

00:03:08.595 --> 00:03:10.720
fruits and vegetables from
Schoharie County, it's--

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.440
I don't know, it
gives a lot of hope.
