Hello and welcome I'm ZaphodX and today I'm
going to show you Novus Aeterno by Taitale

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.340
studios.

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:24.689
Novus Aeterno is an MMORTS, a massive multiplayer
online real time strategy game, set in a single

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:27.490
huge persistent universe.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.990
It's currently in alpha stage and has been
in development for 5 years.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.120
They are running a kickstarter to fund the
final stretch of development,

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.330
so do check the description for a link to
that.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:42.329
So as you can see, it looks really gorgeous.

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.940
The space background looks beautiful
and I'm sure you guys are also thinking how

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.670
awesome this would look in Planetary Annihilation.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.220
So let's take a little look at the game, you
start based on a single planet and

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.730
as you zoom out you can see the planet in
your solar system in space view and as we

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:03.910
zoom out further to celestial view you can
see all of the surrounding solar systems

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.810
in this huge persistent universe, and these
solar systems just go on and on and on.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.270
every single player spawns within this one
universe of star systems.

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:20.159
Jumping back down to our starting planet we
can build our buildings here on the surface,

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.530
with buildings to mine your resources, trading
outposts, storage for a buffer space, factories

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.259
to increase your production speed,
and shipyards to increase the number of spaceships

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.220
you can produce at the same time.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.700
So when creating your space fleet, you design
different types of spaceships to suit your

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.700
style.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.020
You choose a hull type and then
choose all your attachments for your craft

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.020
to have.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.450
You can choose a variety of weapons, engines
to power and manouvere your

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.979
craft and other utilities like fighter bays,
drop pods and faster than light drives for

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.310
warpspeed travel.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.329
All of these affect what capabilities your
ship has and how it performs in battle.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.880
I will go over the gameplay and micro of space
warfare in my next video, but there's a lot

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.229
of important strategy
with how you use the craft you've designed,

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.930
where you attack your enemy and how you move
your ships.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.420
You can jump your damaged ships into the middle
of enemy fleets to damage them, break their

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.580
formations
and cause chain reactions.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.760
Flanking is critical for targeting weak points
in your enemies hull and ship formations.

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:32.280
So for me I'm interested in the e-sports side
of things, and aside from the single universe,

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:35.319
there is also a simulator and hunger games
scenario.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:40.290
The simulator allows for sandbox or competitive
play where you can generate your army and

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.370
make custom fleet vs fleet battles
to hone your strategy and tactics or compete

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.709
with other players.

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.240
The Hunger games scenarios are a special server
up for a limited time only where players compete

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.580
in a system dwindling in resources.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.340
As planets contain limited resources players
must conquer new planets and survive to remain

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.490
the last player standing.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:10.220
So in PA we're used to a high level of communication
with the game devs and Novus Aeterno is no

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.769
different with
an infiltrator program where people engaged

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:18.739
in the alpha have access to a private forum
where feedback goes straight to the devs

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:23.870
and shapes the development of the game, with
devs posting in almost every thread and directly

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.610
engaging with the community
on a very high level.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:33.580
So this is Novus Aeterno, aiming to build
the largest strategy game ever where you design

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.690
and build
fleets, control them on the battlefield and

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:42.220
forge alliances and treaties in a single gigantic
universe.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.980
There's so many other ways to play the game
I haven't touched on with PvP missions, NPC

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.430
interactions and player-made jobs
You can play whatever role you desire, whether

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.019
you want to divide and conquer, run mercenary
missions or

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.510
tax and trade your way to dominance.

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.800
I'm going to cover some more content on this
soon, with developer Nick, the creator of

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:03.939
Novus Aeterno.

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:09.340
Please leave any comments or questions you
have for him and I will cover all those questions

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.030
for you in the next video
Once again check out the kickstarter link

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.110
below for lots more information and to help
fund the game,

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.519
thanks for watching and I will see you again
next time.
