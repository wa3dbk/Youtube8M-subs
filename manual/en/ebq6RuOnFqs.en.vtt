00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Hi, I'm Felix.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
And I'm Stefan.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.400
We are Radical Fish Games presenting CrossCode.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.300
CrossCode is a 2D Action-RPG set in the distant future.

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.500
It tells the story of Lea, a player stuck in an MMO...

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.800
...who has lost her memory and can't speak.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.140
Well, mostly.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.300
Right.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.240
Of course, this won't stop Lea from playing the game

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.000
taking on the challenges and meeting other players on the way.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
And while Lea is playing the game, her memory will return piece by piece.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.400
So eventually you may come to understand

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.640
why a new player is stuck in an MMO in the first place.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.700
CrossCode is a mix of the Action-Adventure and RPG genre

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:07.000
That means you get a lot of different features in one game, like

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
world exploration, quests and a pinch of grinding

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000
Building your character with levels, skills and equipment

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
A fast-paced combat system

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.400
And puzzles, lots of puzzles.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.900
And finally there's one core mechanic that makes CrossCode really unique:

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:24.000
Throwing balls!

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.020
Throwing balls at switches and around the corner

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:28.400
Throwing balls at all your enemies like robots

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.160
more robots, giant turrets and meerkats.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.000
And throwing balls to do this!

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Work on CrossCode started about 3 years ago.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.400
We've spent most of our free time on all the things we have today.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.400
This includes a custom game engine to run CrossCode

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.000
in the web browser, 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
a large number of content creation tools,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.820
and of course the first demo of CrossCode you play today.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.400
Now it's time to finish CrossCode

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.700
and this is where you come in.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.000
Developing such a content-rich RPG

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.500
takes a lot of effort, but if we meet the funding-goal

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.000
we can go full-time on CrossCode and release the game

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.200
as soon as possible.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.700
So if you want to see how this ball-throwing adventure

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.000
turns out for Lea, 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
consider supporting our project. Thanks!

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Thank you!
