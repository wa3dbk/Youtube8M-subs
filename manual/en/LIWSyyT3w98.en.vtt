00:00:00.406 --> 00:00:05.376
&gt;&gt; [Music] For generations,
we dreamed about a place

00:00:05.726 --> 00:00:07.426
to live and work in space.

00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:11.886
A place where life up there
would benefit life down here.

00:00:12.666 --> 00:00:14.926
Today, that dream has come true.

00:00:15.796 --> 00:00:19.326
Research on the International
Space Station improves lives all

00:00:19.806 --> 00:00:20.716
over the world.

00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:24.966
The Station's benefits for
humanity grow everyday.

00:00:25.256 --> 00:00:28.966
And they can be told by the
lives that have been changed.

00:00:29.516 --> 00:00:38.796
[ Music ]

00:00:39.296 --> 00:00:41.156
&gt;&gt; Is that 2?

00:00:41.156 --> 00:00:43.416
Can you say 2?

00:00:43.416 --> 00:00:47.516
I found a big lump in the side
of my face and I kept going

00:00:47.516 --> 00:00:48.956
to doctor after doctor.

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:52.546
[ Music ]

00:00:53.046 --> 00:00:57.036
And I was in so much
pain at that time,

00:00:57.036 --> 00:00:59.636
I was like dying in bed.

00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:01.376
It hurt so bad.

00:01:01.496 --> 00:01:02.976
I've never been in so much pain.

00:01:03.516 --> 00:01:05.826
[ Music ]

00:01:06.326 --> 00:01:08.876
I went for my first MRI
and then it showed up with

00:01:08.956 --> 00:01:11.336
like hundreds of
tumors all over.

00:01:11.336 --> 00:01:16.796
And then they sent to me not Dr.
Sutherland [assumed spelling]

00:01:16.796 --> 00:01:18.436
but someone who works
in his office.

00:01:18.436 --> 00:01:25.326
And he thought it was
neurofibromatosis which I had.

00:01:25.386 --> 00:01:27.506
&gt;&gt; We didn't even
realize what that was.

00:01:27.676 --> 00:01:30.366
We'd always heard it called
the Elephant Man disease.

00:01:30.366 --> 00:01:34.616
There's different types
of neurofibromatosis.

00:01:35.146 --> 00:01:38.196
One of them the tumors grow
on the outside of your skin.

00:01:38.646 --> 00:01:42.066
The other one the
tumors grow on the inside

00:01:43.256 --> 00:01:46.866
and hers grow on the inside.

00:01:46.866 --> 00:01:48.956
&gt;&gt; A long time ago when we
was thinking about this,

00:01:49.546 --> 00:01:51.996
we approached McDonald Detlonger
and Associates [phonetic].

00:01:52.596 --> 00:01:55.926
That's a company that happens
to be located in Canada

00:01:55.926 --> 00:01:58.116
that built robots for space.

00:01:58.646 --> 00:02:00.856
They built what Canadians
called Canadiron.

00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:05.426
And then they constructed
the special purpose dextris

00:02:05.496 --> 00:02:07.576
manipulator [phonetic] for the
International Space Station.

00:02:08.916 --> 00:02:13.096
And the idea was if they could
build such complex robots,

00:02:13.476 --> 00:02:17.506
perhaps in collaboration with
medicine, we could build a robot

00:02:18.036 --> 00:02:20.376
that could operate
inside an MRI machine.

00:02:21.236 --> 00:02:29.176
&gt;&gt; We did not realize that it
was built of the same material

00:02:29.176 --> 00:02:34.876
as the space arm and we're quite
amazed that's what he had made

00:02:34.876 --> 00:02:36.216
it out of.

00:02:36.216 --> 00:02:38.036
&gt;&gt; It's the multi
dexterity of the robot

00:02:38.806 --> 00:02:41.466
and that robot could
perform tasks

00:02:41.956 --> 00:02:44.976
that made us become
increasingly confident

00:02:45.476 --> 00:02:47.746
that we could overcome
the challenges related

00:02:47.746 --> 00:02:51.126
to building a robot that could
operate inside an MRI machine

00:02:51.706 --> 00:02:53.166
with the precision,
the accuracy,

00:02:53.296 --> 00:02:55.116
and the dexterity
of a neurosurgeon.

00:02:57.016 --> 00:02:59.896
It just so happened that
the first individual was a

00:02:59.896 --> 00:03:00.366
young woman.

00:03:00.496 --> 00:03:06.056
And the young woman harbored a
fairly complex tumor underneath

00:03:06.166 --> 00:03:08.656
the front part of her brain.

00:03:09.136 --> 00:03:12.786
A machine like NER
[phonetic] can manipulate tools

00:03:13.436 --> 00:03:15.586
at an accuracy of 50 microns.

00:03:15.956 --> 00:03:17.856
That is overwhelmingly superior

00:03:18.556 --> 00:03:21.096
to what the best surgeon
might be able to do.

00:03:21.556 --> 00:03:26.896
&gt;&gt; I think it's fabulous and to
me, it's actually mind boggling

00:03:26.986 --> 00:03:32.006
that someone can take
that material and put it

00:03:32.226 --> 00:03:39.706
into a life saving device that
can help millions of people.

00:03:40.516 --> 00:03:42.736
[ Music ]

00:03:43.236 --> 00:03:45.856
I honestly think that right
now I'd be bed ridden.

00:03:46.056 --> 00:03:47.636
I would not be able
to get out of bed

00:03:47.896 --> 00:03:49.326
if it was not for my doctors.

00:03:50.216 --> 00:03:52.316
My parents would be taking
care of my kids right now.

00:03:53.516 --> 00:03:57.706
[ Music ]

00:03:58.206 --> 00:04:01.726
I guess like I'm glad that
it hopefully helped people

00:04:01.796 --> 00:04:04.726
who have my disease and I
hope that it helps people

00:04:05.336 --> 00:04:08.516
who need surgery in the future.

00:04:10.176 --> 00:04:13.616
If they're ever propositioned
with a chance in the future

00:04:13.616 --> 00:04:15.976
to have something done like
this, I hope they take it.
