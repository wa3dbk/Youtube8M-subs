00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:04.970
You may perceive language
as one big function

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.550
the brain performs.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.420
Interestingly,
though, it's divided

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.780
into a lot of sub-functions.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.300
In this video, we'll discuss
how your brain speaks

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.410
and understands
language and what

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:18.540
happens when those
functions are disrupted.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.530
First, let's go over
some basic neuroanatomy.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.160
For about 90% of
right-handed people,

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.030
language functions
are centralized

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.320
in the left hemisphere
of the brain.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.910
Lefties and ambidextrous
folks are somewhat more

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:32.720
likely to have
language centralized

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.180
in the right hemisphere,
but still about 70% of them

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.880
will have language centralized
in the left hemisphere.

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.910
Within whichever
hemisphere is dominant,

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.700
the two main areas
associated with language

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.050
are Broca's area,
which helps us speak,

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.040
and Wernicke's area, which
helps us understand language.

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:57.410
Broca's area is in the
frontal lobe, usually

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.550
the left frontal lobe, and
it's responsible for language

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:01.870
expression.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.360
When Broca's area
is damaged, people

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.990
tend to have trouble
producing speech.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.930
Their words become
halting or slurred.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.120
This is called non-fluent
aphasia, or Broca's aphasia.

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.140
I remember this by thinking
that Broca's aphasia means

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.200
"broken speech," and aphasia
is just any type of disorder

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.830
that involves language.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.340
When Wernicke's area, back in
the temporal lobe, is damaged,

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.510
you get Wernicke's
aphasia, which

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.460
is quite a different
pattern of behavior

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.260
than you get with
Broca's apahasia.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:34.460
People have no trouble
producing words--

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:36.920
in fact, words kind of
just tumble out of them--

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.170
but the words that do come
out don't make any sense.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.550
It's like listening to a
bunch of nonsense sentences.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.350
People with Wernicke's aphasia,
which is also sometimes called

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.120
"fluent aphasia," can also
have trouble understanding

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.890
what other people say.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.030
And when both Broca's aphasia
and Wernicke's aphasia

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.800
are present, then
you have something

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.260
called "global aphasia," because
it globally affects language

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.420
instead of only affecting
a subsection of it.

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.580
Broca's area and Wernicke's
area are connected in the brain

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.270
by a bundle of nerve fibers
called the arcuate fasciculus.

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.630
One cool thing is
that this loop is also

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.180
found in deaf people
who know sign language.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:18.800
So it's not specific
to a spoken language,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.080
but the brain adapts to
use whatever modality

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:23.650
is necessary for communication.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.860
When this connection
is damaged, people

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.070
experience something called
"conduction aphasia."

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.360
Their ability to conduct
information between listening

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.470
and speaking is
disrupted, which makes

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.900
them unable to repeat
things, even though they

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.940
understand what's being said.

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.460
Pretty crazy.

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:42.000
And once you think
about how many

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.590
language-specific
functions you do every day,

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:47.320
you might wonder how many
different types of aphasia

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:47.910
there are.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.820
And the answer is "a lot."

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.260
We have agraphia, which
is the inability to write,

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.080
anomia, which is the
inability to name things,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.340
and other specific difficulties
in reading, spelling, grammar,

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.580
pronunciation--
all sorts of things

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.240
you may not even realize
that you do effortlessly

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.160
with a healthy brain.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.200
But Broca's apahasia
and Wernicke's aphasia

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:13.360
are the most common.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.190
Language is just one example of
how our brain works in general.

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.650
Big tasks are subdivided into
small tasks, which are then

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.055
spread around in different
parts of the brain.

00:03:23.055 --> 00:03:25.610
And this can actually
be a good thing,

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.720
because it means if you have
very localized or very specific

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:31.320
brain damage, then you
probably won't completely

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.390
lose your ability to perform
some highly important function

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.180
like communication.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.490
In fact, when functions
are divided like that,

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:40.690
it's easier for
your brain to adapt.

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.710
For example, when
people have strokes

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.110
that affect the left
hemisphere of their brain,

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.040
they may have trouble
speaking or something

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.850
right after the stroke, but over
time and with proper therapy,

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:54.730
some of those people
are able to retrain

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.165
other speech-related
parts of their brain

00:03:57.165 --> 00:04:00.510
by creating new connections
between neurons.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.960
Building these
connections, in combination

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.500
with some recovery of the
originally damaged part

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.140
of the brain, can help
these people speak again

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.140
with at least some
degree of fluency.

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.750
And the brain's ability to adapt
and move functions to new parts

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.709
is called neural plasticity,
or synaptic plasticity.

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:21.180
The neurons are plastic,
or flexible enough,

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.410
to learn new routes and
connections, thus allowing

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:26.220
undamaged parts of
the brain to take

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.840
over functions that the damaged
parts previously performed.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.300
Even with perfectly
functioning hemispheres,

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.470
you might still have
trouble naming objects.

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:38.600
This can happen if communication
between the hemispheres

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.950
is disrupted by severing
the corpus callosum, which

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:45.000
is a band of nerve fibers
that connects your brain's two

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.350
hemispheres.

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.790
This creates what's called
a split-brain patient,

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:52.010
because your brain is
now split into two parts.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.810
People used to have
to do this sometimes

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:56.380
as a treatment for
seizures, but in addition

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.650
to helping with that
problem, this surgery

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:00.230
creates some pretty
interesting side

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:02.790
effects in terms of language.

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:05.190
So assuming that
language is centralized

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.140
in the left
hemisphere, this means

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:08.680
that the right
side of your brain

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.000
can't connect to
the language side.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.240
So anything that you perceive
in the right side of your brain

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:17.520
can't be named or dealt
with in terms of language.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.730
Now, you may have heard
before that your brain has

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.000
what's called a contralateral
organization, meaning

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.620
that information
that you perceive

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:27.460
in your left visual field gets
processed by the right side

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.520
of your brain and vice-versa.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.020
So let's think about
what that means

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.990
for a split-brain patient.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:34.990
If you see an
object on your left,

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:37.100
and it gets sent to
your right hemisphere,

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.920
you won't be able to name it.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.636
You'd still be able to pick
it up with your left hand,

00:05:41.636 --> 00:05:43.760
because again, your right
hemisphere is controlling

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.160
your left-side motor neurons,
but you'd have to kind of turn

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.000
your head so that
the object would

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.670
be in your right visual
field before the language

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:54.800
part of your brain would
have any access to it.

00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.820
Now, when I say the
right visual field,

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.730
that doesn't mean
just your right eye.

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:00.780
It means the right side
of your body, which

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.720
you can view with
half of each eye.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:04.750
So there you go.

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:08.260
Lots of pretty cool implications
for how our brain is organized

00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.250
and subdivided in
terms of language.
