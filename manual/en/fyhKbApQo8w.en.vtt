00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:12.119
The importance of networking, building your
career; a lot of people don't think of conventions

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:17.359
and stuff like that as a main tool.

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.119
They can be good or bad, you know.

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:29.900
Mainly I use conventions as a tool to spread
my art around the world.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.690
Actually you know a lot of people can't, you
know, that's really the importance of conventions

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:44.219
is that you know I'm promoting myself in another
area that they don't get the tattooing that

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:45.219
I do.

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:46.310
I'm very specialized in what I do.

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:54.309
I do a very large traditional Japanese style
tattooing, and I focus a lot on the traditional

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.140
values of Japanese art.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:59.829
But with my own twist.

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:02.520
But I keep integrity of the art.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.840
And I'm able to do it in a relatively quickly
manner.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:15.259
A lot of people love to get something you
know that large that fast and be done and

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:17.979
not have to come back for several sessions.

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:25.840
Conventions are a way you know of going all
over the world, and I love my job, I love

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:36.249
what I do, and for me to be able to you know
go to Australia or you know, Europe and just

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:43.819
tattoo people that are never, have the opportunity
to come to America or come to North Carolina

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:44.969
and get tattooed.

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:50.869
And it's awesome to be able to bring that
to other people.

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.209
And that's what conventions do; they bring
people from all over the world to one area

00:01:55.209 --> 00:02:03.159
so that community can actually enjoy and actually
you know benefit from artists from all over

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.299
the world.

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:06.059
It's all about advancing in this business.

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:09.369
We're not going backwards, by no means, you
know.

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:13.360
We're always trying to advance into another
level, you know.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.400
We're going to take it to another level, you
know.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:23.040
I see kids tattooing two or three years and
are like doing you know portraits that are

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.239
ridiculous, you know.

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:29.930
The importance of going to a convention as
an artist that's not working the convention

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:37.590
is that you can go around to you know Mike
Devries or you know, Billy Vegas or Tommy

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:43.519
Helm or Lea Vendetta and you can actually
watch them work, you know.

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:48.410
And this is a hands-on; this is a hands on
thing.

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.969
We learn from watching, you know.

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:58.000
We learn from you know, we've done it a long
time, and I can, I've done it 21 years and

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.060
I've actually watched other people and go,
"Well, I never thought about doing it like

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.230
that," you know, which we're all learning.

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.440
We're all learning to build and we're all
learning to better this business.
