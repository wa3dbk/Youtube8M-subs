00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.200
now to give us progressive perspective
the is independent senator

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.880
of from uh... from out of course free
citizens in member of the progress of

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.759
progress

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:16.299
about us for residents of

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:17.989
outlook is that really simple

00:00:17.989 --> 00:00:19.689
what are you going to speak

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:24.119
i thought the president said a lot of
the right things i think the devil is

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.279
going to be in the details

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:31.349
and also the question is is whether the
president is going to fight for what he

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:32.179
believes

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:34.500
or is this just rhetoric

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.320
object what we saw ur in terms of the
tax deal you remember back in december

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.440
of the president really basically caved
in and gave the republicans almost

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.900
everything they wanted

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.130
in terms of the continuing resolution
the two thousand

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:49.300
and eleven budget

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:52.380
which i'm going to vote against tomorrow

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.150
there what a massive cuts in programs

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.279
all for health care

00:00:57.279 --> 00:01:01.909
offer education with the infrastructure
keeping people warmth i think a very bad

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:02.690
agreement

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.600
now what the president is saying is that
he is drawing a line in the sand and i

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.930
hope very much that the president is
going to say that the republicans that

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:13.850
if you refuse to raise

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.120
the debt limit

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.049
if you are about to destroy will bring
chaos

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.420
to the international financial community

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.219
leading perhaps to wait

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:26.800
major depression if you guys are
prepared to do it

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.610
take responsibility what we are not
going to cave in again we're not going

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.550
to be blackmailed again

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:34.450
you are not good at this memoir

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.050
the government

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.060
and cut back on programs that tens and
tens

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.070
on millions of americans

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.130
absolutely depend upon while as the
president said you give a trillion

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.110
dollars in tax breaks to the richest
people in this country who in many ways

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.290
have never had it so good so the
president's rhetoric one strong week on

00:01:55.290 --> 00:02:00.490
the details but the sixty-four dollar
question is is the president going to

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.110
really fight is a go to rally the
american people say no

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.460
we're not going to bring a hardship to
the people without money while we give

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:13.080
tax breaks for the very rich that's the
issue that remains to be same will

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.890
centers and resistance apparent to me
that you are concerned frank and towards

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.989
end of the speech the president did say

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.000
i might not get

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.970
what i want so that of course opens the
door for negotiations now obviously they

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.280
have to have negotiations i guess my
question to you is are you happy with

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.940
where the negotiations appear to begin

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.750
because the president said referring to
that deficit commission to be put

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.059
together what's your thoughts on that

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:39.569
you know i think you make a very good
point right and i'm not what often

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:40.599
happens

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.429
is we solved somewhere in the middle
what the right of center

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:47.030
than the republicans go into the extreme
right

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.679
and we end up with a settlement that is
very fought for the right

00:02:50.679 --> 00:02:54.539
i think the president should have been
very clear in terms of social security

00:02:54.539 --> 00:03:00.409
for example and saying excuse me social
security as my contributed one nickel to

00:03:00.409 --> 00:03:04.189
the deficit it could pay out every
benefit hold every eligible eligible

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:09.469
american for twenty six years set at one
point six trillion dollar surplus

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:12.290
it is not on the table we're not going
to discuss about

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:17.690
that's for another day in terms of
medicare i think that clearly the raw

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.160
financial problems there are way

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.329
ways the by getting rid of the iraq
receipt

00:03:22.329 --> 00:03:26.890
within the medicare system weekend sage
substantial sums of money

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:30.829
without doing the kinds of damage that
the republicans want to do

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:32.779
so again jake the

00:03:32.779 --> 00:03:35.360
devil will be in the detail but i a m

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.639
not a great fan

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:38.600
of that simpson balls

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.529
deficit reduction commission i think
that's a bad place the software

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:46.029
right you know my my concerns or their
commission is among other things this is

00:03:46.029 --> 00:03:50.849
a security retirement age rear a
sixty-nine if that's a model were using

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.709
you're not happy with a solution at all
and they were also in addition to that

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:56.040
cut benefits

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.140
all four of many many years

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:02.579
workers it is not a good place thus far
from and also most importantly

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:07.439
we have to separate the whole issue of
how we deal with the deficit which is

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:12.599
very important from social security and
how we make show up that that remain

00:04:12.599 --> 00:04:16.849
strong for seventy five years fees are
separate issues because social security

00:04:16.849 --> 00:04:21.060
is paid for by the payroll tax has a
huge surplus right now hassen

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:25.539
contributed one nickel to the deficit
and it is only republican

00:04:25.539 --> 00:04:29.400
ideology and propaganda which is trying
to bring these two issues together

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.949
all right senator senate honestly i
didn't know where you were to come out

00:04:31.949 --> 00:04:34.069
on this and i says concern for me

00:04:34.069 --> 00:04:35.419
mess around six

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:39.250
but they will see al plays out obviously
thank you were doing a sigh of relief

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.040
refinance definitive alright
