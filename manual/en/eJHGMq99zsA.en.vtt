Hi! I am Yvette Parrish, thanks for joining
me at Expert Village. Today I am going to

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:08.869
show you how to cover those pesky little acne
marks, freckles or any blemishes you want

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:09.869
to cover with the use of concealer or foundation.
I am taking a little bit of the concealer

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:10.869
and putting it on her eyelid, because she
her orbit is a little bit discolored. And

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:11.869
it could be because lack of water, lack of
sleep or hereditary, you know working late

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:12.869
hours, just being tired, being sick. Sometimes
having an eye strain if you have a lot of

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:13.869
eye trouble you have a lot of darkness in
this corner. So there is a lot of reasons

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:14.869
why somebody is dark under there, it is not
always because they are tired, a lot of it

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:15.869
is hereditary. So what I am doing is I am
just going to cover a little bitâ€¦. So what

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:16.869
I want to do to give her an extra little boost
under here, and this is a good trick. I have

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:17.869
used this on the set of Miss. Congeniality,
I have used this trick on several different

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:18.869
music videos that I have done makeup on. When
you have a little bit of a dark circle like

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:19.869
that, what we can do is we are going to take
a lighter powder like so, and I am taking

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:20.869
the same sponge that we had used to apply
it, and you will notice that it is shaped

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:21.869
triangular. I am going to take this flat part
of the sponge, and I am going to dip it in

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:22.869
the loose powder like soâ€¦. And now I am
going to press this edge right here, and this

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:23.869
is going to give her eye area a little extra
highlight, and it looks funny right now. This

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:24.869
is when I say, all right thank you very much
you can leave now, I make a little joke this

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:25.869
is the time to do it, and I am going to leave
it like that, and I am just going to let that

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:25.873
set a little bit.
