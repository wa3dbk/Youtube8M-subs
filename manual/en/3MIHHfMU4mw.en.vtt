00:00:00.806 --> 00:00:05.276
University of Minnesota Extension
educators answer all types of questions

00:00:05.276 --> 00:00:08.066
from farmers, all over the state.

00:00:09.026 --> 00:00:12.346
... including questions about goats.

00:00:12.396 --> 00:00:17.176
"To have goats in the first place, you have to
love them, you have to love what you're doing."

00:00:17.416 --> 00:00:22.866
Laura Kieser's dual roles as Extension educator
and goat owner give her the unique ability

00:00:22.866 --> 00:00:26.686
to help farmers learn more about what
is becoming a popular farm animal.

00:00:26.816 --> 00:00:31.176
"A lot of people will have goats to
supply their family with a milk supply

00:00:31.176 --> 00:00:33.116
or make cheese or other products..."

00:00:33.256 --> 00:00:37.616
Kieser grew up on a farm and says the
goats have become more than just a hobby

00:00:37.966 --> 00:00:40.396
"they've helped her re-connect
with her childhood roots.

00:00:40.826 --> 00:00:43.976
In addition, they're also giving
her a healthy food option"

00:00:44.116 --> 00:00:46.376
"This little goat certainly
knows what's good for it.

00:00:46.756 --> 00:00:49.786
And as it turns out, this milk
is pretty good for humans, too."

00:00:50.246 --> 00:00:54.706
Kieser says goat milk has less lactose
and smaller particles than cow milk ...

00:00:55.046 --> 00:00:57.876
a composition that's easier
for some people to digest.

00:00:58.156 --> 00:01:02.406
"When they sell baby formula, if you look at
the package, the particles are very small,

00:01:02.696 --> 00:01:06.956
so your body doesn't have to work to digest
those, as much as it would a larger particle.

00:01:07.326 --> 00:01:11.546
Cows' milk has larger particles,
goats' milk has a smaller particle."

00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:16.996
Health benefits is just one reason why Vincent
Maefsky and his wife got their first goat

00:01:16.996 --> 00:01:21.206
in the early 70's...since then,
their Poplar Hill Dairy has grown

00:01:21.206 --> 00:01:24.556
to an operation with more than 700 goats.

00:01:24.826 --> 00:01:28.026
"The demand for goat cheese
has increased very rapidly...

00:01:28.026 --> 00:01:31.786
and people ...have stepped
up and produced the milk."

00:01:32.086 --> 00:01:35.956
Maefsky says there were only six
commercial goat farms in the Upper Midwest

00:01:36.196 --> 00:01:38.416
when they started their operation
in the mid 70's...

00:01:38.416 --> 00:01:42.226
"Now, the demand today is
so great for goat cheese,

00:01:42.696 --> 00:01:47.056
that there may be 600 commercial
goat farms in the same area,

00:01:47.056 --> 00:01:50.266
that in 1975 there were five or six."

00:01:50.406 --> 00:01:55.736
Like Kieser, Maefsky is also closely tied
to the U of M, working with the University

00:01:55.736 --> 00:01:57.556
to give tours of his farm to students,

00:01:57.896 --> 00:02:02.156
serving on multiple boards ...and taking
advice from educators like Kieser.

00:02:02.256 --> 00:02:06.366
"We're very glad to have a
land grant college here..."

00:02:07.276 --> 00:02:10.646
Anyone interested should first
do their research ...both Maefsky

00:02:10.646 --> 00:02:12.506
and Kieser say goats aren't easy.

00:02:12.986 --> 00:02:16.706
But between the health benefits of the
milk, the personality of the animals

00:02:17.016 --> 00:02:19.166
and the pride of producing your own food...

00:02:19.346 --> 00:02:22.096
"For me, my life wouldn't
be the same without them."

00:02:22.096 --> 00:02:23.756
...goats are the way to go.

00:02:23.756 --> 00:02:27.686
For the University of Minnesota,
I'm Justin Ware.
