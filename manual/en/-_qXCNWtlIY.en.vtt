00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.340
Hi! Welcome back to Expert Village and today
we are going to continue building our gazebo.

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:12.820
Now move on to the 4x4 8 foot post. Now this
is pretty self-explanatory. Come on down here.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:23.550
We have 8 corners with a post on each corner
so that gives us 8 posts. Now we will go to

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.509
the firing strips. Now the firing strips attach
to either side of the post and after all the

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:38.140
math, it comes out to 9 firing strips but
we are going to overshoot on that and go with

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:46.310
another 12. We move on to our 4 ft by 8 ft.
by half inch thick sheets of plywood. Now

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:53.460
we are going to need 2 of these because we
need to make our 6 ft by 6 ft square. Then

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.640
down to the lattice. These are the 4 ft. by
8 ft. a half inch thick lattice. We know that

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:07.450
the lattice is going to go on these 34 inch
sides, these 2 ft. sides and only 4 foot up

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.969
on these other sides. So what we are going
to go ahead and do and on the roof so that

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:17.210
equals out to 4 pieces but we are going to
overshoot again and we are going to go and

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:22.929
go with 5 that way we make sure we have enough
of everything that we need. So that is pretty

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.950
much all the lumber we are going to need right
there. Now to the hardware. We are going to

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.580
go ahead and need some screws. I would suggest
a 1 5/8 because all you are really going to

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:40.170
be screwing into is your plywood which is
only half an inch thick and your lattice which

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:45.369
is only 1/2 inch thick. So 1 5/8 should be
plenty to get through that material and into

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:50.369
the 2x4's to make sure that it is good and
tight. So we are going to say 1 box. But of

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:57.889
course we are going to overshoot. We are going
to change that 1 box to 2 and then we are

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:04.039
going to need a box of actual cloth rags,
not paper towels. Paper towels like to shred

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:08.509
on wood and then you have little fuzzies all
over it. It's really no good. So we are going

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:14.640
to get some cloth towels and we are going
to get a box of rubber gloves. Rubber gloves

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.860
is for the stain when you are applying it.
You don't want to get that all over our fingers.

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.680
It gets really messy. Last but not least we
are going to need our shopping buddy. So I

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.780
am going to bring on Richard with us which
he will meet us in a couple of minutes just

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.720
to help us during the construction process.
