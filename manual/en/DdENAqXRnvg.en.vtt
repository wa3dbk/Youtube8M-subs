Hi everyone!

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.340
In this ladylike charm video, you will be learning how to have a beautiful posture &amp; the walk of a model. 

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:23.360
 And the best thing is that these are 2 beauty secrets already promised to you. 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.140
 That's right! It's a quick &amp; inexpensive beauty treatment.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:33.180
 All you have to do is become aware of your posture &amp; the way you walk &amp; with enough practice you'll be walking like a model!

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:41.260
Good posture is also important because it helps you appear more confident &amp; it has also been proven to reduce stress.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.960
 And the best part is that it requires no fancy clothes or equipment, just a bit of your concentration...

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.340
So let's get started! 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.500
Poor posture is sloppy &amp; can make you look unsure of yourself, which is what we do not want.

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.080
So to to get this perfect posture stand tall with your shoulders back nice &amp; relaxed.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.160
Now imagine there's a string puling your head up, standing nice &amp; tall.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:27.180
Make sure your ears are directly above your shoulder bone. 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.120
Pull your bellybutton in towards your spine, keeping your back straight.

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:35.560
Look at that, 2 inches off your waist already! Amazing right?

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.340
We also don't want to lock those knees, so keep them relaxed with a slight bent. 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.920
So now whenever you catch yourself slouching, 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.140
just remember to stand tall &amp; you have perfect posture!

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.320
Now that you're on your way to having pretty posture,

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.000
here are some exercises to help you improve it.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.140
Stand with your back against the wall, feet about 2 inches away.

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.800
Have your arms on your sides

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.100
 &amp; head &amp; shoulders back.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.240
Slowly bend your knees 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.140
&amp; slide down the wall to a sitting position. 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.680
Really concentrate on pressing every point of your spine against the wall.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.220
Do this 4 times today

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.000
and then start moving up to 15 times a day.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.900
Also taking quick posture checks when you pass a mirror or store window or mirror is a great way to keep up good posture.

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:30.620
Just remember to hold that chin up, engage your core, &amp; relax your knees &amp; your on your way to perfect posture!

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.720
Alright, so we know that these are definitely not ladylike poses. 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.880
But this one is what we are aiming for. 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:50.460
This pose is also used by many celebrities on the red carpet &amp; in this video you will learn how to use it too. 

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:55.120
First, put your feet together &amp; bring your right foot to the middle of your left instep. 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.600
Then turn your right foot out slightly.

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.460
Most of your weight should be on the left foot while you balance with your right foot.

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.920
Your knees should be relaxed &amp; slightly bent.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.960
This is also a great way to stand longer without getting tired

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:11.060
And when you do just shift your feet so your weight will be on your right leg. 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:16.240
Your elbows should be rounded softly &amp; close to your sides.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.500
And there you go! 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:20.900
You now have that perfect pose:)

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.480
So you've learned how to have a graceful posture &amp; a perfect pose

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.220
now it's time to learn how to walk gracefully.

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.020
With a graceful walk, you will reduce stress, 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.800
&amp; it will benefit your back, hips &amp; ankles. 

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:52.080
A graceful walk begins with the same balance as standing does, so let's put it into motion. 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.080
Recent studies show slouching actually makes you appear more heavier &amp; worsens stress, which is not pleasant at all. 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.480
Walking with your back straight &amp; shoulders back, allows you to breathe better. 

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.080
Same with your posture, keep your core engaged &amp; your arms relaxed at your side.

00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:13.060
To prevent putting stress on your neck, practice by balancing a book on your head. 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:17.240
It may look silly, but in the end it's worth it.

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.200
Shift your weight smoothly &amp; quickly to the heel, ball, &amp; toe of your front foot. 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.080
Follow an imaginary line to transfer your weight from one foot to the other smoothly.

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:35.000
Brush your knees together to help you walk in this imaginary straight line.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.760
 Your hands are also an important part in your graceful walk. 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:42.080
So rather than having rag doll arms 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.580
or stiff arms,

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:47.140
relax your arms at your side, slightly bent, just like in your perfect pose. 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.500
Slightly curve your wrist &amp; fingers so they brush lightly against your sides. 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:03.600
To do a fashion turn, keep your weight at the balls of your feet for better balance.

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:14.120
Rise slightly on the balls of your feet &amp; slowly turn your body until your feet have reversed direction.

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.080
Step forward with your left foot &amp; bring your right foot in front of it.

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.500
Rise slightly &amp; turn until your feet are facing the opposite direction

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:27.700
Congratulations! You have just done your first fashion turn!:)

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.740
I hope this video has been helpful to you

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.940
&amp; you will remember &amp; practice these tips for ladylike posture. 

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:59.460
If your perfect posture &amp; walk feel a bit awkward &amp;  unnatural at first,

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.920
don't worry, with a little practice it will soon become a relaxed &amp; natural part of the graceful new you!
