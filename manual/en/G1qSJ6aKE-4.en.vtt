00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.980
Back when AppSpy was planning its launch in
2009, Duke Nukem 3D was ported to the App

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.980
Store.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.920
It was of significance not only for being
a well known game, but it was one of the first

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.080
major ports on the platform, trading in its
mouse and keyboard input in for touch screen

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:22.110
buttons.

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.869
It didn't fare too well, and it was one of
the first negative reviews we gave.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:31.029
Now at the end of 2012, 3D Realms' other big
shooter release, that is probably more infamous

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.690
than famous has been ported to the App Store
as well.

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:39.220
This is the tale of one Lo Wang, known as
the Shadow Warrior.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.110
In essence this game uses the same template
as Duke 3D, but given a martial arts flavor.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.910
The Shadow Warriors are contracted killers
for major corporations, and when Lo Wang discovers

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.290
that his employer is summoning demons to take
over Japan, he turns on them.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.420
What follows is fast and frenetic gun play,
with lots of gore, special weapons, and a

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.210
bunch of silly one liners.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.940
The game itself is pretty reprehensible but
has the same tongue in cheek sense of parody

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.500
and sophomoric fun that Duke contained.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.220
It's just that this type of speedy shooter
from the late 90s suffers greatly from having

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.810
to use a touch screen.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.050
There are multiple button placement layouts
and aiming sensitivity options, but even with

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:17.890
this, having to aim at a demon shooting an
uzi at you when you speed around the level

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.360
like The Flash is frustrating at best, and
unplayable at worst.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.500
During review play, the first enemy of the
game ended us on more than one occasion, and

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.750
even with the menu options to enable god mode,
and all the weapons and keys, traversing the

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.250
levels was never enjoyable and more importantly,
never smooth.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.500
Perhaps more than being a product of its time,
Shadow Warrior is also a product of its platform,

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:41.790
being the PC in this case.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.590
Shooters were more high adrenaline in the
90s with no time to aim - you plowed forward

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.369
and blasted anything in front of you - but
on the iPhone, even getting the enemy right

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.880
in front of you and keeping it there till
dead is not an easy task.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.920
Our advice would be that if you want to play
this game, you can grab it for a decent price

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.600
on your PC at sites like Good Old Games...
but if you must have the game on phone or

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.000
tablet, just be prepared for a steep learning
curve in coming to grips with the movement

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:13.280
and shooting mechanics.
