Hi, my name is Smallkiwi, and this is how
you play Elder Titan.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.420
Titan is a strength based melee initiator.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.190
His Echo Stomp is a large delayed AOE that
sleeps nearby enemies.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.430
Ancestral Spirit is an AOE nuke that creates
a controllable mimic that has the echo stomp

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:20.519
and natural order abilities.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:25.369
Natural Order is a passive aura that removes
armor and magic resistance from enemies, and

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:29.810
his Ultimate, Earth Splitter, is a massive
delayed nuke thats slows and pulls enemies

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:30.810
in.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.580
Elder Titan should be played in any lane except
mid and pairs well with almost any hero due

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.000
to his early tankiness.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.800
Early game, you can use Ancestral Spirit to
harass and zone enemies in lane.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.960
Titan becomes a formidable initiator as soon
as he has both Echo Stomp and Ancestral Spirit.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.110
You can catch opponents unaware by casting
Ancestral Spirit close to enemy heroes and

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.370
immediately casting echo stomp.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.770
Remember that enemies hit this way are put
to sleep and not stunned, so make sure you

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.359
and your teammates get in good positions before
delivering the first hit.

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.250
At level 6 you add a massive nuke to your
initiation with Earth Splitter.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.340
Simply follow up the combo with your ultimate
and it will be nearly impossible for your

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:11.830
enemies to escape.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.080
Earth Splitter can also be cast when fleeing:
cast it in the direction you and your teammates

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.360
are retreating and enemies will either be
forced to break off the chase or take damage

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.850
and be slowed.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.770
Late game Elder Titan can wade into the middle
of a teamfight and use his powerful debuff

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.030
aura to help teammates mop up enemies.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.700
Donï¿½t forget that you can hit extra targets
with echo stomp by hitting enemies near yourself

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:33.700
and the mimic.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.700
By taking control of the mimic you can make
sure you deal the magic damage to as many

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.700
enemies as possible.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:38.310
Also remember that using Return Spirit will
bring your ancestral spirit back early and

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.560
grant you bonus movement speed and damage
for each unit it damaged.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.240
When leveling Elder Titan, prioritize Earth
Splitter &gt; Ancestral Spirit &gt; Echo Stomp &gt; Natural

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.520
Order.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.061
Get the default recommended starting items,
and then get boots, and either a wand or a

00:01:54.061 --> 00:01:58.640
soul ring then get an urn of shadows unless
another player builds it, otherwise get Drums

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.370
of Endurance, then build Power Treads.

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:07.450
For mid &amp; late game consider a pipe of insight,
assault cuirass, blademail, heart of tarrasque,

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:12.050
scythe of vyse or refresher orb.

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.090
