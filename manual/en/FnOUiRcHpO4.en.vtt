00:00:01.689 --> 00:00:03.165
Hi. I am Erin Betts,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:04.204
a propulsion engineer

00:00:04.239 --> 00:00:05.533
at NASA's Marshall

00:00:05.568 --> 00:00:06.628
Space Flight Center.

00:00:06.663 --> 00:00:07.523
I have led and

00:00:07.558 --> 00:00:08.244
participated in several

00:00:08.279 --> 00:00:09.300
projects that evaluate

00:00:09.335 --> 00:00:10.348
how digital design tools

00:00:10.383 --> 00:00:11.661
and new fabrication

00:00:11.696 --> 00:00:13.228
processes can improve

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:14.181
our ability to build

00:00:14.216 --> 00:00:15.292
sustainable, affordable

00:00:15.327 --> 00:00:16.676
space hardware.

00:00:16.711 --> 00:00:18.101
Before you even start

00:00:18.136 --> 00:00:18.981
designing a large launch

00:00:19.016 --> 00:00:20.125
vehicle, or any large

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.300
system, it is important

00:00:21.335 --> 00:00:22.476
to compare several

00:00:22.511 --> 00:00:23.877
concepts and pick a winner.

00:00:23.912 --> 00:00:24.772
From a management

00:00:24.807 --> 00:00:25.548
perspective, you want a

00:00:25.583 --> 00:00:26.876
concept that not only

00:00:26.911 --> 00:00:27.940
accomplishes a specific

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:29.284
NASA mission but is

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:31.484
affordable and sustainable.

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:33.084
New tools, such as video

00:00:33.119 --> 00:00:34.708
walls, enhance our ability

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:36.172
to actually see the

00:00:36.207 --> 00:00:37.996
design from many angles.

00:00:38.031 --> 00:00:39.444
Teams of engineers from

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:40.972
different disciplines

00:00:41.007 --> 00:00:42.388
can collaborate. This

00:00:42.423 --> 00:00:43.357
helps us start with a

00:00:43.392 --> 00:00:44.180
concept that is already

00:00:44.215 --> 00:00:46.173
far ahead of the curve.

00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:47.820
Time is money. CAD models

00:00:47.855 --> 00:00:49.228
and high-resolution

00:00:49.263 --> 00:00:50.420
integrated analytical

00:00:50.455 --> 00:00:51.588
models have become part

00:00:51.623 --> 00:00:52.739
of the manufacturing

00:00:52.774 --> 00:00:54.124
process, which helps

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:55.436
shorten the time from

00:00:55.471 --> 00:00:57.140
design to manufacturing

00:00:57.175 --> 00:00:58.684
for everything from small

00:00:58.719 --> 00:00:59.564
components to entire

00:00:59.599 --> 00:01:00.916
hardware systems.

00:01:00.951 --> 00:01:02.732
3D CAD models are now

00:01:02.767 --> 00:01:03.813
being carried from the

00:01:03.848 --> 00:01:05.028
design and development

00:01:05.063 --> 00:01:06.228
phase all the way through

00:01:06.263 --> 00:01:07.692
manufacturing, inspection,

00:01:07.727 --> 00:01:10.204
test and operation. 3-D

00:01:10.239 --> 00:01:11.589
models and simulations

00:01:11.624 --> 00:01:12.660
let us fly through a

00:01:12.695 --> 00:01:13.476
virtual design of

00:01:13.511 --> 00:01:14.749
components and entire

00:01:14.784 --> 00:01:16.525
systems. We can quickly

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.876
see design flaws and

00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:19.772
mismatched interfaces.

00:01:19.807 --> 00:01:20.980
Then, we can fix the

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:21.876
problems before they

00:01:21.911 --> 00:01:22.756
become so central to

00:01:22.791 --> 00:01:24.244
the design that they

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:25.348
are impossible or

00:01:25.383 --> 00:01:27.125
costly to change.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.685
Additive manufacturing

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.901
lets us try out designs

00:01:29.936 --> 00:01:31.404
early in a product's life

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.829
cycle. There is no need to

00:01:32.864 --> 00:01:33.925
fabricate costly tooling

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.412
that is often required

00:01:35.447 --> 00:01:36.564
using traditional

00:01:36.599 --> 00:01:38.236
fabrication methods.

00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:39.540
It also allows us to

00:01:39.575 --> 00:01:40.747
fabricate designs that

00:01:40.782 --> 00:01:42.124
could not have been made

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.236
before, allowing us to

00:01:43.271 --> 00:01:44.356
be more creative and

00:01:44.391 --> 00:01:46.052
innovative. Other fully

00:01:46.087 --> 00:01:47.220
automated processes,

00:01:47.255 --> 00:01:48.900
such as robotic welding

00:01:48.935 --> 00:01:50.428
and CNC milling and water

00:01:50.463 --> 00:01:52.053
jets, have evolved making

00:01:52.088 --> 00:01:53.173
it easier to manufacture

00:01:53.208 --> 00:01:54.541
prototypes or components

00:01:54.576 --> 00:01:56.284
quickly at any time

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:58.212
during a product's life

00:01:58.247 --> 00:01:59.373
cycle.

00:01:59.408 --> 00:02:00.469
Once you've made a part,

00:02:00.504 --> 00:02:01.252
regardless of how you

00:02:01.287 --> 00:02:02.460
made it, you need to know

00:02:02.495 --> 00:02:04.061
if it is built correctly.

00:02:04.096 --> 00:02:05.420
Inspection time is also

00:02:05.455 --> 00:02:06.508
reduced when you use

00:02:06.543 --> 00:02:08.197
modern techniques, such

00:02:08.232 --> 00:02:09.165
as structured light

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.428
scanning, to compare

00:02:10.463 --> 00:02:11.692
models of what you

00:02:11.727 --> 00:02:12.468
actually built to what

00:02:12.503 --> 00:02:13.732
you intended to build.

00:02:13.767 --> 00:02:15.028
Testing can be used in

00:02:15.063 --> 00:02:16.125
almost every phase of

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.372
a product's development.

00:02:17.407 --> 00:02:18.516
With additive manufacturing,

00:02:18.551 --> 00:02:20.093
engineers at Marshall

00:02:20.128 --> 00:02:21.804
were able to build a

00:02:21.839 --> 00:02:22.924
one-piece injector and

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:24.076
get it on the test stand

00:02:24.111 --> 00:02:25.340
in about a month. This

00:02:25.375 --> 00:02:26.565
injector was half the

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.795
cost of an injector

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:28.917
built using traditional

00:02:28.952 --> 00:02:29.972
methods, and performed

00:02:30.007 --> 00:02:32.052
just as well. This

00:02:32.087 --> 00:02:33.244
quick-turn-around testing

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:34.628
allows designers to

00:02:34.663 --> 00:02:35.932
explore and compare the

00:02:35.967 --> 00:02:37.420
performance of various

00:02:37.455 --> 00:02:38.492
designs early in a

00:02:38.527 --> 00:02:39.925
product's development.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.212
This saves money in the

00:02:41.247 --> 00:02:42.508
long-run, and allows

00:02:42.543 --> 00:02:43.636
the program to proceed

00:02:43.671 --> 00:02:44.764
beyond development at a

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:45.868
much lower risk and

00:02:45.903 --> 00:02:47.549
higher fidelity.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:49.108
Virtual 3-D simulations

00:02:49.143 --> 00:02:50.180
reduce the cost and time

00:02:50.215 --> 00:02:51.452
it takes to evaluate

00:02:51.487 --> 00:02:52.653
logistics and operations

00:02:52.688 --> 00:02:53.988
early in the development

00:02:54.023 --> 00:02:55.740
phase of a system. They

00:02:55.775 --> 00:02:57.012
also help the ground

00:02:57.047 --> 00:02:58.028
crew who is training

00:02:58.063 --> 00:02:59.388
to operate new space systems.

00:02:59.423 --> 00:03:01.188
In summary, modern digital

00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:02.589
tools and automated

00:03:02.624 --> 00:03:04.140
processes can help reduce

00:03:04.175 --> 00:03:05.700
the cost and time needed

00:03:05.735 --> 00:03:07.012
to develop complex space

00:03:07.047 --> 00:03:08.316
hardware. The challenge

00:03:08.351 --> 00:03:09.516
is in using these techniques

00:03:09.551 --> 00:03:10.716
in a way that aligns with

00:03:10.751 --> 00:03:12.108
your design space, whether

00:03:12.143 --> 00:03:13.700
heritage or blank sheet.

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:14.948
As we have the opportunity

00:03:14.983 --> 00:03:16.180
to apply these techniques

00:03:16.215 --> 00:03:17.332
more broadly, the fidelity

00:03:17.367 --> 00:03:19.220
of the output will increase.

00:03:19.255 --> 00:03:20.572
Engineers like me at

00:03:20.607 --> 00:03:21.853
Marshall Space Flight Center

00:03:21.888 --> 00:03:22.997
are working hard to take

00:03:23.032 --> 00:03:24.556
advantage of, develop, and

00:03:24.591 --> 00:03:26.228
characterize new technologies

00:03:26.263 --> 00:03:27.661
that will be used to

00:03:27.696 --> 00:03:28.708
achieve NASAâ€™s exciting

00:03:28.743 --> 00:03:29.772
exploration missions.
