00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:05.730
Okay I'm going to add a fourth of a cup of
honey, just start squirting it in here. Like

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.510
I said, you could use a raw honey. I actually
really love raw honey. This is just our standard

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:16.990
clover honey. That's almost a fourth of a
cup, just squeeze that in there, there we

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:27.160
go. And let's get, I have one messy measuring
cup so far. There we go, uh beautiful. Honey

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:33.859
is a great great sweetener to use. Use it
in your coffee, use it in your oatmeal, you

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:39.140
can really substitute a lot of just sugar
or sugar substitutes with honey, great healthy

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:48.269
choice. Now let's add our, ooh, tablespoon
of vanilla, as soon as I can open it. What

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:55.649
would a dessert be without a little bit of
vanilla in there? Uh, perfect, just enough,

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.559
there we go, we're done with that. And then
we have our cocoa powder that we're going

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:13.799
to add. We need three fourths of a cup of
cocoa powder. My brand new container. Again

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.570
you can use karob powder. I noticed that you
know, when I eat a lot of karob I start to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.479
not be able to tell the difference between
chocolate and karob, I kind of get used to

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:29.609
the flavor and the taste. But for the most
part I just prefer chocolate, just the taste

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:35.460
for chocolate. Karob has a really distinct
taste to it. So, ooh, got a little on me.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:43.729
Okay that's about three fourths of a cup just
about. That's good, alright there we go. And

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:50.619
I'll show you, everything is in one big blob
right now. It is not mixed together at all

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.080
because our coconut oil is still pretty firm.
And of course we have our honey. That's what

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.340
I'm going to put on the double boiler and
everything will start to melt together nicely.
