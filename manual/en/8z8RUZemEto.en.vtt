Welcome to WildStar. This is DevSpeak. 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.120
This is the Disclaimer!

00:00:15.625 --> 00:00:17.670
Its finally time to throw back the curtain...

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.970
on the Ron Popeil of classes...

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.590
The Engineer.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.185
Our goal with the Engineer was to make a heavy-ranged tank Class that uses do-it-yourself gadgets... and bots...

00:00:28.555 --> 00:00:29.595
to destroy things.

00:00:30.415 --> 00:00:33.160
It's a pet class that doesn't play like a pet class.

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:35.755
Basically we put Inspector Gadget...

00:00:36.155 --> 00:00:37.330
in a Monster Truck.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.790
Now Engineers come packing with:

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:40.950
Heavy Armor

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:42.270
Launchers

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.465
Bots

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:44.820
an ExoSuit

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.325
...and a "Sham Wow".

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.220
Yo Dawg, we heard you like bots,

00:00:49.585 --> 00:00:51.520
so we put some bots with your bots.

00:00:51.855 --> 00:00:54.190
So you can kill things while you kill things.

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:56.900
The Engineer has Bots for tanking,

00:00:56.925 --> 00:00:58.075
DPS,

00:00:58.095 --> 00:00:59.110
CC,

00:00:59.185 --> 00:01:00.260
and heals.

00:01:00.815 --> 00:01:03.630
Every Bot has an ability, and you hold the trigger.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.120
She also uses her Launcher to fire out Experimental projectiles.

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.300
Like this...

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:10.950
or this...

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.050
or call an artillery strike.

00:01:14.825 --> 00:01:16.570
Your heavy armor not heavy enough?

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:17.695
No problem.

00:01:17.785 --> 00:01:20.745
Just activate the Limited Edition Mark 4 ExoSuit.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:22.160
It makes you better...

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:23.605
at everything.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.745
What this means is, it's the Engineer's choice to either...

00:01:27.765 --> 00:01:30.905
hang back in DPS mode to dish out long range damage,

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:34.170
or switch to tank mode and wade through the battlefield...

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.585
like an actual Tank.

00:01:37.105 --> 00:01:39.265
So that's the Engineer in a nutshell.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.830

00:01:43.245 --> 00:01:45.320
Oh that social media!

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.620
Good thing that the devs are listening.
