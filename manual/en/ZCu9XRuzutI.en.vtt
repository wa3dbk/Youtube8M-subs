00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.290
probably like to be able to get our
degree without actually going to school

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.160
but one how high a state university
football player

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:12.139
really really wants that cargill jones
who is a freshman via quarterback at

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:15.699
third string quarterback for the
optimistic but and resilient we did

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:19.839
while still have to go to class if we
came here to play football

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:21.760
commonplace wall class

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:22.870
can't wait

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.710
school thing

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.660
and it is just so ironic

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.560
we killed three hundred fifty planes
cooper

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.990
you probably should have come to play
lots of

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:34.449
was based on the same reason that to me

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:36.370
email on a plan will swap

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:38.090
uh... behind

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:40.300
accel carmel you know

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.720
you're doing your thing uh... about your
first string cell you are pressuring you

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.740
know maybe august up it up but maybe

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.190
great you know you are at a higher state
may not about banking

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:55.880
that reinventing record technically
wrecked another hit it moved the ball

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.580
down the field

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:01.129
indicated to the once you're there i'm
at work

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:04.489
maybe another time for it and i a
detailed look what i was on my high

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.409
school football team for the delay a
couple weeks on the ten thousand named

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.360
his without pain i felt like you know
what even if you're s

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.030
applied

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:17.560
act you always run the risk of getting
injured and it is so important that

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.230
have an education to fall back on

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:25.260
you know are even if you go to the
n_f_l_ and you may be style much money

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.890
that you can just retire for life

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.270
it would just be nice to not come across

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.220
think completely grammatical it here

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.140
bankers clears the air finnegan heaven
knows something about the world you know

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.990
what your only contribution to be

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.510
the ardennes right or whatever

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.369
until it sees a need to do this

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.810
you can see from the graphic ahead fifty
retrieves in a limited amount of time it

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.619
is actually posted beijing tip-off
really fast in the private or deleted

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:56.070
the entire alice cohen now cities like
denver and off the face how math where

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.470
yeah i'll stay with me

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.600
has a turnaround like that the other
news like them should incidentally

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.840
doesn't like that and so they say this
article and

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.640
he apparently is jones that concert the
fact that most public universities major

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.890
athletic programs actually losing money

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.100
and they're charging students thousands
of dollars to subsidize the programs

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:17.090
that will high tail i sat silently
cancer files that one of those they're

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.480
making money but many programs arkin
other scenes actually subsidizing the

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.560
houston citing indicted for free it's
like afoul of the rest of us are having

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.010
like

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.480
thirty thousand dollars a year and
twenty factly for a long time going to

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.229
yukon because of about school program in
u teenagers were football program

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:35.969
until understand nor my perfectly
comfortable with and the way that we do

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:37.370
college sports this country

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.599
i don't think that we should be bringing
people into basically start their career

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:44.909
do college at the class is a little bit
on the side and then make tons of money

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.760
if it's going to be professional thing

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.080
i think that we should just have some
sort of lower level professional league

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.340
division division and they do with
college

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.209
even trinity college teams

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.939
it's supposed to be there was originally
the university would look into its

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:01.879
student body and choose the best players
that they had that person but he

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.500
wouldn't be standing in bringing in
people to play sports

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.100
yeah and occasionally go to class and
everything's the decent agree with me

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.200
from the opposite direction dot thanks
and rubbed on people get into like

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.810
harvard in the air are scheduled no

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.970
this turned out that i starting at
certain idea how to and that we're

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.410
talking about that time the current job
this morning and it's one of my friends

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.409
clean it out

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:27.799
seems like you know if he can you tell
me something to be a bit manages money

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:32.929
really last summer but you might want to
buy this gospel

00:03:32.929 --> 00:03:36.009
i don't know if the letter that was the
only thing both about college sports

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:39.709
being as professional as they are and
also about cardiol jones first this

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.600
should he be taken off the team

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:44.370
i think that they might have a problem
beers megan looked at

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.880
and secondly the dozen dozen point do
any of you think that there are people

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.070
who are contribute so much on the field

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:51.610
shouldn't have to contribute anything in
the classroom
