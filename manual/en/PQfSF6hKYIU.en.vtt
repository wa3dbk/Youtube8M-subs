00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.870
• From giant-mouthed sharks to glow-in-the-dark
octopus, we count 15 deep sea creatures both

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.740
fascinating and often times terrifying found
thousands of metres below the ocean surface

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.090
15 - Fangtooth (or Ogrefish),
• Although these ones are too small to harm

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.189
humans, they have a nightmarish face you'll
find commonly developed in the deep sea

00:00:21.189 --> 00:00:26.270
• Their teeth are known to be the largest
of any sea creature, so big in fact that a

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:30.600
Fangtooth can never close their mouths fully
• They're also one of the deepest-living

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:34.410
fish, found as far as 5,000 metres below the
surface of the ocean

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.840
14 - Stargazer,
• These are fish that have evolved a head

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:44.210
tilted forever upwards, and this is because
they're trapdoor predators - they bury themselves

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.300
in sand and shoot upwards to ambush prey that
pass overhead

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.530
• Some species of Stargazer even have a
little worm-shaped lure growing out of their

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.210
mouths to attract prey before they strike
• Likewise, the Stargazer is also deadly

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.920
poisonous and have been known to cause electric
shocks from time to time

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.870
13 - Giant Isopods,
• This is like a giant woodlouse, one that

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:11.420
only appears in the deep ocean as a result
of deep-sea gigantism and even curl into a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.630
rigid ball when threatened
• They're mostly carnivorous feeding on

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:19.570
dead whales, fish and squid, but they also
hunt slow-moving prey like sea cucumbers,

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.920
sponges, nematodes and some fish
• You'll mostly find them off the coast

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.950
of Australia, but they've also been sighted
in Mexico and India

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.710
12 - Terrible Claw Lobster,
• The scientific name for this one is Dinochelus

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.090
ausubeli, named for its "terrible or fearful"
pale-red claws

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.290
• This is a relatively new species of blind
lobster, one of only four discovered between

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:46.850
two similar species - both in Australia
• The first lobster was found during the

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:52.060
Aurora mission is 2007 led by the U.S and
French natural history museums

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.950
11 - Dragonfish,
• This tiny 6-inch sea creature is, as evident

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.450
purely from its appearance, a deadly predator
• It has a large head and rows of jagged

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.100
teeth lit by its long barbel attached to the
chin, one with a light-producing organ known

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.191
as a photophore
• It flicks the light on this organ on and

00:02:10.191 --> 00:02:15.099
off to attract unwitting prey, then strikes
• You'll find these 5000 feet below the

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:18.379
shoes of small children
10 - Pacific Hatchetfish,

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:22.909
• You'll find these in tropical and subtropical
waters of the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:28.640
Oceans, and over the years they've evolved
a peculiar body "hatchet" shape with bioluminescent

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.079
photophores used to escape predators lurking
in the depths by matching what light there

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.389
is for camouflage
• Unlike their appearance, they're perfectly

00:02:36.389 --> 00:02:40.769
harmless and only coming in at 5 inches in
size - but they're just another example of

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:44.959
deep sea aesthetic craziness
9 - Dumbo Octopus,

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.989
• This was first discovered in 1999, the
deepest-living octopus species seen so far

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.330
coming in at 7,000 metres below the surface
of the ocean

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.430
• This one hovers down under tremendous
pressure of water, no sunlight, siphoning

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:03.200
up snails, crustaceans and the like to feed
• The dumbo name clearly comes from its

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.010
appearance, one crazy to imagine it can maintain
that far below an ocean

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.069
8 - Megamouth Shark,
• These are an extremely rare species of

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.129
shark, in fact only 58 specimens have been
found in the entire world to date

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.090
• They have an enormous jaw used for scooping
up plankton and jellyfish

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.980
• These things can grow up to 5.5 metres
in length and the average size of their mouth

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.389
alone is 1.3 meters - seriously not something
you want to get swallowed by

00:03:26.389 --> 00:03:32.169
7 - Pacific Blackdragons,
• These ones are peculiar, 60cms long with

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:34.829
fang teeth and a long whisker attached to
their chin

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:39.269
• They don't have any teeth, no chin barbel
and no stomach to process food

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:44.400
• But curiously, males survive only long
enough to mate - it's up to the females to

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.879
hunt other fish and crustaceans in the role
of a predator

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:52.451
6 - Basking Shark,
• Another big-mouthed ocean shark, another

00:03:52.451 --> 00:03:57.989
passive feeder filtering zoo plankton, small
fish and invertebrates from up to 2,000 tons

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:01.799
of water per hour
• These are often mistaken for plesiosaurs

00:04:01.799 --> 00:04:06.179
the long-necked reptile from the age of the
dinosaurs, and these are harmless to humans

00:04:06.179 --> 00:04:10.870
• However, humans are VERY harmful to the
Basking Shark - they're generally hunted for

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:15.790
food and hide leather, but rapidly declining
numbers have seen this shark close to extinction

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.870
5 - Red Octopus,
• You'll find these in the deep Atlantic

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:25.039
waters off the U.S Coast, with eight arms
connected by a colourful webbing used to swim

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:29.810
• It has rows of bioluminescent suckers
down its arms that glow in the dark - widely

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.090
believed to attract planktonic prey and insects
to the light

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.400
• Although we've known about these for a
hundred years, it was only recently we discovered

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.080
they glow
4 - Gulper Eel

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:45.520
• This has a mouth loosely hinged to its
jaw, like a pelican - but just as with a snake,

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.330
it can open it to swallow prey much larger
than itself

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:52.270
• Not to mention it can stretch its stomach
too, which comes in handy when it appears

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:56.870
to swallow your entire family while they sleep
• It grows to a total length of two to six

00:04:56.870 --> 00:05:01.699
feet and found all over the world 3-6000 feet
below the ocean surface

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:06.169
3 - Blobfish
• Crazy, ridiculous-looking fish from deep

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:10.330
beneath the ocean - one that looks very much
different when in its natural environment

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:14.889
• But because it needs to adapt to all that
pressure, it has weak muscle tissue and when

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:18.009
exposed to our environment it turns into this
crazy mess

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:22.669
• It lives off the coast of Australia and
New Zealand, and having gelatinous skin means

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:26.380
it can swim without exerting energy
2 - Squat Lobster

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:31.140
• Found at a depth of 4 and a half thousand
feet, it looks somewhat like a headcrab but

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.199
with large frontal claws and compressed bodies
• They have a large skill-set comprising

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:41.309
detritus-feeders, algal grazers, scavengers
and predators - adapting to their environment

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:45.159
• We don't know much else about this one,
it's still a mystery

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:49.010
1 - Colossal Squid
• Something from a nightmare, folk tales

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:54.169
from those lost sea - but it's very much real
• They grow in lengths beyond 14 metres,

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:58.730
the size of a long bus, and they've been known
to attack those giant sperm whales and feed

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.919
on fish and squid
• In 2007, a specimen was found in the Ross

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.439
Sea, and is now on display at New Zealand
