00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:04.710
I MEAN, I KNOW YOUR APARTMENT

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.040
IS HABITABLE AGAIN,

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.060
I JUST...

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:08.200
DO YOU HAVE TO LEAVE?

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:09.200
DO YOU WANT ME HERE BECAUSE

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:10.540
YOU ACTUALLY WANT ME HERE

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:11.540
OR DO YOU NEED PROTECTION

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.680
FROM THE REDHEADS?

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.340
A LITTLE OF BOTH.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.639
OKAY, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT.

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:17.430
IF IT GETS TO BE TOO MUCH,

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.830
YOU CAN COME AND STAY...

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.310
(whispers) AT MY PLACE.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:21.420
(whispers) THANK YOU.

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.420
ARE YOU SURE IT'S OKAY

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.520
THAT I'M GOING TO PARIS

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:24.520
WITHOUT YOU?

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:25.520
JUST BECAUSE I'M SICK,

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.520
YOU SHOULDN'T MISS IT.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.520
I WANT YOU TO GO.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.890
WE ALL DO.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:30.890
WHAT'S GOING ON?

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.890
I JUST FEEL SO GUILTY

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:32.890
THAT MOM IS MISSING

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.260
HER VACATION BECAUSE I'M SICK,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.670
SO I TOLD HER TO ENJOY PARIS

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.670
FOR THE BOTH OF US.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.670
OH, ARE YOU SURE, ALEXIS?

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:40.670
I MEAN, YOUR MOTHER...

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.670
(mouths words)

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:42.670
SHOULD...

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.670
(mouths words)

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.670
ENJOY HER VACATION.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.670
HAVE A SAFE TRIP,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:46.670
MEREDITH.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:47.670
MM.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.670
JE T'AIME, MAMAN.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:49.670
MOI AUSSI.

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:50.670
JE T'AIME.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:51.670
OHH.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:52.670
ADIOS, DEAR.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:53.670
HAVE FUN.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:54.670
MARTHA.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:55.670
MM.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.670
WELL, THIS HAS BEEN...

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:57.670
OH, SHOOT.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:59.070
I LEFT MY PURSE UPSTAIRS.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.710
BE A DEAR.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.339
I'LL GRAB IT.

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:03.429
DETECTIVE BECKETT,

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:06.230
IT WAS A REAL PLEASURE.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.930
YES, IT REALLY WAS.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:08.970
YOU KNOW, MEREDITH,

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.020
IT'S SO FUNNY.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.020
WHEN YOU FIRST CAME

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.470
AND INSISTED ON STAYING HERE,

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.470
I WAS AFRAID THAT YOU MIGHT

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.820
HAVE HAD A SECRET AGENDA.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.410
ACTUALLY, I DID.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.410
WHEN ALEXIS TOLD ME

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.410
ABOUT YOU TWO

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.410
AND HOW THIS ONE WAS SERIOUS,

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:21.870
I KNEW I HAD TO CHECK IT OUT

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:22.870
FOR MYSELF.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.260
AND I'M SO GLAD I DID.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.380
YOU TWO ARE GREAT TOGETHER.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.960
THANK YOU.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:30.430
CAN I ASK YOU A QUESTION?

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:31.700
WHY DIDN'T IT WORK OUT

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:33.190
BETWEEN YOU AND RICK?

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.190
I'M SORRY.

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:35.440
IS THAT TOO PERSONAL?

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.950
OH, NO, NO, NO.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:37.950
IT'S FINE.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.660
YOU KNOW, BEING MARRIED

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.980
TO RICHARD WAS GREAT--

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:43.320
FULL OF ROMANCE

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.320
AND EXCITEMENT,

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:45.320
LIKE A DELICIOUSLY SWEET

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.320
SOUFFLE.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:47.590
AND THEN ONE DAY, I REALIZED,

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:49.070
HE KNEW EVERYTHING ABOUT ME--

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.070
MY DEEPEST SECRETS,

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.600
MY WORST PAIN--

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.600
ENOUGH TO FILL

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:53.750
A MILLION NOVELS.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:54.750
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.750
ENOUGH ABOUT HIM

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.210
TO EVEN WRITE A PAMPHLET.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.610
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.610
FOR INSTANCE,

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.610
WHENEVER I ASKED HIM ABOUT

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.610
HOW HE FELT ABOUT

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:04.610
NEVER KNOWING HIS FATHER,

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:05.610
HE WOULD SMIRK.

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:06.610
YOU KNOW THE WAY HE SMIRKS.

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:07.670
AND THEN HE WOULD

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:08.670
THROW OUT A QUIP

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:09.670
AND CHANGE THE SUBJECT.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.000
OUR MARRIAGE WENT ONE WAY,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.670
AND THAT WASN'T ENOUGH FOR ME.

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:14.480
I MEAN... (chuckles)

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.700
SOUFFLES ARE WONDERFUL,

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.700
BUT SOONER OR LATER,

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.390
THEY ALWAYS FALL.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.170
OH, BUT THAT WAS

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.080
A LONG, LONG TIME AGO.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.080
WH-WHAT?

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.420
15 YEARS IN FACT.

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.420
HE'S A TOTALLY

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.420
DIFFERENT MAN NOW.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.160
YES, OF COURSE.

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.400
I WAS JUST CURIOUS.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.400
OKAY.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.400
HERE WE GO.

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.160
OH, YOU ARE THE BEST, RICK.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:36.160
THANK YOU.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.160
YOU BET.

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:38.959
I HOPE WE SEE

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:39.959
EACH OTHER AGAIN.

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:40.959
OH, ME, TOO, MEREDITH.

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:41.959
HAVE A WONDERFUL TRIP.

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:42.980
GOOD-BYE, RICK.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:43.980
BYE.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.030
(door opens and closes)

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.030
WHEW.

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.560
HOW ABOUT I MAKE YOU A LITTLE

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:51.560
BREAKFAST BEFORE YOU LEAVE?

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:52.560
I'M GONNA WHIP YOU UP

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.560
A SMOR-LET.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.560
IT SOUNDS BETTER

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.560
THAN IT TASTES.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.560
WAIT, THAT'S--NO.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.560
IT'S THE OTHER WAY AROUND.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:58.560
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:59.560
(dishes clinking)

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.563
