00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.710
A large percentage of homes will have a dirt
crawl space.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.970
Usually a dirt crawl space is against the
side of the home.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:10.660
Nobody really likes to deal with it or discuss.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.929
They can be very damaging to the houses as
a structure, health as in general to everybody

00:00:16.929 --> 00:00:18.710
inside of it.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:22.529
The first thing that I’ll address in the
crawl space is water infiltration.

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.800
We want to make sure we have an adequate water
proofing system in there that’s going to

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.329
maintain control any standing water that maybe
coming in to that crawl space.

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:37.190
Secondly, we want to create a barrier within
that crawl space such as a crawl space conduit.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.519
Typically a 20 mil polyethylene barrier is
used for an encapsulation in the crawl space

00:00:43.519 --> 00:00:50.410
and it simply covers the floor, the dirt floor
it runs up the wall and sealed in front of

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.660
the sill plate.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:58.980
You want to avoid any additional moisture,
radon gases, methane, insects, and rodents

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.640
from entering into that dwelling.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.839
The first part of that process is dehumidification.

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:09.200
You want to make sure you use an industrial
grade dehumidifier just try to stay away from

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:15.170
the aftermarket dehumidifier to find out they
have a pin that you have to go down and drain.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.640
You really want to use an industrial grade,
high capacity dehumidifier.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.119
Secondly, to control the dehumidification
you need air exchange.

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.250
You want to have a proper system out there.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.799
A Bonaire is a great unit that’s out there
what that does is it draws warmer air from

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.899
the upper level takes it down and exchanges
it.

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:40.880
That’s all takes part and helps in achieving
and maintaining a proper relative humidity.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.810
The third thing is while is there a sub systems
out there that are designed to draw moisture

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:54.289
from underneath the encapsulated area and
draw moisture out of the soil.

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.289
Again that is really the 3 tools in controlling
relative humidity.

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.719
You want dehumidification and air exchange.

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:07.509
Again air exchange can come in the form of
a Bonaire type system which draws make up

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.430
air a good air down from the upper level,
there’s also sub systems out there that

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.400
draw moisture out of the soil itself humidity
access is one that comes to mind where you’re

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:23.690
taking all moisture out again that all plays
part in controlling relative humidity.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:31.300
It’s a necessary part of a complete crawl
space encapsulation.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:36.150
The key things to remember with any crawl
space encapsulation is to always close off

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:43.519
all outside vents, seal them from the inside
using a moisture resistant ply wood adhere

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:49.220
right to the foundation covering that vent,
sealing it with a polyethylene sealant and

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.680
also using a vent cover on the exterior.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.860
We want to stop all moisture from the outside
coming in to that crawl space encapsulation.

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:05.050
It’s also very important that we make sure
we have adequate mechanical ventilation in

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:06.050
there.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.970
We want to create air exchange within that
encapsulation.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.569
A Bonaire system is a great tool that’s
on the market now which is designed to pull,

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.540
make up the air from the upper level take
it down and exchange it with that damp air.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:28.309
So these are both crucial steps in an encapsulation
and very important for that whole process.
