Hi guys so I just filmed a hair maintainence
video and this is how I wash and style my

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:20.990
pixie cut I hope this is really helpful for
you all I usually do something conservative

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:26.380
so i thought since summer is coming around
I should switch things up so I decided to

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:33.079
do a style like this and think its really
fun and cute.

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:38.010
I hope you guys enjoy the video and if you
have anymore questions comment below and remember

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:47.160

giving away that liquid foundation at two

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.350

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:59.210
Right now I'm using a large dye brush to apply
the relaxer if anyone wants to see a more

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:18.680
Now that i have washed the relaxer out i'm
using a deep conditioner in my hair.

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:28.079
once I'm done applying the deep conditioner
im going to take a shower cap and let that

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:33.790
sit for fifteen minutes.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:44.140
Next im taking my leave in conditioner and
i'm applying that in my hair and im going

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:49.210
to take my wrapping mousse and apply that
all over as well.

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:56.780
I'm going to take a tail comb and start combing
my hair out but first i'm going to make sure

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.289
to find the center of my head.

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:25.160
I'm going to comb and mold my hair the way
i want it.

00:02:25.180 --> 00:03:03.230
I'm going to use a brush to brush the hair
down.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:27.370
Im going to take a velcro hair wrap and and
wrap it around my head.

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:39.130
Now that my hair is dry i'm going to take
an oil sheen and rubbing that all into my

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:41.760
hair.

00:03:41.760 --> 00:04:07.970
I am cleaning up my sides by using an electric
razor.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:49.150
Now I am sectioning off my hair and then using
my mini flat iron to start flat ironing my

00:04:49.150 --> 00:05:05.050
hair.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:12.230
There is no specific direction that I am curling
the hair some of the curls are going in and

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:27.520
some of them are going outwards I am just
going for a messy curls look . next I am going

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:51.160
to bump the sides.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:06:13.139
I am going

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:27.020
to take some styling gel and apply that to
my edges and then I am going to take a hair

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:34.530
sheen and spray it on my hair and that's it
see you in my next video
