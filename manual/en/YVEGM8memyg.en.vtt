A lot of people ask me what I consider to
be the essential tools that I keep with me

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:15.839
while I’m knitting. And, I get that in person,
and in email.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.130
So I thought I’d cover the answer here in
a video.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:24.770
Uh, now, first up, I carry all of my knitting
notions in this plastic school box.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:29.160
And there are so many cute little zippered
bags out there, and I think they’re so adorable,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.340
but I don’t like digging for things in a
bag. I like everything open and visible to

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:38.090
me just like this, that’s why I use this
ugly pink box.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:43.780
Anyway, let’s go through this box and I’ll
show you what’s in here.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:50.200
First up, I have this little case, where I
keep a lot of different things, a lot of different

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:58.390
sizes, but mainly in here I have tapestry
needles, and stitch markers.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:04.860
Both the clippie kind, and little ring markers.

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.850
And that’s what’s in here. There are a
few other things like buttons and stuff, but

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:19.640
mostly this is a little case for stitch markers,
different sizes, and tapestry needles.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.330
Next up is a ruler that’s also a needle
gauge checker, to tell me what size needles

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:26.330
I’m using.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.470
The ruler is important because you want to
be able to have something stiff like this

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.840
for when you’re checking stitch gauge, see
if you’re getting the correct tension on

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.840
a
pattern.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.150
And then, of course, it’s an added bonus
to have the needle gauge the needle size thing

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.150
here as well.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.950
Now the other side of that is a tape measure,
a soft tape measure, for measuring longer

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:56.240
things like sleeves and lengths of sweaters
and stuff like that.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.770
Next up, I have a row counter. I usually keep
one or two row counters in my bag.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.829
Um, this one’s my favorite because it’s
a katcha counter, it’s quick to add numbers

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:13.670
to it, but you can also lock it when you put
it in your knitting bag, it won’t add rows.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.950
Uh, next up is, a little bit of scrap yarn.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:24.861
And I use this for holding stitches, for reserving
stitches, when my pattern tells me to while

00:02:24.861 --> 00:02:26.340
I’m knitting.

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:33.489
And then the other side of that is I do have
various… I’m sure this is noisy in the

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:34.489
microphone.

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.219
I do have various stitch holders like this.

00:02:37.219 --> 00:02:42.409
And I have them there, but really I don’t
use them very often. I always go back to the

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.059
scrap yarn.

00:02:44.059 --> 00:02:49.749
And put the stitches on hold with the scrap
yarn instead of the stitch holder.

00:02:49.749 --> 00:02:52.299
Okay.

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:58.209
Next up of course is scissors. Pretty obvious
why you need those in a knitting bag.

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.629
I also keep pens. Because I always, always
photocopy the patterns that I’m using and

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.930
make notes about the patterns in pen while
I’m working them so I don’t actually have

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.109
to mark up a book or anything.

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:15.219
It’s really handy if you’re making things
like socks or sleeves where you know you need

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:16.889
to knit another one later.

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:22.859
And next are some cable needles. And you only
need these when the pattern calls for them,

00:03:22.859 --> 00:03:26.930
but this is where I keep them.

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:28.689
Okay, not too many things left.

00:03:28.689 --> 00:03:32.269
The next part is kind of personal hygiene.

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:38.709
A nail file. Cuz if your nails are snaggy,
you’re never going to get through that pattern.

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:43.040
Hand lotion, cuz if your hands are dry, you
can’t get a grip on the yarn. This is me,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.389
at least.

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:48.499
And lip stuff. Because.

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:58.569
And the last thing that I keep in my bag is
this funny little tool that’s half crochet

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:59.959
hook and half knitting needle.

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:04.419
And it saves me from a lot of knitting disasters.
I’m able to correct a lot of mistakes with

00:04:04.419 --> 00:04:05.419
this thing.

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.650
And it’s tiny, and it’s only a couple
of bucks, and I recommend that everybody gets

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:11.010
one.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:18.780
Anyway, that’s a real life trip through
my knitting tools. [laughs]

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.030
