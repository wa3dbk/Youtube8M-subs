00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.360
San Diego stands on the West Coast of the
United States.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.790
Situated right on the border with Mexico,

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:18.660
it's the southern-most city in California
and is home

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.189
to almost one-and-a-half million people.

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:27.700
Ever since the Europeans first settled here
in the 18th century,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.540
San Diego has been a city whose fortunes and
personality

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:36.110
has been influenced by the warm currents of
the Pacific Ocean.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.710
With a deepwater harbor, the city has always
been an important trading port,

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.070
and at one time was the tuna fishing capital
of the world.

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:51.830
Today San Diego is the mainland home to the
US Navy's Pacific Fleet.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.350
San Diego's Old Town is often called the "birthplace
of California".

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.210
This heritage precinct preserves and recreates
life

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.720
from the early Mexican and American periods.

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:10.329
In the 1860s the city's development and focus
shifted to the waterfront,

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:17.329
however Old Town remains an important center
for community and cultural celebrations.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.820
San Diego's Downtown area rises straight from
the water's edge.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.540
The Central Business District is home to some
beautiful heritage buildings,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:32.540
but to feel the real pulse of San Diego, head
to the Gaslamp Quarter.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.520
This 16-block historical neighborhood of Victorian
buildings

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:44.520
really lights up at night as theatergoers
and university students pour into the area.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:52.330
A few blocks inland from Downtown is the largest
urban parkland in the US -

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.780
a place where nature, culture, and fabulous
architecture converge.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.010
Balboa Park features over a dozen museums
with collections ranging

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:10.010
from automobiles to aviation, and from art
to natural history.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.040
There are almost twenty different gardens
to explore,

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:19.540
including a recreation of the Alcazar Gardens
of Seville.

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:24.819
Balboa Park is laced with miles of paths and
trails which connect its many treasures -

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.099
like the San Diego Zoo.

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.970
This is one of the world's greatest zoological
parks,

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.410
and one of the few places outside of China
where you can come face to face

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.890
with a Giant Panda.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.400
To truly appreciate San Diego's relationship
with the 'seven seas',

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.650
head to the Downtown waterfront area.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.650
Here you'll find the Maritime Museum and the
Navy Pier.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:59.580
Climb aboard the USS Midway, the longest serving
aircraft carrier of the 20th century.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:06.860
At the nearby Broadway Pier, jump aboard a
ferry and leave the busy Downtown behind.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.430
It's just a short ride to Coronado, where
the pace slows.

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:19.180
Locals have been kicking back in the sunshine
here since the 1880s.

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.900
Just across the harbor entrance is Point Loma,

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.750
the place where explorer Juan Rodriguez Cabrillo
first stepped ashore in 1542.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.020
Loma is Spanish for 'hill', and the views
here are incredible.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:38.230
When the weather is right, you can see all
the way to Mexico.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:41.690
Heading north, the dramatic cliffside neighborhoods
of Point Loma

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.250
open out into an endless string of California
beaches -

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.160
the kind of beaches that inspired all those
Beach Boys songs!

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:53.319
Each beachside community is unique;

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.760
Mission Beach is relaxed and laid back, while
neighboring Pacific Beach

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.970
with its vibrant bar scene likes to stay up
late and party.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:06.580
A great way to explore these coastal neighborhoods
is to hire a beach cruiser

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:08.260
and hit the promenade.

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.950
A little further up the coast is 'the jewel
city' - La Jolla!

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:19.590
Surrounded by ocean on three sides, La Jolla
is all about pristine coastline,

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.020
picturesque streets and beautiful architecture.

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:27.130
This is about as good as California Dreaming
gets.

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:31.070
Even the sea lions agree!

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.180
San Diego is a dream destination for children
too.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:39.870
The little ones can let their imaginations
run wild in Legoland,

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:42.970
while at historic Belmont Park, the Giant
Dipper

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:48.060
has been thrilling kids of all ages for almost
one hundred years.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.280
The people of San Diego have a deep abiding
respect for the ocean.

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.150
The Birch Aquarium plays an important part
of the city's tradition

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:01.639
in marine research and conservation.

00:05:01.639 --> 00:05:05.840
Then of course, there's SeaWorld, which has
been entertaining

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:12.840
and educating visitors from around the globe
since 1964.

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.160
Exploring San Diego can build up an appetite.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.470
With its proximity to Mexico and the sea,

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:23.710
there's no prize for guessing what the specialties
are.

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:28.229
So why not wash down that shrimp taco with
an ice cold beer.

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:35.229
Of course, the ideal way to end your San Diego
day is to grab a friend or two,

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:38.330
head to the water, and simply look to the
west.
