00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:03.340
Hello, this is Scott and this is the Hyper
Report.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.420
Here are quotes for various items.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.420
First...

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:08.420
Silver Demand

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.780
According to Stephen Leeb, silver is vital
for the Chinese to achieve the target of generating

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:11.919
70 gigawatts in photovoltaics.

00:00:11.919 --> 00:00:15.610
This means the price of silver is going to
have enormous momentum behind it when it starts

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.640
moving.

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.670
Next...

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.670
Stalling

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:21.570
The next crash will be big because we already
have zero interest rates, cheap easy money,

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:22.580
and massive stimulation.

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.000
We are seeing signs of a stalling economy
as illustrated by corporate profits dropping

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.330
10% and a GDP of -2.9%.

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.700
So, does one continue to buy into an all time
high stock market with shrinking corporate

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.570
profits or gold and silver when they are low?

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:35.570
Next...

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:36.570
17 Facts About American Jobs

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.570
Here are a few:
1.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.280
Only four of the twenty fastest growing occupations
in America require a Bachelor's degree or

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.280
better.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:43.280
2.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:44.410
One out of every ten jobs is now filled by
a temp agency.

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.410
3.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.930
In terms of median wealth per adult, the U.S.
ranks 19th in the world.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:48.930
4.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.600
76% of all Americans are living paycheck to
paycheck.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.600
Next...

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.600
No Food or Water

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.329
One in six New Yorkers are in a home where
there is not enough money to put food on the

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:57.329
table.

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.100
Adding to the hunger crisis in New York is
the fact in Detroit, thousands are going without

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.579
water - which is a similar situation for people
in drought stricken Las Vegas.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.280
This may be what is to come for the rest of
America.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.280
Next...

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.280
Firearms Buyback

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.470
While a report on the New York firearm buyback
program, that offered pre-paid credit cards,

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.360
resulted in a collection of 30 unused or unwanted
shotguns, rifles and handguns, according to

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.590
those on the scene, many of the firearms were
in fact broken BB guns and other pellet guns.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.290
The backlash against the New York Safe Act
mirrors what happened in Connecticut.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.290
Next...

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.290
Student Loan Interest

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.630
As of July 1st, new college students will
see their student loans increase from 3.86%

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.150
to 4.66%, or a 20% increase.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.780
Needless to say, with this economy, one can
expect student debt to skyrocket.

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.410
Will those students, who cannot pay their
loans, be forced into government service?

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:39.410
We will see.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.410
Next...

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:41.410
It's About Time!

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.700
IRS attorneys will be even busier than normal
next week because a U.S. District Court judge

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.990
is considering letting an outside expert to
probe IRS emails in relation to the so-called

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.410
destruction of all hard drives and backups
of Lois Lerner's emails.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.410
Next...

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:54.410
Why Celebrate?

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.950
It a palm in the face moment when people actually
believe that John Wilkes Booth and Joseph

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.840
Stalin were great Americans.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.840
Yikes!

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.829
Mark Dice clearly displays peoples knowledge,
in his latest video, as we also learn that

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:06.579
Abraham Lincoln discovered America in 1492.

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:08.350
What more needs to be said?

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:09.350
Yikes!

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:13.620
Finally, please prepare now for the escalating
economic and social unrest.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.030
Good Day!
