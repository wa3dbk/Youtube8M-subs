Hey what's up this is Scott Magno DJ MadFlip
here with UniqueSquared.com.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.340
Today we are checking out the Native Instruments
Kontrol S2.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.800
Now this is a fascinating controller from
Native Instruments.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:15.089
Some of you guys might be familiar with the
Kontrol S4.

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:17.449
Let's have a look at that first in comparison.

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:24.890
As you can see the S2 is just a little bit
smaller than the S4.

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:30.189
But actually the jog wheels and the line faders
are identical.

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.970
We went ahead and measured ourselves and they
are absolutely identical.

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:39.020
Some of the differences you'll find, the outputs
are pretty much the same, you've got balanced

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:41.090
TRS and RCA.

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.210
Now you do have a booth output, you can select
the RCAs to be a booth output.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:50.050
That did not exist on the S4, so cheers to
Native Instruments for getting us that.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:56.170
You also don't have DVS support for this and
you only have one TRS input, most of you guys

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.220
are going to use that for a microphone.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.650
So now on the front we actually have a enable/disable
button for that microphone, very convenient

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.820
to have.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.390
Let's check out the goods.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.510
So in the transport section on the S2 it's
going to be pretty much the same except you're

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:39.140
going to have four hot cues on the S2 versus
eight on the S4.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.540
So the effects section on the S2, it looks
identical but it's just a little bit different.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.520
You're going to have control over either a
chained effect or an advanced effect on the

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:49.670
S2.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.320
Now on the S4 you had control of four different
effects in advance mode, you're not able to

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.049
do that on the S2.

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:00.240
You also do not have a dedicated filter knob.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.560
So if you want to adjust the filter on each
deck you just hit shift and you can use the

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.190
gain to control the filter.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.190
That's very nice.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.090
Alright so let's talk about the decks, you've
got control of two decks on the S2, whereas

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.480
on the S4 you had 4.

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.579
You also have one sample channel on the S2,
where you had control of two extra sample

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:23.260
decks on the S4.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.680
But you still have control of eight different
samples, whether it's going to be on deck

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:32.910
C or D, you have a total of eight on that
one channel.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:38.599
Overall the Kontrol S2 has everything that
you need in a pro sense to be an awesome DJ.

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:42.659
I think one of the things that I like about
it the most is that I can get up and running,

00:02:42.659 --> 00:02:48.790
get in my mix, and do almost everything that
I can do on the Kontrol S4 with the exception

00:02:48.790 --> 00:03:25.099
of two extra decks.

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:28.669
It doesn't matter who you are out there, whether
you're a beginner, intermediate, or advanced,

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:33.319
or no matter what kind of DJ you are, the
Kontrol S2 is going to be perfect for you.

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:37.569
