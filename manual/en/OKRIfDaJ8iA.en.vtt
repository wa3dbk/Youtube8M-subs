00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.730
MATT GRAHAM: Like I said before, you really
don't need any tools at all to change the

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.420
strings on your acoustic guitar. With all
these excess string that's hanging off the

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:18.070
ends, rattling around and possibly disrupting
my playing of chords with my left hand, if

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:28.419
you don't have tools handy, you can simply
wrap them in a loop, like so, and that will

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:37.110
just get them out of the way. Be careful with
these sharp pointy ends. But if you do have

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.880
a pair of needle-nose pliers with the wire
cutter in it or just a set of wire cutters,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.730
you want to clip away those excess strings
just because they do create noise and tend

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:56.040
to get in the way. Now when you trim these
strings, it's important that you come at the

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.930
string at a 90-degree angle, because if you
cut them at a diagonal, like this, you're

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.990
basically creating a needle. You're sharpening
the end of that string and if you brush up

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.180
against it or if you're tuning and you hit
it with your finger and even when you're changing

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.540
strings the next time, if you've got it at
an angle like this, there's a lot better chance

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.020
that when some--when you're tune--changing
the strings you can--they'll snap back and

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.810
cut you or stab you. So again, come in at
90 degrees so you're cutting it off flat and

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.630
just snip the string, and I'm just going to
come around and carefully do that to all of

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:55.359
them. When you trim your strings, you'll want
to leave an eighth to a quarter of an inch

00:01:55.359 --> 00:02:04.600
of extra
and, really, all of that's doing for you,

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:12.520
leaving that extra on there, is creating something
to grab with your pliers when you remove these

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:16.360
strings after they've worn out or broken.
