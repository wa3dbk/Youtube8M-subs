00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:04.899
Scott: Hi, everyone.

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:09.540
Scott Lewis here from WireFly and this is
the full review for the LG G2.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.490
The first thing that catches my eye about
the LG G2 is the bright and vibrant 5.2 inch

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.600
IPS LCD display covered by Corning Gorilla
Glass 2.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:24.320
LG says the reason they use the 5.2 inch display
in the G2 is that 5.2 inches is the largest

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.509
display that one hand is able to navigate
on a smart phone.

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:34.870
The LG G2 has screen resolution of 1080 by
1920, making it a 1080P high definition display

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:38.860
with a pixel density of 423 pixels per inch.

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.180
The pairing of the large size and crystal
clear HD display makes the G2 the perfect

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.670
phone for watching and sharing videos.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:52.010
Pushing graphics through the Adreno 330 GPU
is a quad-core 2.3 gigahertz Snapdragon 800

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:54.440
CPU and two gigabytes of RAM.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:59.230
While the G2 comes with 32 gigabytes of on
board storage, it doesn't have the ability

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:03.030
to accept a micro SD card for additional storage.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.070
The overall look of the LG G3 is sleek and
elegant.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.390
With only a micro USB charge port, 3.5 millimeter
headphone jack, and a slot to insert a micro

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.680
SIM card, you might be wondering where the
volume and power button are located.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.580
On the back of the phone where your pointer
finger normally sits, you'll see the volume

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:21.300
up and down button separated by the power
and sleep button.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.860
There volume up and down buttons also act
as shortcut keys.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.720
With the phone locked, a long press of the
volume up button will launch the notebook.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.520
This is a great place to take take down a
task, note, or list to share later.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.130
A long press of the volume down button will
launch the camera app so you can quickly capture

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.280
a special moment.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:44.410
The Android 4.2.2 operating system, layered
with LG's user interface is very fluid in

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:46.760
transitioning from app to app.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.220
Thanks to that beefy 2.3 gigahertz Snapdragon
800 processor, you will never feel like the

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.020
LG G2 is lagging behind.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:58.320
One of my favorite features of the LG user
interface is the customization option to choose

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.140
the layout of the bottom buttons on the screen.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.120
Because you've most likely used a previous
phone for around two years, you've gotten

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.110
used to the location of the buttons.

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.120
When changing to a new phone, there is a learning
curve on where each button's located that

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.049
can be a little frustrating.

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:17.060
If you've coming from a smart phone with a
different button layout, you can customize

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.160
the LG G2 to match the configuration that
you're used to.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.849
The camera on the LG G2 is packed with a great
on screen interface, tons of camera settings

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:30.730
and adjustments, and optical image stabilization.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.319
On one side of the camera interface, you have
the ability to toggle between the front and

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.260
rear camera, select the shooting mode you
wish to be in, and adjust the white balance

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:40.919
and other options in the settings menu.

00:02:40.919 --> 00:02:45.200
If you're more of a point and shoot photographer,
the LG G2 has an intelligent auto mode that

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.560
when turned on, will automatically identify
your scenes characteristics and adjust the

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.840
aperture, shutter speed, and other settings
to take the best photo possible.

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.430
On the other side of the camera interface,
you have the ability to toggle from photo

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.840
to video mode, capture your pictures with
the shutter button, or go to the image gallery

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.640
to view previous pictures or videos.

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:09.909
The duel access optical image stabilization
moves the lens independently from the body

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:14.069
of the phone to help compensate for accidental
shake while taking pictures.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:20.049
The LG G2 automatically and precisely adjusts
so your photos and videos are clear with less

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:21.049
shake.

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:26.530
Here are some image and video samples from
the LG G2's 13 mega pixel 1080P video recording

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:51.290
primary camera.

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.909
Here's our sample video from the LG G2.

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:01.650
This also has optical image stabilization,
so let's go ahead and take a walk to see how

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.569
the shake comes out.

00:04:04.569 --> 00:04:08.019
I'm not doing anything special to try and
hold it any steadier than I normally would

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:10.650
with a normal camera.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.290
On the display, it looks like the optical
image stabilization is working really well.

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:18.730
We'll see how it comes out on the final video.

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:21.370
Those were our sample photos and video from
the G2.

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:26.050
Overall, the LG G2 is a solid phone that I'd
recommend to a novice or an advanced smart

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.050
phone user.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:31.440
The G2 has all the adjustments that a seasoned
Android smart phone user wants, while also

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.150
delivering a great experience for the novice
user that just wants to pick up the phone

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:37.230
and use it right out of the box.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:41.159
