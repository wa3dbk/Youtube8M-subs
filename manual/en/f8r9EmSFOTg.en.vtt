00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.110
Hey, you know, back when I was 
a little guy my grandma told me,

00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.540
that when I grew up Lenova was going 
to release a 21 inch, HighDef, all in one PC.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.950
And you know what, then I called her a liar.
Now, I feel really bad.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.860
Hey, check this out, Lenovo has just
released a much anticipated Lenovo A600,

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.540
all in one computer, and I gotta tell you,
this thing is rather impressive.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:38.960
We're talking a huge screen, 21.5 inches,
High Definition, 1920/1080 resolution,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.860
So you're gonna be able to watch 
all of your 1080p videos on this thing.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.410
It's got a Core 2 Duo processor 
and that's going to be running at 2.1 GHz.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:55.030
It's the T6500. A full four gigs of DDR3 RAM.
Massive 500 gigabytes of hard drive.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.880
It's got a DVD-RW built in. It's got
wireless, it's got BG and N wireless.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.100
It has a TV tuner built in, so you're going
to be able to watch everything,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.360
on television, on your computer.
And you're going to be able to use

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.830
Windows Media Centre to its full extent,
expecially when Windows 7 comes out.

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.640
Of course you'll be able to upgrade this 
to Windows 7, as soon as you get it.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.260
This is a very, very cool system. 
It's very big, but it's perfect for a room,

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.880
where you say, want a computer, 
and a TV, but there's not room for both.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.410
Like say, I don't know, 
a dorm or a college, an apartment,

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.610
or maybe even one of the extra rooms in your
house. This thing is really, really sweet.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.210
It's got the Intel GMA 4500 
graphic chips set on board.

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.650
So it's going to be able to decode all of
your HighDef content, without any problem,

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.760
whatsoever. And of course if you're somebody
that's worried about your computer crashing,

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:53.610
if you're worried about viruses, if you're
worried about restoring your computer...

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.490
Lenovo makes it very, very easy, 
with their one key rescue system.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:03.260
Allowing you to completely restore your
system, with just the touch of one button.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.220
Alright, so let me go ahead 
and show you around this a little bit.

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:11.070
This of course is our all in one computer,
I'll show you all... Every angle of it here,

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.080
in just a moment.
A huge 21.5 inch screen on this thing.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.400
Does of course come with 
keyboard, and a mouse.

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.610
It also includes this. This is Lenovo's
Media Centre remote control.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.580
So it will allow you to use all of the
advanced Media Centre functions,

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.090
that come along with this PC.
And, you also have this right here,

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.310
which is your IR receiver and blaster, 
so you're going to be able to control

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:40.790
all of your home theatre components 
as well, through this one machine.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.510
So let's go ahead and show you around this.
It's actually a very simple setup.

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.850
You come with your keyboard and your 
mouse here. Simply have to plug those in.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:53.610
Both are USB, and that was just plugged in
to the side here. Take a look at this.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.760
Over on this side, is where you are going to
find headphones and microphones,

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.930
couple of USB ports. You've got your 
IE 1394 Fire Wire port right here,

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.590
as well as your 
multi SD card reader.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.340
It's gonna do SD, MMC, Memory Stick,
Memory Stick PRO, all of that.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.780
You also have your power button
located right over here.

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.400
Now, around the back, you're going to find
your gigabyte Ethernet,

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:27.200
four more USB ports and your TV in, 
that of course is for the TV tuner.

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.640
And over on the other side here, is where
you are going to find your DVD-RW drive.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.450
Slot loading, slide it right here
into the side of the PC,

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.770
you don't have to worry about any trays 
or anything getting locked up.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:44.760
Slot loading DVD right there.
Setup of this could not be simpler.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.310
You literally take it out of the box, 
plug in your keyboard and your mouse,

00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:53.680
plug in your cable, and if you've got 
cable near by, and that's all there is to it.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:00.180
This thing is automatically ready to go
right out of the box, no assembly required.

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.260
It does have Dolby Home Theatre
surround sound, built into it.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.240
It has really, really good speakers. 
It gets loud and it sounds amazing.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:14.160
It also has an integrated webcam and
microphone of course, built into the machine,

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.990
as well, so you're going to be able
to do all of your video chatting,

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.310
and all of your video blogging, 
right with this machine.

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:23.170
In fact, there's very little you're not
going to be able to do with this PC.

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:28.410
It's got tons of RAM, a very, very fast
processor, lots of hard drive space,

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.570
and of course all the bells and whistles that
you would expect from a high end Lenovo PC.

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:36.310
All in one, very convenient package.

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.260
So there you go, an incredible all in One PC
from the folks at Lenovo.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.980
There's not a task this thing is 
not going to be able to do.

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:48.710
