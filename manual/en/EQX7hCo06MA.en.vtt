00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.090
This is my Bearded Dragon. He's a juvenile.
He's in quarantine right now, which is why

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:12.340
he's in a small cage. He had an illness. What
happened was I allowed him to gorge himself

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:18.859
on meal worms, which, they, I have heard from
several different sources that that's what

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:24.519
you should do with juvenile Bearded Dragons.
I believe I may have got a bad batch of meal

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:30.319
worms, because the next day he had thrown
them up, and with the vomiting, he also began

00:00:30.319 --> 00:00:37.149
having seizures. Now, I looked it up, and
I did as much research as I could on the seizures,

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:43.600
and what I found was that the main cause of
seizures in Bearded Dragons is a calcium deficiency,

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.699
so I've been treating him for that. In the
mean time, I have him in this little cage.

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:54.859
I have him on cage carpet, which is, I think
it's better because that way none of the substrait

00:00:54.859 --> 00:01:00.260
gets in to the food. I'm able to exam the
fecal matter very closely and make sure he

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:07.510
doesn't have anything strange going on with
that. I'm also able to see if he's eaten all

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.140
of his food or not, none of it gets buried
in the sand, I don't have to do any searching

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:19.840
for it. And this allows me to maintain a temperature
gradient that I feel is necessary for his

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:25.070
getting better from his illness. So, what
I've done here is I put the cage carpet in.

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:33.590
There is a rock heater over here for the basking
area. He needs to be very warm, especially

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.190
with an illness, you need to keep your reptiles
extra warm. I also have a thermometer on the

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:42.610
side right there, so that I can monitor the
temperatures, and make sure I don't overheat

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.140
him. I do have the basking lamp over head,
so he has heat coming from both directions,

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.280
and he can really warm himself if he feels
he needs to on that side. Over here, I've

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.240
been keeping his food and water dishes. It's
a cooler area, it's a good 20 degrees cooler

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.670
on this side of the tank, so right now he's
trying to cool off a little but. He feels

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:09.929
it's a little bit warm in there, so. If you
see here, there's little bits of skin on the

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.420
bottom, and that is shed from him. His, with
his illness, it's a little bit more difficult

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.290
for him to shed. So, what I've done is, I
soaked him for about 15 minutes. Bearded Dragons

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.310
you don't usually soak, if you do, it's for
very short periods of time, but I have, I

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:32.030
soaked him for about 20 minutes, 15, 20 minutes,
and it seems to be working quite well. You

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.740
can see the skin here, and it comes off in
little patches, it's not expected to be in

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:41.310
a very large piece. He's also got some fecal
matter in there, and that's the first one

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:47.530
since his illness began, so that's good. I'm
going to need to be able to exam that. So,

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.920
this also allows me to see that he has eaten
the vegetables that I have put in here. I've

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:00.260
dusted them with a supplement for added minerals
to help him recover. And he's also go his

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.420
little water dish over there, which he's been
drinking quite a bit. Keeping your animals

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.450
in quarantine like this when they have an
illness, or are recovering from an illness,

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:20.260
is very beneficial for the reasons that I
mentioned; the monitoring, and that way you

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:26.160
can really maintain a temperature gradient
that you feel is necessary for your ill Bearded

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.240
Dragon.
