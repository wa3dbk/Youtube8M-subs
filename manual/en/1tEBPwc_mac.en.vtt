00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.720
Almost 3 years ago to the day US gamers were
able to play CAPCOM's fourth title in the

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.110
Devil May Cry series on major consoles. While
still not as critically acclaimed as the original

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.369
Playstation 2 brawler, it carried on the traditions
of the series while adding a fresh twist to

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.080
the gameplay. Now iOS gamers can also get
their hands on 'Devil May Cry 4 refrain',

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.869
but with its diminished graphics, gameplay
and storyline it's a far cry from the devilish

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.830
title it could be.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.110
Players are given a choice of two control
schemes, either giving players an all-purpose

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.059
attack button that switches between ranged
and melee combat depending on their range

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.060
or separate ranged and melee button to make
the choice on their own. Navigating around

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:46.380
each of the game's tiny areas is easy enough
thanks to the responsive virtual stick, though

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:50.760
making use of advanced features like dodging
can be tricky to perform in the heat of battle.

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.360
Combat itself revolves around 'combos', with
additional points being awarded for managing

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.150
to string together powerful attacks for as
long as possible. This is made simpler thanks

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:02.530
to the all-purpose attack button, though attempting
to make use of the EX-act system (a method

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:06.460
of boosting your attack power) borders on
useless as you have to completely forgo moving

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.990
in order to tap the opposite corner in time
with your attacks.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.970
Graphically the game is surprisingly detailed,
though the tiny areas, low resolution textures

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.720
and simple 3D models harken back to the Playstation
1 era rather than the gorgeous graphics present

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.550
in the console version. This would be far
more forgivable if the camera wasn't awkwardly

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.860
positioned in many rooms, making it difficult
(if not impossible) to track your targets

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.979
as they enter the battle or are knocked back.

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.310
The word 'refrain' in the title is quite an
apt choice as it serves to highlight two key

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.630
issues with this release. Firstly, as in the
musical sense the gameplay quickly devolves

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.560
in to a repetitive sequence of attacks that
require little in the way of strategy, even

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.189
on boss encounters. Secondly, the story has
been held back, leaving all but the bare essentials

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:47.110
to justify moving forward.

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.370
'Devil May Cry 4 refrain' is a poor facsimile
of an excellent 3D brawler, but with so few

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.490
alternatives it's still one of the better
releases available; caution is advised for

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:56.670
fans of the series.
