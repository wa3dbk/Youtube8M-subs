00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:03.920
So, we're taking out a couple of rotten boards here,

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:10.740
and we're painting up the ends with a water repellent,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.460
in this case Thompson's Water Seal.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.320
And we're painting the tops of the old nail holes.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.400
You can fill those old nail holes right up
with this Thompson's, and that helps it out,

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.960
because usually the rot starts in the nail holes.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:38.540
Water collects in there, and if you fill it up with something that stops the rot from going in, that's good.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:41.160
We've got this little piece of sheet metal bent because

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.440
there was a little bit of decay on this particular one,

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.300
and we're really soaking that one up, and we're going to put the sheet metal over top of it,

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.200
so that it doesn't continue to absorb water,

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.960
and hopefully we'll get a few years out of that,

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.660
and we're going to also probably sister something alongside of that one.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:17.620
But it doesn't really help to sister if you
allow the water to keep going in there.

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.900
So the sheet metal, little piece there, will
turn out to be a flashing for over top of that.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:30.100
So, we put the first one in here, but I just wanted to show you this flashing here.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:34.800
It won't allow the water to continue to accumulate underneath that.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.960
And we're going to cut the next one in,

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.840
but this is good to show how that went.
And that goes right underneath all of that.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:54.510
So, you can see under here, you can see where this metal will drip off that edge,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.730
and not let any more water into that wood.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.970
Here's how we sistered this one,

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:08.979
and we did another sister on that one because it was getting kind of weak.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:10.279
It all worked out good.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.460
So, here's the deck all ready for a few more years,

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.000
and it could use a coat of paint.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.660
And this particular deck had a lot of dog hair in between the cracks, which holds the moisture.

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.660
So, should probably clean that out every so often.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.760
Right poochie? Hello.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.560
