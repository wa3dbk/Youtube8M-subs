00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:11.870
good morning girls today is it gonna be
a chicken house cleaning up and today

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:29.359
move back back 13 yeah I gotta clean
this mess up get it ready for the winter

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:37.140
uh I I put out some styrofoam up there
and these chickens have been slowly

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.780
pecking at it and tearing it apart I
think they finally got to the point

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.149
where they can't reach anymore so I'm
gonna trim that up clean it all up in

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.520
here or put new shavings and get my
heater in here ready for the winter

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.460
supposed to be a really bad winner
I got a tarp put up down here so the

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.970
rain doesn't come in here you know blow
in here hard and this is north well

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.260
actually that's about north there but
I'm gonna put a tarp up here too just to

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:18.960
give them a area to get out of the wind
man clean all these oh hey girls clean

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:33.450
all these chicken boxes out and this box
is washing drying new Hey what yeah new

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:48.960
hey and let's see oh yeah I got 20 bags
20 bags of pine bark mulch and since

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:56.150
this is supposed to be a very very wet
polar winter this holds water here

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.260
and I'm gonna throw all that mulch out
here try to give them some somewhere to

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:05.960
dry to stand they can catch diseases one
of them's called bumblefoot if they stay

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:17.420
in wet too much short I ain't wearing
pants still absolutely hefty all right

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.360
girls let's get busy back to work
everybody layin eggs

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:30.470
thanks for the hill breezy you did good
all right I sure hated using that mini

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.860
fender washers but uh they're kind of
expensive but I don't want this to blow

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.320
off and this stuff has the tendency to
get a little brittle as it as it gets it

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:47.240
older and exposed to Sun so there we
have the north side protected from the

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:56.300
wind okay on to the next one that's
probably gonna be the worst part which

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.770
is uh
getting up in the hen house here and

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:08.890
shoveling out crack out witty old crap
slick and put fresh crap in there

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:40.720
thank you scared of you think you'll be
real pretty here these are some nasty

00:03:40.720 --> 00:04:17.070
creatures here scraping begin my
favorite part of the job

00:04:42.389 --> 00:04:53.509
I need your hands for this

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:19.420

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:04.990
well I decided to redo their perches
they're all kind of flimsy and flopping

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:07.080
around

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:14.340
and they actually use them pretty good
bit

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:24.600
okay next getting that mulch in there

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:29.080

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:42.940
young ones I think they're let's see
August they were six months old the

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.620
other girls are all getting a little
long in the tooth

00:06:46.620 --> 00:06:52.090
alright let me put some things away and
I'm gonna get after this mulch all right

00:06:52.090 --> 00:07:03.100
that's what that looks like and now I
gotta get probably 20 or 30 more bags of

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:10.180
this so I can do out here cuz I'll tell
you last year I tried bales of hay and

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.130
we'll not got trampled down I went out
and raked up all that pine straw there

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:20.110
and a couple other trees and put it in
here and I'm spring came it was a mess

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:23.980
to get out of here
so this mulch got to do a much better

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:32.830
job getting them up out of the mud
thanks for watching the tomatoes have

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:38.620

squash growing

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:52.620
