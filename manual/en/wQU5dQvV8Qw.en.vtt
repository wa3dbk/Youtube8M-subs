00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:02.700
A sleeping-item is still left.

00:00:05.566 --> 00:00:08.500
Isn't it a toe separator while doing pedicure?

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.966
It's a toe pillow.

00:00:10.966 --> 00:00:12.933
Oh, does toe have a pillow too?

00:00:12.933 --> 00:00:14.600
Think how much burdensome

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.033
your toes have every day.

00:00:16.033 --> 00:00:17.733
Right. My toes are the most

00:00:17.733 --> 00:00:18.933
in trouble in the world.

00:00:18.933 --> 00:00:20.300
Right.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.900
It stretches feet that is known for

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.900
the 2nd heart, at the same time,

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.133
helps a blood circulation to

00:00:25.133 --> 00:00:27.033
put you in asleep easily.

00:00:27.533 --> 00:00:30.166
Now, this is a toe pillow.

00:00:30.166 --> 00:00:32.433
I'm shy to show my feet.

00:00:32.433 --> 00:00:33.100
Okay.

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.666
Right?

00:00:34.033 --> 00:00:34.933
At a wrist.

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.666
At my wrist.

00:00:36.666 --> 00:00:38.133
It could be a finger pillow.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.366
It's very soft.

00:00:41.366 --> 00:00:41.500
Right?

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.333
And I can feel some stones inside of it.

00:00:48.333 --> 00:00:48.833
Yeah.

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:50.066
Hm... What do you call this?

00:00:50.066 --> 00:00:50.666
Acupressure?

00:00:50.666 --> 00:00:51.333
Acupressure! That's right.

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:52.066
Blood circulation.

00:00:52.066 --> 00:00:53.233
Your whole body will be relieved

00:00:53.233 --> 00:00:55.233
if your feet are stress-free.

00:00:55.233 --> 00:00:56.000
Right.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.833
This is a beneficial item.

00:00:59.166 --> 00:01:02.233
Aside from it, there's a steam mask

00:01:02.233 --> 00:01:04.766
which emits around 40 degrees Celsius

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.833
to let you feel warm while sleeping

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:08.533
and an eye relaxer which allures

00:01:08.533 --> 00:01:10.566
you to sleep by air acupressure.

00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.966
You can sleep deeply without knowing  even if

00:01:13.966 --> 00:01:15.566
someone carries you piggyback.

00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:16.166
Right.

00:01:16.166 --> 00:01:17.100
If!

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.666
If you really can't sleep!

00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:21.833
- If! - Even if you play a phone game...

00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:24.300
That's the time you will you this.

00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:25.666
Huh? What's that?

00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.033
A plaster.

00:01:27.033 --> 00:01:27.766
A plaster?

00:01:28.766 --> 00:01:32.900
You can cut into pieces as small as your nail

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.366
to use as an acupressure plaster.

00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:39.333
Put this on between eyebrows

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:40.366
and temples.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.100
Put them.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.266
And at the back of ears.

00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:42.800
Put them.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:43.700
You know here?

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.433
Yeah.

00:01:44.433 --> 00:01:47.600
You can sleep as soon as you put.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.066
What's this principle applied?

00:01:51.066 --> 00:01:53.033
It leads you to sleep by

00:01:53.033 --> 00:01:54.966
stimulating a blood aperture.

00:01:54.966 --> 00:01:57.066
It helps your blood circulate freely a lot

00:01:57.066 --> 00:01:59.800
if you put on temples to reduce your headache

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:01.233
and relax the central nervous system

00:02:01.233 --> 00:02:06.200
if you put at the back of ears.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.600
It's very medical method!

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.833
Guys with insomnia must give it a try.

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:15.300
It already relieves my stress

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.266
by pressing these points here.

00:02:18.266 --> 00:02:20.733
Taste-sniper no.1 #sleepingitem

00:02:20.733 --> 00:02:22.433
send us many hearts

00:02:22.433 --> 00:02:24.366
if your heart got caught!

00:02:24.366 --> 00:02:25.900
I'll try at home too.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.400
Just put that big one on ears.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:29.166
On your forehead.

00:02:29.166 --> 00:02:30.133
On your eyebrows.

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:31.900
I feel sleepy.
