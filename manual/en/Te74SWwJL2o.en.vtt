00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.101
Okay, you should have a completely finished
stocking now, it’s plain, but it’s finished,

00:00:16.101 --> 00:00:21.090
and you’re ready to do some kind of design
on here, like this.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:26.250
I’ve offered you a couple of choices here
for charts, and things that you can embroider

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.250
on the side of it.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.790
Really, any cross stitch pattern that you
see online will work as well, and there are

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:35.440
so many little free motif kind of patterns
that you can see out there.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:40.230
I also think that this would be cool if I
put the year right here.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.440
Which I haven’t done on this, but I think
I might do it, I think that’s a pretty good

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.440
idea.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.040
So I’m giving you this snowflake design,
and this Christmas tree design.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.800
But really the technique is the same for any
design that you want to embroider on the knit

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.629
 – on to the stockinette stitch.

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:00.910
Now, when we embroider on stockinette stitch,
we use what’s called the duplicate stitch,

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.041
because it exactly matches the look of the
knit stitch.

00:01:04.041 --> 00:01:05.799
Kind of makes it look like it’s knit in.

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.479
And that’s the technique I’m going to
show you right now.

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.859
So I’m going to use this swatch, which amazingly
matches [laughs] my fingernail polish.

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:18.500
And that was accidental.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.320
And you need a length of yarn in the color
that you want to embroider, thread it on to

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.179
your tapestry needle.

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:31.039
We look at this, and we look at the knit stitch,
we’ll see that – or stockinette stitch,

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:34.619
we’ll see that it’s a series of Vs, right?

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:40.159
To do a stitch in this cream color, I’m
going to put my tapestry needle in at the

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:46.680
bottom of a V, pull it through, leave myself
a little tail on the back so that I can weave

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.259
that in later.

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:56.520
And then put my needle through both legs above
the stitch I just came in on.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:03.030
So I come in here, the bottom of this V, skip
this V and put your needle through both legs

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.819
of the stitch above.

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:06.179
Pull that through.

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:08.899
And this is where you really want to watch
tension.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.650
Because something too loose isn’t going
to look right, and something too tight isn’t

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:13.650
going to look right.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.709
And I should tell you, I knit this swatch
out of chunky weight yarn, and I’m using

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:21.560
worsted weight yarn for duplicate stitch,
so this is never going to look exactly right,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.810
but the technique is the same.

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.440
Okay, so I pulled my – pulled it through
both legs of the V above, and I go back down

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.500
into that same hole that I came in on.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.190
Okay, and I have a little V there.

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.760
I’m going to keep traveling up.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:46.810
I come in at the bottom of a V, skip that
V, grab both legs of the stitch above it,

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:51.000
pull that through, watching my tension, go
back down into the same hole that I came out

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.310
of, and tighten it up.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.900
Now I’m not sure what I have going on here.
I actually think I might have come in too

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.130
low on the first stitch, that’s easy enough
to fix.

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.760
Because that V didn’t look perfect, and
they really should look perfect.

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:11.640
That looks better! Okay.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:14.520
Now I’m going to travel a little bit here
and do this one more time.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:20.990
Come in at the bottom of a V, and you can
see on the back of the work here, I’m travelling

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:22.110
a little bit.

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.250
The fewer times you do that the neater your
work looks on the back, but the back of this

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.070
is going to be on the inside of a stocking,
anyway.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:37.450
Skip that V, grab the two legs of the V above,
pull it through, watching your tension, go

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:42.750
back down into the same hole, tighten that
up, watching your tension, and there’s a

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:43.750
V.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:47.320
So that’s the technique. That’s the stitch
that you’re going to use to embroider the

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:48.540
pattern into the work.

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:54.250
Um, before you get started though, of course,
you will want to count the number of stitches

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.860
down and make sure that things are centered,
and make sure where you want to place things.

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:01.490
It’s entirely up to you. You can fill the
stocking with embroidery, if you like.

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:06.650
Um, but the technique is the same, and you
want to make sure that you don’t travel

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.650
a float too far on the back of the work.

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.650
You want to make sure that the back of the
work is tidy enough so that things can actually

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.850
be put into the stocking without snagging
on the embroidery floats that you have in

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:17.850
the back.

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.570
Just break the yarn if you need to, tie a
little knot, and start it up again in another

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.350
place if it looks like you’re traveling
too far.

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:31.190
That’s it! That is how to do the duplicate
stitch on the side of your stocking.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:33.319
