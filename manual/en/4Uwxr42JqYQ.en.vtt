00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:07.030
On June 7, 1692, the Jamaican city of Port
Royal, a notorious pirate haven, sank into

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:08.250
its own harbor.

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.700
This disaster (or blessing, depending on who
you ask) was caused by liquefaction of the

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.670
ground following a major earthquake, and we
know it happened at exactly 11:43 am thanks

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:23.240
to a pocketwatch that went down along with
two thirds of the town and over 2000 people.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:28.160
Liquefaction happens when waterlogged, loose
soil (we call it "sand") turns into quicksand

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:29.240
- temporarily.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.180
If you look closely at sand, you'll realize
that it's actually comprised of tons of tiny

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.190
rocks, and their roundness and roughly uniform
size mean there's space between them that

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.809
can get filled by water.

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.239
When we step on saturated sand at the water's
edge, it's fairly stable because the particles

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:47.370
get pushed together and rest on each other,
while any excess water escapes by flowing

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.449
away to where the pressure is lower.

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:53.670
We can (and do) build buildings on wet sandy
soil, since the weight of the grains and the

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.459
friction between them makes the soil behave
as a solid most of the time.

00:00:57.459 --> 00:01:01.449
But in an earthquake, soil particles repeatedly
jostle back and forth so much that the water

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:02.980
can't flow away.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.180
Loosely packed dry soils tend to compress
under stress, but with incompressible water

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.460
in the gaps between grains (which can't escape),
the soil can't compress and the water takes

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.460
the load.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:16.560
Unfortunately, water, as a liquid, doesn't
have much structural integrity - so if the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.460
saturated soil is forced to compress too much
too quickly, it will start to act like a liquid,

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.130
and dense objects resting on the now liquefied
soil will sink.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.920
You can experience liquefaction for yourself
in the water-soaked sand near the edge of

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.300
a beach - it feels pretty solid if you stand
still, but if you wiggle your toes, the movement

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.990
causes the sand to liquefy beneath you, burying
your feet.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.650
On a larger scale, earthquake-induced liquefaction
can swallow cars, roads, and even enormous

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:43.270
apartment complexes.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.439
In other words, earthquakes can create quicksand,
except that when the shaking stops and the

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.770
soil particles are no longer suspended in
water, the ground solidifies again and anything

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:53.789
that sank becomes stuck.

00:01:53.789 --> 00:02:15.020
Like this carrrrrr.
