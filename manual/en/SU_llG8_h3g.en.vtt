00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:20.359
Lesion removals.

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:21.489
This is the skin night, Iím telling you.

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:27.750
Okay, ìWhen coding 17Öî We must haveÖ
maybe some students in our course in the Integumentary

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.179
System, perhaps?

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:36.899
ìWhen coding 17000, 003 and 004, do you put
the number of lesions removed units or do

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.790
you just list each lesion separately with
the 59 modifier?

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.550
Iíve seen it both ways.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:48.540
Iím thinking of using the units and not the
modifier.î Okay, let me turn thereÖ

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.540
Okay so here, we see where the bubbling and
highlighting helps.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.280
And what Iíve highlighted after the semi-colon
is first lesion.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:00.290
And then the idented code is the 2nd through
14.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.860
Okay and because it uses the word ìeachî,

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.530
if you haveÖ letís just say, for example,
12 lesions total.

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.570
17000 will be what youíll use for the first
lesion.

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.960
And then 17003, youíll report times 11 to
come up with the individual ones.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.030
So thatís how I would do it.

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.830
Iíd put a 11 in that column.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:37.890
Now, as far as the 59 goes, that would be
a pair preference, I guess, because youíre

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.060
going to have them listed as units.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.909
So if you just had two and you have one unit
of 17000 and one unit of 17003, I donít think

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.460
59 would really apply because itís an addon
code.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.900
So you know, unless the payer specifically
told you to do it a different way, I donít

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.070
think itís necessary you know, to do that.

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.070
But thatísÖ you know, Iím in the coding
world, not the billing world so your mileage

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:05.130
might vary there.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:10.670
You know, if anyone has any other opinions,
feel free to put it in the chat box.

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.659
On the board exam, I doubt youíd use a 59
in that case.

00:02:15.659 --> 00:02:19.480
Oh, and you asked about the 004.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.110
That is when once you hit 15 or more then
you use 17004, okay?

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:29.380
So if you haveÖ and youíll only report 1
unit of it.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:37.060
So if you have 20, youíre going to only report
one unit of 17004, okay?

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:43.060
And is modifier 51 exempt?

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:51.940
Yes, the 17004 and thatís because of the
No Smoking symbol is what I call it.
