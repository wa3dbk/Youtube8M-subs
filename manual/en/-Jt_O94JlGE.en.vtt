00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.870
I got my jug here and I got quite a bit of
volume uh... of liquid I need to ad to this

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.260
thing
to cover

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:17.520
all these circuit cards here this time
so I'm gonna recycle

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:27.369
the uh... copper chloride from the last batch
because it probably has some active

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:34.500
hydrochloric acid still in it
and as well copper chloride is a good solvent

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.010
for copper anyway.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:47.379
So all I'll need to add is a little dash
of hydrochloric acid which is this

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:53.140
and probably just a shot of water
will be sufficient to raise the level

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.790
as needed
I'm just gonna throw some water in there

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:02.550
I think if I jiggle that around that's gonna
be high enough anyway

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.610
Another thing you can add is just some hydrogen
peroxide

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.539
just regular store bought
it's like three percent it's not a lot

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:14.850
to add a little bit of oxegen to it.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.570
It get's things goin'
or you can put a fish tank bubbler in there

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:26.250
speeds the process along
as well

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.380
an option to avoid having to use
hydrogen peroxide in your little digestion

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.170
tank here
to dissolve copper and also to reduce the

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:40.580
amount of hydrochloric acid that you need
um, you can get just a very small

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:44.220
fishbowl aerator
alright, an old coffee pot comes in really

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.360
handy
and uh... an old coffee pot maker these things

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.390
are so cheap
you can get these things on Craigslist pretty

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:52.440
cheap uh...
just to use specifically for this

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:56.700
I'm quite sure that it will ruin it, but
you've got the heating plate on it,

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.520
the glass holds up well
and you have a little thing to handle your

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.200
filters
so, what we're gonna do

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.950
is we are going to siphon the
fluid out of this tank

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:19.250
down through the coffee pot
we're doing here is separating the gold from

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.490
the copper
and stuff that is desolved in the fluid

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:29.280
the gold is still solid
the other base metals and impurities are dissolved

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.640
in the acid
most of the gold will stay in the tank

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.570
but we don't want to lose any of these fragments
either so,

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:45.800
that is why we filter it
it is real handy to have a coffee pot

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.690
it just goes right down in there
all fluids need to be saved

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:54.570
this is toxic
mostly copper chloride

00:02:54.570 --> 00:03:02.260
not disposal friendly
There could be small amounts of dissolved

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.340
gold in here
so we will save this.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.370
We can use
electrolysis to recover the copper

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:10.930
nickle, and uh we can also have it tested
to make sure there is

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.570
not platinum or anything else in there.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:15.600
stuff builds up ... this could be boiled
down some too.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.400
I'm going to rinse some of this with distilled
water

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:36.140
now that the acid is pretty well diluted,
I can even reach in there with my bare hands

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.240
and
maybe put some rubber gloves on but uh..

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.880
I'll get the big chunks out uh... get them
were I can

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.120
squit them off and wash off any gold that
might be on them

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.990
and then try to wash out
as much gold as we can get out of there

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:55.130
get into this filter paper
an interesting thing I have noticed about

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.870
some of these cards
that I have

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.650
from what I can tell,
underneath the green paint

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.680
or the green epoxy coating or whatever
there's still

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.570
a big ol' thick layer of copper
that appears to be plated with gold

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.780
all the way through and through on these cards
so

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.060
uh... some of these cards may have an aweful
lot

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.880
of gold on them
but it takes an aweful long time to digest

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:22.320
as
you can see the, it kinda has to,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.270
because the plastic protects the
copper

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.900
it kinda has to digest from the edge and work
its way in

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:36.030
you see it has made a lot of progress here
but there's still quite a bit left to go

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.870
so some of these cards will just have to digest
for a really long time

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:44.000
wow, there could be a lot of gold on
some of these cards

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.750
I sure would not want to sell these to uh...
scrap dealer

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:51.000
because they probably wouldn't konw how
much gold is on them either

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.710
it pays to process these kinds of cards yourself
