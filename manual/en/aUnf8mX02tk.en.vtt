00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.000
The secrets of beauty oils

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Winter is hard on my hair. 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
It has to cope with overheated rooms, plus I need to wear a hat outside most of the time.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I need a solution to repair the damage! 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Macadamia oil works miracles on my hair.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Once a week, I use it as a hair mask.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Working section by section, I massage it into my hair, so that it can absorb all the benefits of this elixir.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
For even better results, I recommend wrapping a warm towel around your hair. 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
15 minutes later, after a gentle shampoo, my hair is repaired, soft and shiny. 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Fatigue tends to build up, 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and you can see it in my eyes.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
But I know just how to banish fatigue! 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
The perfect duo for wide-awake eyes: cornflower floral water to reduce puffiness

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
and avocado oil, to nourish and protect the eye area.  

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
I moisten two cotton pads with these products  

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
and leave them on my eyes for 10 minutes. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
In winter, the cold air whips against my legs and my skin is damaged by wearing tights. It's hard to avoid dry, crocodile skin. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.000
My winter skin saviour: argan oil, to regenerate and repair. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
I spray my legs with orange blossom floral water

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
then the argan oil is immediately absorbed. 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
At this time of year, my delicate skin is really damaged by going from warm to cold environments every day.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
It needs comfort.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Before applying moisturizer, I apply a drop of calendula oil to damp skin, then gently massage it in. 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Immediately, my skin is soothed and ready to face the wintry weather!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
