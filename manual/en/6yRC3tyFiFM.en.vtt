00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.100
Intensive care units all over the world are confronted with the same challenges.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.980
The greatest challenges in critical care in current modern medicine is 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:27.400
the growing number in ventilator patients that we see as the population ages. 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.500
We have issues with manpower, issues with the resources available at our disposal, 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:38.620
as well as challenges dealing with how do we provide quality care to a patient with restricted resources. 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.820
That means in the ICU we have to increase our efficiency of care. 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:49.300
In 1983 Hamilton Medical was founded with a vision: 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:58.280
To develop intelligent mechanical ventilators that make life easier for patients in the ICU and for the people who care for them.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.940
The original vision was Steve Hamilton‘s. He wanted us to develop fully automated ventilators.

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.660
Airplanes can fly using an auto pilot, so why should that not be possible with medical ventilators too?  

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.240
Today Hamilton Medical is a leading manufacturer of critical care ventilators.

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.360
It is essential to us to deliver a first-class product 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.240
that meets the demands of our customers while providing the best possible medical outcomes. 

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:39.380
Hamilton Medical revolutionized critical care ventilation in 1998 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:45.180
with the first intelligent ventilation mode: ASV - Adaptive Support Ventilation. 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.940
ASV has become the standard for ventilation in many hospitals around the world.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.840
The difference between ASV and conventional ventilation modes is that

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:06.740
it combines mechanical breaths, spontaneous breathing and as an underlying level of support 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:15.420
it is adapting to the patients’ needs and provides all levels of ventilation regardless what the patient’s needs are.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:22.200
In critical care the patients change. They change from second to second, minute to minute, hour to hour. 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.675
And if you have decreased manpower if you don’t have an intensivist in the ICU who can stay there 24 hours a day, 

00:02:28.675 --> 00:02:32.895
you need to have a smart mode of ventilation that makes automatically minor changes by itself. 

00:02:33.535 --> 00:02:38.735
This is especially important in critical care transport and in emergencies.  

00:02:40.935 --> 00:02:43.415
ASV has proven its worth in daily use. 

00:02:43.457 --> 00:02:46.257
Our crews are very enthusiastic about it.

00:02:46.257 --> 00:02:52.075
They say that they can practically leave the details of ventilation to the machine and focus on the patient’s other needs. 

00:02:52.075 --> 00:02:58.035
Once these are taken care of, they can return to inspect, and if need be, optimize ventilation.  

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.460
However, more often than not, the machine is almost doing a better job than a doctor.

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.700
In 2010, Hamilton Medical revolutionized ventilation again. 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.814
This time with the world’s first ventilation autopilot: INTELLiVENT-ASV.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.800
INTELLiVENT-ASV is a complex mode inside 

00:03:21.975 --> 00:03:25.815
with very advanced technology and advanced algorithms, 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.920
but for the user it is very simple to handle. 

00:03:31.464 --> 00:03:38.344
The doctors just have to determine what the targets are in terms of end tidal CO2 and SPO2 for the patient 

00:03:38.344 --> 00:03:40.235
and the ventilator will do the rest.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.700
We gain time that way. 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.234
Time we can use to accomplish other important tasks that take place in an ICU, 

00:03:47.234 --> 00:03:53.915
such as taking care of the patients, providing essential medical care, and informing and comforting the patients‘ families,

00:03:53.915 --> 00:03:56.880
which we consider as particularly important.

00:04:01.274 --> 00:04:06.954
Since 1983, the most advanced medical ventilators are built in the Swiss mountains – 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.340
always ahead of their time

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:12.715
always incorporating cutting-edge technologies 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.120
and the latest medical findings. 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.400
And always with just two people in mind: 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.820
the patient and the one who cares for them.

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:26.435
We will continue to develop intelligent systems that best support clinicians

00:04:26.435 --> 00:04:29.154
 to ventilate their patients – wherever they are.
