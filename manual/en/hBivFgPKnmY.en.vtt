00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.162
Hello, Spacelab! I'm Lucianne Walkowicz.

00:00:02.162 --> 00:00:06.258
I'm an astrophysicist at Princeton University, where I work on studying stars

00:00:06.258 --> 00:00:10.588
and planets with NASA's Kepler Mission and I'm here today to answer your questions.

00:00:10.588 --> 00:00:16.060
The first question is "If we were to add a lot of mass to the moon for its gravity to get stronger,

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:19.253
what would that mean to the rotation of the earth?"

00:00:19.253 --> 00:00:24.592
So, this is a great question and in order to understand how the rotation of the earth would change

00:00:24.592 --> 00:00:30.759
if the moon was much more massive, it helps to know how the moon actually affects Earth's rotation currently.

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:36.693
So, the moon and the earth interact through gravity and the way that the moon affects the Earth's rotation

00:00:36.693 --> 00:00:41.106
is that it actually causes the earth to be ever so slightly egg-shaped

00:00:41.106 --> 00:00:46.448
because it exerts a pull on the earth from one side to the other, what we call a tidal force.

00:00:46.448 --> 00:00:50.999
Now, this affects the actual ground of the earth a very tiny bit,

00:00:50.999 --> 00:00:53.504
but it affects our oceans a lot more.

00:00:53.504 --> 00:00:59.217
And it causes the oceans to pile up in one sense on one side of the planet.

00:00:59.217 --> 00:01:02.388
So, we actually get what we call a tidal bulge.

00:01:02.388 --> 00:01:06.846
Now this bulge, as the earth rotates, gets dragged just a little bit forward of where

00:01:06.846 --> 00:01:12.596
the moon is in the sky, but the moon still pulls on it, so through gravity it actually

00:01:12.596 --> 00:01:15.811
creates a force that makes the earth slow down over time.

00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:17.818
Now the slow-down is really, really small.

00:01:17.818 --> 00:01:23.835
It's really only about 1 500th of a second every century, but over time it adds up.

00:01:23.835 --> 00:01:28.084
If we were to wait a long enough time, the earth and the moon would actually

00:01:28.084 --> 00:01:34.137
eventually become completely locked so that one side of the earth was always facing the same side of the moon

00:01:34.137 --> 00:01:37.838
and therefore only one side of the earth would ever be able to see the moon.

00:01:37.838 --> 00:01:41.335
So, if you were to make the moon much more massive than it is now,

00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:46.337
you would actually exert a greater force on the earth and you would cause that slow-down

00:01:46.337 --> 00:01:49.692
to the rotation of the earth to happen even faster.

00:01:49.692 --> 00:01:54.108
The second question is, "If smaller objects are being pulled by larger objects,

00:01:54.108 --> 00:01:58.181
then why does the moon get further and further away from Earth?"

00:01:58.181 --> 00:02:02.198
So the answer to this question is actually related to the answer to the first question.

00:02:02.198 --> 00:02:06.275
As the moon and the earth interact through gravity and the moon slows down

00:02:06.275 --> 00:02:11.093
the earth's rotation over time, that means that it's causing Earth to lose energy

00:02:11.093 --> 00:02:14.041
as the moon itself gains that energy.

00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:18.957
That gain in energy means that the moon starts to orbit further and further away from the earth.

00:02:18.957 --> 00:02:23.261
So it actually moves further away, even through the interaction of gravity.

00:02:23.261 --> 00:02:26.837
Now over time, that means that the moon is spiraling outwards

00:02:26.837 --> 00:02:31.145
and we can measure that happening because we do experiments where we bounce

00:02:31.145 --> 00:02:36.510
laser beams actually off of the corner reflector mirrors that the Apollo astronauts left behind.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.747
So we can measure that the moon is moving further away and this also means that

00:02:40.747 --> 00:02:45.172
we live in a sort of special time, where the moon is actually the same apparent size

00:02:45.172 --> 00:02:51.244
as the sun on the sky and that means that we live in a time where we can have total solar eclipses.

00:02:51.244 --> 00:02:56.097
So, years and years and years from now, the apparent size of the moon will actually

00:02:56.097 --> 00:03:00.722
be smaller than that of the sun and so total solar eclipses will cease to happen.

00:03:00.722 --> 00:03:08.465
The third question is, "Why are celestial bodies like starts, planets and moons, always spherical in shape?"

00:03:08.465 --> 00:03:12.051
So the answer is, they're actually NOT all spherical in shape.

00:03:12.051 --> 00:03:16.305
Even though you're probably familiar with some of the bigger bodies in our solar system,

00:03:16.305 --> 00:03:20.821
like the sun and the earth or even other planets like Jupiter that are spherical,

00:03:20.821 --> 00:03:25.604
many of the bodies in our solar system are actually sort of oblong or pock-marked

00:03:25.604 --> 00:03:27.787
and look a little bit more like potatoes.

00:03:27.787 --> 00:03:29.773
A good example is the asteroids.

00:03:29.773 --> 00:03:33.791
These bodies are small enough that most of them didn't have enough mass

00:03:33.791 --> 00:03:37.429
for gravity to mold them into a spherical shape when they were forming.

00:03:37.429 --> 00:03:42.504
So even though gravity brought the material that formed them together and holds them together today,

00:03:42.504 --> 00:03:48.548
it's in fact impossible for things that are very small to become spherical in shape.

00:03:48.548 --> 00:03:49.894
Thanks for the great questions.

00:03:49.894 --> 00:03:54.091
