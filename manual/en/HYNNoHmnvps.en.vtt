dot com were testing the latest heavy
duty pickup trucks

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.350
from Ford GMC and RAM we've hooked up
trailers away almost 19,000 pounds

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.859
and we pull them almost 2,000 miles to
four different states

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.980
let's see other trucks dead a first up

at the same place the automaker test

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:35.390
its cars and trucks the germ X power
2012 GMC Sierra 3500 with returning some

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:53.530
the F 350 was fashion quarter-mile while
the gym sepals or 55 miles an hour

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.610
with a better time close behind both

while racing is your 60s Prince next was
a Ford F 350

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.690
while the RAM 3500 to third spot in both
aunty enjoying runs

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.560
how for the ram was passed down low
especially in first year while Ford GMC

founder sweet spots higher up in the
gears rev range

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:26.250
before star made up for the Rams earlier
toward we also tested stopping distances

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.450
from forty miles an hour

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.340
with the trucks hooked up to the
trailers at therefore combined weight

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.799
about 27,500 pounds each

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:36.590
in the first round the Ford F 350 at the
shortstop in distance

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.130
just 94 feet next was rampant 105 feet
from the GMC Sierra

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.110
at 114th Street but what if you lose
connection from tractor-trailer

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.190
so the truck no longer controls the
trash breaks repeated the same brake

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:51.100
test to find out

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.710
stopping distances grew by an average of
50 percent the F 350 came to a stop in

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.040
143 seats the ramp and 164 feet

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.010
and this year's top and 165 feet after
testing the flatlands

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.869
next up was a low-altitude Brooklyn test

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:22.120
the average inclined Davis Dam is five

fastest time at the great followed by
the Ford

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:27.950
Ram trucks we also tested high altitude
in the Rocky Mountains

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:31.739
between the same seven-mile stretch of
highway we previously used for rumble in

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:32.630
the rockies test

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.920
the finish line is a Eisenhower Tunnel
Colorado

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.390
the highest point in the US interstate
system at eleven thousand feet above sea

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.690
of

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.670
making this claim even tougher than
David stamp is a7 percent incline for

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.099
most the rest once again

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:49.989
the GMC Sierra 3500 was also fastened to
the top prize in our past

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:56.750
followed by the Ford RAM 1 times over
2,000 mile drive route we also measured

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:57.500
fuel economy

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.050
point in nineteen thousand pound taking
trailers the 4350 was most efficient at

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:03.470
nine and a half miles per gallon

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.500
filed by the Sierra at 9.1 miles per
gallon

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:09.980
and the ramp and a half miles per gallon
driven individually

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.069
all the structure highly capable
workforce is better in almost every way

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.310
from church we tested

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.500
just a few years ago after wrapping up
the heavy duty for like a comparison

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:21.750
our final results near earlier tests but
these were course pickups

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.950
the GMC Sierra 3500 his best overall
with the Ford F 350 in the second spot

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:33.950
and Ram 3500 in third for the full
details on this heavy-duty comparison
