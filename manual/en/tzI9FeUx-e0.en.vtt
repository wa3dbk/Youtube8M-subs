00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:08.380
Today on this 2007 Honda Odyssey were going
to be installing Curt Hitch part number C13068.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:11.830
Starting off over here on the drivers side
of the vehicle, were going to be using three

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:12.830
attaching points.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:17.480
Were going to be using the two rear most weld
nuts here at the end of the frame.

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.300
And if you follow a little bit forward you
see we've got three existing holes.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:24.609
Were going to be using the middle one as our
third and final attaching point.

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.359
And thats going to be the same on the passenger's
side of the vehicle.

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.059
However, on the passenger's side you'll see
that we do have the exhaust that is in the

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:36.840
way so we are going to need to lower it down
to give us a little bit more working room.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.230
To do that were just going to take a spray
lubricant and go ahead and spray down the

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.310
stud of the exhaust and the rubber hanger
as well and go ahead and separate the two.

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.460
The next thing we want to go ahead and do
is to thoroughly clean out the weld nuts on

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.240
the vehicle on both the drivers and passengers
sides.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.010
To do that were going to again take a spray
lubricant, thoroughly spray down the weld

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.590
nuts and then were going to take a wire brush
and go ahead and run that into each one of

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.920
the weld nuts and we may need to do this several
times.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.140
Any vehicle that has seen at least one winter
is going to have some corrosion and rust built

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:47.549
up 
into 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:02:31.860
these 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:04:02.739
weld nuts.
