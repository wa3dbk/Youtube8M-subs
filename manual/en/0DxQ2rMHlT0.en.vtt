00:00:05.572 --> 00:00:06.071
Hi guys.

00:00:06.071 --> 00:00:08.510
I'm Catie Wayne, and this
is "Weird Gross Beautiful"

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:09.335
on Animalist News.

00:00:09.335 --> 00:00:10.710
For those of you
that don't know,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.550
I've had a show called
"Weird, Gross, and Beautiful,"

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:17.620
and we were like, hey, how
come it's not here on A News?

00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:19.150
And we were like, I don't

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:20.160
And so we switched it.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.690
And so those of you that
are familiar with the show,

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.290
I hope that you will
subscribe to Animalist News

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:27.700
so that you can get your
weekly dose of "Weird, Gross,

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:28.570
and Beautiful."

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.560
And for those of you that
are not aware of the show,

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.450
well then, here you go.

00:00:37.945 --> 00:00:40.070
Hello and welcome to "Weird,
Gross, and Beautiful."

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:41.060
[? I kind of ?]
discuss about animals

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.707
that I think are weird, gross,
beautiful, or all three.

00:00:43.707 --> 00:00:45.290
And today, we're
talking about pandas.

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:46.655
Yes, that's a panda.

00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:49.172
Spoiler alert, I
think they're cute.

00:00:49.172 --> 00:00:53.470
Newborn baby panda cubs are
only three to four ounces,

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.707
and that is 1/900 of what
their mommy would weigh.

00:00:57.707 --> 00:00:58.206
No!

00:00:58.206 --> 00:01:00.380
It's already too cute.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.280
It's exhausting loving animals
as much as I do, you guys.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.230
They don't hibernate
like other bears.

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.670
Maybe that's why they
got the dark circles.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.390
Because they're so
sleepy, because they

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:12.850
don't hibernate like
the other bears.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:13.760
What a life.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:17.370
99% of what a panda bear
eats is bamboo shoots.

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:20.350
And they have a special
lining on the throat

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.975
to make sure that they don't get
splinters and stuff like that.

00:01:22.975 --> 00:01:24.650
Depending on how
big the panda is,

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.960
they'll have to eat 26 to
84 pounds of bamboo a day

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.820
because of how
unnutritious bamboo is.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.140
Jesus Christ, somebody get
them a [BLEEP] multivitamin.

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.520
That's ridiculous.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.825
Look at that face.

00:01:38.825 --> 00:01:41.279
Look at that tubby, tubby
[? face. ?] Actually,

00:01:41.279 --> 00:01:42.320
they're not tubby at all.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.090
They are super muscular.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.130
In fact, a panda jaw, face,
and cheek muscle thing,

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.360
it can easily nom nom
nom on an aluminum dish.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.460
And they can,
obviously, conveniently

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.960
chew right through bamboo.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.080
And humans have a
hard time getting

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.570
through the exact same
stalk with an axe.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.260
Think about that for a second.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.924
Humans are trying to
chop these things down,

00:02:04.924 --> 00:02:06.590
and they're like,
woo, breaking a sweat.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.289
Oh, man, this is so hard.

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.759
Pandas, they're just like,
nom, like it's a Fruit Roll-Up.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.420
Clearly these are
powerful creatures.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.520
Panda mommies will only
ovulate once in a year.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.560
So they're only
fertile two or three

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.480
days out of every single year.

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.320
And so, realistically, she'll
probably only give birth

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.580
every other year.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.750
And pandas have a very,
very poor reproduction rate.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.760
But what's even sadder
is that she'll maybe

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.007
have one to two cubs at
a time every other year,

00:02:35.007 --> 00:02:36.590
and then she'll just
leave one of them

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:38.590
to die if they
happen to be twins,

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.860
because she can't take
care of both of them.

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.630
This is so sad!

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.104
And as if that wasn't bad
enough, more than half

00:02:46.104 --> 00:02:49.220
of newborn pandas
die from diseases

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.575
or from being accidentally
crushed by a mommy.

00:02:52.575 --> 00:02:55.184
Pandas are cute, but man,
they're [BLEEP] parents.

00:02:55.184 --> 00:02:57.725
Thank you so much for watching
"Weird, Gross, and Beautiful."

00:02:57.725 --> 00:02:58.640
My name is Catie Wayne.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.014

like to, you can

00:03:00.014 --> 00:03:01.840

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.080
me know animal you would
like me to cover next.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:06.670
This week's episode
was suggested by Jade,

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.090
so thank you so
much, sweetheart.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:11.792

these videos over here.

00:03:11.792 --> 00:03:13.750

video, you could share it,

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.480
because that would be
super helpful to me.

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.825
Oh my gosh.

00:03:17.825 --> 00:03:18.775
I love you all.

00:03:18.775 --> 00:03:19.900
And I'll see you next time.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.625
Bye.
