I think nutrition makes a massive difference when you're training regularly. Its just not about that session, you need to be also thinking about the session you're doing in four days time.

00:00:18.501 --> 00:00:29.500
I've learnt to use nutrition products better, its definitely helped me to train a bit harder, both in terms of fuelling the outing and recovering from it.

00:00:30.501 --> 00:00:39.500
The big guys are probably taking on 6,000 calories a day and you can do that in three meals but you need to be snacking and fuelling yourself during the session.

00:00:39.501 --> 00:00:47.500
Its important that they go out and start a training session very well fuelled and to make sure you keep on top of your nutrition within a session.

00:00:47.501 --> 00:00:53.500
Take out lots of carbohydrate rich drinks and gels while your rowing and while you're training.

00:00:54.501 --> 00:01:05.500
Science in Sport is crucial to us, our guys are always going out with one or two bottles of the carbohydrate drink and they get through the gels as well for a short term energy hit to get them through long endurance sessions.

00:01:06.501 --> 00:01:20.500
After your training session there is a short window to get in as much replenishment as possible. They hit the REGO to replenish carbs and protein quickly to start repairing the muscle damage.

00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:26.500
Around the weights they use REGO Rapids to build bigger muscles because they need to be very strong and powerful.

00:01:27.501 --> 00:01:32.500
Its the little things that make the big difference in performance and nutrition is clearly one of them.

00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:42.500
You've got to get it right, its like putting fuel in your car Ã± if you don't put any fuel in your car it wont go anywhere. 

00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:51.500
Part of my ritual before a race is to get the caffeine gels in and certain times. I do it an hour before the race, then again half an hour before the race.

00:01:52.501 --> 00:02:03.500
Eat a balanced diet, maintain your weight at a healthy level and eat as close to training as sensible so you can absorb the food in a good state. 

00:02:05.501 --> 00:02:12.500
We would always have our REGO recovery fuel after a water session. It plays a big part in our land and weights training. 

00:02:14.501 --> 00:02:21.500
We also use Rapid as it helps us recover and push on during the weight session. Its definitely one of the biggest differences in the last few years with our team.

00:02:22.501 --> 00:02:35.500
Its about keeping standards high and that is why we will always use products before we get going, while we're going and after we've been going and there all slightly different products and they are crucial to keep us at the level we are at.
