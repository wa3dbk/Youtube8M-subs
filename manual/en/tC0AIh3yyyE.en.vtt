Everyday you post pictures, updates and things
that are important to you, on Facebook. If

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.910
you think about it, you’re basically writing
the story of your life as you go. Now how

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.530
cool would it be if you could keep a copy
for yourself? Actually, you can. Just log

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.500
into Facebook, click settings, and look for
the option to download a copy of your Facebook

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.980
data. This way you’ll have an interactive
copy of all your pictures, videos, messages

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.090
and posts, saved right to your computer.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.920
Thinking outside the box a little can get
you some really amazing deals. For example,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.420
the next time you go buy something on eBay,
try searching for spelling mistakes on the

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.230
items you’re looking for. Listings like these,
aren’t going to be found by very many people,

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.540
so they’re less likely to get bid up in
price. So get in the habit of searching misspelled

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.240
words, and see what kind of savings you can
score.

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.790
There’s a fast and easy way to save online
receipts, pictures, and basically anything

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.050
else that pops up on your computer screen.
It’s called screen capping and it’s unbelievably

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:57.770
quick and easy to do. If you’re on a Mac,
hold shift, command, and the number 4, then

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.489
select the area on the screen you want to
save. As soon as you let go, you’ll have

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.819
an instant picture saved to your desktop.
Now if you’re using a PC, just press the

00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:09.340
“PrtScn” button to copy the screen to
the clipboard, then go ahead and paste the

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:11.619
image into a program like windows paint.

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:15.729
We’re halfway through the web tricks now,
so let’s take a quick break and tell Google

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.799
to “do a barrel roll”. Surprisingly, you
can see it really does.

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.499
Hundreds of people are using public computers
every day, and if you’re in a situation

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:27.929
where you have to use one, it’s really important
to protect yourself. One of the simplest things

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.969
you can do is called private browsing. Almost
all modern browsers have a feature for private

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:37.859
browsing or "incognito mode", which basically
means, nothing will be saved from your online

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:42.100
session. When you’re done, close the browser,
and now there won’t be any history, or anything

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.500
else about you for the next person to find.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.189
Did you know there’s a way to record your
computer screen and make it into a video?

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.359
Just open up "QuickTime", and select "New Screen
Recording". You can select which microphone

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:57.729
you want to use, and hit record, and now whatever
you see on your screen next will be made into

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.009
a video. This way you can make gaming tutorials,
record special highlights, or do video commentaries,

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:07.450
and, of course, upload them to share your
perspective with the world.

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.939
YouTube is the second largest search engine
in the world, so here are a few tricks to

00:02:10.939 --> 00:02:15.459
make it work better for you. First of all,
click the gear icon beside the “Subscribed”

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:19.400
button and select “Send me updates”. Try
it with mine right now, and you’ll get an

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.629
email notification the next time I upload
a video. Now you’ll never miss an upload

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:27.970
again. Secondly, if you don’t like the closed
captioning on videos like this, you can click

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.349
the text and drag it off the video, or you
can even turn it off altogether by clicking

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:37.980
the "cc" button and selecting “off”. And
finally, when you’re trying to load a video

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.650
and it’s gets stuck buffering, just press
the down arrow on your keyboard to turn the

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:46.900
dots into a game of snake. This will help
keep you occupied until your video loads up.

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.090
Well there are 6 simple tricks you can start
using right now, that will help save you time,

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:54.760
