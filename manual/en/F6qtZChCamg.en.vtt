00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:08.710
Hey guys, what's up!

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.830
Today I am going to show you how you can install
the latest Roboto fonts that, apparently,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.299
leaked from Android 4.3.

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:25.650
First you go into recovery mode by pushing
volume down and power rocker together and

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.600
hold it tight.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:36.160
Okay, recovery mode.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:43.579
Now you just simply go to "install zip from
sdcard", choose zip from sdcard...

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:58.260
0 ... and just navigate to the file which
is called Roboto_Condensed 4.3.zip and simply

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.430
install it.

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.930
As you can see it didn't take long at all.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:17.240
Reboot system now, and just wait.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:32.620
Alright, here we are!

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:38.450
We should have the new font, yes, I can see
that!

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:46.380
The font is much more narrower and is certainly
different.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:53.870
This is the first time I see it myself so
I am not sure if it is any better than the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:54.870
stock font.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.270
You will have to check it out yourself.

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:05.390
I will also post a before and after screenshots
from the settings.

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.000
Give it a try and see if it if you like it
or not.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:21.540
Please write in the comments section below
whether you like it or not, actually!

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.059
Thank you for watching and see you next time!
