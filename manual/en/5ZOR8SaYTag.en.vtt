00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.220
Before I came here I have never been to Cologne before..

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.660
So, what my friends told me about Cologne, the night experience, how the people are very welcoming...

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.260
...that was one reason why I chose Cologne to study.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.280
I think it’s the most significant attraction for me in Cologne.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:29.640
If you go out at midnight you can still see some people.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.560
They are walking, they are talking 
and you feel that still the city is alive.

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.680
It’s not a dead city. You know, so it’s like very important for me.

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.640
I think that the unique thing for me in Cologne are the people and not really the city.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:51.320
But also, of course, the people are connected to the city, but mostly is the people.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.420
So many unique people are in the same place...

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.080
...at the same time, and I had the luck to get to know them in such short period of time.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.680
To be new in a city is always about adapting yourself.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.160
And I think it’s the case not only in Cologne, but everywhere.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.600
But maybe Cologne is a nice city to… like… it’s not that hard to adapt, since...

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.020
... it’s like the people are really open, and they are very helpful...

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.140
...and if you have a problem there is actually no problem.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:34.300
The one thing that I enjoy here is that it’s really somehow like multinational.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.520
Your friends are from almost everywhere in the world.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.000
We have a lot of different students, different backgrounds, different nationalities

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:49.180
and different cultures all in Cologne that could easily come into play.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.860
That is something that I think the city has really done well

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:59.260
in terms of integrating foreign nationals into the system.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.540
The city has this “homey feeling” to it.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:12.520
It’s like if you wake up or you hang out in your dorms or in your room in pyjamas

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.780
and you can like go outside and talk to people in your pyjamas and you feel very “comfy”.

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.800
And that’s  how I feel in Köln.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.080
I would walk around in pyjamas, and everywhere is my home.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.540
I guess it’s more a city that you learn to like or to love.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:39.580
And it’s pretty more because of the life that it’s in it that you enjoy it.
