Southern New
Hampshire University

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.380
is proud to be one
of the first colleges

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.600
to offer an environmental
science degree online.

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.490
The program is
ideal for students

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.000
who are passionate about
environmental protection

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.400
and conservation.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.810
As organizations
seek to continue

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:23.450
to minimize their
environmental footprint,

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:25.890
the demand for
environmental scientists

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.970
is going to grow at
a rate much faster

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.275
than many other professions.

00:00:30.275 --> 00:00:31.650
Southern New
Hampshire University

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.830
is a fully accredited,
private, nonprofit institution.

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.960
From day one, students will be
supported by dedicated advisers

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.100
and faculty with real-world
experience in the field

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.250
of environmental science.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:47.740
This unique, affordable
program gives students

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:51.920
a strong foundation in
natural and physical sciences,

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.490
with a focus on natural
resources and conservation.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.780
And the flexibility
allows the students

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.700
to complete their coursework
anytime, anywhere.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.660
Students will gain
hands-on lab experience

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.020
by using the tools and
equipment provided to them,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.990
and the custom lab kits that
are shipped to their home.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.080
For example, students
do a lab exercise

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:17.500
that requires them to
perform a water quality test.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.220
They can collect and test water
from samples in the field,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.030
or they can simulate certain
environmental factors

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:24.660
without leaving home.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.460
We also provide an instructional
lab book and online videos

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.570
to help walk students
through the labs.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.060
Students that go through this
particular degree program

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.620
will have the opportunity to
be environmental scientists,

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.060
researchers, analysts, work in
the field of natural resources.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.200
The possibilities
are just endless.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.740
At Southern New
Hampshire University

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.870
we are committed
to student success.

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:51.410
We'll make sure that they have
the tools and the resources

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.170
that they need to be successful,
no matter what, no matter

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.790
when, we will be there
to support their success

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.080
in any way that we can.
