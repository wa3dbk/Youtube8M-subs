00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:05.150
Whoa! There it goes!

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.810
Okay, here we have a test apparatus, with a 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.900
vacuum chamber, here, and we've got a hand pump, 

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.990
hooked up to that. Inside the chamber, is a 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.100
standard plasma globe, Plasma Ball.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:42.230
We'll zoom in...Okay,

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.370
we've got the Plasma Ball inside of the vacuum

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:50.530
container, here, and we're taking the vacuum down...

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.740
As you can see, our hose goes underneath, and

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.930
there it is, being pumped

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.120
by a loyal helper here...

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.290
a loyal lab technician, and...

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.490
Opps! There it goes! Not even twenty. Just caught it.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:15.660
It's got a slight glow left, but it, basically the bulb is

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.850
out, at this point. It is completely out now.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.890
So, we have a question whether the

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:27.950
Plasma Ball is draining the batteries

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.010
more than usual now, or less than usual, 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.090
or maybe it's even charging the batteries! hehe

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:40.130
Hey, wouldn't that be cool....

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.290
Okay, further experiments

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.450
with our Plasma Ball. We have a magnet

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.510
on the top. It's a ring magnet, with North-South

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.690
orientated that way on the magnet, instead of North-South

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.880
this way. So, we're just going to set that on top,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.060
very dangerously, and then we're going

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:13.250
to put the vacuum chamber on top

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.420
and take it down and see what happens...

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:21.600
So far, everything is about the same as when we began...

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.790
How many inches of mercury do we have there?

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.810
19. 19, last time

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.860
we got an effect at 22, I think it was...

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.880
where the entire Plasma Ball shut down.

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.940
Oh! And it just did the same thing!

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.980
Wow, look at that! At 20, 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.020
So, at 20, it cut out the Plasma Ball. We're still amazed by this phenomenon.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.200
Even when you touch close to it, it doesn't ..."See the middle is glowing."

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.290
Oh, yeah, it is glowing a little bit. That's at 19.

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:02.400
19, got the middle glowing slightly. Ah, did we kill it already?

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.540
Oh, it's starting to come back a little bit. 15

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.730
15, eh? Oh, there it's back!

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.790
Pretty much normal there now, at how much? 13

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.840
13. If we take it back up to 15, you'd think it would

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.010
cut out? 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.200
(speeded up)

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.370
We're at 21.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.540
21. Whoops, there it goes, it just disappeared!

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.730
Haha! Isn't that something?

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.910
At 21, that's about where it was before, and it just cut right out.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.950
And stopped working.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.010
That is a very strange 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.060
phenomenon! We have a dead Plasma Ball!

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:00.100
Well, let's see if we can bring it back to life...

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.250
There it goes. So, we're at

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:12.360
what is that? 15? 15 this time, instead of 13 last time

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:16.480
so, it's around a 5 inches

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.610
of mercury range, where this Plasma Ball

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.770
cuts out, and then it won't cut back in again,

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.860
until it drops down by 5 inches of mercury...

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.150
Okay, we are at 20 inches of mercury,

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:41.340
now, and still have a pretty good arc about like

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.530
it was originally, 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.040
This hand pumping is...

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:06.230
just not the way to go for efficiency! haha!

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:10.410
But, boy, are we building up our forearms!

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:14.590
21 yet?

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.780
"No....22!" Oh, wow...

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.970
So, it's staying at...Oh, it just went out! Look at that!

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:27.160
Just like a switch, bingo, gone!

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:31.340
My assistant is a little out of breath in this experiment! He is breathless! haha!

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.540
It is rather breath-taking, actually, to see this

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.720
Plasma Globe just instantly go out...

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.750
at how much? It was 22, 23? "22, yeah."

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.810
At 22 inches of mercury...Oh, it just came back! "Really?"

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:51.870
"It's still at 22!" Oh my God, that is 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:55.950
so bizarre. 

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.040
"I guess that means more pumping!" That's your cue...I'm holding

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.170
the camera! haha!

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:08.330
Oh, there it goes..."22 and a half now"

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:12.490
We have a theory that it has to do with the

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.540
capacitance of the air around the 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.730
globe , that is, the Plasma Globe, not the World globe,

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.910
would tend to

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:29.090
make the plasma work, so if we take away the air, the plasma no longer

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:33.300
has a place to flow to. But, then we put this tinfoil in, 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.480
touching the metal down below here, the metal fitting, 

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:41.660
where the tinfoil is connected...nothing, nada. She's dead in the water. 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.700
"That's the furthest I can get I'm afraid." Well, it's not doing anything different

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:49.910
and I don't think it will. It just doesn't want to work!

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:06.050
(Mystery revealed in part 2)
