00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.470
If you need to sharpen your plane blades or
chisels, you may first need to grind them.

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.080
Now you will only grind them if they're chipped
or out of square.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.420
Then will sharpen them on your sharpening
stones.

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.090
Now we have a stone that has a coarse side
and a smooth side.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.779
You will sharpen it on the coarse side first
and then the smooth side.

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:31.940
We have oil stones and water stones for sharpening.

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.420
I'm going to use an oil stone.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.940
An oil stone requires a light oil on the surface
of the stone to float the metal particles

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.300
out of the surface and you clean it down with
a cloth when you're finished.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:47.950
It is important to sharpen at the correct
angle.

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:53.440
That's difficult to do by hand, but fortunately
we have a honing guide to allow you to get

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.809
the correct angle every time.

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.470
Honing simply means sharpening the chisel.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:08.420
Position the blade on the 30 degree gauge
mark and lock the chisel onto the honing guide.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:18.870
We'll oil the full surface of the stone and
when you're honing apply even pressure and

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:28.430
use the full surface of the stone, so that
you get even wear over your entire stone.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:35.570
Once you've finished a few strokes on the
coarse side, turn your stone over and hone

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:39.939
the chisel on the fine side to give it a fine
finish.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:47.450
Apply some oil to the fine side and finish
hone using the guide.

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.330
Honing leaves a small burr on the flat side
of the chisel.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:59.890
Remove it from the guide, turn it over, and
use it flat, just a few strokes to remove

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:01.740
the burr.

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.750
Your chisel is now ready to use.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.060
