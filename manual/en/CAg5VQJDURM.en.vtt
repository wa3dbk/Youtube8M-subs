00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:31.460
I had six months of chemo-therapy,
started in May, ended in November of 2013.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.399
And… I’d have to say the hardest part was

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.059
initially being diagnosed.

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:41.870
Because I lost both of my parent to cancer

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.149
at a young age, so that was really hard for me.

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.020
I have two kids. I had to pull through for them.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.809
We’re at Eastern State Penitentiary today
for our photo shoot with the Profoto B2.

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.590
And I’m really excited because this light
has allowed me to work faster at weddings

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.710
than any other light that I’ve ever used.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.490
I keep it in TTL mode, I have
my lighting assistant hold it up

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.580
and we get wonderful images of brides and grooms.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.590
Today we’re gonna be using that same 
light to capture photos of our model.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:20.069
Look back at me… that’s good.

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.469
Yeah, get a little cocky!

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:33.500
Eastern State Penitentiary is
several degrees below freezing.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:37.020
We’re using TTL, the modeling light and the fact

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.390
that we don’t have to put the light on C-stands

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.920
to keep this shoot rolling.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.500
Bring your hands forward like you did.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:50.469
The Profoto B2 is clearly a game changer that
has allowed me to work faster than any other

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:53.259
off-camera flash system that I’ve ever used.

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.300
Breaking free from it just meant, you know,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.799
I’m done. I’m free.

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.239
I don’t have to lay around
and feel sorry for myself

00:02:07.239 --> 00:02:09.739
or any of those things any more.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.150
I believe that photos have the power to heal.

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:30.289
I’ve personally experienced how photo shoots
with cancer survivors can change their outlook.

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:42.820
Even though the port remains in
her body as a reminder and a scar,

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:47.320
Cherish is one year cancer-free and
I think that’s something to celebrate.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.410
In some ways some good things came out of it.

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.329
I appreciate life a lot more.

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:03.430
I can play with my kids, I can enjoy my life.

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.930
And… I feel like a lot stronger.
