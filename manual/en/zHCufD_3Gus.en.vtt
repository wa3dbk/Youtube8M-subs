00:00:16.915 --> 00:00:18.999
Once the kingdom had come to know and love me

00:00:18.999 --> 00:00:22.298
Drupad decided it was time for me to wed.

00:00:23.959 --> 00:00:25.879
He declared a great swayamvar

00:00:25.879 --> 00:00:30.396
where suitors from many lands came to win my hand and make me theirs.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.678
But the truth is the task my father had set

00:00:35.277 --> 00:00:40.998
the quest my suitors had to accomplish to 
 win my hand, was of such difficulty

00:00:40.998 --> 00:00:44.158
That there was only one with the skill to win me

00:00:58.383 --> 00:01:02.259
Prince Arjuna. He'd vanquished my father in battle

00:01:02.259 --> 00:01:06.358
and now he had come, disguised as a monk, to take away his daughter.

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:15.478
I had been built to hate him

00:01:16.197 --> 00:01:19.063
But perhaps there were higher powers at play, I did not know

00:01:19.063 --> 00:01:22.998
I knew only this: I wanted him.

00:01:25.511 --> 00:01:31.549
Our eyes met across rows of failed suitors, as 
 one by one they failed the test

00:01:32.516 --> 00:01:38.637
I waited anxiously, not even noticing the many princes 
 as they broke in tears before me

00:01:39.799 --> 00:01:43.390
But the road to victory is never free of obstacles

00:01:45.398 --> 00:01:47.270
I'd never seen such skill.

00:01:47.841 --> 00:01:54.840
The strangerâ€™s wolfish eyes told me he thought me 
 a prize already won. But who was he?

00:01:55.354 --> 00:01:56.440
Karna, they said. 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.460
Sworn brother to the snake-prince Duryodhana. A warrior 
 whose eyes burned with a cold fury.

00:02:12.864 --> 00:02:15.840
And then they told me his father was a charioteer. 

00:02:16.877 --> 00:02:20.800
A low-born upstart, aspiring to the hand of Draupadi?

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:27.160
Wait!

00:02:27.997 --> 00:02:30.540
Yet even as the great hall fell into silence 

00:02:30.544 --> 00:02:35.240
and I could hear my next words before 
 I spoke them, doubt filled my mind.

00:02:36.249 --> 00:02:40.200
What if this hard-eyed stranger was my doorway to escape? 

00:02:40.756 --> 00:02:42.480
To a different life? 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.040
Was I no more than an instrument of my father's revenge? 

00:02:46.798 --> 00:02:51.200
Was I just some prize? What if I let him try?
