00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.250
Today on this 2002 Honda Civic, we are going
to be installing part number 24706 from Draw-Tite.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.510
And this also applies to Hidden Hitch part
number 60867.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.910
OK, the first thing that I am going to do
is go ahead and show you the mounting locations

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:13.910
for our hitch.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.350
It is going to be the existing hole right
here and it is going to be the same on both

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.350
sides.

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:20.350
We are also going to mount here to the tow
loop.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:25.740
Now, in order to put our hitch up, we are
actually going to have to fish wire our carriage

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.970
bolt and block through this existing hole
here.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.060
But, it is not wide enough so we are actually
going to have to make it a little wider so

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:32.620
our parts can fit through.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.030
We are just going to use a hammer and a chisel.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:38.350
We are just going to check and see if our
block fits through.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.080
And it seems like it does so that is a good
sign.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.210
0:41
Now, in order to take our carriage bolt and

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.960
block and put it into position, we are actually
going to have to use what we call a bolt leader.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:48.000
And we actually sell those.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.830
And it is part number 80101-1.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.800
Now all we are going to do is we are going
to go ahead and stick it through the hole

00:00:54.800 --> 00:01:00.570
that we are putting our bolt and carriage
block into.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:14.360
We are going to pull it through like that.

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:31.030
Then we are going to go ahead and put our
block on there and then thread our carriage

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:42.260
bolt 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:53.000
on there.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:09.039
It is just going to come out, pull it out
of the hole just like that.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:19.909
We are also going to do that for the remaining
hole on the passenger side.

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:21.839
