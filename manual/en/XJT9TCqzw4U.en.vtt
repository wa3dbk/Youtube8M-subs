&gt;&gt; What if there were a way to know which
images, headlines, and website copy are most

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:10.969
effective at getting visitors to convert?
Instead of losing visitors shortly after they've

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.209
entered your site, what if you could find
the magic words and images that enticed them

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:21.580
to stay and become customers?
Google Website Optimizer is a free mutli-variate

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.240
testing tool from Google that helps you do
just that.

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.540
It eliminates guesswork from website design,
because you can test variations of your web

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.619
pages.
Here's how it works.

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.129
You choose the page you want to test and the
conversion goal.

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.879
The goal could be someone clicking through
to an important page on your site-- for example,

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.929
the receipt page after a sale.
The goal could also be submitting a form or

00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.219
spending a certain amount of time on a test
page.

00:00:48.219 --> 00:00:53.269
Next, provide alternate content.
You might try different variations of headlines,

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:59.280
images, or text, even large-scale design or
layout variations.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.549
Website Optimizer does the rest.
As traffic arrives at your site, Website Optimizer

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:08.980
works in the background, dividing visitors
into different groups, and presenting each

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:14.010
group with a unique page variation.
As it tracks how each group interacts with

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:19.790
your site, Website Optimizer figures out which
pages-- and even which elements on a page--

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:23.650
are most effective at producing the outcome
you're looking for.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:29.430
You can run simple A-B tests that compare
just two or three pages, or you can run complex

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.360
multi-variate experiments that test dozens
of headlines, images, copy, and design combinations

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.580
simultaneously.
It's easy to set up, and once you have some

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.030
alternate content, you can launch a simple
test in under five minutes.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.890
All you need is a web browser and website
to begin testing.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.370
