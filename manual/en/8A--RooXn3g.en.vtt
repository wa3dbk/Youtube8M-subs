Hey all, thanks for watching my Panasonic
TX-L65WT600 review. Panasonic has introduced

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:25.689
the world the first ever ultra high-definition
TV with HDMI 2.0 support.

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:34.349
The Panasonic TX-L65WT600 review is great for gamers,
too. The standard Display Port 1.2a is supported

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:44.320
by Nvidia, so you can play your 60 frame per
second Ultra HD games. Non-gamers connect

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:52.530
their mobile device and display their photos,
videos and webpages on screen.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:59.530
The Panasonic TX-L65WT600 is the first in
the company's Viera WT600 line of 4,000 pixel

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:09.309
resolution TV which will be compatible with
the HDMI 2.0 standard. The 65 inch screen

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:18.189
has four times the resolution of the regular
full HDTVs. Some are saying that it's just

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:25.350
like looking out a window.
With the Panasonic TX-L65WT600, you can connect

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:33.399
it to a computer and use it as a monitor.
There's a pop up webcam at the top so the

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:39.780
whole family can sit on the sofa and chat
with a faraway friend or relative.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.780
That's the Panasonic TX-L65WT600 review in
a nutshell. For pricing and up to date information,
