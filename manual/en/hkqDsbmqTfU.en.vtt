00:00:10.609 --> 00:00:15.439
So here i used a white polish as my background.

00:00:15.439 --> 00:00:20.489
and then i grabbed my black striper polish and made 2 parallel lines right down the center of my nail.

00:00:20.489 --> 00:00:24.769
Make sure you leave space between the parallel lines because your going to need that space to work with.

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.169
also you want to take it down to the edge of your nail its going to make your manicure last longer.

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:29.959
Then grab your white striper polish and make 3 stripes across those parallel stripes

00:00:29.959 --> 00:00:33.760
Now your going to get your black striper polish again and your going to make lines on the opposite sides of the squares

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.770
and at the corners again your going to make 2 lines and then just fill those in like little triangles.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.330
I cant explain it well that well but yea

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:40.510
go ahead with your top coat

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.930
i can explain it well but yea go ahead
with your top coat

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:56.980
next

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:03.710
uh... I used a white OPI Polish again

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.300
and i wanted to use this polish from OPI and this is something about Emerald City i dont know its really pretty so i decided to use it

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.780
so here I used 2 coats and to add extra little shimmers on it just grab a toothpick

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.740
and take those out of the polish

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.930
So i grabbed my black striper polish again made an upside down triangle
pieces

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:22.440
and im just filling that in and thats just

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.479
going to be like his jacket his white jacket inspired me

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.060
so yea just filling that in

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.700
and then when your done with that

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.710
just go ahead and and put a top coat over that.
And then if you want to be done there then you can be done there.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.570
so here im just using my makeup brush

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:44.759
and i made 2 small dots for his glasses

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.400
and a toothpick to make

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.120
like the rest of his glasses.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.100
Then again with the toothpick or the back of a

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.990
old earring that i had i made little white dots
around the glasses

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.399
So using this Essie polish in peach daiquiri

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.130
i'm using that to make PSY

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.269
P S and Y

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:16.009
so after that um go ahead and dip that in your yellow nail polish and just make dots

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:18.810
around the PSY and then your good to go

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.429
