[music]

00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:03.010
Hello, I'm Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.010
[pause]

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.950
And welcome to DermTV.

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.019
Some skincare products cause different sensations
like tingling,

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:14.830
stinging or even burning when you put them
on your skin.

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.009
So when are those unpleasant sensations ok?

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.769
More importantly, when do they mean that that
skincare product

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:23.880
just isn’t for your skin?

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.660
First, let’s distinguish between tingling,
stinging and burning.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.619
I use tingling to describe what you feel when
right after

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.570
applying your product, it causes a sensation
of heat or tiny pins,

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.570
like prickling.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.520
But it’s slight and temporary.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.370
Yes It catches your attention, but it doesn’t
feel scary

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:45.030
because it doesn't build up or become stronger.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.090
It stays the same

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:50.350
intensity and stops by itself in about a minute.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.109
This tingling is nothing to worry about

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:55.989
and probably means that the product is ok
for your skin.

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.220
But it’s very different than stinging and
burning.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:02.170
While stinging and burning aren’t the same,
both are signs

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:06.460
that the product is probably going to irritate
or possibly harm your skin,

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.170
and you should rinse it off immediately.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:12.320
While I would say that with stinging, pins
or prickling

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.520
is greater than the heat, and with a burning
sensation

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.820
it’s the opposite, both stinging and burning
start almost immediately,

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.180
increase very quickly, even over a period
of seconds,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.520
and they accelerate so fast that they frighten
you.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.450
This is when your good common sense tells
you

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.479
something is wrong, and if you don’t wash
off your products,

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.700
they can even become painful.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.420
Obviously, that skincare product is not good
for your skin.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.490
Now note how I used the word “probably”

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:41.750
several times in this episode.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.329
That’s because, there’s no way

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.710
for me to be 100% sure that you’re actually
feeling

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.939
a tingling vs burning or stinging.

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:49.939
It’s always better

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:52.240
to be safe than sorry but the guidelines above

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.399
should certainly help.

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:56.200
So when it comes to unpleasant sensations

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.060
from skincare products, while temporary tingling
is usually ok,

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:16.299
there’s NO truth in the saying, “No pain,
no gain!”
