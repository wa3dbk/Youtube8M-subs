Hey guys, Jess here, and welcome to MInecraft
Builds of the Week, where we bring you the

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.000
best, most creative, and most interesting
Minecraft Builds we saw each week - stick

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.800
around to the end to see some awesome Harry
Potter-themed builds!

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:28.550
First up, since horses are coming in 1.6 (whenever
that finally gets released), Keralis did a

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.550
Let's Build Stables tutorial.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.160
The stables are gonna have to be empty for
now, but they look good at least.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:41.540
Or maybe you could put some pigs or chickens
in there instead - anyway, click the link

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:49.370
in the description to watch the full build
tutorial.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.489
Next, another build by Keralis - and once
again he did it in a "let's build" format

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.059
so you can follow along, but this one's the
latest in his series of Modern Houses.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:08.700
Once again, we'll link the full video in the
description in case you wanna build it too.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.600
Third, this one's definitely super impressive
- FyreUK built a huge region they call "the

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.160
Land of Akane" - it's a Japanese-inspired
area consisting of a city, villages, temples,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.280
shrines, and more - the 14-minute timelapse
consists of 25 hours of footage recorded over

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:35.750
7 days, and over 50 people participated in
building the region!

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:46.000
Finally, and this one's my personal favorite,
since I'm a Harry Potter nerd - a group of

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.110
friends who call themselves The Crew had a
Harry Potter-themed build session.

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.670
They made giant versions of Harry, Ron, Hermione,
and noteworthy scenes from the books like

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.740
Sirius Black's death.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:06.980
And those were our favorite builds from the
week - again, I liked the Harry Potter one

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.369
the best, but how about you guys?

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.690
Which build was your favorte?

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.090
Comment and let me know!

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.920
And remember, you can click the links in the
video description to view the full videos

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.890
on the creators' channels, and if you see
a really cool build you want us to showcase

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.670
next week, be sure to tweet me the link @JessBrohard.

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.670
THanks for watching!

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.200
Enjoy the game.
