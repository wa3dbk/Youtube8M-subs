Hi and welcome to another review!

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Today we'll be having a look at DC Direct "Blackest Night" Hal Jordan, which is part of series 6!

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This figure has been released in 2010 and it's 7" scaled, it's about 7 inches tall!

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.500
Let's take a look at the packaging!

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
A very nice clamshell with the Blackest Night logo on top.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
On the bottom, the Green Lantern logo.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:43.000
On the back, the other figures available in series 6 with the respective read-up...

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
...or bio, if you prefer.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
And, here, the other figures available in the other series, series 1, 2 etc etc 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Let's take a closer look!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
The figure is really well sculpted. Specially the head!

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Check out the hair! Very nicely sculpted and painted!

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
I really like the black line around his eyes. I think it gives the face a lot of expressivity.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:47.000
But the really impressive thing is the skin texture on the face. It's not painted, I believe it's the actual plastic that has this nice pink color. And that gives the figure a much more realistic look compared with the traditional painting!

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Let's take a look at the body as well.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:10.000
A very muscular body, very defined! I like this aspect because it looks like the costume is a  second skin. It doesn't look like an actual costume, but more of an energy costume. Like in the movie! I really like that concept!

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000
Very nice tha shade of green DC Direct chose for this figure. I don't know if you agree with me, but it looks very "alien" in my opinion.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.500
Very nice the pearl white for the gloves as well!

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Let's take a look at the ring!

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
No details here. I think they could have done better here.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:53.000
A very nice looking figure. Specially the head, I think the head alone makes the entire figure! Really amazing work!

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Articulation wise. Head is on a ball joint. Arms can fully rotate and move in and out.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Rotation at the upper bicep, single jointed elbows. Full rotation at the hands.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Nothing on the torso and waist. Legs can move forward, but not back because of the sculpt of Hal Jordan's butt.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Single jointed knees with a very limited range of motion. And full rotation at the boots.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:43.000
As for the accessories, Hal Jordan comes with this base. Very nice, translucent, with the Green Lantern logo.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:04:08.000
And then, the lantern, the battery to charge the ring. Check out this nice touch by DC Direct: they put translucent plastic in the core of the lantern, on both sides. Very nice!

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:31.000
It can be put into Hal Jordan's left hand and I suggest you to make it like this: detach the handle, insert it into the hand and then put the lantern back, on the handle.

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:04.000
I strongly recommend this figure! Even though articulation is limited, sculpt, painting and accessories make it a must-have for any Green Lantern and DC fan!

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:15.000
You can find it on ebay, it's not particularly rare. I bought mine on ebay from USA and I paid about 17 euro (about 22 USD) shipped for it!

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:23.000
If I must suggest a price range, I would say: from 15 to 20 euro (18-25 USD), including shipping obviously.

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.500
That being said, I'll see you on the next video! BYE!
