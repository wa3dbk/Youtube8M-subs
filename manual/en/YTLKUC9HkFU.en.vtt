Hello and welcome to the first in this 
series of programs called 
Safety Checks - Safety Skills.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The show is for learner drivers and supervisors 
alike and in each episode you'll find 
some practical tips and advice to 
help you stay safe on the road.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
To help us with these skills and checks 
is Brian Everitt from RACQ Driver Education,
 Hello Brian

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Hello Jess

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
So Brian, I guess when you're learning 
you really want to just get in the car 
and go.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Can you talk us through why we need 
to do a safety checks before 
we even begin?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Sure Jess. Learning to drive is exciting.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
You feel like you just want to jump in 
the car and start driving. 
But that's not the way to go.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
If you've ever watched a plane 
being prepared for take off, you'll 
have seen the crew go through 
a whole series of safety checks.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
I guess they can't afford for anything 
to go wrong.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Exactly - and it's the same when you're driving.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
You need to be certain your vehicle 
is in good condition before you go out 
on the road.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
So this is the pre-vehicle safety check 
you need to do before you drive.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
First up we check we have L-plates 
clearly displayed front and back.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Check you have legible number plates 
and a current registration label.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Now Jess make sure your hand brake's on

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
and then turn the key till the ignition 
lights on the dashboard come on. 
But don't start your engine.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Okay.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.000
Now we'd like to check the right indicator.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Left indicator. Excellent.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
We're working our way around and 
checking that the headlights, tail lights, number plate light, stop lights and 
indicators are in working order.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And while you're moving round the car -
check your tyres are correctly inflated 
and that you have at least 1.5mm 
of tread.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
And this is what you're looking for

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000
The tread wear indicator... if it's exposed 
the tyre is not legal.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
Check the windscreen is not cracked 
and that the windscreen and windows 
are clean enough so they don't 
restrict visibility.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Check the horn works and is clearly audible.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Your doors should all be operational 
from inside and out. And instrument 
gauges like your speedometer - should 
all be in good working order.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Remember though every vehicle you 
get into can have the instruments 
and controls in a different position.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.000
You need to be able to reach controls 
like your hazard light switch, instantly.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So every time you get into a vehicle, 
familiarise yourself with the layout 
of the dashboard.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
And it's also a good idea to check your fuel.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
We're good.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
That's a wrap.
