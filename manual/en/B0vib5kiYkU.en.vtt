00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.500
Every morning, you see your reflection in the mirror.

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:09.480
Every summer, your friend looks squiggly in the bottom of the pool.

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.840
But how can we use this to make invisibility cloaks?

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.740
Boo.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:16.420
What?!

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:18.660
Or explain the shiny wings of a butterfly?

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:24.280
The answer is 'photonics',

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.200
which is all the crazy ways to mess with light!

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.500
Crazy way number one: bouncing

00:00:36.098 --> 00:00:38.098
Take a look at yourself in a mirror - 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.080
you probably do this often enough, but do it again anyway.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:43.820
What do you see?

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:47.960
It's yourself, of course, but have you ever wondered WHY this happens?

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.697
You may have heard that light travels like a wave,

00:00:51.697 --> 00:00:53.377
sort of like these water waves.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.920
The water ripples have high parts and low parts that travel out

00:00:56.920 --> 00:00:59.240
and if they hit a wall, they bounce right back.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.260
That's the same sort of thing going on with the mirror -

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.260
light coming from your cell phone is hitting your face and bouncing off of it.

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.900
This bouncing is called 'reflection'.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.280
A lot of that reflected light bounces off the mirror and goes into your eyes.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.880
Crazy way number two: bending

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.720
Now let's look at this pencil underwater -

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:22.780
why does the part of the pencil that's IN the water

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:25.060
look bent compared to the part ABOVE it?

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.140
Of course, for you to see the pencil at all,

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.140
light needs to reflect off of it.

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:34.320
But it also needs to travel through different materials before it hits your eye.

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:38.280
Light generally takes the fastest path to get between two points,

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.940
and that might always be a straight line.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.980
Light travels slower in water than in air,

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.380
so the fastest path is actually bent.

00:01:46.795 --> 00:01:48.795
It's just like when you travel from your house - 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.180
the shortest path isn't always the fastest.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.600
Like here you could travel the shorter route along slower, smaller roads,

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.620
or you could go a little farther and take the fast highway.

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.740
Light does that too - this bending is called 'refraction'.

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.240
That's why the pencil looked bent in the cup, and your friend looked squiggly in the pool.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.260
Crazy way number three: mixing

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.060
Let's look at water waves, which actually behave pretty similarly to light waves.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.600
I made these waves by dropping to droplets some distance apart.

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:22.340
Each droplet forms a set of waves going out

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.400
and these waves meet and mix with each other.

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:27.529
This mixing is called 'interference'.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.620
At some meeting points, the mixed wave is bigger than each of the original two waves.

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.720
At other meeting points, the two waves cancel each other out.

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.140
We can see the same thing happening with light waves in this experiment,

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.000
where I shine light through two tiny slits with a small separation.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:49.400
Just like with water, there are some parts of light meeting where the mixed light is brighter,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.080
and other parts where the mixed light is darker.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.940
But what does this have to do with invisibility cloaks and butterflies?

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.660
Let's bring these crazy ways to mess with light together.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.380
How could this cloak make someone invisible?

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.200
Let's say this camera is your eye,

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.480
and this green fabric is the cloak we want to make invisible.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.740
You're probably thinking, "Let's make the cloak itself invisible

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.740
so that light would pass through it."

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.960
But if we did that, light would still be able to bounce off what the cloak covers,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.500
pass through the cloak, and get to your eyes.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.720
And that's no good.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.480
What the cloak really needs to do is take light from the opposite side of the camera,

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.680
channel it through the fabric and out the front, unchanged.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.120
No light would bounce off the cloak OR what it covers inside,

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.880
so you would just see what's on the opposite side of the cloak,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.880
kind of like camouflage.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.480
And every other side of the cloak would just channel light to its opposite side,

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:51.620
so none of the light would even get to what's inside the cloak,

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:56.120
and none of the light hitting the cloak would be reflected into the camera lens.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.100
So there'd be nothing to see!

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:01.480
All of this depends on CHANNELING light,

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:02.920
which is not easy.

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:05.140
But, nature can help.

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.280
I'm here with some Morpho butterflies at the Boston Museum of Science.

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.060
Their wings are a super shiny bright blue color.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:16.400
The front of their wings are made of alternating layers of air and chitin,

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.400
and chitin is what lobster shells are made of.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.580
These alternating layers take advantage of how light bounces, bends, and mixes,

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:25.860
to channel the reds, yellows, greens, oranges - 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.697
basically every color of light EXCEPT blue -

00:04:28.697 --> 00:04:30.697
all the way to the back of the wing.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.760
The blues don't get channeled through,

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:36.820
so this is why you see blue on the surface, but no other color.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:41.160
If you could take the color-channeling structures of a butterfly wing

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.860
and weave them together into a fabric,

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.680
you would have a cloak that would be invisible to every color of light except blue.

00:04:49.635 --> 00:04:51.975
If we lived in a world with no blue light,

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:55.660
no blue could ever be reflected, so our cloak would work great!

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.120
But if someone shined a blue light on you and your cloak,

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.120
you would look kind of silly.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:04.120
To work in our world,

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.100
your cloak would have to channel ALL colors, including blue.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:11.860
So how DO you invent a true photonic invisibility cloak?

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.960
Well, any photonic cloak should be possible, right?

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.680
Because you CAN mess with how light bounces, bends, and mixes.

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.460
All right, well, I'M going to invent a photonic cloak first.

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:23.040
I already have.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.560
You know, that's just a green cloak...

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:29.500
Oh.
