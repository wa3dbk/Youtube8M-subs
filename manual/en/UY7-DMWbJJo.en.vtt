Hey guys what's up

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.400
today I'm gonna show you how to watch Star Wars in Command Prompt on Windows 7 Operating System

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.780
basically what you want to go do is go to your start menu button, which is the Window button

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.680
and go to Control Panel

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.100
usually when you when you open the control panel, it will usually look like this, but I changed it to this

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.680
make sure it either Large Icons or Small Icons

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.060
then you want to go to Programs and Features

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.480
just click on that

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.540
you should find all the programs you have on your computer

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:48.480
right then you click on Turn Windows Features On or Off

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.460
and then this window should pop up, turn windows features on or off and all that other crap

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:07.420
basically what you wanna open is, these two will be un-ticked, Telnet Client and Telnet Server, wanna click on these arrows and press ok

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:14.920
then what you wanna go do is go to start menu button and then into All Programs

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:24.160
Then find Accessories folder right here and go to Command Prompt, right click, Run as Administrator

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.800
and then you should see the Command Prompt

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:52.400
then what you wanna type is "telnet towel.blinkenlights.nl" and I'll put an annotation so you can read it and in the description

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:04.480
once you've done that, you want to press enter and there you go you got Star Wars on Command Prompt
