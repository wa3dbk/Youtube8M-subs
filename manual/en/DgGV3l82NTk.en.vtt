00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The fundamental matrix

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Used in stereo geometry

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
A matrix with nine entries

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
It's square with size 3 by 3

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Has seven degrees of freedom

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It has a rank deficiency

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It's only of rank two

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Call the matrix F and you'll see...

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Two points that correspond

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Column vectors called x and x-prime

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
x-prime transpose times F times x

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Equals zero every time

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
The epipolar constraint

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Involves epipolar lines

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Postmultiplying F by x

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Results in vector l-prime

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
It's the epipolar line

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
In the other view passing through x-prime

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
A three component vector

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Of homogeneous design

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The left and right nullspaces of F

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Are the epipoles e-prime and e

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
All of the epipolar lines

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Should pass through these

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Here's a linear estimation example:

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Take a set of 8 point samples

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Construct a matrix, take the SVD

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000
And the elements of F are in the last column of V

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
If you try to estimate

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.000
F with a coplanar set of points

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
Your sample set will be degenerate

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
And will not bring you joy

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000
When doing the estimation, if you don't perform rank deprivation

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Your epipolar lines and the epipoles will not coincide

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000
But if your scene has three views

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000
The trifocal tensor is what you'd use

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Constraints from the third view act like glue

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000
That can't be determined from just two views
