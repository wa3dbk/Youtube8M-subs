00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:01.840
Tex: Ok - pick one

00:00:01.840 --> 00:00:02.620
Church: Any one?

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:05.900
Tex: Well, preferably one on that side of the canyon

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.720
But, er, I'm not all that choosy.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.280
Tucker: Why are you looking at me when you say that

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.620
Tex: No reason...

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.240
Just pick one and take the shot

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.780
I'll cover you if they attack

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:15.340
Church: You mean - shoot them with this?

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:16.100
Tex: What else?

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.000
Tucker: Er, he's really not that great with that thing

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.220
Tex: Give me a break

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:20.540
You're a soldier

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.840
Church: Yeah, well, that's debatable

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.000
Tex: Hit the rock over there

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.740
Church: Ok

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.820
(gunshots)

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:31.140
(Tex: (sigh)) Church: Yeah, uh, I think, I-the sun reflected off the rock face there and-

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.500
Tex: Just give me the damn rifle

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:33.640
Church: Yeah, ok. Thanks

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.320
Donut: Hey, Simmons, did you hear that?

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:38.880
Donut: I'm sure it's nothing

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.440
Donut: Good point, Simmons. Back to work

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.040
Tucker: Dude, this has to be embarrassing for you

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.400
Church: I don't really want to talk about it

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.720
Tex: Alright, come on, it's not that hard

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.920
Which one should we take out?

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.480
The pink one, the orange one?

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.540
Caboose: Pretty sure he's yellow

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.580
Tex: Is it just me or does he seem a little slow?

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.360
Tucker: Yeah, Caboose was held back a grade..or two

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:58.760
Tex: I meant the orange one

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.440
Tucker: Ohoho - yeah, he's just fat

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:01.460
Tex: What about the red one?

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.480
I mean, he's the leader, he seems tough

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:05.880
Or maybe the maroon one?

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.240
He looks like he's up to something

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.160
Church: Er, yeah, I don't know - I can't really decide which one, maybe we should put it to a vote..

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.540
Tex: You know what, screw it - the maroon one is closest

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.220
We'll just shoot him

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.200
(gunshot)

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.040
Lopez: Ow

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.100
Tucker: Eughaha

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.120
Church: Nice shot

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.660
Tex: Thanks

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.380
Donut: OH MY GOD - Simmons!

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.980
How did this happen?

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:25.860
Tucker: Wow

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.060
That was pretty fucking brutal

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.760
Caboose: Andersmith - I kept my promise

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:31.420
You have been avenged

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:33.220
Tex: You know what? Let's shoot another one

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:35.080
I think you guys could use the advantage

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.180
Church: Ummm...are-are you sure?

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.800
Donut: There was so much we had left to talk about

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.240
Like our feelings and hopes

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:44.060
and dreams

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.840
And why most of your insides are wires

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.780
How could you just explode like this?

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.340
We could have talked - you could have told me what was wrong!

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.760
Donut: (pained yells)

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:58.960
Tex: Uh. Maybe I'll let that one live

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.400
Might demoralise the rest of us

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:01.240
Tucker: Good idea

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:02.600
Tex: Come on. Let's pack it in

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.660
Tucker: Does anybody else feel really, really dirty about this?

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.900
And not the good kind of really, really dirty?

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.160
North: Team A, you look clear - window is open

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.160
Start your clocks. On my mark - mark

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.220
(everyone): Sync

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.140
Carolina: Roger that. Team A is moving

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.060
North: Copy that, Carolina

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.080
Good luck, Team A

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.600
Carolina: Thanks. We won't need it

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.000
North: Alright, Bravo, let's move out

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.900
We have three minutes until first alert

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:42.680
Let's have our target in hand by two

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.420
Carolina: We're in

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.560
York - get up here

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:55.680
How long to crack that lock?

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.840
York: Should take about 60 seconds

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.160
You can give me 15

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.280
Wow - is that holographic?

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.740
That's high end

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.460
Carolina: Can you get through it?

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:07.680
York: Course I can

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.820
Didn't bring me along for my good looks, did you?

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.640
Whoever designed this is a genius

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.580
(alarm)

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.560
Carolina: You were saying?

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.580
York: Ok, I take it back, whoever designed this is an asshole!

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.620
Everybody in

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.180
Carolina: Thanks, York. But do something about that alarm system

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.780
We don't need any more surprises

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:29.640
York: Does saying sorry count as something?

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.020
Mmm, guess not

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:35.760
Carolina: We'll secure the package. Set some trackers and then find us a way out of this

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:36.460
York: Moving

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:38.500
Insurrectionist: What the?

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.940
Looks like we got an alert on sector seven

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.060
That's the vault

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.620
Take a team up there now

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.920
Grif: Simmons is...dead?

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.380
Donut: I can't believe he's gone

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.300
Sarge: Well, you know what they say at a time like this?

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:53.660
He may be dead -

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.380
But he's never truly gone

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.780
Until, we get rid of all his gross body parts

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.060
Grif, go fetch a garbage pail

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:03.120
Grif: Sarge, I'm grieving here - can't making up excuses to avoid work wait 'til later

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.420
Sarge: You're right, Grif

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:06.640
I suppose someone should say a few words

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:08.600
Anybody?

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.460
Come on, who knew him best?

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:11.500
Donut?

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.260
Dount: Um...I think he said he liked gum once

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:16.480
I don't know - that's kind of all I got

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:17.400
Sarge: How about you, Grif?

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.660
Grif: Me? Why me?

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.080
Donut: Come on - Grif and Simmons!

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.600
You guys were inseparable

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.400
Surely the two of you must have got to know each other over the years

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:29.460
Grif: Yeah, I dunno, he would talk a lot and I'd lose interest immediately

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:31.660
And then he would ask me a question and I would just go -

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:35.360
'Huh? What? Oh yeah, sure, Simmons, whatever you say'

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:37.660
It wasn't a perfect system...

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:38.740
(sad) But it was ours

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:40.560
Sarge: But he always stayed by your side

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:43.080
Isn't there anything you remember him telling you?

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:44.640
Grif: Huh? Oh, er, yeah -

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.920
Sure, Sarge

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.700
Whatever

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:47.980
Donut: What about you, sir?

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.540
Simmons always loved helping you

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:51.420
Sarge: He did have a knack for following orders

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:55.000
Sometimes I'd make things up just to get him off my back

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.840
One time I told him to disassemble the jeep - and rebuild it!

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.920
Just to keep him busy

00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:00.280
(laughs)

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:01.580
I'll miss doing that

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:03.160
Simmons: Guys, guys, I'm free!

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.240
Oh wow - you already killed Lopez

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.300
Awesome

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:08.480
Sarge: Can it, Simmons - we're trying to give you a eulogy

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.180
Simmons: But I'm not dead, I- wait, you guys are talking about me?

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:12.120
In a good way?

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.080
Oh, never mind, go ahead, please

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.720
Continue

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.780
Sarge: (clears throat)

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.180
Gentlemen - we are here to pay our last respects to Simmons

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.600
Who died...so suddenly...and so violently

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.380
Simmons: Oh, man, this is the best day ever

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.220
Sarge: Simmons wore maroon armour

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:27.480
He talked a lot

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:28.840
And did some work

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.120
Also...

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:31.680
He liked gum

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:34.640
The end

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:35.900
Simmons: What?! That's it?!

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:36.760
That's my funeral?!

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:38.820
Sarge: Not quite. Let's get that garbage pail

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.440
Donut: I remember the gum thing

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.680
Simmons: I never imagined that my death could somehow be worse than my life, but

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:45.240
here it is

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:46.140
Bitching

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.200
Grif: I contributed to the 'talks a lot' part

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.020
Simmons: I don't talk a lot, I talk a regular amount

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.220
You really think I talk a lot?

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:54.580
Grif: Huh? Oh, yeah, sure, Simmons, whatever

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:55.500
Simmons: I hate you

00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:00.020
Donut: Oh man! I just realised - I could have made a flower arrangement for the funeral

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.780
Aww. There's just so few chances to do that around here

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:05.420
Grif: Don't worry, Donut. I'm sure one of us will get killed again soon

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:07.780
Donut: Aw, you're just trying to make me feel better

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:09.040
And I love that about you

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.260
Grif: What's up, forever alone?

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:15.820
So, er, you wanna do something with your life, or do you just want to sit around on you ass all day like a loser?

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:17.720
Yeah, me too!

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.940
So, uh, just subscribe and keep watching youtube

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:20.880
It's way easier
