Hi. This is Julie with Beadaholique.com and I want to show you how to make this

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:16.049
ring. It uses C-Koop copper enamel
formed flower shape

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.840
we put it on a pretty ring finding

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.750
based upon how we're gonna make this

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.720
we can actually spin our flowers around. It's a fun ring to make

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.460
so what you're going to need is a ring
form, you need one with a hole in the

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.570
middle. I've got this one with a pretty filigree edge

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.570
it's going to be perfect for it

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:38.460
We've got a three inch head pin in antique brass to match the

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.640
ring finding

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:44.550
I've got three of these copper enameled flower shape to it. I've got

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.440
one that is twenty four millimeters approximately, they are going to all vary a little

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.360
bit

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.700
in turquoise

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.220
I've got a mustard yellow one that is seventeen millimeters and I've got a

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.280
little white one which is twelve point
five millimeters and then I just have a

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.290
little czech glass bead

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.950
that is four millimeters. In terms of what tools you're going to need is a pair of

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.240
chain nose pliers and a pair of flush
cutters

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.730
super easy to make this project. You're
gonna take your head pin

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.950
and place onto a little four millimeter bead

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.780
then you're going to place the smallest of the flower shapes

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.240
you're gonna have the cap facing
upwards

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.120
so that it captures the bead inside

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.170
go ahead do the medium size

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.110
followed by the large

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.840
take the base wire of your head
pin

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.490
put it through the middle of the ring
finding

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.450
and pull it down tight

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.370
you can see what we've got on the other side
now

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:43.900
once that is secure in there you're
gonna go ahead and take your wire

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.440
pull it to the side keeping a nice tight
tension

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.420
wrap

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.340
the wire from the head pin

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.930
around the base of your ring finding and the
ring shank and the filigree

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:02.910
and you just going to keep wrapping

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.690
as many times as you can

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.339
take your flush cutters

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:14.059
trim off the edge

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:18.239
and that's actually nice and tight up
against there. If you do have a wire

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:21.629
which is poking out it looks like it's
going to actually hurt your finger

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:25.019
take your chain nose and just push
it in a little bit but that's up there

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.040
nice and tight

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:28.209
and then

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.479
it will spin and that is how you make a C-Koop
copper enamel spinner ring. Go to www.beadaholique.com to purchase beading supplies and to get design ideas!
