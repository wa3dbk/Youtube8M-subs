00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.959
But now, let me turn the conversation 
in another direction.

00:00:03.559 --> 00:00:09.639
I have heard our great head-shaman, Edemen, 
say that your son Ugyek, and Emese, who was 
chosen for your daughter-in-law, 

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:16.199
the daughter of the Kazar Kagan, Onedbeila,
the most beautiful woman in Kaspivar, 
presented you with a grandchild.

00:00:19.959 --> 00:00:24.799
We are in Asszorugyek, the spendid, luxurious 
royal town, in the palace.

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.399
In the bed-chamber, the distinguished royal 
couple (Ugyek and Emese) is sleeping.

00:00:29.319 --> 00:00:34.759
A gorgeous, beautiful Turul appears in Emese's 
dream and celebrates the wedding with Emese.

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:37.879
Then dazzling light phenomena disappeared.

00:00:39.759 --> 00:00:45.599
When the time to give birth had come, she was 
escorted across to the birthing house, 
where the place of birth was already prepared.

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:51.599
Hot water was poured onto the ground, then 
cinder was sprinkled, and finally this was 
covered with steaming sheets

00:00:51.759 --> 00:00:54.599
to avoid infections.

00:00:56.759 --> 00:01:00.759
The child was called Almosh according to 
Savard (i.e. Avar) custom.

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.759
This dream indicates as well,
that we have to take over our new home

00:01:06.879 --> 00:01:13.959
in the ancient Hun realm of the thermal waters, 
in the Carpathian Basin, and make the relatives 
living there stronger!

00:01:15.199 --> 00:01:21.199
The point of this is that the logical mind, the Is,
is irradiated by the emotional sense, the Sus,

00:01:21.199 --> 00:01:26.599
which gives long-lasting, wiser action
instead of short-term, selfish exchanges.

00:01:26.879 --> 00:01:33.639
The guards of the nine spells, the religion 
Buun, are the carriers of the Avar mind 
without exeption.

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:40.719
The greatest deed of Bat-Bayan was that he was 
able to join the shaman-world of Ordos with 
the Bat-world of the Avars,

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:48.639
the Taltosh belief of Magyars, the Sumerian 
Anahita-Anina and the Scythian Pech-Torem faith.

00:01:50.559 --> 00:01:57.559
Ata-Isis, the Sun God, and his wife Eda live in 
the seventh heaven. In the garden, there is a 
great mountain, and on the mountain,

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:06.559
there is tree which touches the sky. 
From the top of this tree, the Sun, the Moon, 
and every star start their paths.

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:20.119
The children of the Sun God often brawled; 
therefore, Ata-Isis dropped one of the tree's 
fruits into the lower skies,

00:02:20.119 --> 00:02:27.079
and a great tree grew from it as well. 
Through this, he sent his children to 
populate the lower worlds.

00:02:29.199 --> 00:02:37.159
In the hall of the gods, in their heavenly 
dwelling, our ancestor and god, 
the God of the Magyars, looks after us!

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:42.159
May his memory be blessed!

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:48.159
The law of our ancestors is
an old, true law,

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:52.159
the celestial twin-vortex
which arose with the whirlwind.

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.159
These are the root of everything:
life, death, law.

00:02:56.159 --> 00:03:03.079
Ey, the sky granted it, and the forefather 
of our ancestor got it that way!

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:07.159
Old men have a seat 
on a bench,

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:09.959
little children 
lie in the dust,

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:13.559
the bed of a ripe girl
smolders,

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:17.159
a nice girl is the desire of
a capable lad.

00:03:17.199 --> 00:03:23.239
Ey, the sky granted it, and the forefather 
of our ancestor got it that way!

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.199
Have enough weath on the cornfield 
for the turtledove.

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:31.159
oats grown for horses
can also be given to wild deer.

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:34.159
Let us have wine and wealth.
Let us have peace.

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:38.119
let us rejoice and make merry
for as long as we live.

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:44.319
Ey, the sky granted it, and the forefather 
of our ancestor got it that way!

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:53.319
May the forefathers be blessed, blessed and 
praised, who died for freedom, for the Homeland,

00:03:53.919 --> 00:03:56.239
or were crippled.

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:01.319
We do not leave our widows and orphans in need!

00:04:02.399 --> 00:04:07.359
Blessings to you as well!
Let us go make merry and feast!

00:04:36.039 --> 00:04:38.439
End

00:04:42.079 --> 00:04:52.559
