00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.500
Ok I'm Tim Gipson and I'm going to talk to
you about how to use a carpet steam cleaner.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.390
Now the first thing you want to do before
you steam clean any carpet is you want to

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.450
make sure that the area is vacuumed very well.
In some cases you might even want to go over

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.349
it a couple of times. A good thorough vacuuming
is very important before you start to steam

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:26.650
clean a carpet. The next thing is that there
are several models of steam cleaners that

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.570
you can use at home, there are several types
that you can rent. The most important thing

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:39.140
is to make sure that you load the detergent
in the system that is designed for that particular

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:44.460
steam cleaner. Ok so you don't want to mix
and match or you don't want to use a detergent

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.519
for cleaning your carpets that isn't particularly
designed for steam cleaning. The next thing

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:57.670
we'll do is that you'll want to fill your
reservoir in this case, this has an upper

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:04.610
chamber that you can go and just fill it with
hot tap water. In most cases, hot tap water

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.570
will be sufficient for using your steam cleaning.
You want to make sure that as you fill this

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:18.800
up that you fill it up to the line that is
indicated here. So with your steam cleaning

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:30.229
one thing is very important is that as you
start you want to, you can move it forward

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.520
to spray some heavily soiled areas but in
most cases what you want to do when you are

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:41.750
steam cleaning is as you are depressing the
detergent button that you want to be pulling

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:50.350
the stream cleaner slowly and steadily towards
you. Ok and in this case you are not really

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.909
using vigorous strokes like you may in a vacuum
cleaner You are using slow, steady. And then

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.090
you want to go back and you want to continue
to work this in parallel so as you are depressing

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:10.229
the button then move in a slow, slow method.
What this will allow, the slow steady movement

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.330
in parallel strokes will make sure that you
get a complete clean but it will also make

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.730
sure that you don't saturate too much of your
steam cleaning solution into that. And then

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:26.569
also a lot of your steam cleaners will have
a rinse mode so you can go back and actually

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:34.819
rinse and not leave detergent. And then from
that you can simply let your carpet dry, and

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.540
in some cases depending on what type detergent,
what type of system you are using it may recommend

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:43.260
that you vacuum it again to remove any of
your detergent residue. So I'm Tim Gipson

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:44.640
and that's how to steam clean a carpet.
