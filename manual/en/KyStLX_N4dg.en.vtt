00:00:09.939 --> 00:00:15.217
This is Tamrac's Aero series Speed Pack™ 85, Model 3385.

00:00:15.218 --> 00:00:18.325
What's great about this pack is it can be worn

00:00:18.326 --> 00:00:21.326
like a traditional photo backpack on your back,

00:00:21.327 --> 00:00:23.328
but when you need to get to your gear quickly,

00:00:23.329 --> 00:00:25.382
Simply take off the right shoulder strap,

00:00:25.383 --> 00:00:27.153
swing the pack around to the front

00:00:27.154 --> 00:00:29.584
and you can get to your equipment through the side door.

00:00:29.585 --> 00:00:32.574
this is what we call our Dual Access System™

00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:34.575
cause it allows you to get to your camera

00:00:34.576 --> 00:00:37.484
with lens attached quickly and easily.

00:00:37.485 --> 00:00:39.275
When you're done shooting

00:00:39.276 --> 00:00:41.845
simply return the camera and lens to the pack,

00:00:41.846 --> 00:00:43.584
zip it closed,

00:00:43.585 --> 00:00:45.687
throw it on your pack and you're ready to go.

00:00:45.688 --> 00:00:49.012
When you need to get to your other equipment inside the pack,

00:00:49.013 --> 00:00:52.415
take it off, put it down,

00:00:52.416 --> 00:00:56.714
open the main compartment door and you can get to your other gear.

00:00:56.715 --> 00:00:58.760
The Speed Pack 85 is large enough

00:00:58.761 --> 00:01:00.541
to hold a pro sized body like a

00:01:00.542 --> 00:01:03.457
Canon 1DS or a Nikon D3, additional lenses, a flash

00:01:03.458 --> 00:01:05.454
and other accessories.

00:01:05.455 --> 00:01:08.845
On the flap is a small zippered pocket to hold

00:01:08.846 --> 00:01:11.988
accessories like cables and cords

00:01:11.987 --> 00:01:15.157
anything else that you need to keep secure.

00:01:15.158 --> 00:01:18.875
The top compartment of the Speed Pack 85 is very

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:22.187
roomy for personal items like a light rain jacket, a lunch,

00:01:22.188 --> 00:01:26.314
or anything else you need to carry to your shoot.

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:29.874
In back of the top compartment are mesh pockets

00:01:29.875 --> 00:01:32.387
for accessories like a card reader, extra batteries

00:01:32.388 --> 00:01:34.117
or perhaps a manual.

00:01:34.118 --> 00:01:39.854
The Speed Pack 85 also has a laptop computer compartment in back.

00:01:39.855 --> 00:01:45.417
It zips open, it will hold up to a 17" laptop,

00:01:45.418 --> 00:01:48.745
and it keeps it separate from your photo gear,

00:01:48.746 --> 00:01:51.845
which is nice for security lines in an airport.

00:01:51.846 --> 00:01:54.449
There is a water-resistant zipper to protect the laptop

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.763
from the elements on the laptop compartment,

00:01:56.764 --> 00:02:01.510
and also on the side door for the photo compartment.

00:02:01.511 --> 00:02:03.100
On the other side of the pack,

00:02:03.101 --> 00:02:06.816
is a mesh pocket to hold a water bottle.

00:02:06.817 --> 00:02:10.717
The bottom has lash tabs to hold a small tripod.

00:02:10.718 --> 00:02:14.865
We have our Model S-113, the Tripod Cinch Straps.

00:02:14.866 --> 00:02:18.510
Again, this is the Speed Pack 85, Model 3385

00:02:18.511 --> 00:02:21.615
comes in Black and also Black and Rust.

00:02:21.616 --> 00:02:35.674
