00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:07.390
So for the, since we found the color of her
foundation. I'm going to use it wet first

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.860
before I use it dry. So I'm just going to
make it a little bit of a tinted moisturizer

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:18.650
or concealer by adding a little bit of lotion.
The same lotion we used the all natural lotion

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.520
and as you can see like just a little bit
of moisture really turns this into a nice

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.410
creamy product. Now I'm going to use it as
a concealer first. Look up for me because

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:38.640
she doesn't need foundation all over her entire
face. Especially thicker foundation. So I'm

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:49.130
just going to use it where she needs it. Around
the eye area first and foremost. Maybe a little

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:58.559
bit around the nose area and anywhere where
you feel like there may be a little blemish

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:09.859
to cover. A little around the chins a little
bit discolored. You can also use it on the

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:16.680
eyelids as a little bit of a base just to
get the color out of the eyelids. Create a

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.380
nice even pallet for when you put on your
shadow and also around the lips. Her lips

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.709
are pretty dark so we may want to use a little
bit of concealing on the lip area as well.

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:43.200
Or dust a little powder on top and you want
to really apply it evenly to each side and

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.679
really be patient. I like using this nice
foundation brush you can use a sponge. You

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.220
can use your fingertips just make sure your
hands are clean. I like this little foundation

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.259
brush cause it really gets to every little
corner and crevasse of the face and it really

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:08.191
makes everything blend smoothly. It's a nice
little brush to use ether on yourself or on

00:02:08.191 --> 00:02:16.400
a client. I really enjoy my brushes and I
think brushes are a big part of the reason

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:22.420
why makeup looks so good on certain people.
If you're using a really nice brush then it's

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:29.870
going to apply a lot nicer. So brushes I know
are an investment but there a very good investment

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:40.750
as far as I'm concerned. OK, look at the camera
and you can add a little bit more you know

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.270
depending on where you need it but like I
said she doesn't need it all over the face.

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:50.370
So I just put it where she needed the foundation
and her skin still looks natural and glowy.
