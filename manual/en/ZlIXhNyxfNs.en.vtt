Hey, guys.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.900
I'm Mindy from Cute
Girls Hairstyles.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.370
And today I'm going
to show you how

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:12.776
to do what I'm calling
the edgy sides pull back.

00:00:12.776 --> 00:00:14.150
So I've worn this
hairdo recently

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:16.755
in a few videos and everyone's
really responding well to it

00:00:16.755 --> 00:00:17.935
and asking for a demo.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.487
I filmed "The Mom's View"
episode the other day

00:00:23.487 --> 00:00:25.570
and I wore this hairdo,
and they were just totally

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.540
commenting on it, too.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.590
So I thought I better
come home and film it

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.810
and put it up so everyone
knows how to do it.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.660
So to start with, this is
how I wore my hair today.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.950
So I'm going to take this out.

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:41.590
And I am going to begin by
taking just a regular rubber

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:42.210
band.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.720
And what I'm going to do is from
like, the edge of my eyebrows,

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.610
I'm just going to take
my hair and scoop it

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.820
up and out of the way.

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.215
And all we're doing it just
pulling it out of the way

00:00:53.215 --> 00:00:54.590
so that we can
work with the hair

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.130
underneath for the time being.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:00:57.680
OK.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.140
So you should have a section of
hair from the top of your ears

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.850
to about where your eyebrows go.

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.110
I'm going to take a
comb, pull these back.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:09.900
Like so.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:11.330
I'll turn around when I
put the rubber band in,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.340
so you can see better.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.450
I'm just going to take a comb
and slick the sides back.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:19.100
Comb them back.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.910
And then on these
little fly aways,

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:25.440
you can use hairspray,
which is what I will do.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:28.280
But basically, you're just
getting it really combed back

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.560
so it's tight looking
against your head.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.951
So now I'm going to
take some hairspray.

00:01:33.951 --> 00:01:34.450
Whoa.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.590
My hairspray is
spraying crooked.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.850
Whoa.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.936
Comb it just til
you get it however

00:01:42.936 --> 00:01:45.890
you like it and it's
laying pretty flat.

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.620
Because you want it to look
tight against your head.

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.700
Now I'm going to take a small
little teeny elastic and just

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.530
secure that hair with
that small elastic.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:00.540
Best if you use an elastic
that matches your hair color,

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.400
or close.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.830
So once you get your
elastic in place--

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.840
I can see I still have
a fly away right there.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.470
There we go.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.070
OK.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.050
So we've got like, the bottom
layer done and secured back.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:17.640
So we're going to
let the top down now.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.480
And we're going to section
off pretty much from like,

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:25.450
just the top part of
your forehead back.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.040
So I'm going to
actually do basically

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.280
the same little piece I
had from my hairdo today.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.310
And you really don't
want a ton of hair.

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.290
So think small little section.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.730
Not too thick.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.090
And get that out
of the way again.

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.530
So now we're working
with this middle layer.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.240
And this part, again we're going
to just pull one side back.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.180
Comb it flat.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:54.280
Hairspray as needed.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.390
This is a hairdo
I like to do like,

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.040
the day before I wash my hair.

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.100
Because then I can wash
all the hairspray out.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:05.840
Take a bobby.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.980
I'll turn around so you can see.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.570
And I'm just laying the hair
over the top of that elastic,

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:16.920
and I'm just going to secure
it with a bobby pin like so.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:20.860
If you need a second
one, you can just

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.820
do it the opposite direction
so they cross over each other.

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.530
And that secures down
that piece of hair.

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:30.050
So now I'm going to
come and repeat only

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:32.600
on this side of my head.

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:34.750
Same thing.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:35.510
Comb it flat.

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.020
And any pieces we still have
poking up when we're done

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:44.770
is fine, because we'll
just spray them into place.

00:03:49.321 --> 00:03:49.820
OK.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:57.884
Again, take a bobby pin-- turn
back around-- and secure it.

00:03:57.884 --> 00:03:59.550
This one's a little
harder for me to do,

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:08.220
because I'm right handed and
I have to reach backwards.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:08.720
OK.

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.380
So now you see we have this
nice flow of hair down the back,

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.269
and we have hidden our elastic.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.089
I know you can see a couple
bobby pins, but that's OK.

00:04:22.089 --> 00:04:26.590
So top layer.

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:28.500
Pull this out.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.090
The top layer is where
all the magic happens.

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.690
So now you're going
to rat-- or tease,

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.410
whatever you want to
call it-- your hair.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.090
If you don't want
to do this, then

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.530
you can try blow drying it
with, like, a round brush back

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.940
if you're not a teasing fan.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.790
But I'm OK with teasing.

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:48.550
So I'm just going to take my
hair and just a little bit.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.930
It doesn't have to be tons.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.770
You can see mine's
already going to stay up

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:57.040
because I had my hair
like this earlier today.

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:59.250
Anywhere I can see it just
is going to fall down.

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.895
And then you're just going
to back comb it up and over.

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:15.390
And like right here,
see how that one

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:16.990
wants to fall to the side?

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:20.090
I'm just going to back in and
tease it just a little bit more

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:21.380
so it wants to stay put.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:26.380
OK.

00:05:26.380 --> 00:05:28.860
Now here's a little trick.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.800
If the teasing doesn't
work and you hair

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.500
won't stay exactly
where you want it,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.440
you can take a little
bobby pin and just grab

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:39.550
that little tiny piece,
that edge right there,

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:43.141
and just tuck it down in and
then hide that little bobby

00:05:43.141 --> 00:05:43.640
pin.

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:47.000
And that will also help give
you that line, that edge,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.580
that we want.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.340
My hair wants to just
fly out of control today.

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.734
I mean, I could use a lot of
hairspray and rat it a lot

00:05:58.734 --> 00:06:00.900
and it would stay in place,
but another way to do it

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:05.770
is to just take this bobby pin,
grab that little tiny edge,

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:09.510
and just tuck it in
as far as it'll go.

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:13.435
And that'll also give you
that shape and dimension

00:06:13.435 --> 00:06:17.190
that you want without a lot
of teasing still in your hair.

00:06:17.190 --> 00:06:20.610
So we pretty much
have the look we want.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:27.824
Of course, add hairspray to
keep the shape up on top.

00:06:27.824 --> 00:06:31.100
Now, if I've done my job
right, when I flip around

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:33.310
you really shouldn't see
bobby pins at this point,

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:36.690
or at least not a ton.

00:06:36.690 --> 00:06:37.960
They're pretty hidden.

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:42.660
And you can see that I have
like, the slicked back edges.

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:43.940
This one-- ooh.

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.640
Right in my ear.

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:47.990
Right there and right here.

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:49.600
There we go.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:56.820
And it gives you that
like, hard edge look.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.520
And then you just soften
it up around the bottom.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.700
And there you go.

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:04.410
So I love this one
because when I'm

00:07:04.410 --> 00:07:06.600
wearing like, something
that's a little nicer,

00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:08.980
dressier, but I still want
to look just the tiniest

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:13.290
bit edgy and young, then this
is a really fun hairdo to wear.

00:07:13.290 --> 00:07:17.490
I've seen Maria Menounos
wear this hairdo,

00:07:17.490 --> 00:07:19.350
and Nicole Richie
wears this one a lot.

00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:21.140
I see it on the
red carpet, even,

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.470
where they wear like a
really pretty formal dress

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:25.320
and then they edge it
out just a little bit

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:28.240
by doing a little bit more
rough looking hair, which

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.190
is a really fun way
to have a unique look.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:34.320
Anyway, hope you enjoy.

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.800
Leave a comment
below and tell me

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:39.440
