00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.300
Hello everyone

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.940
In this video, I will show you

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:05.420
a different nail art style unusual to me

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.460
It is an American urban nail art

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.800
Customized with the One Stroke technique

00:00:15.325 --> 00:00:17.050
For the other fingers,

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.775
I’ve made a pink gradient

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.100
I’ve used a clear Essie

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.650
and a fluorescent of Color Club

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:24.375
and a sponge

00:00:24.575 --> 00:00:26.725
First I apply a white base

00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:28.700
Then I make the gradient

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:32.550
Sorry the color does not appear well on the camera

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:33.825
It is better in real

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.325
So I apply the two colors on the sponge

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.500
and I make the gradient as usual

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.125
You know how to do it now

00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:46.525
I tap two layers of it to make the gradient

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.775
Before it dries,

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.850
I use a cuticle pusher to remove the excess

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.050
Before it is dry, it take much more time to remove

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:59.425
Then I use a square brush and pure acetone

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.050
To clean my skin rapidly and one movement

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.675
Since the nail polish is still sticky,

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.600
I add some pigments to it

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.600
These ones, I have bought in Japan

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.050
White pigments

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:11.850
You can also take eye shadow

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.333
Or pigments or glitter

00:01:14.426 --> 00:01:18.293
I apply it using my finger and I tap

00:01:18.346 --> 00:01:19.773
Here is the result

00:01:19.866 --> 00:01:22.160
I did not make the design on all the fingers

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.546
because it may be very bulky

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.853
Thus I’ve made it on only one finger and its fine

00:01:25.933 --> 00:01:27.360
I have made it on a fake nail

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.760
Because I could not record it on my fingers

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.866
It was too complicated

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.586
On a white mate varnish

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.533
I make some gray and white strokes

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.106
I dip half of my square brush in grey,

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.400
half in white

00:01:41.453 --> 00:01:44.253
And I make several horizontal strokes

00:01:44.373 --> 00:01:45.906
Now for the rest of the design,

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.573
I'll use a detailed brush.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.880
Your black acrylic paint must be much diluted

00:01:49.973 --> 00:01:51.586
And a detailed brush

00:01:51.826 --> 00:01:54.133
I mark the outlines

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.266
I add small vertical lines

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.586
that will represent the brick of the wall

00:01:59.546 --> 00:02:03.520
After making the small staggered vertical lines

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.133
I create the brick shape

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.746
To do so, I round the right angles

00:02:08.893 --> 00:02:11.093
to round corners

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.693
I've made it the wrong way

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.786
The camera was annoying,

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.480
however its better on my nails

00:02:18.693 --> 00:02:22.640
Then when it is dry, I use a big detailed brush

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.880
So that it is easier to make the splash

00:02:25.106 --> 00:02:27.586
I'm using fluorescent pink acrylic paint

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:35.133
I apply a scoop and I draw like flower or star shape

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:37.577
Can you see how it looks like?

00:02:39.577 --> 00:02:44.111
It should not be too thick otherwise it will look gross

00:02:44.111 --> 00:02:46.110
Then I’ve made some drops aside

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.288
Now I will add some the light effects

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.666
You need a landmark

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.800
And here for example it’s on the top left, the sun

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.666
And you need to draw white lines

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.577
on only one side of the spot

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:59.066
To do so I use a very small squared brush

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:01.866
I dip half of it in white acrylic paint

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:02.555
I make a gradient

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.644
In fact, it is a one stroke with only one color

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.066
I add the white color only on the top left side

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.555
You can put it at the bottom right, it does not matter

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.955
But you should really respect the light effect

00:03:13.044 --> 00:03:16.422
Put the white color only on the same side

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.555
To create that reflection effect

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:21.977
Finally I apply the top coat

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.488
Here is it! The splash nail art is done!

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:27.022
I hope that you like it

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:28.711
and that you like this style

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.644
However, I will keep my usual style

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:34.466
with the small flowers and girly things

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:37.911
But it's fun sometimes to change and it's entertaining

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:39.400
I hope that you love it too

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.777
Feel free to share work on Facebook

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:44.222
Have a nice end of holidays

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:45.311
See you soon
