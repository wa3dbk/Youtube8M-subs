00:00:00.188 --> 00:00:04.594
(playful music)

00:00:05.153 --> 00:00:05.936
- Hey, friends.

00:00:05.936 --> 00:00:06.557
- Hey, everyone.

00:00:06.557 --> 00:00:09.148
- Welcome to Cook With
April on Tasty Tuesday.

00:00:09.148 --> 00:00:11.121
Today I'm gonna show you how to make

00:00:11.121 --> 00:00:14.859
chewy chocolate chocolate chip cookies.

00:00:14.859 --> 00:00:16.821
They are, like, I guess,
they're like double chocolate?

00:00:16.821 --> 00:00:17.518
- Mmhmm.

00:00:17.518 --> 00:00:19.004
- Double chocolate chip cookies.

00:00:19.794 --> 00:00:22.348
I'm just nuts about them so stay tuned

00:00:22.348 --> 00:00:23.590
and learn how to make 'em.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:25.378
Let's begin by preheating our oven

00:00:25.378 --> 00:00:28.890
at 350 degrees Farenheit,
175 degrees Celsius.

00:00:31.438 --> 00:00:34.161
In a medium bowl, place
one cup of softened butter

00:00:35.698 --> 00:00:37.034
and one cup of white sugar

00:00:37.034 --> 00:00:39.304
and make sure to mix those ingredients.

00:00:43.953 --> 00:00:45.555
Then, crack about two eggs

00:00:45.555 --> 00:00:47.802
and again continue to mix with your mixer.

00:00:55.539 --> 00:00:57.884
Then you're gonna go ahead
and sift two cups of flour,

00:00:57.884 --> 00:01:00.624
three quarter cups of
cocoa powder unsweetened.

00:01:00.624 --> 00:01:02.505
three quarter teaspoon baking soda

00:01:02.505 --> 00:01:04.891
and one quarter teaspoon of salt.

00:01:07.451 --> 00:01:09.331
Combine the dry and wet
ingredients together

00:01:09.331 --> 00:01:11.880
with a hand mixer or just a spoon.

00:01:15.508 --> 00:01:17.423
Then you're ready to add chocolate chips.

00:01:17.423 --> 00:01:19.443
You can add two cups or
if you don't really like

00:01:19.443 --> 00:01:21.806
chocolate chips you can add less.

00:01:27.384 --> 00:01:30.629
I love walnuts, so I decided
to add one cup of walnuts.

00:01:41.653 --> 00:01:44.996
Place the cookies by one
tablespoon or one teaspoon each,

00:01:44.996 --> 00:01:47.545
spread them apart by one to two inches.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.671
You're ready to bake
for about ten minutes.

00:01:56.327 --> 00:01:59.665
I hope you enjoy, it is
chewy, delicious and soft.

00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:10.398
So they are fresh out of the oven.

00:02:10.398 --> 00:02:11.443
- Oh man.

00:02:11.443 --> 00:02:14.595
- And I waited for them
to cool on the rack.

00:02:14.925 --> 00:02:16.684
- So I picked the one that
had the most walnuts in it.

00:02:16.684 --> 00:02:18.355
- (laughs) Of course you would.

00:02:18.355 --> 00:02:19.667
- Cause you know that's what I love.

00:02:19.667 --> 00:02:20.997
- Of course you would.

00:02:25.781 --> 00:02:27.198
- Wow, that is delicious.

00:02:28.578 --> 00:02:31.605
I taste the crunch of the walnuts,

00:02:31.605 --> 00:02:34.949
the gooeyness of the actual
chocolate chips in there,

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:37.735
the softness of the middle of the inside,

00:02:37.735 --> 00:02:39.184
and then crunchiness around the edges.

00:02:39.184 --> 00:02:40.484
It's like the perfect cookie.

00:02:40.484 --> 00:02:43.340
- It is! I'm like nuts
about it, I kept eating it.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.395
- God, this is so good, I
don't know if I've ever had

00:02:44.395 --> 00:02:46.479
a double chocolate chip
cookie with walnuts.

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:48.087
- I added walnuts just cause --

00:02:48.087 --> 00:02:49.758
- I love it, no I love
it, I think it's cause

00:02:49.758 --> 00:02:51.639
sometimes double chocolate chip cookies

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:53.381
are too sweet for me or too rich,

00:02:53.381 --> 00:02:55.238
but this, I don't know, I
feel like, with the walnuts,

00:02:55.238 --> 00:02:56.469
I don't know, maybe that's
dumb, but with the walnuts

00:02:56.469 --> 00:02:58.837
it just makes it better, I
don't know, I would eat it!

00:02:58.837 --> 00:03:01.646
- You never know, maybe it
kinda evens out the flavors

00:03:01.646 --> 00:03:03.458
cause it's like maybe too chocolatey

00:03:03.458 --> 00:03:05.186
and you like the nutty flavors.

00:03:05.186 --> 00:03:06.045
- Mmm!

00:03:06.045 --> 00:03:08.111
- I'm so glad that you like them.

00:03:08.111 --> 00:03:09.667
