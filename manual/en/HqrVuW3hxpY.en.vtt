00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:05.380
Welcome to 3 minute Bible study on
Luke 10 and the Good Samaritan.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.809
In vs. 25 a lawyer asks Jesus what he should do to inherit eternal life.

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:12.200
Jesus asked what he'd read in the law,
and the lawyer responded with 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:13.170
the fundamental duties of

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:17.470
loving God with all your heart, soul, and  mind, and loving your neighbor as yourself

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.070
Jesus commended the answer and told him to do it. But looking for the limits  

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.000
of that duty, the lawyer wants to know 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.420
who counts as a neighbor? In verse 30 Jesus responded with a story.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.700
A certain man was traveling from
Jerusalem to Jericho. 

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.579
Attacked  by robbers, he's beaten, stripped, and left half dead.

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.600
As he lay there, a priest comes down
the road, but on seeing the victim he

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:40.840
passes by on the other side. Next comes a levite who does the same thing

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:44.829
Why? Stopping to help would have been
messy and trouble. Besides...

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.100
We don't know anything about him. Avoid
eye contact, keep moving, not my problem.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.120
Now consider &amp; compare
these two men with the robbers ...

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.110
the robbers make no pretense of righteousness. Like the bandits in Proverbs 1,

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:58.500
they're evil men banded together to shed blood and steal. 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.600
The priest &amp; levite, on the other hand, are not criminals.They're men of temple service.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.439
And yet, there's something common to all these men.

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.580
Consider: how did the criminals leave the
victim? Half dead.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.619
How did the priest &amp; levite leave him?           Half dead

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:16.009
So though we have two varieties of evil here, one active and one passive - in both cases

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.970
there's a total lack of concern for the
man in the road,

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.080
a callous failure to treat him as one
would want to be treated.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.000
Now along comes a Samaritan... 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.799
For background, recall that Jews had no dealings with Samaritans.

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.900
So as the Samaritan approaches the
victim from Jerusalem, 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.900
he's looking at a man, who in better condition,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.740
might want nothing to do with the Samaritan.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.400
And yet what does the Samaritan do?  And why? Instead of moving away, the  Samaritan 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.500
is moved with compassion. He comes to the beaten man, treats his wounds, 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.500
mounts him on his own transport, gets him to an inn,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.200
out of his own personal pocket, provides a place for the victim to recover.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:52.590
Side note: this is not about church
funded relief. Church funds in the N.T.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:56.479
were consistently provided to
needy saints within the churches

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.149
as part of a spiritual fellowship. That
was a collective duty.

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.890
What we see in Luke 10 is an individual,
personal, and active duty.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.790
And putting a check in
the collection on Sunday is not

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.150
a substitute for personally doing to
others as you'd have them do to you,

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:16.020
whoeverthey are. In fact, consider this:
What kind of people were the robbers?

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.860
Selfish &amp; evil. What kind of people were 
the priest &amp; levite? Selfish &amp; evil. 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.200
What kind of person was the Samaritan? Good.   Now ... 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.750
What kind of person was the man in the road?

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.000
We don't know. And neither did the Samaritan. What he did know, was that

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.660
this dying man needed his help,

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.849
and moved with compassion, he did for him
what anyone would want done for them.

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.000
Jesus ended with a question. Which of the
three proved neighbor 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.970
to the man who fell among thieves?

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.599
The lawyer replied, "He who showed mercy," to which Jesus said

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.870
"You go &amp; do likewise." Our neighborhood is not limited to those next door,

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.989
those who look like us, or those who are
good to us.  Our neighborhood

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.910
is to be much bigger than that. For more
