Hello, I'm Donna Beth Joy Shapiro on behalf
of ExpertVillage.com and today I'm going to

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.680
show you how to iron a shirt. In this clip,
we are going to talk about how to iron a man's

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:18.090
one hundred percent cotton dress shirt that
has some embroidery and some embellishment.

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.949
You would approach this a little differently
than a dress shirt because you don't want

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:27.009
to harm this beautiful embroidery. We are
going to do this just a little bit differently.

00:00:27.009 --> 00:00:33.140
And by the way, we are not going to use starch
on this. This shirt has a lovely, soft cotton

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:39.190
feel to it, and while I love the look of any
garment starched, if I were going to wear

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:47.120
this myself, I would not starch it. So, I'm
going to do the collar the same, though when

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.510
we get to the front of the collar, what I
would do is cover this with a thin tea towel

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.539
or pressing cloth. Dampen that; spray it with
water and then iron the collar. I really would

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:10.410
avoid ironing the front side or any part of
this shirt that has embroidery. Probably the

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.480
embroidery is one hundred percent cotton,
but maybe not. My feeling is that it probably

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:19.750
has some synthetic in it. The same goes for
this braided trim. I would be afraid of it

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.640
melting. So I'm just going to show you real
quickly how I would approach this. Just turn

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:37.180
it inside out and spray it a little bit. I
might not need to spray it because this iron

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.910
has a lot of steam. But, for those of you
out there who do not have a lot of steam,

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:50.990
you might want to spray it. So, I would also
make sure that I leave the iron on the fabric

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:58.780
for the shortest time as possible, just in
case this embroidery does have synthetic in

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:07.910
it (so that it doesn't melt). So, you are
going to get a fabric that is definitely not

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:14.380
wrinkled. As soon as the wearer puts it on
and starts moving around, it is going to wrinkle

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.770
and crease, but it definitely will look a
lot neater than it does right now. Thanks

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:21.310
for watching.
