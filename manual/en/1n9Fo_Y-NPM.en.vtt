Hello it is Binky from Made in Chelsea and
welcome back to another episode of Binky's

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:04.699
Boutique.

00:00:04.699 --> 00:00:09.510
I think it is so important to look after your
hands to always having perfectly painted nails.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.840
This week I am going to show you some of my
favorite hand and nail products.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.450
[music]
So first up we are going to have this beauty

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:29.310
secrets cuticle oil and if I just squeeze
the little pump at the top, then you just

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:36.129
put it on your cuticles, like so, and then
just rub it in like that.

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:39.120
It smells really great, it smells like marzipan.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.710
This just softens the skin and then ail beds,
keeping your nails moisturized and in really

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.780
good condition.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.194
So I just pop that on, leave it, just rub
it a little bit then leave it, and then let

00:00:48.194 --> 00:00:49.194
just work its magic.

00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:55.019
Now I am very excited, this is the Binky London
Ultra Winter[?] nail color range.

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.140
It is called Oil Slick and these colors are
beaut.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:04.080
Their really metallic, they are quite fun,
if it catches different light they change

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.930
different color, and yeah they go with everything.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.560
These are really cool evening colors.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:16.119
The colors I have got here are blue, red,
kinda purpley, green, a lighter blue, it does

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.600
change color as you move it.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.369
So definitely an eye out for Binky London
nail range.

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:24.890
These will be coming out soon.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.409
This is a Dior gel coat and this is really
good to put on top of the color you have chosen.

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.240
The kinda of makes it have a shellac feel,
polished, and it also helps prevent the paint

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:40.130
from chipping away so that is a really good
little purchase to get.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.469
It gives that professional finish that you
would normally get if you went to a nail bar

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:46.229
but you can do it at home so it is all good.

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.890
This is the bare Minerals Purely Moisturizing
cream.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.979
You can use it on your face but I am going
to be using it on my hands.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:02:01.100
It smells really good and is quite, it is
not too greasy, it is quite a thick formula.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.789
I often use this for my hands if they are
quite dry over winter.

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:09.000
Like I said it is not too greasy so, I do
not normally like using moisturizer on my

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.350
hands but this is a really nice one.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:13.860
Now this is a hand cream that you can keep
in your hand bag because it is so small and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.860
cute.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.490
This is the L'Occitane and it is called Rose
Petals, you can also get it in different flavors

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.120
but this is my favorite.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.750
This smells like rose petals and it is very
moisturizing.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.280
Again, not too greasy, yet it is perfect for
winter.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.500
It has got a shea butter formula which I absolutely
love, so, good purchase.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.470
If you like this video and you want to see
me do more favorites videos then give this

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:38.770

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:43.260
