00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:16.960
Hello, I’m Steve Gonzalez, HP’s WW Product Marketing manager for

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.710
HP ProLiant DL360 Series Servers.

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.750
In this session of Coffee Coaching

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.739
i'm going to cover the new features in the DL360p Gen8 Server.

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:30.669
This is HP’s 8th Generation of ProLiant Servers and we continue to

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:34.589
drive the heritage and legacy of Reliability, Accessibility and

00:00:34.589 --> 00:00:36.580
Serviceability.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:37.519
In this session

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:39.330
we’ll cover – what’s new

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:42.340
and what’s improved.

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.920
The DL360p Gen8 comes with industry leading performance,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:47.940
Efficiency

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.470
and capacity in a 1U space.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:53.790
It’s an Enterprise class design with the versatility to change for future

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:55.590
requirements.

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.200
The DL360p Gen8 is the ideal server

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.129
for performance driven workloads with smaller storage requirements

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:05.620
in a dense rack package.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.070
It is built to protect your investment

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:14.040
and extend the life of the server with flexible features designed in.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.730
What’s New?

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:20.580
With the DL360p Gen8

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.250
you now have the choice of 8 Small Form Factor or 4 Large Form Factor drives

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.710
and still have the optical option available.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.200
We are introducing Intel’s E5-2600 Family

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.859
Series processors

00:01:34.859 --> 00:01:37.200
with Increased Performance,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.760
Capacities and memory channels.

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.729
The family of processors will come with 2, 4, 6 or 8 Cores

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.150
and up to 3.3GHz max speeds.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.870
Our newest technology innovation from HP

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.570
comes with the processors.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.220
The HP Exclusive Smart Socket Guide provides you

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:59.539
with a new simplicity for installation, serviceability

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:00.950
or upgrade.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.500
A fool-proof installation mechanism that protects you,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.549
the server and your investments.

00:02:08.549 --> 00:02:10.400
With our Generation 8 servers

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.889
we have improved access for serviceability by moving to flat cables

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:17.290
and adding management guides.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.089
This provides a cleaner look and faster access.

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:25.139
We have improved thermal designs to remove the old black air-baffle of

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.269
G7

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.439
and opened up access to the internal components for faster deployment,

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:33.949
configuration or upgrades.

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:38.829
Our new Smart Memory will enable the system to authenticate HP memory to

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:40.789
ensure it meets our highest

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:42.870
quality HP standards.

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.639
And since the memory has been optimized for HP ProLiant,

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:50.439
it will enable new enhanced memory features.

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:55.080
DDR3-1600MHz memory is now available in Gen8

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.139
allowing 20% higher memory bandwidth.

00:02:58.139 --> 00:02:59.229
Gen8 supports

00:02:59.229 --> 00:03:00.659
4GB,

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.040
8GB, and 16GB memory densities

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.430
and we can support 1600MHz DIMMS all the way up to

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.459
128GB of capacity.

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.519
A New Smart Storage family of controllers

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:16.829
and drives

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.779
allow for increased intelligent storage systems.

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:23.779
Improved performance, expanded capacities

00:03:23.779 --> 00:03:25.959
and a new Icon based display

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.109
will improve drive status and health indication.

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:32.519
Listening to our customer

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.619
inputs we have provided easier and faster access to the IO on our servers.

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:40.359
The new style secure mechanisms

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.120
on the riser cages allow for a quick removal

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.669
and replacement of PCI solutions.

00:03:45.669 --> 00:03:47.629
Simply lift the blue tab –

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:51.349
rotate 180 degrees and lift the riser out.

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:56.479
Another HP Innovation for an enterprise class design.

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:00.119
HP is re-inventing Rack Server networking with a New Flexible

00:04:00.119 --> 00:04:01.959
Networking Technology.

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:05.219
The HP Flex LOM which is similar to a PCI card

00:04:05.219 --> 00:04:10.379
resides in the same location where the G7 nics were on the motherboard.

00:04:10.379 --> 00:04:13.199
It has options and therefore can be changed

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:17.189
for Flexible configuration to 1Gb or 10Gb

00:04:17.189 --> 00:04:19.599
or other options to be determined in future.

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:23.789
All this without wasting a PCI slot.

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:28.869
With this new generation of DL360 servers we now introduce new fast

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:32.210
access/quick replace HOT PLUG redundant fans.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.150
The new designs once again improve thermal and power thresholds for

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:40.139
a cooler, quieter and more efficient server.

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.389
And, our latest

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.819
Common Slot Power Supplies have moved up the energy chart

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:49.279
with 94% efficiency on Intelligent Power Solutions.

00:04:49.279 --> 00:04:54.340
This improves efficiency and keeps commonality with previous generations.

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.669
Finally, a new version of iLO,

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:02.069
iLO Management Engine, with Active Health Monitor, Management and Deployment

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:03.999
features will help you

00:05:03.999 --> 00:05:08.669
with faster deployment and issue resolution. What about Metrics?

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:12.940
With a whole new design the DL360p Gen8 server has improved its

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:17.039
performance and capacities over previous generations.

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:21.280
Memory has increased by 2 times over G7 servers

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.169
We have introduced Smart Storage and new carriers to improve storage capacities

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.419
by 33%

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:33.069
A 100% improvement in IO performance with PCIe 3.0

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:38.660
The latest HP Smart Arrays on the Gen8 servers has improved performance

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.330
up to 200%.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.759
With HP’s iLO Management Engine

00:05:43.759 --> 00:05:46.240
and the Active Health Monitoring Systems

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.120
We have improved the diagnosis of root causes of issues in operations by

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.090
five times

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:55.160
And Key Design Innovations

00:05:55.160 --> 00:06:00.269
that dramatically improve Reliability, Accessibility and Serviceability

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:02.059
in summary

00:06:02.059 --> 00:06:06.090
Top of the line Intel Processors,  HP Qualified Memory,

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:09.839
new RAS features for an enterprise class server

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:12.749
and flexibility of options for future needs.

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:13.999
Bottom Line –

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:17.910
The DL360p Gen8 can meet many of your Performance,

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:23.889
Capacity and IO needs in a 1U space.  A new cloud server.

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:30.889
Thank You for choosing HP as your partner!
