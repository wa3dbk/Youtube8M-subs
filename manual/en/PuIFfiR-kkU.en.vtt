00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:05.799
Okay in this next clip I'm going to show you
the definition of a legal shot. Okay now this

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:10.460
is for tournament play in a bar table I'll
tell you the rule the alternative rule to

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:17.100
most bar tables, but you've now determined
the only time this won?t be, this is the definition

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.369
for a legal shot, the only time it wouldn't
be is when you have a break shot or when this

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.670
the field is open and it's chose. On a legal
shot you could shoot. You have to shoot your

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.470
ball so if you have solids you have to hit
a solid for that ball to be legal now for

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:41.260
the rest of the shot to be legal you either
have to pocket the ball that you're calling.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.410
Now again if you're calling the sixth ball,
let's just, I'm just going to try to give

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.620
you a couple of scenarios. If you, If you
were going the two into the six into the side.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.750
The six goes into the side pocket then that's
a legal shot. Alright you can also combo your

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.140
shot as long as you hit the, your ball first,
now I'm solids, I hit my two first I can then

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.760
hit a strip ball and the strip ball could
hit the six and go in so again you have to

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.190
hit your ball first and the ball has to go
into a pocket, that's the first way for a

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.220
legal shot. The other scenario is, Like I
said you can either make your object ball,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:25.060
but the other way for a legal shot to be legal
is you hit your own ball first and that ball

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.909
or the cue ball have to hit or any other number
ball have to hit a rail. So you have to hit

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:36.950
your ball and either have that ball or the
cue ball hit the rail, like so for it to be

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.960
a legal shot, if not it's a foul, your opponent
gets ball in hand behind, ball in hand. Now

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.070
I'm going to talk a little bit about ball
in hand for tournament play, but on a bar

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.520
table that rule really never sticks because
your playing with again the money situation,

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.190
you can't bring balls out you can't take balls
away so usually on a bar table, It's just

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.650
considered a scratch and you get ball behind
hand, so that's how the foul works there.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.480
But again remember that either on has to hit
you can also do this as a legal shot you can

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:14.701
make the cue ball hit a rail first come back
and hit a ball and either the cue ball or

00:02:14.701 --> 00:02:19.700
that ball have to hit a rail for it to be
a legal shot. So there's your definition for

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.560
the two scenarios of a legal shot. All right
here's a legal shot when you make the ball

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.599
two in the, the two in the side pocket. Since
I made the shot it's a legal shot. Now here's

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:38.761
a legal shot without making the ball, a six
ball in the side. I miss the side but you

00:02:38.761 --> 00:02:43.930
know what the ball hit a rail; it's a legal
shot. If this ball, you can even do something

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:49.920
like this where maybe the six doesn't hit
a rail but the cue ball does you still hit

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:55.960
the six, see that right there that?s a legal
shot because I hit a ball and the cue ball

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.971
hit the rail, and again another legal could
be something like this where you hit the rail

00:02:59.971 --> 00:03:08.470
first, and it comes back, that would be a
foul because it didn't hit anything. Okay

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:13.080
so now so now you know who are strips and
who are solids lets come back and I just want

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.730
to define a legal shot.
