00:00:07.203 --> 00:00:10.173
Why does my iPhone die so fast?

00:00:10.173 --> 00:00:12.523
Are you charging it every night?

00:00:12.523 --> 00:00:15.432
Not every night, but most nights.

00:00:15.432 --> 00:00:20.473
If you let is discharge all the way too often,
the battery might lose the ability to charge

00:00:20.473 --> 00:00:21.473
completely.

00:00:21.473 --> 00:00:26.763
Then it will die faster after a full charge,
because it has less juice.

00:00:26.763 --> 00:00:28.973
It is an almost new phone.

00:00:28.973 --> 00:00:31.113
Is the charger plugged in?

00:00:31.113 --> 00:00:33.932
If plugged in, it still might not be working.

00:00:33.932 --> 00:00:37.773
It works, because it is charging the phone.

00:00:37.773 --> 00:00:43.553
If you are using a USB charger, it will have
trouble charging the phone very fast.

00:00:43.553 --> 00:00:47.762
You could end up with half a charge though
the phone is plugged in all day.

00:00:47.762 --> 00:00:50.482
I thought they had better performance than
that.

00:00:50.482 --> 00:00:55.422
The USB charger has even worse performance
if the computer goes into hibernate mode or

00:00:55.422 --> 00:00:57.012
turns off.

00:00:57.012 --> 00:01:02.232
If there isn't full power to the PC, it won't
give more than a trickle to the phone.

00:01:02.232 --> 00:01:05.312
I don't know if the problem is hardware related.

00:01:05.312 --> 00:01:10.973
If you leave the GPS and location based services
on, it will drain the battery really fast.

00:01:10.973 --> 00:01:12.763
I know that.

00:01:12.763 --> 00:01:16.133
That's why I keep those services to a minimum.

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:20.313
If someone has hacked the phone with a program
that captures all your audio and sends it

00:01:20.313 --> 00:01:23.873
to the cloud, that'll drain the battery pretty
fast.

00:01:23.873 --> 00:01:28.273
The same is true if I have a lot of apps running
all the time.

00:01:28.273 --> 00:01:32.713
Services and applications that are constantly
connected use more power than those that don't

00:01:32.713 --> 00:01:37.303
need to draw from the battery to reach out
and connect to the cell phone tower.

00:01:37.303 --> 00:01:41.943
What if it is the NSA spoofing the cell phone
tower and infecting it?

00:01:41.943 --> 00:01:46.533
The NSA can get all the metadata for your
calls from the cell phone company without

00:01:46.533 --> 00:01:48.443
infecting the phone.

00:01:48.443 --> 00:01:52.503
If they want to listen in, they'll set up
a repeater that acts like a cell phone tower

00:01:52.503 --> 00:01:56.473
to listen in but that doesn't drain the battery
more than usual.

00:01:56.473 --> 00:01:59.863
I don't know if that makes me feel better
or worse.

00:01:59.863 --> 00:02:04.923
If the battery is dying faster than it should,
it isn't going to be the NSA's fault.
