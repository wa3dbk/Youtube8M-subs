00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.110
Here we are going to do core
plank pike's with the towel.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.370
So, all you are going to do is getting a good push-up position in your plank position.

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.559
So, your back is flat,

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.960
core is tight and your feet are going to either be

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.420
on a towel or you can just be using your
socks as well.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:23.750
All you are going to do is just bring your legs up straight

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.390
as far as you can come in here and then
bring them back down.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.410
Back to playing position; you want to go
nice.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.410
good under control movements. Now to add a bit more difficulty

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.360
just go on one leg.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.940
So, the one leg variation is going
to be more challenging so you do that

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.970
for this item on repetitions on one leg

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.660
then you switch leg. The double leg
variation is where you should do this when you are just

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.440
starting out again. You can use a towel

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.660
on a cement surface, you can use your
socks. Towel is going to be a little bit

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.990
harder than your socks will be.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.360
Or if you don't have a smooth surface
that slides like that,

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:13.580
you can use something like
rollerblades

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.770
where the toll of the skate

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.830
is going to roll for you so you'll be able
to do it that way. So here we have

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.420
more challenge variation

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.490
of the plank pike's. We are going to actually be using plates, so you can use 5, 10, 25,

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.880
whatever weight that you want to use as
long as you keeping good technique. Use as

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:31.930
much weight as you can.

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:36.660
And then we are just going to put the plate on a cement surface. We are going to put our toes

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:37.729
on the middle the plate

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.050
and then you are just going to pike up and back. So all you are going to be doing here is in a good plank

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.700
position.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.610
You are here

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.670
and then planking up or piking up; legs
are straight,

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:57.409
bringing that hip up as far as you can.
For me coming back to make it more

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:58.130
challenging.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:05.130
Or you can just move on to a single a variation.

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:10.000
As you are adding more and more
weight to that you are going to want to

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.420
really add more pressure to the plate

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.970
to push it back and pull it forward which is going to make that more challenging

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.330
and really engage your core. So, double-leg

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:23.350
or single leg. If you do single leg just do the assignment on repetitions for one

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.709
leg

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:24.790
and then move to the other leg.
