Hello. This is Russ with the Salt Lake City
Bicycle Collective. I'm online at www.slcbikecollective.org.

00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:10.760
I'm here today on behalf of Expert Village
and we are going to show you how to install

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.870
some shift cables. There's two different types
of cables out there; one is shift and one

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.910
is brake. Shift cables are linear and they
go straight in and out. Brake cable is more

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.110
of a coil, like a spring design. So, you want
to make sure that you use the right one. After

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.130
I have the shift cable and it's all set up,
what I want to do is make sure that I have

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.761
the housing here to cover the distance from
the shifter to the bike frame which would

00:00:33.761 --> 00:00:36.630
be on this side. You want to give it enough
room so that when you turn it, that cables

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.800
not going to get all binded up. What you are
going to do is, get a new shift cable. When

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.350
you have that new shift cable, you are going
to go ahead and take of the set screw that

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.860
is in here in some capacity. You are going
to run it straight through here as long as

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.700
it's in the lowest gear. You're going to kind
of fish it through there. It might take you

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.621
a couple of tries. It's going to come out
this other end over here. When you have that,

00:00:56.621 --> 00:01:01.559
you can go ahead and pull this all the way
through and that should steep inside there.

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:05.249
You can always check by double shifting it
and making sure it goes in and out. After

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:09.780
you have that, this length of shift housing
that you've already cut will end up on the

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.530
end here. On both ends of this shift housing
there is what we call a feral. They are normally

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.689
metal or plastic. It's just a cap to keep
the shift housing from extending beyond it's

00:01:20.689 --> 00:01:24.969
casing. You're going to run this inside here
and go around whichever side of the frame

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:29.459
it needs to be on. In this instance, this
one is going to line up with the back, so

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:34.169
we are going to run it on the drive side of
the bike here. It's going to go through here

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:38.329
and it's going to go underneath. Underneath
there is a piece of plastic with a little

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.429
slot in it. You are going to run it through
that, come all the way to the back and I'm

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:45.860
going to run it through this other piece of
shift housing that I've already determined

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.391
the length for. You are going to insert it
inside here. It's going to come out of the

00:01:50.391 --> 00:01:57.079
other end and go into these slots. In another
video, we are going to show you how this actually

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:00.699
connects into the d√©railleur and how we are
going to secure it and create shifting.
