00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:13.740
Once you get to, like, April May you're, like,
oh my goodness, like, I have all these things

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.289
I want to do and it's funny because me and my
friends are making our bucket list and there's

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:18.390
only two weeks left of school.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.439
Oh my goodness. So on my bucket list it's
kind of broken down into food, adventures,

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:24.810
places to go.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.960
We still want to go to places on Newbury.
We want to find all the BU libraries on campus.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.620
BU has, like, so many cool rooftops that I've
always wanted to explore so that's one thing

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:35.920
that I definitely want to try and do.

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.010
I still haven't walked on the seal so I'm
waiting to do that.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.679
I have a certain respect for the seal. I'll
probably take a picture, you know, on it or

00:00:42.679 --> 00:00:43.210
near it.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.780
I would want to go into the dining hall and
eat a whole pie in one sitting.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:50.449
Go back to FitRec a couple more times to get
my money's worth.

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:52.679
The Rhett's Challenge cause I've failed twice
already.

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:56.179
Knight's Challenge that's always something
I've always wanted to do but that is one crazy

00:00:56.179 --> 00:00:56.960
thing to do.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.879
So I've never done, actually, the Freedom
Trail. LIke, I've walked through it, I've

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.940
walked on it obviously but I've never actually
taken a Freedom Trail tour which is something

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.500
I always planned on doing earlier on but never
got around to.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:08.780
I think I'd want to sit on a Red Sox game
not in the bleachers. I'd like to actually

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.250
sit somewhere closer to home plate.

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.490
I actually haven't had clam chowder yet in
New England which I think is so weird because

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.829
I'm a huge clam chowder fan so I need to do
that.

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:19.920
I've always wanted to paddleboard on the Charles.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.630
I want to go to the Harpoon Brewery.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.990
Now that I'm 21, I kind of want to go to The
Beehive because there's, like, a live jazz band.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.159
T's Tuesdays is a thing too. I'm going to
the MFA. Some of my friends haven't done that.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.549
I've done that. I love it. I recommend everybody
does that.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:38.490
Different places like the islands, Cape Cod,
go biking around Boston. Lots of different

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.079
restaurants and places to explore that we've
never been.

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:46.130
I'd like to see all my professors who I know
one more time and just thank them for, like,

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.939
helping me.

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.200
I think the best part of the bucket list is
that you get to do it with your friends. You

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.969
know, once you graduate everybody moves all
across the country, some across the world,

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:56.659
and you may not be able to do it with everybody
again.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:01:58.819
So it's important to take advantage of it
now.
