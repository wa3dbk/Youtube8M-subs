Hello, thanks for watching my channel!

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.040
Have you seen the Japan - Brazil match yesterday?

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.520
I couldn't watch it because I worked late...

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:18.140
...but I watched the interview with the coach during dinner

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.380
That was when I thought...

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:28.200
Lately the coach of the national team is always a foreigner

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:34.140
Like Zaccheroni or Osim, and some others I forgot

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.560
And it seems after each World Cup...

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.240
...when they drop out in the group stage

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:49.000
they always change the coach, it's always the same

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.560
Japanese TV experts always say...

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:02.860
...that Japanese football does not improve or evolve

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.960
I think there are two main reasons for that

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.020
Other than at a club...

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:21.620
...the national team should have a coach that speaks their language

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.840
Think of Brazil, Germany or France

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.480
Or any other successful nation

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.480
They all have a coach from that country or someone who at least speaks the language

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.500
I don't remember a German head coach that didn't speak German...

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:43.320
Never happened

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.540
And there's a reason for that

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:56.560
It's not just the language but also the mentality of the players that you need to understand

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:05.260
in order to make the players understand the kind of football you want them to play

00:02:05.282 --> 00:02:07.282
It also takes time

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.380
and every translation or interpretation always changes the meaning in a slight way

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.160
Which can have a huge impact

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.060
If you think about tactics with your players

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:30.140
or the game style

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:37.540
at the national team you don't have your players around every day like in a club

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.760
The players come from clubs all over the world

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:53.280
So when you have them with you, you need be really precise and have them understand what you want

00:02:53.440 --> 00:03:03.020
In Japan there are many good players like Honda, Nagatomo or Uchida

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.820
but they're not good as a team because of that

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:13.500
The other reason is that they change their coach so often

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:23.940
Every coach has a new system that players need to get used to

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.420
If that changes often the team will not improve

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:36.980
The always need to start from zero instead of taking a step forward

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.800
The Japanese team has a lot of potential

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:45.780
but they can't show it because of this

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:56.240
It's not a shame to lose against Brazil especially with Neymar

00:03:56.474 --> 00:04:11.994
but how they lost was not worth of a Japanese national team

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.240
How do you think about this?

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:24.800
Do you think they need someone with internation experience from outside?

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:30.220
Or wouldn't be someone like the coach of the women's team be better?

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:42.720
Sasaki-san is coaching them for years and in 2011 they have won the world cup

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:54.820
He had the time and ways to shape his team and make them play how he imagines

00:04:54.820 --> 00:05:00.640
And so the players themselves did improve as well

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.420
I think that does not happen with the male national team

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:16.780
Because they always change the coach and the coach doesn't know the language

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.500
Please let me know your opinion also if you don't like football

00:05:23.708 --> 00:05:28.948
Have a nice day and thanks for watching
