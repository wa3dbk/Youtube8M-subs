00:00:05.214 --> 00:00:09.030
My name is Dick Shornagel, I'm a motoring journalist and petrolhead.

00:00:09.827 --> 00:00:12.478
I love British cars.

00:00:12.696 --> 00:00:18.082
One year ago, I received a call from a car dealership I know,

00:00:19.274 --> 00:00:25.292
They were trading in a Silver Seraph, and asked me to buy it.

00:00:25.978 --> 00:00:31.728
I refused: I thought it was to modern and expensive.

00:00:32.365 --> 00:00:35.154
I did want a Rolls-Royce, but it had to be a very old one.

00:00:35.544 --> 00:00:41.894
They said: "It's a very nice one, and it's cheap as well".

00:00:41.894 --> 00:00:45.177
They were right: it was very, very beautiful.

00:00:45.177 --> 00:00:48.698
As for the inspection today: this morning, the seat belt broke.

00:00:49.243 --> 00:00:54.517
Let's hope the inspector doesn't notice.

00:01:00.054 --> 00:01:03.243
All kinds of problems could occure with such a complex car.

00:01:04.412 --> 00:01:08.104
But it feels like very good quality.

00:01:08.895 --> 00:01:14.701
Apart from the suspension, I found allmost nothing strange yet.

00:01:15.664 --> 00:01:25.084
Just after starting, it ran a bit irregular. Now, that's all gone.

00:01:25.868 --> 00:01:29.999
So I don't worry about that.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.970
So we'll see what happens during the inspection.

00:01:34.113 --> 00:01:42.608
I can't really say anything yet, because I'm not familiar with RR.

00:01:50.202 --> 00:01:58.098
This might be the first time we inspect a Rolls-Royce.

00:01:58.264 --> 00:02:03.096
It has done 280,000 km, so I'm very curious.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.303
There is a lot of tectyl on the bottom, to prevent rust.

00:02:20.173 --> 00:02:29.196
There's nothing wrong with the rear suspension, looks solid.

00:02:35.806 --> 00:02:39.779
At the front, there is this rattle I noticed while driving.

00:02:43.449 --> 00:02:48.434
There is a bar at the left that causes it, nothing too serious.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:56.702
Even here, it's very clean. Very nice to see!

00:03:01.461 --> 00:03:16.129
This tyre is worn, but only on the outside. The inner bit is ok.

00:03:16.278 --> 00:03:22.115
This shows there is something wrong with the suspension.

00:03:22.907 --> 00:03:29.495
It most likely has a positive toe on the front wheels.

00:03:42.435 --> 00:03:44.732
How often does a Rolls-Royce visit this garage?

00:03:45.178 --> 00:03:49.532
Never, but I did see this type of engine before.

00:03:50.106 --> 00:03:51.317
Is that because it comes from BMW?

00:03:51.317 --> 00:03:57.007
Exactly, it's a slightly outdated BMW V12. 

00:03:57.245 --> 00:03:59.857
How is the condition of the car?

00:04:00.125 --> 00:04:01.368
Actually, it's very good. 

00:04:01.368 --> 00:04:06.010
There is the rattle in the front suspension,

00:04:07.141 --> 00:04:11.139
Later, we found a tiny lack of straight-line stability.

00:04:11.442 --> 00:04:14.523
It leaks a little oil, and that's about it.

00:04:14.523 --> 00:04:16.991
Oh, and the tires are worn, but that's just maintanance.

00:04:17.543 --> 00:04:18.583
So, thumbs up then for this Rolls?

00:04:18.583 --> 00:04:23.144
Absolutely. Well... like this.

00:04:29.178 --> 00:04:36.592
I expected to hear something about the tires and the rattle,

00:04:37.385 --> 00:04:42.540
because I knew it was harmless, I left it the way it was.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.602
Soon, I'll fix it.

00:04:44.052 --> 00:04:48.007
The inspector was very strict,

00:04:48.007 --> 00:04:53.154
so I'm pretty sure I bought a good car.
