00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:09.819
the LibreOffice color palette is used
for font color

00:00:09.819 --> 00:00:15.349
highlighting and the background-color
it's the same palate

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.859
to all of these

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.179
features although there is nearly one
hundred different colors

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:22.529
there are still times when

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.949
you might want to customize one of these
colors or

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.779
add in your own color

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.289
to change our color palette

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:30.749
will need to go into

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:32.360
tools

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.000
options

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.280
then into colors

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:39.489
to change of color we need to

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:40.490
choose one

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.760
i'll choose this black in the upper
left-hand corner

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.640
we see black and black these are our colors

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.510
the red, green, and blue RGB are all set
to zero

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:53.540
perhaps i'll

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.110
change this to

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.160
two fifty-five

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.950
and now

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:01.670
we've changed the color to red

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.680
this was your original color

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.640
this lower one is the proposed color. 
If i want to update this to be the new

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.510
color i would just click on modify and that
will change this.  i don't want to change

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.419
the color

00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:16.750
so to go back to the original color

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.350
i would just click on it once again

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.990
it resets all the colors and our name
back to black

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.940
now what i want to make a custom
color

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:30.020
i'm going to call this

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.170
custom blue

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:38.049
I can create this by just by typing in these

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.700
RGB numbers, if i know what they are

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.040
two fifty five

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.310
and we can see the new propose color

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.500
is this blue color

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.430
i can also click edit

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:50.870
and it brings up this color chart

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.710
now how this works is

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.960
it's put this little dot

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.320
where my

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.389
custom color is right now, it's
probably tough to see

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:05.359
let me zoom in. perhaps you can see this
now this little dot here that i can drag

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:06.860
this around

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.499
and make this whatever color I see in here

00:02:11.499 --> 00:02:14.219
to red to the blue to the green

00:02:14.219 --> 00:02:15.229
back to red

00:02:15.229 --> 00:02:18.079
now this is tell me the new proposed
color

00:02:18.079 --> 00:02:21.509
if i click okay right now it will be this
purplish color

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:23.309
we also have this

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:27.119
color chart here that we can kind of
play with

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:29.379
to choose this color red

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.139
i'd would click this

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:37.389
right arrow saying - bring this circle to
where this color red is clicking

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:39.279
the arrow

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:42.079
we see it turns right to red

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:45.709
i can change it to this blue that's in
this corner

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.579
and it's that blue right there

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.379
two fifty five

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:55.209
to make it the green

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.930
now there's another arrow

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.579
to use this

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:01.900
i can't take my little

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.579
ball here are my little dot

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:06.909
place it into a color

00:03:06.909 --> 00:03:09.859
then click the left arrow

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:11.460
and it turned this corner

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.319
into this color right here

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:18.309
and i could drag this down to the white

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:20.989
if i make this corner white

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.309
now click the left arrow

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:24.750
it brings this white

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:26.880
to this side and it gives me a little

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.700
change of colors there more to choose
from and i'll say okay maybe i'd like

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.709
this color right here

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.419
i'll crick it back

00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:36.909
from the left to the right

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:41.239
and now  i've got this orange color

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:44.589
these three in the center of the red
green blue

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:48.059
those are the same that are on the

00:03:48.059 --> 00:03:50.519
other RGB that we saw

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:54.429
on the dialog box just before this

00:03:54.429 --> 00:03:58.559
the cyan/magenta color in key these...
you can play with them in a changes the

00:03:58.559 --> 00:04:02.279
colors but they all come down to
whatever these are

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:06.629
the only ones that may play a little
difference are maybe this brightness

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:13.629
if I turn this way up we can see it going
higher or I can bring it down

00:04:14.369 --> 00:04:18.169
see now there's no real white color
around here though

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:21.199
for me to drag into

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.380
but that doesn't mean that it's not
available i would just take this white

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.639
in the corner here

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.150
or i could type in the numbers i can
lower these numbers

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.790
that's just different ways to play
around t get to color choice that you

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:35.940
want

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.580
going back to my custom blue

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:45.389
i'm going to make it this very light
colored blue

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.830
and click ok

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.219
and let's zoom out

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:54.199
to create my new custom blue color

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:57.270
i'm going to click add

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.610
we see it added it right here

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.810
clicking back in the black its black
here's my new custom blue, my new color

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:07.240
i can modify this calor

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.099
i can edit

00:05:09.099 --> 00:05:12.960
going and bringing up that color wheel or i can
type in the numbers here

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:19.960
i want to add another custom color
we will call this custom red

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:23.669
I will make it similar to this red color here

00:05:23.669 --> 00:05:25.729
notice when i click that red it

00:05:25.729 --> 00:05:27.080
blew-away my title

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.139
so i need to type that in again

00:05:30.139 --> 00:05:35.520
and to change things around will make
this one two hundred

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.419
and this one two hundred

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:40.669
so there's my customer red

00:05:40.669 --> 00:05:43.340
going to add that

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.860
we need to scroll down to see it

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.560
so i got my custom red

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.460
and custom blue

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.110
if i don't like this custom blue

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.580
and delete it

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.669
clicking this delete it gives me one
more chance to say do you really want to

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:00.259
delete this color

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:02.189
i'll say yes

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:06.119
now that's gone are custom red this in
the lower right

00:06:06.119 --> 00:06:08.620
lcicking okay

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:09.460
looking at our

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:11.889
color palette for background-color

00:06:11.889 --> 00:06:13.310
we see in the lower right

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:14.999
custom red

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:18.779
well what happens if i had left that
custom blue in their let me add that

00:06:18.779 --> 00:06:25.779
back in real quick

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.749
now when we look at

00:06:38.749 --> 00:06:42.309
the background-color

00:06:42.309 --> 00:06:44.900
we need to scroll down

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:47.249
on the next row

00:06:47.249 --> 00:06:49.259
it is also in

00:06:49.259 --> 00:06:52.330
are font color

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.219
and it is also

00:06:55.219 --> 00:07:00.409
updated in our spreadsheet calc

00:07:00.409 --> 00:07:02.669
here it is custom red

00:07:02.669 --> 00:07:03.500
and custom blue
