&gt;&gt;Michael This is a major statement about

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:05.750
what this university thinks of its students.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.640
This is the Mitchell and Hilarie Morgan Residential
and Dining Complex at Temple University.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:17.019
There are two buildings, the tower which is
our 27-story residential building which will

00:00:17.019 --> 00:00:20.829
be predominantly seniors and juniors and sophomores.

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:27.210
The south building which we call the midrise
or Morgan South, is actually going to be predominantly

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.470
first-year students or freshman.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:42.690
[music]
&gt;&gt;Michael We've been working on this for about

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.710
4 years in conjunction with our colleagues
from Facilities Management.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.670
If I was a student I'd absolutely want to
be here.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.300
It's an awesome facility.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.680
The terrace level, the landscaping, the fact
that you have a great combination of landscaping

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.660
and hardscape, greenery, grass, trees.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.240
They're going to pay attention to the lighting
and how open and airy the space is, tall ceilings,

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:09.100
great furniture.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.939
[music]
&gt;&gt;Michael These fireplaces in the lobbies

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:18.549
which will be nice during the winter, the
audio visual technology will allow for everything

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:25.359
from movies to music, meeting space, and dining
on top of that all so, we believe it brings

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:32.340
a lot of value to campus, not just for Morgan
residents, but the entire Temple community.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.749
[music]
&gt;&gt;Michael The dominant room style is a two-bedroom

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:44.439
four-person unit that has two bathrooms.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.759
There's a 42-inch television in each of the
living rooms, and the kitchens which will

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.270
allow them to cook and congregate around a
table.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.719
It's an investment that will pay dividends
with regard to the student engagement experience

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:02.009
at Temple for years to come.

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:07.090
[music]
&gt;&gt;Michael This building specifically says

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.720
that the student residential, and dining,
and the overall student experience at Temple

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.310
University means something and that we as
a university take it very seriously.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.780
I think that it is going to be beacon in North
Philadelphia and at Temple for a very long

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:26.590
time that adds significant value to the Temple
residential experience.
