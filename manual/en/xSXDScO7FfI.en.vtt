[Constance Whiston]
When I started fly-fishing in Texas, I thought

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:10.010
I had to learn how to tie flies.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.619
But I found out that I could get flies on
the internet.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:18.370
I could also go to my local fly fishing club,
and visit with the members there and learn

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:20.449
all I needed to know about flies.

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.390
I could also go to my fly-fishing store in
my hometown.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.279
The club is a good idea to visit because they’ll
tell you what the fish are eating in your

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.279
area.

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:32.829
And that’s the most important thing to know.

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.590
What are the fish dining on?

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.140
What are they gonna eat?

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.199
So the flies are tied to match the type of
food that the fish is eating.

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.850
One of the most popular flies is this hard-body-popper.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.010
Warm water fly-fishers love to use these because
the fish will literally leap out of the water

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.370
to go after this fly.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.420
But if they are not feeding on the surface,
you might want to try a sub-surface fly like

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.800
this black–bead-head- woolybooger.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.170
Or maybe how about a green and white clouser?

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.489
These are very popular too for warm water
fly fishing.

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.140
There’s a large variety of flies that you
can use in warm water, sponge-buds, poppers,

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:12.440
damsel flies.

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.140
But maybe you want to fish for rainbow trout
at the Guadalupe River.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:20.110
There too you can fish at different levels.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:25.460
Fly-fishing is not all done on the surface,
so you may want to use sub-surface flies like

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.910
these bead-head-nymphs, or these egg patterns.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.750
If you’re going down to the Texas Gulf Coast,
you might want to try a pencil-popper, or

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.070
a little pink shrimp pattern, or maybe this
crab pattern.

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.950
That’s a real popular fly to use on the
Gulf Coast.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.200
So no matter where you’re fishing, you need
to know what type of food the fish are eating.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.200
And the best way to find that out is from
your local fly-fishing club, or people in

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.140
the area that fish that water.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.100
Find out what the fish are eating and travel
to the area with the flies that the fish will

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:59.100
dine on.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.250
You want to make sure that you go prepared
when you’re out fly fishing Texas.
