00:00:00.514 --> 00:00:03.538
(synth music)

00:00:03.538 --> 00:00:04.545
- [Radio Host] 7-Eleven
will be giving away

00:00:04.545 --> 00:00:07.001
great prizes all summer
long including samples

00:00:07.001 --> 00:00:08.979
of 7-Eleven's new Slurpuccino,

00:00:08.979 --> 00:00:10.443
where cappuccino meets Slurpee.

00:00:10.443 --> 00:00:11.858
- I don't know what's more
amazing about this video,

00:00:11.858 --> 00:00:15.347
the awesome power of nature
revealed in the towering vortex,

00:00:15.347 --> 00:00:16.556
- Or the fact that their radio personality

00:00:16.556 --> 00:00:19.723
keeps babbling on about a Slurpuccino.

00:00:21.426 --> 00:00:23.939
(synth music)

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.683
Because as amazing as a Slurpee

00:00:25.683 --> 00:00:27.291
and cappuccino hybrid might be,

00:00:27.291 --> 00:00:29.821
these twisting storm
columns can reach windspeeds

00:00:29.821 --> 00:00:34.356
of 318 miles per hour,
512 kilometers per hour,

00:00:34.356 --> 00:00:36.629
and measure miles across,
scarring the earth

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.196
and decimating homes and
buildings in the process.

00:00:39.196 --> 00:00:40.085
- [Robert] In some parts of the world,

00:00:40.085 --> 00:00:41.860
these powerful storms
are a regular occurrence.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.580
The United States alone experiences

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.685
more than 1,000 tornadoes a year,

00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:47.068
and the storms have been reported

00:00:47.068 --> 00:00:48.723
on every content except Antarctica.

00:00:48.723 --> 00:00:49.698
- [Julie] But how do they work, right?

00:00:49.698 --> 00:00:51.045
There's more going on here than a mere

00:00:51.045 --> 00:00:53.005
house-to-witch delivery system.

00:00:53.005 --> 00:00:54.852
- [Robert] If you've ever
watched a whirlpool form

00:00:54.852 --> 00:00:56.366
in your bathtub or sink
while draining the water,

00:00:56.366 --> 00:00:58.828
then you've witnessed the
fundamentals of a tornado at work.

00:00:58.828 --> 00:01:00.762
A drain's whirlpool,
also known as a vortex,

00:01:00.762 --> 00:01:02.132
forms because of the downdraft

00:01:02.132 --> 00:01:04.234
that the drain creates
in the body of water.

00:01:04.234 --> 00:01:05.314
The downward flow of the water

00:01:05.314 --> 00:01:06.612
into the drain begins to rotate,

00:01:06.612 --> 00:01:09.122
and as the rotation
speeds up, a vortex forms.

00:01:09.122 --> 00:01:10.804
- [Julie] Why does the
water start rotating?

00:01:10.804 --> 00:01:12.947
Imagine yourself as a
particle in the water,

00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:16.099
suddenly pulled toward the
suction that the drain creates.

00:01:16.099 --> 00:01:18.874
At first you'd find yourself
accelerating toward the drain,

00:01:18.874 --> 00:01:21.231
then, quite literally, there's a twist.

00:01:21.231 --> 00:01:22.571
- [Robert] Because of
your previous momentum

00:01:22.571 --> 00:01:23.756
and the number of other particles

00:01:23.756 --> 00:01:25.811
rushing towards the
drain at the same time,

00:01:25.811 --> 00:01:27.284
chances are that you're
going to be pushed off

00:01:27.284 --> 00:01:30.025
to one side of the point
of suction when you arrive.

00:01:30.025 --> 00:01:31.633
That deflection sets
you on a spiraling path

00:01:31.633 --> 00:01:33.996
into the point of suction, like a moth

00:01:33.996 --> 00:01:35.677
spiraling in toward a light.

00:01:35.677 --> 00:01:37.333
Once the spiral has
started in one direction,

00:01:37.333 --> 00:01:39.435
it tends to influence
all the other particles

00:01:39.435 --> 00:01:40.306
as they arrive.

00:01:40.306 --> 00:01:42.291
A very strong spiraling
tendency is created.

00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:44.381
Eventually, there's
enough spiraling energy

00:01:44.381 --> 00:01:45.594
to create a vortex.

00:01:45.594 --> 00:01:47.652
- [Julie] In a tornado, the
same sort of thing happens

00:01:47.652 --> 00:01:50.364
as with our bathtub
example, except with air

00:01:50.364 --> 00:01:51.394
instead of water.

00:01:51.394 --> 00:01:52.988
A great deal of the Earth's wind patterns

00:01:52.988 --> 00:01:54.563
are dictated by low pressure centers,

00:01:54.563 --> 00:01:57.019
which draw in cooler, high-pressure air

00:01:57.019 --> 00:01:58.364
from the surrounding area.

00:01:58.364 --> 00:02:00.484
- [Robert] This airflow
pushes the low-pressure air

00:02:00.484 --> 00:02:02.798
up to higher altitudes,
but then the air heats up

00:02:02.798 --> 00:02:05.285
and is pushed upward as
well by the air behind it.

00:02:05.285 --> 00:02:08.002
The air pressure inside a
tornado is as much as 10% lower

00:02:08.002 --> 00:02:09.613
than that of the surrounding air,

00:02:09.613 --> 00:02:12.237
causing that surrounding
air to rush in even faster.

00:02:12.237 --> 00:02:14.381
- [Julie] The result is
pure atmospheric power.

00:02:14.381 --> 00:02:17.757
Even a weak F0 twister on the Fujita scale

00:02:17.757 --> 00:02:19.420
can reach wind speeds of up to

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:23.620
72 miles per hour, 116
kilometers per hour,

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.204
which can rip shallow rooted
trees from the ground,

00:02:26.204 --> 00:02:29.468
damage signposts, traffic
signals, and even chimneys.

00:02:29.468 --> 00:02:30.467
And a mighty F5?

00:02:30.467 --> 00:02:34.147
Well, with windspeeds up
to 318 miles per hour,

00:02:34.147 --> 00:02:37.588
512 kilometers per hour,
that's when you see cars

00:02:37.588 --> 00:02:40.756
become projectiles, houses
turn to splintered kindling,

00:02:40.756 --> 00:02:43.340
and even steel-reinforced
concrete structures

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:44.948
suffer some serious damage.

00:02:44.948 --> 00:02:46.916
So there you go, the
power and the grandeur

00:02:46.916 --> 00:02:48.756
of a tornado, explained.

00:02:48.756 --> 00:02:50.180
- Now for my part, I grew up in kind of a

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.605
tornado alley, so I see footage like this,

00:02:52.605 --> 00:02:54.796
or I see anything in
the sky even resembling

00:02:54.796 --> 00:02:57.500
a vortex, and I start
freaking out a little bit.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.492
But what about you guys and gals?

00:02:58.492 --> 00:03:00.386
What do you think when you
see these awesome clips?
