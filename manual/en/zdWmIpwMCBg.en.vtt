00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.840
On the battlefield, it’s not just humans
and machines...

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.000
You’re watching Beyond The Trailer’s review of Max...

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.600
Air Bud is one of Disney’s most successful
franchises due to its incredibly high profit

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.130
margin - cheap to make, almost all profit.
But dogs don’t actually play sports. They

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.640
do, however, fight wars. Yes, not only do
the Marines use dogs on the Battlefield, but

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:58.400
dogs have been used in warfare since Ancient
Egypt! While primarily used as guards, dogs

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:03.680
were sometimes used to attack enemy soldiers
- especially those on horseback! Dogs were

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.420
even outfitted with their own version of armor.
Today, they still wear special body armor!

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.750
And in 2011, a Military Working Dog - their
official title when serving with the US Marines

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.270
- was part of Operation Neptune Spear where
Osama bin Laden was located and killed. The

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.910
Belgian Malinois, named Cairo, was there to
find hidden rooms and doors, as well as deter

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:29.230
and delay any Pakistani forces who might come
to Bin Laden’s aid. Cairo is one of five

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:33.780
hundred and thirty dogs currently in active
duty. And there’s one dog that has a story

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.890
very similar to Max’s. LEX was a real dog
serving in the Iraq war when, in 2007, he

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.360
and his handler Dustin J Lee came under attack.
Lee was mortally wounded while Lex also was

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.770
wounded, yet he refused to leave Lee’s side
and had to ultimately be dragged away by other

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.850
military servicemen and personnel. While Lex
recovered and was able to return to duty,

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.570
Lee’s parents submitted a request to adopt
him, which gained national attention. Finally,

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.780
at the end of the same year that their son
was killed in Iraq, the US Marines officially

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:12.990
released Lex to the Lees. So while this movie
might take a few Hollywood liberties, at its

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.670
soul it does represent real life humans and
dogs who put their lives on the line for their

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:23.720
country, and forge bonds as strong as those
between human soldiers. And Max has a solid

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.700
Hollywood pedigree as well, written and directed
by Boaz Yakin who previously directed Remember

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.120
the Titans and Uptown Girls, as well as co-wrote
Now You See Me. It also stars Thomas Haden

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.440
Church, Lauren Graham, and newcomer Josh Wiggins
- as well as Robbie Amell, cousin of Stephen Amell

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.000
hot off of the CW’s DC shows as well
as  The DUFF.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.026
So while yeah, the Air Bud movies are a lot of fun,

00:02:46.026 --> 00:02:48.702
in the same year as mega-hit American Sniper,

00:02:48.718 --> 00:02:52.318
can Warner Bros offer a more meaningful alternative?
