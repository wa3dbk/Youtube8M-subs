00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.510
With the number of people that are using on stage monitor mix systems

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:24.240
and in-ear monitor mixer systems in the church market, the number of

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.630
on stage wedge monitors is becoming less and less. And that's  a great

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.630
thing because you get less sound on the platform. And it makes for a cleaner

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:35.730
mix. However for the vocalist out front, we're still using a lot of wedges.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:41.360
And so, you're looking for a nice, small, compact, clean and clear wedge monitor.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.540
And the new MX Series from Community might just fit that bill.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.670
Comes in an 8-inch version &amp; then a 10-inch version, which I'll show you in just a second here.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.720
Now the difference here and what makes them so compact and small...You can see

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.880
I can lift this thing, you can see the relative size is very compact,

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.770
is that they're a co-ax monitor. What the "co-ax" means is you've got an 8-inch

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:06.010
or 10-inch woofer, and then inside at the center, there's your high-frequnecy driver.

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.250
It gives you 2 things: the compact size, but also excellent mid-range sound.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.160
Because the sound wave is emanating both at the low frequencies and the high frequencies,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:21.460
from the center. That means that you get a nice wide coverage, because you reduce the amount

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.360
of interference between a high-frequency driver which is located off to the side

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.590
and a low-frequency driver which is separated from it. So the co-ax gives you,

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.880
at the crossover frequency, smooth coverage...and you've got about 120 degree

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.130
wide coverage here as well. So you can run 2 or 3 singers off of

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.440
1 monitor. Where a lot of wedge monitors are designed for rock and roll,

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.700
very narrow coverage. So the MX Series, the MX8 and the MX10,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.790
might be a great choice for front-of-house use. You can see how compact they are.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.340
They come...the Neutrik NL connectors on the back. Pretty standard these days.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.930
And the nice thing, you can see how they've sloped the back off like this so

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:03.770
that the NL connector that goes in...will not hit on the floor.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.770
So you can go ahead and put that on the floor. I'll show you the

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.260
relative size difference here. Here's the MX8. Here's the MX10, still very compact as well.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.930
That's the Community MX Series MX8 and MX10 floor wedge coaxial monitors.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:27.000
