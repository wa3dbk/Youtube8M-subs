00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:14.700
hi today we learn how to make tulips for
this you will need a straight thick wire

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:21.720
a thin flexible wire scissors pencil glue
black color

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:28.259
pips floral tape green colored crepe 
paper and any color crepepaper for the flower

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.579
you need to cut out stencils for this
which are all measured in centimeters

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.949
the first stencil is a petal you need to cut
out six pieces of it

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:43.410
the second stencil is of flower base we need
to cut one piece of it

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.199
the third stencils is of leaves and you need to cut out two pieces of it

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:53.550
you place the stencil vertically
according to the grain of the crepe

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.629
paper trace it out and cut it out and
they look like this

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:07.090
you take one of the petals you place
both your thumb and your index finger

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.210
in the middle of it and you push
it out

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:16.900
this called is cupping you've got the whole
flower like this and you crimp that is

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.900
pull the top of the flower in the opposite
directions

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:28.000
and its called crimping after you cupped and crimped the flowers it look like this

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.390
you take the flower base and you stretch
it and then you fold it into half

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:45.700
now you take the thick straight wire and
you applied glue on its top and then you

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.700
stick this strip around the wire like
this

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.600
roll it

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.180
and stick the end using glue

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.290
after you've stuck the strip you take
the pips and we put them around the

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.290
strip

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:34.440
and then using a thin flexible wire you
tie it around the base of the strip to

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.440
tight in the pips

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.700
twist it

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:52.990
and this is how it will look you take one of the petals and you apply glue on its base

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.689
and then you stick it on the strip

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:09.219
you do the same for the other two petals
 sticking them in a rotation after

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:10.840
you stuck the three petals

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.579
it looks like this now you take the thin
flexible wire and you tie it around the

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:24.790
base of the flower and then twist it

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:31.170
and look like this you take rest of the three petals and you stick them in a similar manner

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:37.349
you apply glue on the base and you stick
them in between the gap of the petals

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.349
other petals

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.610
you do the same for the other two petals
and then you

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:50.460
wind flexible wire around the base after you stuck all the

00:03:50.460 --> 00:03:52.410
petals it will look like this

00:03:52.410 --> 00:04:01.020
now you take the green floral tape and you start winding it around the wire from

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:07.470
the base of the flower you take the leaf
and using a pair of scissors you make a

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:10.470
slit at its base of half centimeter

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.310
now you the stick the leaves on the
flower leaving a gap or 15 centimeters

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.490
from the base of the flower and then you
wind the tape around the leaf

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:38.710
you do the same for the second leaf

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:45.880
after you stuck the tape it look like
this

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.750
and here's your tulip thanks for watching our video
