00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:23.130
Hello and welcome my name is Nate from Video
Games Recon and in this series of videos I

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.430
will be discussing all of the weapons from
call of duty ghosts, giving my opinion on

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.580
the weapon in question and it's characteristics,
keep in mind this video will probably be released

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:41.030
before any patches so the guns my change somewhat
by the time you watch this video and as an

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:42.030
F.Y.I.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.670
This series was filmed before I had prestieged
and thus obviously didn't have all the weapons

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:53.570
available to compare so most of the footage
in this series will feature bots also all

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.239
weapons in this series will have like for
like attachments where possible to try and

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:04.910
make the comparison fair anywho enough of
my jibba jabba, and without any further adieu

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.090
let's do it to it.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:17.031
M9A1
The first handgun to review is the M9A1 this

00:01:17.031 --> 00:01:22.860
feels like a very well rounded gun even though
its stats tell a different story, it has high

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.130
damage and large clips for its class and is
a very accessable pistol for people not use

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.550
to using handguns and is a pleasure to use.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:42.439
MP-444 Grach
The Grach is a solid and balanced pistol with

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:48.509
low recoil and 15 rounds in a mag as standard
and has the highest fire rate in its class,

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:54.479
the first 3 handguns are all very similar
weapons so which one suits you better is more

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:00.450
a matter of preference than anything else
but for me this is the least satisfying gun

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:06.200
as it's a little weak and feels cheap compared
to most other guns in this category and ends

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:13.140
up feeling like a poor mans P226.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:21.790
P226
The P226 is a very balanced weapon with the

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.540
largest magazine of all pistols and comes
with great damage, range and further more

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:34.400
is very satisfying to use, on the downside
it has a fair amount of recoil but all pistols

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.030
aside from one handgun has recoil that is
easily manageable so this isn't really that

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.530
big of a deal.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:53.120
.44 Magnum
The magnum has the best range and by far the

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.019
most power of any pistol and as it is a revolver
it has 6 rounds in a magazine.

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:05.340
On the negative side it has the slowest fire
rate and mobility compared to all other weapons

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.970
in this category, however those points are
kinda irrelevant as the thing that really

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.580
holds this weapon back is the unmanageable
amount of recoil which makes it really hard

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:22.420
to hit anything after firing the first shot,
that aside this gun is kinda meant to be a

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:28.760
bit of a novelty and thus probably isn't a
secondary to rely on but is most definitely

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:40.000
the go to choice if you want to have some
fun.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.650
PDW
The PDW is a 3 round burst fire handgun which

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.720
comes with 18 rounds in a mag and supposedly
has a high fire rate and moderate recoil,

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:58.050
making this weapon very similar in design
to the B23R from black ops 2, however that's

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:04.360
where the similarity ends as this gun doesn't
really work as it's not all that powerful

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.159
and the fire rate between each burst is really
slow also due to the fact that your firing

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:16.260
3 rounds at a time the clip capacity is more
like 6 rounds in a magazine instead of 18

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:22.400
and to top it off this gun isn't all that
fun to use, so in my opinion I'd steer clear

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:38.010
unless this weapon gets buffed at a later
date.

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:43.010
So that's my thoughts and analysis of the
handgun class so far, this category can be

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:49.330
genuinely useful as a secondary weapon or
even as a primary in the right situations

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:54.789
assuming you have set up your perks correctly
and have a tac knife, on the other hand you

00:04:54.789 --> 00:05:00.290
may wish to have no secondary and take an
extra perk instead, this decision is purely

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.399
up to personal preference and you should set
up your load-out as to which of these strategies

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:07.909
most suits your play style.

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:13.080
Anywho as I touched on at the start of this
video it's still early days in life of call

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:19.050
of duty ghosts so my opinions on these guns
my change over time, but for now this how

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:25.540
I feel about the characteristics and usefulness
of the weapons available so far, with that

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:31.830
being said it's now time again to pick a best
and worst gun in this category.

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:40.060
So my favourite handgun is a bit of a tricky
one as the first 3 pistols are all very similar,

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:46.870
I'll rule out the grach as it feels to me
near identical to the P226 except for being

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:55.520
slightly worse in most if not all areas, next
the M9A1, this is the most accessible for

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:01.039
people not used to using a pistol and is one
of the most enjoyable to use but lacks the

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:08.180
power accuracy and range of the P226, so as
you've already guessed the best gun in this

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:14.219
class is the P226 which is outstanding in
all areas.

00:06:14.219 --> 00:06:20.360
As for the worst, this is a battle between
the magnum and the PDW as both aren't that

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:27.340
useful due to either ridiculous recoil or
a slow fire rate, however I'd have to give

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:32.700
the wooden spoon to the PDW as at least the
novelty factor of the magnum makes it fun

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.700
to use .

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:41.330
So that was my opinion on the weapons in call
of duty ghosts, feel free to leave your thoughts

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:45.950
