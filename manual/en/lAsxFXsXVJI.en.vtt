00:00:06.010 --> 00:00:09.550
The Inland Empire is home to more than
four million people,

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.660
the thirteenth most populous
metropolitan area in the United States,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.119
and the third largest in California.

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.150
Not only is the area one of the most
populous, it is also one of the fastest

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.800
growing regions in the United States,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.619
increasing by almost thirty percent in
the last decade.

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:30.710
Like all areas of its size, the
Inland Empire shares many of the usual

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.640
big-city issues:

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.560
transportation, economic development, and
education.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:37.830
But sadly,

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.920
the Inland Empire suffers from one
problem that does not affect her equally

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.850
sized sisters.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.409
We in Inland Southern California

00:00:46.409 --> 00:00:49.400
have less than half the primary care doctors
we need.

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.860
In some areas of the Coachella Valley,
for instance, there's only one primary care

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.920
doctor for nine thousand patients. When
you get to that degree of shortage,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.720
they are no longer doing primary
care, they're just doing urgent care. 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.930
And that's one of the reasons why Inland
Southern California

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.000
is in the bottom quartile of every
measurable health outcome in the state.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.470
How many providers do we have today?

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.430
Fred Deharo sees the problems caused
by this shortage daily

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.460
at the Desert Hot Springs Community 
Health Center.

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.080
If you take this community
of approximately

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.749
thirty to thirty-five 
thousand residents,

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.560
we have one and a half physicians

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.920
providing services for the community.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.159
So you're looking at about
eighteen thousand

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:32.940
residents to each physician.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:37.610
Numbers like these put tremendous
pressure on clinics like this one.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.970
In Coachella,

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:46.520
Dr. Randolph Gibbs is one such provider.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:51.439
We're still in need, you know, we need people
to commit, to come on out and

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:54.840
get involved.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.770
At Kids Come First in Ontario,

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.299
they see children who have
no primary care doctor.

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:16.909
Good morning. How are we doing today? Beverly Speak is the
executive director of Kids Come First.

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:19.529
A lot of the children that come to us have come

00:02:19.529 --> 00:02:22.799
because otherwise they would have had to
go to an emergency room

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:26.949
and wait many many hours. They don't have
a primary care giver, they don't have a

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:30.040
family doctor, they don't have somebody 
that they can trust

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.590
to ask questions.

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.489
It gets worse.

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.099
The shortage will become even more
critical as new people enter the system

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.090
under the new

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.790
federal health care reform law.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:46.889
Bradley Gilbert is the CEO of the
Inland Empire Health Plan.

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:51.559
He believes the impact of the health
care reform law will be substantial. 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:53.399
It's going to have a really huge impact.

00:02:53.399 --> 00:02:56.499
You've got approximately two hundred thousand
people that are going to get coverage through

00:02:56.499 --> 00:03:00.639
Medicaid, or medical as it's called in California.
You've got another three hundred

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:05.029
thousand who will be eligible for coverage
under what's called the health exchange.

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:08.809
so you're talking about five hundred thousand
people who are currently not covered, have

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:10.209
no insurance,

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:11.899
having access to

00:03:11.899 --> 00:03:15.549
healthcare coverage, and therefore access to
physicians, hospitals, etc. 

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:18.309
So you look at five hundred thousand new people

00:03:18.309 --> 00:03:21.499
potentially suddenly having access to physicians,

00:03:21.499 --> 00:03:24.929
if you don't have enough now and you add five hundred
thousand people it's going to make things difficult

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:29.319
in terms of access for appointments,
doctors ability to spend

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:32.639
the time they need and care for the
patience that they currently have.

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.059
I'm on my way to go visit a member and
according to our records her

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:39.519
children are due for well child visits.

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:43.189
Delia Orosco works with an
innovative program designed to help

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:46.459
people access healthcare in Victorville.

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:53.459
She actually travels to patients' homes
to help them navigate the medical system.

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:04.779
Innovative programs like health
navigators can help,

00:04:04.779 --> 00:04:07.399
but there's only so much that can be
done if there are just 

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:09.479
not enough doctors.

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:13.970
According to Dr. G. Richard Olds, the answer
is a new medical school

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:17.120
at the University of California,
Riverside.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.579
But not just any medical school.

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.330
Just having a medical school is not
enough.

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:27.940
We need doctors to go into the fields
of medicine that we need in this area,

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:32.120
and we need them to stay and practice 
in this area. So what we're doing here

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:34.889
at UCR is actually building a
pipeline

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.809
that includes a medical school. 

00:04:36.809 --> 00:04:37.860
We are

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:41.739
drawing as many highly qualified
students as we came from our own geographic

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:42.710
area,

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.020
and because this geographic area has the
lowest college going rate,

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:50.550
the lowest standardized test scores, etc.
that's a challenge in and of itself. 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.289
We're then going to recruit them into our medical
school with a somewhat different

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:55.650
orientation.

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:59.169
And just what is this somewhat
different orientation?

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:02.069
We have a somewhat different approach.
We're not building our own university

00:05:02.069 --> 00:05:03.529
hospital. In fact,

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:04.860
what we're doing is we're

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:09.319
partnering with the existing health care
facilities, the existing doctors, the

00:05:09.319 --> 00:05:11.870
existing federally qualified health care
centers,

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.259
to get them all working together

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.780
to educate the next generation of
physicians.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:21.550
Dr. Olds believes that UCR is
uniquely qualified for this mission

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:22.909
because of what,

00:05:22.909 --> 00:05:24.749
and who, it is. 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:26.809
Of all the Universities of California,

00:05:26.809 --> 00:05:28.289
for which there is ten,

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:30.240
this is the school

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.930
that has the highest number of students

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:33.910
that are first in their

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:36.189
families to go to college.

00:05:36.189 --> 00:05:37.520
This is

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:41.969
the UC that has the greatest
diversity of its students, it's the sixth

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:43.930
most diverse undergraduate campus in the

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.709
United States, and this is the UC

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:52.899
that enjoys the best town-gown
relationship. We are the UC for Inland Southern

00:05:52.899 --> 00:05:55.059
Californian and we're strongly supported

00:05:55.059 --> 00:05:56.280
by our communities.

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.300
Dr olds' enthusiasm is so infectious

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.360
that people from across the country have
joined his staff

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:03.699
to share his vision.

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:05.199
When you

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:07.439
see traditional medicine,

00:06:07.439 --> 00:06:10.969
you don't have many opportunities to
change

00:06:10.969 --> 00:06:14.850
the curricula. You don't have many opportunities to
change

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:15.719
the way

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:19.210
medicine is delivered.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:22.659
With this new school and with
this mission,

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:28.219
the sky is the limit as to what you
can do with the

00:06:28.219 --> 00:06:31.259
way that you train students and the way that you
teach students. You can have a 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:34.270
huge impact on the

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:38.550
community.

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:42.759
As construction continues, and ideas and
methods solidify,

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:45.250
economic concerns are paramount,

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:50.129
and not just for the medical school.
So if we can even capture a fraction

00:06:50.129 --> 00:06:52.490
of the current health care

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.229
activities that are leaving our region,

00:06:55.229 --> 00:06:58.029
we'll have a huge economic bone in this area.

00:06:58.029 --> 00:07:02.100
Plus research shows that business
follows doctors,

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:05.120
So for each new doctor who stays in
the area,

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:09.150
a new one million dollar small
business will be added to the Inland

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:10.550
Empire.

00:07:10.550 --> 00:07:12.309
Everyone wins.

00:07:12.309 --> 00:07:13.970
If we don't act now,

00:07:13.970 --> 00:07:18.860
access to health care will get even
worse for the residents of the Inland Empire.

00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:22.309
Now is the time to open this medical
school.

00:07:22.309 --> 00:07:26.079
The vast majority of the money that we
are currently raising to open this med

00:07:26.079 --> 00:07:28.459
school comes from our own communities,

00:07:28.459 --> 00:07:30.129
and I think that that's a

00:07:30.129 --> 00:07:30.849
reflection

00:07:30.849 --> 00:07:32.409
of how strong

00:07:32.409 --> 00:07:36.069
our communities not only want a med school,
but want this med school.
