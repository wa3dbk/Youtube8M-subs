00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.840
How do we measure a man's life?

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.760
Don't get a guy like this for me.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.580
I want someone with a little bit of... gravitas.

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.340
I'll see if James Earl Jones is available.

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:13.420
That would be nice.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.200
A time to die...

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.600
A time to reap...

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.880
A time to sow...

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.220
A time to mourn...

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.140
A time to heal.

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:27.700
A time for every purpose under heaven.

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:31.040
And so we say goodbye to Charles Francis Harper.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:35.400
Devoted son, loving brother, caring uncle.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.060
Bon vivant and world-class connoisseur of the booty.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:43.460
Nice turnout.

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:47.700
Yeah. Standing room only.

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:50.380
Goes to show you, give the people what they want.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.900
You mean the open bar, right?

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:54.660
Sure.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:00.000
Thanks for coming, by the way.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.280
You came to mine.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:03.300
Yeah, but you're dead.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.880
Charlie, take a look in the box.

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.760
That's not a tanning booth.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:09.640
Oh, yeah.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.160
So listen, as long as you're here...

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:14.540
What's heaven like?

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:15.840
It's unbelievable.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.120
It's paradise.

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.980
Like your house, before your brother moved in.

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.780
Oh, that was good.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.160
You can drink all you want, no hangover.

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:27.140
Endless supply of women, each one more beautiful than the last.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.340
And Charlie, get this. They believe everything you tell them.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.340
Everything?

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.460
It's heaven, dude.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.740
Wow.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.620
Well, save me a good seat.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.560
I wish I could, but that's not where they sent me.

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:42.740
Oh...

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.660
Then how do you know what heaven is like?

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.980
They make us look at a video every day while they're putting lube on the pitchfork.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.860
Well, at least, you get lube.

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.580
Only on the middle prong.

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.440
To be completely honest...

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:04.480
I didn't know Charlie Harper.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:06.300
But any man...

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.740
who, with his dying breath, would set aside $25,000

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.580
and a first-class air ticket so I could deliver his eulogy...

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.060
is aces in my book!

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.180
That being said

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.960
there are many people here today who did know Charlie and perhaps

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.580
some of them would like to stand up and say a few words.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.960
Oh, oh! I wanna say something.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.940
Eh...

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.880
Hello everybody.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.580
Hello James Earl Jones.

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.920
Ehm...

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:38.560
Hey bro. Don't get up.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.800
What can I say about Charlie?

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.700
So many words come to mind.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.900
So few that you can say in church.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.740
But we'll give it a shot.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.940
Ehm, Charlie was a man of love.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.200
Ehm, he loved his friends.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.000
He loved his family.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:00.520
But most of all...

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.040
he loved his penis.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.520
The only part of him that ever had an actual job.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.800
Eh, anyway...

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.860
This was a man, so full of love, that it practically oozed out of him.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:18.640
Eh, at which point, of course, he would see a doctor.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.920
But, I kid the deceased whoremonger.

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:29.160
Anyway...

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.760
Eh, since he never made out a will...

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:34.340
I hope you will all join me...

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.460
for a wake slash luau at my Malibu beach house!

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.680
He got my house?

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.840
He got everything you had.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.000
Everything?

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.480
Well, not the diseased liver and the swollen prostate.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.880
Oh, look.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:56.040
Your old girlfriends are saying their final goodbye.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.660
That's not very respectful.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.100
Just FYI, spit is the devil's lube.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:15.440
Listen, would you mind recording my answering machine message for me?

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.720
That'll be an extra $500.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:19.840
That's okay. I'm rich now.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.320
Alright. What do you want? 'This is CNN' or 'Luke, I'm your father'?

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.060
So, Charlie, it's been great catching up, but I gotta go.

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:30.380
Already? Can't you stay a while?

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.820
No, it's pitchfork time.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.020
If you're late, you don't get the spit.

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:38.080
And believe me Charlie...

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.480
You want the spit.

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.040
I want the spit!
