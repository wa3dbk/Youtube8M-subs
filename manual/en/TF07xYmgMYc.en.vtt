00:00:04.947 --> 00:00:07.349
We're going to drive the Insignia Sports Tourer.

00:00:07.466 --> 00:00:11.861
Actually we're only here because
Opel invited us to eat and do some archery.

00:00:12.227 --> 00:00:14.734
But we'll show you the car later. Don't worry.

00:00:19.727 --> 00:00:21.353
I've won a shirt...

00:00:21.485 --> 00:00:23.621
...that's because I'm genuinely good at archery.

00:00:23.715 --> 00:00:28.147
You always think I'm joking,
but sometimes I'm very serious.

00:00:28.484 --> 00:00:31.190
Why are we driving this
Opel Insignia Sports Tourer?

00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:32.939
Because we can.

00:00:32.941 --> 00:00:37.929
And because we think it's good looking.

00:00:38.281 --> 00:00:42.113
It's got a very wide rear.

00:00:42.324 --> 00:00:45.543
Opel refers to those big airplanes,
the Super Guppies...

00:00:45.635 --> 00:00:47.338
...whose nose can open up completely.

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.357
They've taken those as an example
for designing the boot-lid.

00:00:50.616 --> 00:00:53.197
It's just a big hole to throw stuff in.

00:00:53.617 --> 00:00:56.312
I don't know if it houses
more liters than its competitors...

00:00:56.468 --> 00:00:58.040
...but it sure looks very big.

00:00:58.324 --> 00:01:00.424
And that's also quite important.

00:01:02.263 --> 00:01:06.243
We didn't want to drive another
top of the range model...

00:01:06.318 --> 00:01:09.303
...but luckily Opel has 
introduced some new engines.

00:01:09.391 --> 00:01:15.559
A 180 hp, 1.6 turbo and
a 190 hp 2-liter bi-turbo diesel.

00:01:15.826 --> 00:01:17.230
We didn't like the sound of both of them...

00:01:17.231 --> 00:01:21.232
...so we've chosen
a petrol 2-liter turbo with 220 hp.

00:01:21.522 --> 00:01:23.629
It's front-wheel drive.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.584
And where it's predecessor,
whose name we still can't mention...

00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:29.717
...would've ended up
crashing into some trees...

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:32.261
...this one hasn't done that yet.

00:01:32.355 --> 00:01:37.624
That gives us the opportunity 
to find out how good the chassis really is.

00:01:37.643 --> 00:01:39.781
Four-wheel drive masks a lot of flaws...

00:01:39.873 --> 00:01:41.825
...there's always enough traction and grip.

00:01:42.074 --> 00:01:45.745
And a front-wheel drive shows you
the limit of its capabilities fairly quickly.

00:01:45.874 --> 00:01:48.715
This time we almost crashed into a bus.

00:01:48.955 --> 00:01:54.300
Cos the rear does come around
when you lift off in a corner.

00:01:54.498 --> 00:01:57.072
So watch that as a potential buyer.

00:01:57.191 --> 00:02:01.301
It's entertaining though, not very unsafe.
But it happens non the less.

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:08.433
There also are some real flaws.

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.318
You feel the steering react
when you hit the throttle.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:16.862
And when the road is uneven,
the front becomes a bit shaky.

00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:20.439
This is also a car in which you can't change
from first to second gear very smoothly.

00:02:20.541 --> 00:02:23.707
That's because the revs
don't drop down quickly enough.

00:02:23.756 --> 00:02:28.247
So you can't change very quickly,
while you usually do that without noticing.

00:02:28.368 --> 00:02:29.406
Well, I do anyway.

00:02:33.773 --> 00:02:36.317
Another disadvantage of this 2-liter turbo...

00:02:36.386 --> 00:02:38.737
...is that it isn't that powerful
below 1500 rpm.

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:40.728
And that's not nice when driving in the city.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:43.270
If you're driving in second for example,
you don't want to go back to first...

00:02:43.354 --> 00:02:45.000
...but it isn't really present then.

00:02:45.312 --> 00:02:47.644
Above 1500 rpm it's a beauty.

00:02:47.833 --> 00:02:49.884
It's very quick, 220 hp.

00:02:50.115 --> 00:02:54.963
I just did 150 mph,
and it does 0-62 in just over 7 seconds.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:58.141
That's quick enough for everyday use.

00:02:58.301 --> 00:03:00.649
Even for Autoblog it's quite decent.

00:03:10.183 --> 00:03:13.096
Of course you clicked on
the Insignia Sports Tourer...

00:03:13.226 --> 00:03:15.095
...because you want to see the boot.

00:03:15.097 --> 00:03:17.440
Shall I show it to you?

00:03:17.515 --> 00:03:20.783
I'll just turn over and show it to you,
no problem.

00:03:26.385 --> 00:03:27.577
That's nice.

00:03:28.552 --> 00:03:29.582
Now it's closed.

00:03:30.381 --> 00:03:33.164
And if you want to take your stuff out,
you just do this.

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:36.896
Neat!

00:03:47.841 --> 00:03:50.496
Aren't you happy that
we talk about the boot nowadays?

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:51.873
Yeah, very happy.

00:03:54.091 --> 00:03:56.427
All your stuff fits!

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:03.356
1510 liters of space for Ikea furniture.

00:04:03.523 --> 00:04:08.592
That's very important, who needs 220 hp?

00:04:08.816 --> 00:04:10.980
With a boot like that your life will be great!

00:04:11.008 --> 00:04:12.665
I'm going to do archery again.
