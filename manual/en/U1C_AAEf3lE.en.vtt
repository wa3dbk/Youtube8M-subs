00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.080
Hi, I'm Tricia, a California organic gardener,

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.280
and I want to get to know my soil better!

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:19.460
I figure if i don't know what the
deficiencies are i could waste money on amendments,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.580
or I could put my garden at
risk.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.200
To avoid that, I'm going to take a soil sample and send it away for testing!

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.720
When the results come back,

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.720
I'll know if i need to add some nitrogen for
vegetative growth,

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:35.140
or perhaps some phosphorus for fruiting, flowering and root development,

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.920
potassium for disease resistance or maybe calcium for sturdy cell walls and pH adjustment.

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.660
or maybe i'll find out that my soil's
healthy just as it is!

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.000
Take it from me, it's really important to
take a good soil sample

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.760
and that starts with using a good tool.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.780
I'm going to use this clean cast aluminum trowel with measurements on it.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.580
Don't use brass, soft steel or your hands to take the sample.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.900
I also have a clean plastic bucket to put
the soil samples.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.600
You don't want to use galvanized steel or
rubber because that could also contaminate the soil.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.160
I have several raised beds so I want to take a different sample for each bed.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.000
Last season there were different crops
growing in each bed and so the soil

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.600
nutrients were depleted a little bit
differently.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.280
I'm going to take about 12 sub-samples
from each bed,

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.120
that way we have a good composite of what the soil is like.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.500
Be sure and clear away any debris, leaves or any other organic matter from the

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.000
surface of the soil.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.020
For vegetable gardens you want to dig down about 6 inches, or as deep as you plan to till or cultivate.

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:43.120
So you want to dig a cone shaped hole as I said about 6 inches deep,

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:52.640
and then you want to scrape the sides of that hole to get the strata of the soil.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.880
You want to be sure and pick out any debris like roots or little stones

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.880
or whatever before you

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.620
put the soil in your bucket.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.740
Repeat this processes in a zigzag pattern.

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.920
If you're not growing in a raised bed,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.560
Try to make the sample distances
about five to ten feet apart and avoid

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:22.889
small areas of obviously different
soil like a manure pile or a path because

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.289
that can skew your results.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.580
You want dry soil. If the soil is too wet to plant, then it's too wet to sample.

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.780
if your soil is wet, spread it out on a newspaper in a location with good air flow and out of the sun a day or so

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.720
before putting it in the bag so it doesn't mold.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.100
Never use heat to dry your soil!

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.140
I'm going to take about a pound of it and put it in this little bag,

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.000
which is all ready to be sent off for testing.

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.400
Most gardeners just need a basic soil
test which includes nitrogen, phosphorus,

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.880
potassium, pH and organic matter.

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.520
However, if you're starting a new garden or if your soil has never been tested before,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.100
you can also get a micro nutrients test.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:06.380
This test for micro nutrients such as zinc, copper and manganese.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.200
So in a couple of weeks I'm going to get my test results

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.120
along with an interpretive booklet which
will have some suggestions for organic fertilizers

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:16.929
that correct deficiencies.

00:03:16.929 --> 00:03:19.960
So get to know your soil, and Grow Organic for Life!
