00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:11.559
Last year we had the absolute joy of being
able to play Juicy Beast's disgustingly fun

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:17.670
classic GOBTRON on the iOS platform, but it
wasn't long after its release that fans asked,

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.720
'Where's Burrito Bison?'.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.840
At long last the developer has paired up with
Ravenous Games to release their luchadore-bison

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.249
bouncing; gummy-bear squishing; city-smashing
Flash hit to the App Store, but is it too

00:00:29.249 --> 00:00:30.880
little too late now?

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.140
The App Store, and indeed the free-Flash game
market itself, is redolent with games in the

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.050
vein of 'Fly Kiwi, Fly!', or 'Vikings Can
Fly!', so you need to bring your best and

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.390
brightest ideas to the table to not only stand
out, but to cut through the inevitable boredom

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.060
that comes from so much trial and error.

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.500
Burrito Bison's particular twist comes in
two forms.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.900
Firstly, while most other games focus on gaining
cash on each attempt in order to upgrade the

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:58.850
character you're controlling, Bison splits
the difference by allowing you to not only

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.560
upgrade 'Burrito', but also the gummy-bears
he squishes.

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:06.720
The upshot to upgrading the candy treats is
a higher chance at obtaining useful power-ups,

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.500
extending your runs.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.859
Secondly, the player is given a modicum of
control via 'slams' that can charge up over

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:15.130
time by bouncing off bears.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.909
Although the game still suffers from the genre's
dependance on 'lucky' runs where you manage

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:22.789
to pick up all the power-ups you need to maintain
your momentum, being able to smash in to the

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.350
ground to either avoid a loss of momentum
or to get that much-needed power-up can be

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.850
the difference between a game-ending run or
something that only takes you half-way.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.329
Progression through the game is (for the most
part) fairly consistent, with several decent

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.670
runs culminating in an upgrade of one sort
or another.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.789
Unfortunately there was no real effort to
liven-up the title for the iOS release, either

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:47.909
by packing in new stages or features, meaning
those who have already finished the game on

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.450
the Flash version are unlikely to gain anything
new here.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.770
If anything this release feels somewhat harder
as there are generally less bears to run in

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.770
to.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.289
As these games go, Burrito Bison is a vibrant
and amusing entry in to the genre, but it

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.679
sticks to the formula a little too closely,
which is a shame as this release could have

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:14.159
packed in so much more.
