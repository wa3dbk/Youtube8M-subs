00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.970
All over the world, families find it hard
to make ends meet. But in Afghanistan with

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.960
high unemployment, low education and cultural
barriers, it can be even harder for the average

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.580
family to make enough to get by.
Mazar e Sharif is one of the first cities

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.249
to transition to Afghan control of security.
It's famous for its blue mosque and has a

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:23.029
reputation for being relatively safe compared
to other parts of the country.

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:29.849
Meet Mohammad Zarif, his wife Shanaaz and
their children, Wahida and Abdul. They were

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.950
forced to move to the urban district of Dasht
Shorr due to persecution by the Taliban in

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.510
their village.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.980
“The Taliban came and didn't let us stay
at home. They sent us away to fight in faraway

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:49.460
places. We went to Yalganak. We travelled
two days and nights on patrol before we escaped.”

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.800
“We faced lots of problems. The Taliban
came, they took my brother and in a week he

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.050
was found dead. My cousins and some other
relatives were also killed just like him.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.760
In one month 25 youths from our village were
killed.”

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.439
After the regime crumbled, Mohammad found
it hard to get a job. He and his wife relied

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.070
on their cows to give them an income, while
his son worked as a mason.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.030
“Our life was very bad in the village because
there was drought, there was nothing to grow,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.220
there was no water, no wheat and we were hungry.
We were in a bad state.”

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.210
Even though he was in his teens, Abdul took
the burden of providing for his family.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:31.450
“If I was studying, who could bring money
to our family? I'm the eldest at home, so

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:32.979
I had to work.”

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:37.679
But when the money Abdul was bringing in wasn't
enough, both mother and daughter also went

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:40.930
out to work. Something that would not have
been allowed under the Taliban.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:45.399
“I stay at home and every day my wife and
daughter leave the home and go to an institute

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:51.569
and teaching the women in a literacy course.
They also teach sewing, embroidery, and bag-making.

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:56.210
They make money from anywhere they can. They're
helping the children of other people and also

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:57.689
helping us.”

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.039
After hearing an advertisement for women's
project start-up funds on the radio Shanaaz

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.920
went to the women's affairs department and
persuaded the official there to help her write

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.799
a proposal for a literacy and skills project
for women.

00:02:08.799 --> 00:02:14.770
“When we came in this area, the people were
very close-minded and we were also poor, but

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:19.620
I had the courage to talk with people in the
community. Although I am illiterate, I'm still

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.909
smart.”

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:29.159
While Shanaaz helps women improve their sewing
skills, daughter Wahida teaches literacy.

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.510
“Because my father and my mother were both
illiterate they wanted their children to be

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.970
literate. They moved from the village. We
had lots of land in there but they left because

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.709
of the fighting, but also because of us.”

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.599
The project helps women improve their trade,
whether it be selling clothes in a special

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.379
women's market or baking bread.

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:53.329
“The females can work like the males. In
the beginning, it was just the teachers that

00:02:53.329 --> 00:02:58.319
were coming out of their houses, but now you
can see females driving in the city and working

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.689
in shops. So now we are free.”

00:03:00.689 --> 00:03:06.709
And in a country where unemployment for men
hovers around 35%, it's sometimes more practical

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.549
for the women to go out and earn.

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:13.830
“My relatives were always asking, 'why are
you working', but I don't like to sit at home,

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.890
so I was always trying to be really busy.”

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.840
For our Mazar family, it can still be hard
to make ends meet, but they all agree that

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.290
life has improved compared to the past.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.239
“Our life has become better nowadays, all
of Afghanistan has improved, my daughter has

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:34.629
become a teacher, my son is now earning and
thanks to God I am also feeling very good.”

00:03:34.629 --> 00:03:39.370
