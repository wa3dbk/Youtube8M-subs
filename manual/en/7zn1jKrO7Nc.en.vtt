Hey guys Maxine here at AccessoryGeeks.com
and I have in front of me the Original

00:00:08.275 --> 00:00:12.446
Audio Universal Rock-It 2.0
Portable Vibration Speaker.

00:00:12.646 --> 00:00:17.702
Now this Rock-It speaker is unique and that
it is not actually a speaker, what it

00:00:17.836 --> 00:00:24.476
is, is this little pod here at the top,
this will emit the vibrations of your

00:00:24.576 --> 00:00:31.801
audio files on to any object that you want
and it will thus, turn that object into

00:00:31.968 --> 00:00:34.904
a speaker.
So I'm actually going to go ahead and turn

00:00:35.004 --> 00:00:37.440
this on and show you how it works.
There is an on and off switch here.

00:00:37.507 --> 00:00:41.277
Once the device is on you will know
because there is a green LED light

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.614
indicator.
And now I'm going to go ahead and unwind

00:00:44.747 --> 00:00:50.471
this pod from the capsule itself and
I'm going to stick it on to Batman.

00:00:50.643 --> 00:00:55.242
Now as you can see here it is stuck to Batman
and that is will be using to emit

00:00:55.275 --> 00:00:58.112
our audio so my Batman PDA
will soon be a speaker.

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.736
There is a 3.5 mm audio jack and I'm going
to go ahead and stick it in to a port for

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:11.643
my iPhone 3GS and I can stick it in the
right port and we are actually going to

00:01:11.743 --> 00:01:18.735
cover the speaker and the microphone for
the iPhone 3GS so that you can see that

00:01:18.835 --> 00:01:25.441
the audio will be emitted from the
little pod here and not my device.

00:01:25.692 --> 00:01:27.944
So are you ready?
Here we go.

00:01:33.384 --> 00:01:36.537
So as you can see my finger is over
the speaker and the microphone.

00:01:36.604 --> 00:01:43.143
Now all the audio is being emitted from
this little capsule here so very cool you

00:01:43.277 --> 00:01:50.035
can adjust the audio from your deviceâ€”
oops, here we go so you can turn the

00:01:50.102 --> 00:01:55.674
volume up and down and what it is doing
is the capsule is actually turning your music

00:01:55.974 --> 00:02:01.580
into vibrations sequences and is then
turning those vibration sequences into

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:11.608
audio so very cool with the sound is what
you would expect from a speaker.

00:02:11.941 --> 00:02:15.979
It is a little muffled I think it might
be because I have it stuck between

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:23.804
Batman's arm and his chest so that
vibrations probably caused backfire on you

00:02:23.871 --> 00:02:28.009
know this guy.
So but still little less is a very cool

00:02:28.213 --> 00:02:31.879
object as you can see here, you can take
it anywhere and turn anything you want

00:02:31.946 --> 00:02:38.637
into a speaker and it is pretty portable.
You need 2 triple A batteries to operate

00:02:38.704 --> 00:02:41.240
this but they are already included

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:48.046
and yeah it folds up into a neat tiny
little capsule as you can see here.

00:02:48.531 --> 00:02:55.739
So it is very cute, very fun and great
for anywhere and it is extremely portable

00:02:55.872 --> 00:03:00.977
