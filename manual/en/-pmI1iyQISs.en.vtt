Hi, I am Eugenie.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.960
Today I am going to make chocolate chip muffins,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:24.710
which is one of the most popular recipes at eugeniekitchen.com these days.

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.790
For this recipe, you will need:

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:29.120
2 cups all-purpose flour (250g)

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.250
1/2 cup caster sugar (112g)

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.540
1 egg, medium-sized

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.460
1/2 teaspoon salt

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.790
3 teaspoons baking powder

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:39.290
2/5 cup (which is 1/3 cup + 1 tablespoon) vegetable oil (95ml)

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:41.590
4/5 cup (which is 2/3 cup + 2 tablespoons) whole milk (190ml)

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.420
1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:47.750
2/3 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips (60g)

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:53.380
Light brown sugar, for dusting

00:00:53.380 --> 00:01:01.210
First, line muffin pan with liners.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.250
In a large mixing bowl, sift flour 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.380
and baking powder 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.410
and whisk to combine; set aside.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:24.880
In a medium mixing bowl, break in an egg. 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.190
Add in sugar, 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.500
salt, 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.420
and vanilla extract 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.830
and beat until white.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.870
Now add in vegetable oil,

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:47.300
today I used Pietro Coricelli grapeseed oil,

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:55.750
and milk. 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.690
And whisk until combined.

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.920
Make a well in the center of dry ingredients.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.040
Add in milk mixture 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:16.880
and lightly stir just until combined.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:27.760
Finally add in chocolate chips and stir to combine.

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:48.750
Then distribute among muffin molds. Fill only 2/3 of each mold.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:54.500
Bake at 400 degrees F (200C) for 20 to 25 minutes, 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.000
or until puffed and golden brown.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.540
Let cool on a wired rack for 5 minutes.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.250
Voila,

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.290
Chocolate chip muffins.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.700
Sprinkle with light brown sugar and serve.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:29.500
Bon appetit!

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.290
Oh, I finished. 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.960
