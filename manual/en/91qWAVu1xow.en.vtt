00:00:00.169 --> 00:00:00.867
- Hi, everyone!

00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:03.104
My name is Tyler Oakley, and I am here

00:00:03.104 --> 00:00:05.077
with the one and only.

00:00:05.077 --> 00:00:05.906
- Betty Who.

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:08.308
- Betty, tell everyone
a little about yourself.

00:00:08.708 --> 00:00:09.944
(coughing)

00:00:09.944 --> 00:00:10.744
(laughter)

00:00:10.744 --> 00:00:12.246
- The glamor, the drive.
(cheerful music)

00:00:12.246 --> 00:00:15.048
I am a singer from Australia.

00:00:15.048 --> 00:00:17.684
I live in New York, but I'm
here in L.A. making my album.

00:00:17.684 --> 00:00:18.518
- Mhmm.

00:00:18.518 --> 00:00:19.753
- I like to hang out with Tyler.

00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:21.154
- She's my celebrity doppleganger.

00:00:21.154 --> 00:00:22.323
Ow, don't touch me.

00:00:22.323 --> 00:00:25.793
I have loved Betty Who for about, ever.

00:00:25.793 --> 00:00:28.569
- I just released a new
EP about a month ago.

00:00:28.876 --> 00:00:30.030
It's called "Slow Dancing."

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.798
- It's incredible.

00:00:30.798 --> 00:00:33.366
It's so good, I just used
it in one of my past videos

00:00:33.366 --> 00:00:35.535
where I went and explored
Italy, so if you want

00:00:35.535 --> 00:00:37.137
to check that out, the link will be below.

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:38.372
But it was perfect for it.

00:00:38.372 --> 00:00:39.239
Thanks for letting me use that.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.507
- Oh yeah. You're welcome, babe.

00:00:40.507 --> 00:00:42.209
- Okay, so because you
are so good at singing,

00:00:42.209 --> 00:00:44.345
I figure we should do a
little singing challenge.

00:00:44.345 --> 00:00:45.078
- Okay.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.214
- Are you down to play
the humming challenge?

00:00:47.214 --> 00:00:50.317
- I am 100% always down to
play the humming challenge.

00:00:50.317 --> 00:00:51.718
- Okay, I don't want to intimidate you,

00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:55.238
but I am very gifted, and--

00:00:55.238 --> 00:00:56.190
- Excellent at this game.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:57.891
I already prepared myself.

00:00:57.891 --> 00:00:59.192
I've been warming up all morning.

00:00:59.192 --> 00:00:59.860
- Have you?

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:00.327
- No.

00:01:00.327 --> 00:01:01.595
- Okay, good, I'm like, fuck!

00:01:01.595 --> 00:01:03.163
(laughs) Okay, let's get into it.

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:03.630
Oh my god.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.872
Wait, we need to discuss King
of Pop, with the Queen of Pop.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.969
(Betty laughs)

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:08.569
Iconic.

00:01:08.569 --> 00:01:10.137
Is he your number one in One Direction?

00:01:10.137 --> 00:01:12.072
- Uh, well, it's--
- [Tyler] Careful!

00:01:12.072 --> 00:01:13.340
- I know, it's tough.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.941
- "I know-er!"

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:17.411
I'm so sorry!

00:01:17.411 --> 00:01:19.279
- Alright, alright, I've got this.

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:22.482
(hums)

00:01:23.784 --> 00:01:25.726
- (claps) Ah, "I Found
Love in a Hopeless Place"!

00:01:25.726 --> 00:01:26.887
Easy!
- [Betty] "We found love."

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:27.821
- Oh, shit.

00:01:27.821 --> 00:01:29.689
- "We Found Love," but that's fine.

00:01:30.123 --> 00:01:31.925
(Tyler hums)

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.361
(grunts)

00:01:34.528 --> 00:01:36.530
(laughing) Do you know it?

00:01:36.897 --> 00:01:38.072
Do I have to keep going?

00:01:38.072 --> 00:01:39.027
This is so shameful.

00:01:39.027 --> 00:01:40.033
- "Who Let the Dogs Out"!
- [Tyler] Yes!

00:01:40.033 --> 00:01:41.535
Okay, good (claps), thank you.

00:01:41.535 --> 00:01:43.003
That's what I've been
practicing all morning.

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:44.805
That's my warmups, my vocal warmups.

00:01:44.805 --> 00:01:46.673
- (grunts) Yeah, no, that was amazing.

00:01:46.673 --> 00:01:47.307
- Thank you!

00:01:47.307 --> 00:01:49.076
- Oh, personal favorite.

00:01:49.076 --> 00:01:50.874
(hums)

00:01:50.874 --> 00:01:53.146
- Dude, the finger! (laughs)

00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:00.053
- "Say My Name."

00:02:00.054 --> 00:02:01.822
Clearly "Say My Name."

00:02:01.822 --> 00:02:02.856
Wait, I have seen you perform.

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:04.425
How many times have I seen you perform?

00:02:04.425 --> 00:02:05.658
- Several.

00:02:05.725 --> 00:02:08.429
You're my numero uno fan.
- [Tyler] I am like a groupie!

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:09.930
- I don't think I've ever seen any

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:12.299
of you and our other friends be gayer

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.834
than when you were all at my show.

00:02:13.834 --> 00:02:15.001
- (laughs) You bring it out of me!

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:16.670
- I think I actually bring
out the gay in people.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.771
- You're not a drag queen.

00:02:17.771 --> 00:02:18.371
- No.

00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:19.607
- But you have the same effect on people.

00:02:19.607 --> 00:02:21.108
- You all showed up and I was like

00:02:21.108 --> 00:02:22.276
"Oh, all my friends are standing

00:02:22.276 --> 00:02:24.478
"in front of me in this show,"

00:02:24.478 --> 00:02:27.313
and then I looked out
and you were like crying

00:02:27.313 --> 00:02:30.016
and screaming, and Dwight
was like losing his mind.

00:02:30.016 --> 00:02:30.818
- We were dying.

00:02:30.818 --> 00:02:31.685
- I was like, "Are you guys okay?"

00:02:31.685 --> 00:02:33.487
It's the gayest I've
ever seen you, I think.

00:02:33.487 --> 00:02:34.121
- Thank you.

00:02:34.121 --> 00:02:34.788
- You're welcome.

00:02:34.788 --> 00:02:35.822
- Did we ever have a feud?

00:02:35.822 --> 00:02:37.480
If we had a feud, what would it be over?

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:38.759
- Harry Styles

00:02:38.759 --> 00:02:39.827
Maybe Niall.

00:02:39.827 --> 00:02:41.395
- Wait, can I show you something?

00:02:41.395 --> 00:02:42.363
- Yeah.
- [Tyler] That I have?

00:02:42.363 --> 00:02:44.765
Speaking of Harry Styles, I have something.

00:02:44.765 --> 00:02:48.769
You can't keep it, but I'll
let you, like, cherish it.

00:02:48.835 --> 00:02:50.437
This is the crown he wore.

00:02:50.437 --> 00:02:51.205
- No!

00:02:51.205 --> 00:02:53.440
- Do you wanna touch it? (laughs)

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.108
- You made these?

00:02:54.108 --> 00:02:54.709
- I made this.

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:55.842
- For the One Direction boys?

00:02:55.842 --> 00:02:56.543
- Yes!

00:02:56.543 --> 00:02:57.378
That's kind of a look.

00:02:57.378 --> 00:02:58.845
- Me and Harry have the same sized head.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:02:59.746
- If that isn't proof--

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:01.915
- If that's not true love,
I don't know what is.

00:03:01.915 --> 00:03:02.649
- Back to music.

00:03:02.649 --> 00:03:03.483
- Sorry.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:06.887
(hums)

00:03:11.458 --> 00:03:12.104
(humming becomes very energetic)

00:03:12.104 --> 00:03:12.726
- Wait--

00:03:12.726 --> 00:03:13.960
(claps) Oh, "Wrecking
Ball," "Wrecking Ball,"

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:15.829
"Wrecking Ball," "Wrecking
Ball," "Wrecking Ball."

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.031
Are you going on tour this summer?

00:03:17.031 --> 00:03:18.298
- I'm doing all of the Pride festivals.

00:03:18.298 --> 00:03:19.400
I'm doing LA Pride!

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:20.400
- Shut up!

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.175
- Yeah!

00:03:21.175 --> 00:03:22.802
I'm doing LA Pride, Salt Lake Pride,

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:25.139
Columbus Pride, I'm doing--

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:26.273
- The true gay icon.

00:03:26.273 --> 00:03:27.274
- New York Pride.

00:03:27.274 --> 00:03:29.209
A gay-con, if you will.

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.510
Okay.

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:34.814
(hums)

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:40.921
- Ah! Adele.

00:03:40.921 --> 00:03:42.156
But...

00:03:42.623 --> 00:03:43.223
"Someone Like You"!

00:03:43.223 --> 00:03:44.090
"Someone Like You"?

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.624
Yeah.
- [Betty] Yep.

00:03:44.624 --> 00:03:46.861
- Wow, can I just talk
about your humming skills.

00:03:46.861 --> 00:03:47.460
(Betty clears throat)

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.096
You don't need to write lyrics any more.

00:03:49.096 --> 00:03:50.198
Lyrics are out.
- [Betty] I'm just gonna hum.

00:03:50.198 --> 00:03:50.764
Always.

00:03:50.764 --> 00:03:52.632
- Would you ever do a humming album?

00:03:53.166 --> 00:03:54.134
(laughing) I don't think you should!

00:03:54.134 --> 00:03:56.036
Let me just stop your
thought process right there.

00:03:56.036 --> 00:03:57.071
- Uh....
- [Tyler] Would you?

00:03:57.071 --> 00:03:57.705
- No.

00:03:57.705 --> 00:03:59.011
You should make a humming album.

00:03:59.011 --> 00:04:00.073
- I think I might!

00:04:00.073 --> 00:04:00.907
- Your (mumbles) was so beautiful.

00:04:00.907 --> 00:04:01.975
- Thank you.
- [Betty] You're welcome.

00:04:01.975 --> 00:04:02.676
- Okay, wait, you ready?

00:04:02.676 --> 00:04:03.810
- Yeah.

00:04:03.978 --> 00:04:07.080
(Tyler hums)

00:04:10.283 --> 00:04:10.984
- Don't j--!

00:04:10.984 --> 00:04:12.319
The judgement in your face!

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:13.286
- I'm not judging!

00:04:13.286 --> 00:04:14.187
I'm not judging.

00:04:14.187 --> 00:04:16.957
(Tyler hums)

00:04:20.227 --> 00:04:22.629
(Betty hums)

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:23.697
- (laughs) You look like you're having

00:04:23.697 --> 00:04:25.699
a seizure of some sort!

00:04:25.699 --> 00:04:26.333
- Applause.

00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:27.167
- Yeah, thank you!

00:04:27.167 --> 00:04:30.337
(Betty hums)

00:04:30.337 --> 00:04:31.104
- "Royals"!

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.139
Easy.
- [Betty] Yeah.

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:33.306
- Easy breezy guaranteezy.

00:04:33.306 --> 00:04:35.208
- Look how quick you guessed that.

00:04:35.208 --> 00:04:36.710
You're in it.
- [Tyler] I'm here.

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.045
- You are in it to win it.
- [Tyler] I'm here to play,

00:04:38.045 --> 00:04:39.713
even though there's no scoring system.

00:04:39.713 --> 00:04:42.315
- I didn't come to make
friends, I came here to win.

00:04:42.315 --> 00:04:43.483
- I came here to hum.

00:04:43.483 --> 00:04:44.885
- We were all rooting for you.

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:45.719
- (clapping) Tyranny!

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:46.786
- We were all rooting for you!

00:04:46.786 --> 00:04:47.988
- You know that speech?

00:04:47.988 --> 00:04:48.855
- I don't know the whole thing.

00:04:48.855 --> 00:04:51.558
- I feel like that's how
you should open your tour.

00:04:51.558 --> 00:04:52.492
- "We were all rooting for you"?

00:04:52.492 --> 00:04:55.996
- Bring a fan up on stage and
just yell it that. (laughs)

00:04:55.996 --> 00:04:58.098
- Just like devastatingly,
like Tyra Banks.

00:04:58.098 --> 00:04:59.933
- Oh my god, that could be something.

00:04:59.933 --> 00:05:02.669
- What if Tyra Banks can
become a fan of mine,

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:03.937
and then I just bring her on tour

00:05:03.937 --> 00:05:05.005
with me to yell at my fans.

00:05:05.005 --> 00:05:06.439
- She could open for you!

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:08.108
I mean, that makes sense....

00:05:08.108 --> 00:05:09.642
- Tyra.
- [Tyler] She follows me!

00:05:09.642 --> 00:05:10.510
- I don't know what you're up to--

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.902
No!

00:05:10.902 --> 00:05:12.245
- Yes, she favorites me tweets!

00:05:12.245 --> 00:05:13.012
- Tyra!

00:05:13.012 --> 00:05:14.314
- Tyra, I know you're watching.

00:05:14.314 --> 00:05:15.249
- I know you're watching.

00:05:15.249 --> 00:05:16.816
Holy shit, Tyra!

00:05:16.816 --> 00:05:17.917
- This is all coming together.

00:05:17.917 --> 00:05:19.552
- If you were to come on tour with me

00:05:19.552 --> 00:05:21.454
and just yell at people from stage,

00:05:21.454 --> 00:05:23.423
yelling "We were all rooting for you...."

00:05:23.423 --> 00:05:26.092
- Everyone, tweet Tyra Banks right now.

00:05:26.092 --> 00:05:27.027
- Let Tyra know.

00:05:27.027 --> 00:05:28.428
- This video, "let Tyra know."

00:05:28.428 --> 00:05:29.496
#LetTyraKnow.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:30.297
- Okay!

00:05:30.297 --> 00:05:31.465
- Okay, back to the game!

00:05:31.465 --> 00:05:32.732
- Whatever!

00:05:32.732 --> 00:05:33.867
Okay.

00:05:34.801 --> 00:05:37.303
(hums)

00:05:38.105 --> 00:05:40.239
- Uh, it's Beyonce.

00:05:45.245 --> 00:05:46.446
♫ I've got my mascara running-- ♫

00:05:46.446 --> 00:05:47.981
What is that?

00:05:48.181 --> 00:05:50.049
Uh, keep going.

00:05:51.518 --> 00:05:53.920
♫ I just wanna be that girl you like ♫

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:57.491
"Partition," "Partition," "Partition"!

00:05:57.491 --> 00:05:59.693
Thank you, I needed the
visual of the partition.

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:00.260
(Betty squeals)

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:00.927
- Wow.

00:06:00.927 --> 00:06:02.629
(hums)

00:06:07.701 --> 00:06:08.468
- Is it "I Love It"?

00:06:08.468 --> 00:06:09.069
- No!

00:06:09.069 --> 00:06:12.138
Uh, (hums)

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:17.177
- Timber. (mumbles)

00:06:17.177 --> 00:06:19.246
- Yeah, but I started with Pitbull.

00:06:19.246 --> 00:06:20.113
You're welcome.

00:06:20.113 --> 00:06:22.182
I know that you're Pitbull's biggest fan!

00:06:22.182 --> 00:06:23.316
- Numero uno fan!

00:06:23.316 --> 00:06:23.985
- No, are you really?

00:06:23.985 --> 00:06:24.751
- No!

00:06:24.751 --> 00:06:26.519
- Would you do a song with Pitbull?

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.088
Never say never.

00:06:28.088 --> 00:06:29.589
- Nevah say nevah?

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:31.191
It's a little off brand, probably,

00:06:31.191 --> 00:06:32.526
- There's no such thing
as off brand for Pitbull!

00:06:32.526 --> 00:06:33.326
- But nevah say nevah.

00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:34.694
- Pitbull would collab with everybody.

00:06:34.694 --> 00:06:35.677
- He's glowing right now.

00:06:35.677 --> 00:06:37.731
- I am glowing, because
I'm like infatuated!

00:06:37.731 --> 00:06:38.866
- I don't know if you guys can see

00:06:38.866 --> 00:06:41.234
on the screen right now how

00:06:41.534 --> 00:06:42.569
just like dazzling he is.
- [Tyler] Sweaty?

00:06:42.569 --> 00:06:43.503
Were you gonna say sweaty?

00:06:43.503 --> 00:06:44.771
- Dazzling he is.

00:06:44.771 --> 00:06:45.371
- Yeah?

00:06:45.371 --> 00:06:46.539
Okay, thanks, bye.

00:06:46.539 --> 00:06:48.074
(Betty laughs)

00:06:49.476 --> 00:06:51.144
Hey guys, I am here in Singapore,

00:06:51.144 --> 00:06:52.679

like the last 10 minutes

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:55.615

video has disappeared!

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:57.651

and she is so talented.

00:07:06.793 --> 00:07:08.094
