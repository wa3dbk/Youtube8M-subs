00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.740
Computer tv

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:08.080
So everybody knows
that the 4850 is probably

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.120
one of the most popular
video cards in the market.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.220
It's at the right price point.
It's got the right amount

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.620
of performance.
It's perfect for most people's monitors

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.560
and it plays
just about any single game 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.120
on the market
that you want it to play.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.820
But, now you have got
a new one to consider.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.590
Check this out.
This is the XFX HD 4850

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:28.460
and XFX does makes ATI Video Cards.
They just started doing that

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:32.200
just recently, like last week.
So, don't be freaking out.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.070
They didn't stop making
Nvidia video cards.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.970
But, they do now make
ATI Radeon video cards as well 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.530
and for a very good reason
they are doing

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:40.180
extremely well on the market.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.910
Pretty much they are
out performing some 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.410
of the SLI cards
and in video cards

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.550
at the same price point.
So, why would you pay for Nvidia,

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:52.320
when you can have ATI.
So, check this card out.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.540
The 4850.
Now, the 4850 is in between

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.790
the 4830 and the 4870.
So, when the 4850 first came out

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:00.260
we were kind of like, 
what is it?

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.560
Now, we know exactly
what it is. Let me go 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.190
over the specs with you
to give you a general idea

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.800
of the hardware
that is inside this card

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:07.560
because it's a lot of good stuff.
Now, first of all

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.970
this is the RV770 GP
that's on there.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.840
So, it's the same one
that's in the 4870,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.010
it's very fast,
it's just clocked a little slower.

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.410
So, let's talk about that first.
GPU core clock on this

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.380
is 625 megahertz.
To give you an idea,

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.950
the 4870 is at 750
and the 4830 is at 575,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.680
so you are right in the middle.
50, 50 and 50.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:29.290
It increases by 50 each time. 
You also have 800 Steam Processors

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.870
which are also clocked at 625 MHz.
You get 512 MB of GDDR3

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.000
which is extremely fast,
it's on a 256-bit Memory Interface

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.670
and that's clocked at
1,986 MHz

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.070
which is about 
1943 regular

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.840
and then since it's DDR3,
 it's double-pumped

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.550
so you multiply it by two
you get 1,986.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.310
You also get 16 ROPs,
and you also get 40 texturing units.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.190
So, it's a lot of good hardware
on the 4850. It's very powerful.

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.820
And it's very good
for pretty much anything

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:06.590
that you want to do.
As far as games that are out there

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:07.960
that go if you want to play
some Call of Duty 4,

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.370
some Unreal Tournament 3,
World at war,

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.970
Brothers in Arms,
even some Crysis and Crysis Warhead,

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.330
Far Cry 2,  Fallout 3.
All the newest, latest, greatest games 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.510
are all going to play on here
with absolutely no problem.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.150
Depending on your monitor size
we will tell you

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:25.680
what settings
you may have to go through.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.180
But even on Crysis
on a pretty good size,

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.450
a 22 inch monitor,
you shouldn't have problems

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:33.080
on median settings
as long as you turn o the filters,

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:36.060
and that's very, very good.
It doesn't sound like it's that great

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.590
because the median mode...

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.060
It's really good.
Crysis is really hard to play

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.950
on most computers
and it's still going to look

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.870
really awesome no matter what.
So, let me take you

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.230
for a quick, brief tour on the card.
First thing you're going to notice,

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.970
It's a little bit different.
It's not that typical round,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.670
with a flat back,
with a round over here.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.250
It's all square.
it does have XFX effects on it,

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.810
it's very simple, very plain.
Another thing that's very plain

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:00.180
and simple about it is the power.
You will enjoy that.

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.110
Take a look at the power.
It's only one 6 pin

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.120
 PCI Express Connector.
You are not going to need

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.260
a 4 or a 8 or anything else
or any ridiculous connections.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.730
One 6 pin, you can run
this stuff for 500 Watt power supply

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.260
if it's good quality, no problem.
If you have one of those

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:17.200
cheesier generic Chinese made ones,
you might want to get a 600

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.870
just in case, but you are 
definitely not going to have a problem.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:21.970
I run one of these
off a really good quality 4850,

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:25.200
  no problem.
Also, on the other hand

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.210
you can notice those red DVIs
are very, very cool looking

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.640
and that back is a little bit black. 
It's definitely very cool.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.580
It's like a shadow-chrome back.
It's going to look really cool

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:37.450
if you have a nice case.
You have that S-Video 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.860
in the middle, right there.
That's for your break-away cable

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.420
which I will show you in a moment.
That's a 7 pin S- video cable, it's digital.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.090
These will do 2560X1600
maximum resolution.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.400
So, you could even run
two 30 inch monitors

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.030
off this one video card.
Now, as far as interface goes,

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.320
you guessed it. PCI Express, 2.0,
X16, length, and electrically running.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.010
So, make sure you have 
the right slot.

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.870
If you don't have the PCI express 2.0 
it will run on any PCI Express

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:03.910
as long as it's X16,
and you won't lose any performance.

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:07.580
You have a dual link DVI 
on it also, you can do CrossFire, 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:09.950
which is also very important.
So, if you want to run these

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.980
with any other 4800
series cards you can.

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:14.960
And you'll get multi GPS scaling,
you get some very nice

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.730
improvements in performance.
Also, what's really important 

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:18.860
is you get HDCP. 

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.460
HDCP is 
Highband with Digital Content Protection.

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.600
Some people just short it
and say high definition content protection, 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.010
and that's exactly 
what it does.

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.170
It protects your high- def,
your blue rays, your HD DVDs,

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.990
or any content you download
off the web.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.300
It protects it from being
stolen or pirated.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.280
So what happens is, if you have 
a nice HD TV

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.910
and you want to stream
one of these high def movies to it,

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.080
you can't do it just by
plugging the cable 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:43.120
from the computer to the television.
It's not going to work,

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.890
you'll need HDPC. 
This has it, you will be able to do it.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.660
It's also got another great technology
called UVD 2.0,

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.090
which is Universal Video Decoder
Version two, 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.560
and that's really incredible
because that let's you get

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.400
a S/PDIF lead cable, plug it into
your video card

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:59.700
and you instantly
have 7.1 HD lossless audio

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.870
through the HDMI cable,
and that can go 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.500
either to your television
or it can go to your receiver, no problem.

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.990
And give you 
that amazing sound.

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:08.710
You actually don't have
to even use a sound card

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.310
if it's going to receiver,
because that's going to do

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:11.940
the processing for you,
and it's sending 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.950
lossless digital audio
through an HDMI cable. 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:17.150
So, that's very, very awesome. 
Now also, as far as games go

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.790
DirectX 10.1 is on here,
 utilizes Shader Model 4.1 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:24.420
and an OpenGL 2.1 as well. 
Which is very important,

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.220
it's got to use the support a VIVO
as well as some of the stuff 

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:29.900
that's going to be coming up
with Parallel Graphics Processing Physics.

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.600
It's going to be
 ported eventually 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.870
around these ETI cards
and that will allow you

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:40.170
to do stuff like that.
So, the 4850 is a fantastic card

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.380
in CrossFire.
it's one of the best bang for buck

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:44.810
for a large monitor 
performance setup.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.910
You want to get a couple of these
and run them on CrossFire,

00:05:47.380 --> 00:05:48.680
your are going to get
some incredible performance. 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:50.250
If you want to get
more information, you can run

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:53.950
to Computer tv, go to the forums 
or look for other videos

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.490
on how to choose a video card,
there is a lot of information

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.190
on our forums though
which is great.

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:01.090
And if worse comes to worse, 
you really need to ask

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.800
me a question, 
email me here

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.100
and that's it, goodbye. 

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.100
For more information on the
 XFX Redeon HD 4850 Graphics Card,

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:15.180
type in P450-4850
into the search engine of any 

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:17.750
of these major retailers.
For Computer tv, I'm Albert.
