00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
The best financial advice I ever got was from my father who said simply, "Be prudent."

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.572
I was thinking of buying a very lavish estate on the eastern shore of the Chesapeake Bay,

00:00:10.572 --> 00:00:16.532
which I would only use a few nights a year, and my father said, "Be prudent."

00:00:16.532 --> 00:00:20.336
And that was good advice. And he also gave me very similar advice,

00:00:20.336 --> 00:00:25.923
which was I said, "Well I could buy this house and not be anywhere near the neighborhood of poverty."

00:00:25.923 --> 00:00:29.414
And he said, "Good 'cause that's a neighborhood you never want to be in."

00:00:29.414 --> 00:00:31.968
The best money advice I ever got was from my grandfather,

00:00:31.968 --> 00:00:34.806
which was, "You can't make money if you owe money."

00:00:34.806 --> 00:00:38.770
So he was a strict anti-debt guy, and I followed it.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:46.108
The first I could pay off all of my debt in my mid-twenties I did and never looked back.

00:00:46.108 --> 00:00:49.087
Great advice. Hard to do though.

00:00:49.087 --> 00:00:53.964
So when I graduated and I got my first job, one of my professors said

00:00:53.964 --> 00:00:58.791
that my salary is going to increase dramatically from a student stipend to a faculty position

00:00:58.791 --> 00:01:04.588
and that I need to think carefully about the speed in which I want to increase the quality of my life.

00:01:04.588 --> 00:01:10.354
The temptation is that when you get a salary increase, you want to start buying lots of things that you've been craving

00:01:10.354 --> 00:01:14.583
but we know that happiness can go up quickly and then we get used to it.

00:01:14.583 --> 00:01:18.281
So the question was, how do you space it out over a long time?

00:01:18.281 --> 00:01:25.793
So I think it's really about how to think about money as a tool to buying happiness.

00:01:25.793 --> 00:01:29.374
And what is our intuitions about the relationship with money and happiness?

00:01:29.374 --> 00:01:31.630
What are the cases where it's right, and what are the cases where it's wrong?

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.292
The best piece of money advice I've ever been given is to look at every single one of my expenditures

00:01:35.292 --> 00:01:38.020
and to not think about it in today's salaries but for future dollars.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:40.937
So for example, if I'm buying something that costs $300,

00:01:40.937 --> 00:01:44.590
what's the opportunity cost of not having that $300 in my retirement account?

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.934
Maybe it's $20,000 over many, many decades.

00:01:47.934 --> 00:01:50.813
And it really helps focus my spending because of it.

00:01:50.813 --> 00:01:54.722
I want to live big when I'm older, and I'm willing to sacrifice

00:01:54.722 --> 00:01:58.148
a lot of the sort of mundane things today that I would have spent on otherwise.

00:01:58.148 --> 00:02:01.178
The best money advice that I ever got was to not be afraid to spend it,

00:02:01.178 --> 00:02:04.685
which I know is weird because of the time people say, you know, you need to save.

00:02:04.685 --> 00:02:08.620
But sometimes to make money you have to spend it,

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:12.793
and whether that's paying for college, buying a house, buying a good stock,

00:02:12.793 --> 00:02:15.864
investing in a business. So I would say not to be afraid to spend it.

00:02:15.864 --> 00:02:20.394
The best money advice I got was ironically the worst money advice I got.

00:02:20.394 --> 00:02:23.394
And that was this constant refrain we hear of stop spending money on lattes.

00:02:23.394 --> 00:02:30.847
And I heard it over and over and over from everyone in the media.

00:02:30.847 --> 00:02:33.204
And I thought, this must be true.

00:02:33.204 --> 00:02:36.204
And so I tried to cut back on all these little things—

00:02:36.204 --> 00:02:41.616
buying a small Coke instead of a large Coke, cutting back on morning coffee.

00:02:41.616 --> 00:02:44.107
I really tried, and it never worked for me.

00:02:44.107 --> 00:02:46.279
I started feeling guilty. I would yo-yo back and forth.

00:02:46.279 --> 00:02:50.900
And that's when I realized just because everyone says a certain type of advice

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.799
doesn't mean they've actually tested it.

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:58.191
And ironically that advice led me to learn about the psychology of money and the psychology of human behavior.

00:02:58.191 --> 00:03:04.640
And so that terrible, terrible advice actually brought me to learn what I know now about money.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:09.499
I was working at a small Philadelphia brokerage firm in the summer of 1949.

00:03:09.499 --> 00:03:13.074
And I was a runner delivering securities as they did in those ancient days

00:03:13.074 --> 00:03:16.556
from one firm to another, and there were probably 50 firms in Philadelphia then.

00:03:16.556 --> 00:03:18.829
So I palled around with the other runners. They were good guys.

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.557
They knew a lot about the business.

00:03:20.557 --> 00:03:27.644
And one day one of them having finally kind of thought they could trust this young college student,

00:03:27.644 --> 00:03:37.838
said, "Bogle, I want to give you the best stock market advice that you ever had in your life."

00:03:37.838 --> 00:03:40.319
And I said, "What's that Ray?"

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.421
And he said, "Nobody knows nothin'."

00:03:44.421 --> 00:03:47.614
And of course that's by definition true.

00:03:47.614 --> 00:03:50.118
You know, we're betting against one another.

00:03:50.118 --> 00:03:54.564
One of the betters is going to be right. One of the betters is going to be wrong.

00:03:54.564 --> 00:03:56.924
And the future is not ours to see.

00:03:56.924 --> 00:04:00.739
At least the short-term future—what the market's going to do today, tomorrow, and the next year.

00:04:00.739 --> 00:04:05.386
Nobody has a clue. So that was basically if you want to call that

00:04:07.554 --> 00:04:13.823
the —I never thought about it this way before—but a quasi inspiration for the index fund.

00:04:13.823 --> 00:04:17.756
You know, and it seems like it might be now.
