00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.970
Here I am, with the ball again. Love the ball.
However, what does everybody do with the ball?

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.639
Crunches. There's nothing wrong with crunches
on the ball. If you're going to do crunches,

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.320
it's the only way I would do them. However,
let's do something else, while we're at the

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.590
playground, especially, if you have the foam
underneath you. This is important. It's kind

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.730
of tough on your knees, otherwise. The ball
rollout, simply rolling the ball in and out.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.060
There's a couple of things to keep in mind.
I 'm on my knees, and I'm going to put my

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.720
hand, palm and wrist, resting on the ball
in the middle.I'm going to roll out, and I'm

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.450
going to roll in. Here's the key on this.
I'm showing you what you don't want to do.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:47.080
I'm not coming down. Notice the difference,
here, from the proper way to do it. Roll out.

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:54.120
Hold your back steady. Roll in, so I'm rolling
my wrists, and my arms on the ball, but the

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.270
rest stays steady. It gets to be difficult.
In and out, so there's one exercise that you

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.300
can do a lot of reps. This is a great warm
up too. Works your upper body, as well. Now,

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:12.780
a jackknife, much harder. You have to use
balance in this one, and it looks kind of

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.690
awkward, but it's a great exercise. In the
beginning, you'll be really wobbly. That's

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:24.800
ok. You have to have some upper body strength,
though, so that's why your push-ups are important.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:30.880
Straight back. Ive got my push-up position.
The ball's under me, basically, kind of my

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:35.370
lower leg, and my feet. I'm going to roll
in, and I'm going to roll out. What I'm not

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.130
going to do, is roll in, and stick my butt
up in the air, on this one. I'm simply rolling

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:44.341
in with my knees, and rolling out. Now, can
you take a variation, and roll your knees

00:01:44.341 --> 00:01:52.409
in ? Yes.Is it harder? Pretty difficult to
do, and harder on your back. Jackknife, working

00:01:52.409 --> 00:02:00.180
your stomach a lot. Wow, so if you've been
doing crunches on the ball for a long time,

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.590
your stomach muscles are used to them, so
mix it up, and try something else, and you'll

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.210
notice the difference in your abdominal training.
