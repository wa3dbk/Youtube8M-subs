00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.467
This video goes with my article
about building a bandsaw.

00:00:03.601 --> 00:00:06.368
My first test was to make
a wooden pulley, and

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:09.800
make sure that worked,
seemed to work just fine.

00:00:09.801 --> 00:00:12.435
To get the wheels running
totally true, I actually

00:00:12.467 --> 00:00:14.801
turned the wheels in
my bandsaw, begins

00:00:14.834 --> 00:00:18.635
as a lathe.

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:25.401
Once I had two wheels built,
came time for a very important

00:00:25.434 --> 00:00:27.601
test, which is to make sure
that they would actually,

00:00:27.634 --> 00:00:29.901
successfully track a bandsaw
blade on them without

00:00:29.934 --> 00:00:33.934
any sort of guides.

00:00:42.701 --> 00:00:46.701
So far so good, now let's
test it under power next.

00:00:52.834 --> 00:00:56.834
It works. Sweet.

00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:01.767
I used the blade from my 14
inch bandsaw, which is actually

00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:04.101
too short for this
size wheel, but

00:01:04.133 --> 00:01:07.700
good enough for the test.

00:01:07.701 --> 00:01:09.701
I've got the beginning
of my frame rebuilt,

00:01:09.701 --> 00:01:13.701
and here I'm making the very
first cuts with my bandsaw.

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:22.867
OK, next test is with
a piece of Maple,

00:01:22.868 --> 00:01:26.868
that's a little bit
harder to cut.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.600
A little 1/3 horsepower
motor that I started

00:01:33.601 --> 00:01:37.601
my experiments with is not quite
strong enough for this one.

00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:45.767
All right, time for a bigger
motor, a 1 1/2 horsepower motor.

00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:47.868
It runs a little
bit faster, too.

00:01:47.901 --> 00:01:50.535
Watch that saw shake, this
is when I realized I needed

00:01:50.567 --> 00:01:53.634
to balance those wheels.

00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:56.001
This is how I balance my
wheels, it's just a matter of

00:01:56.033 --> 00:01:58.367
putting them on some really
easily running ball bearings,

00:01:58.367 --> 00:02:01.801
and seeing which side tends to
drift towards the low side,

00:02:01.801 --> 00:02:05.801
if I just let it spin freely.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.934
Clearly this wheel has got a
heavy spot, so it's just a

00:02:19.934 --> 00:02:23.934
matter of waiting for it to
settle at the bottom.

00:02:25.567 --> 00:02:27.934
All right, I need to drill
another balancing hole,

00:02:27.968 --> 00:02:31.469
right about here.

00:02:31.501 --> 00:02:33.935
With better balanced wheels,
time to do more testing.

00:02:33.968 --> 00:02:37.968
This is cutting sideways
through a piece of Oak.

00:02:43.367 --> 00:02:46.601
A closer shot of doing a
test cut in some pine.

00:02:46.601 --> 00:02:50.601
You can see my very inter-light
blade guiding this shot.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.967
Here's my really cool ratcheting
blade tensioning mechanism.

00:03:04.968 --> 00:03:07.101
The springs on the right
are actually the thing

00:03:07.133 --> 00:03:09.367
that holds the tension, and
the thing I'm operating is a

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.301
winch that tightens the springs,
all this supplies tension

00:03:12.334 --> 00:03:16.168
through a lever that moves
the actual wheel, which

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.200
is in the bracket at
left, up and down.

00:03:22.367 --> 00:03:24.634
Once I've applied a lot of
tension, I'm checking that the

00:03:24.634 --> 00:03:26.634
tracking still works.
And, also just that

00:03:26.634 --> 00:03:30.634
the blade sounds nice
when you twang it.

00:03:32.067 --> 00:03:34.434
With enough blade
tension, I don't actually

00:03:34.467 --> 00:03:37.534
really need a blade guide
to keep the blade in place.

00:03:37.567 --> 00:03:40.435
The blade is tracking well
enough to resist the force

00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:43.001
of the cut that I'm making here,
there's no guides on this saw

00:03:43.033 --> 00:03:47.033
at this point whatsoever.

00:03:50.868 --> 00:03:53.369
I took this shot to get a
sense of which directions

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.901
sawdust would get
ejected from the saw.

00:03:55.901 --> 00:03:59.168
So, I'm cutting through about
12 centimeters of Maple, here.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.200
And, just watch
that sawdust fly.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.600
And, finally an enclosure
belt for the saw.

00:04:12.601 --> 00:04:14.935
And, of course, I have to do
some more testing with another

00:04:14.968 --> 00:04:18.001
huge chunk of Maple, this
one is about 12 centimeters

00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:20.600
or about 5 inches wide.

00:04:20.601 --> 00:04:24.601
Cutting right across it.

00:04:28.334 --> 00:04:30.835
Up to this point, I had my blade
running just on bare wood, but

00:04:30.868 --> 00:04:33.369
it was very loud, so I stretched
some inner tube over the wheel

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:37.400
to see if that would help.
Much quieter than before.

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.067
So, this video is actually just
a few random clips that I took

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.500
while experimenting with
building this bandsaw.

00:04:47.534 --> 00:04:49.801

00:04:49.834 --> 00:04:52.101

00:04:52.133 --> 00:04:54.133
