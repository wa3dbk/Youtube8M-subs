00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:05.840
Hey, folks.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:07.490
Gilbert Gottfried here.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.410
So there's this thing called a
gender cake party that some

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.270
parents are throwing to
find out the sex of

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:18.180
their unborn child.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:23.380
They have the doctor send the
test results to a baker, who

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:28.640
then bakes a cake with either
blue or pink batter.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:33.610
So when they cut it open, they
find out if they're having a

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.430
boy or a girl.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.860
Look, I get it.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.910
You want to make a party and
give your friends another

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.530
reason to have to buy
you presents.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.280
Listen to me for a second.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.370
You don't want a doctor
that sends your test

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.780
results to a baker.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:58.920
You want a doctor that says
to you, no, I'm a doctor.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:04.564
What happens if you get a cake
that's both pink and blue on

00:01:04.564 --> 00:01:05.700
the inside?

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.330
I guess you're having twins
or a hermaphrodite.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.110
Maybe we should all get our test
results through cakes.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.950
Green batter, congratulations!

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.460
You have chlamydia.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.470
Thanks to foursquare, people
now get to tell the world

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.760
where they are at every single
moment, because everyone needs

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:41.070
to know you're taking a shit
in the Starbucks bathroom.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.730
And now a company made a map
that takes all that data and

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.440
uses it to stalk people.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.620
It's called Girls Around Me,
and it tells you when girls

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.050
have checked in near you and
gives you access to her

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.230
personal information.

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:02.070
I get it.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.940
You have trouble
meeting women.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.750
Call me old-fashioned, but I
miss the good old days when

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:14.190
stalkers had to hide out in
your hallway for hours and

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:15.230
wait for you.

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.080
That took commitment.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.970
Apparently, this was so creepy
they had to take the app down.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.040
Sorry, predators.

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:31.430
Finally, this French inventor
has developed a spray that

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.700
apparently gets you super drunk
for under a minute.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:37.760
I get it.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.520
This is the perfect invention
for our fast-paced world.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.940
Who has time these days to take
a bottle, tilt it over a

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.100
glass, and then drink it?

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.910
That could take minutes.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.100
This is perfect for people who
love to drive drunk but hate

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:01.110
getting caught.

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:06.590
You could be hammered when a cop
pulls you over and sober

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:09.495
by the time he reaches
your window.

00:03:09.495 --> 00:03:14.030
Do you guys know any stupid
stuff I can sound off on?

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:15.710
Of course you do.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:17.590
It's the internet.

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.920
Just send me your ideas
on Twitter.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.390
Until then, try not to get too
drunk cyber-stalking women on

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:28.550
their way to a gender
cake party.
