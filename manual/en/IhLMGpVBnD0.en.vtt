AS CLAIRE METZ REPORTS, THOUGH

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:21.210
THE INJURIES TO THE CHILDREN

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.410
WERE MINOR, THE SHEER NUMBERS

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.360
LED TO A MASSIVE RESPONSE BY LAW

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:25.710
ENFORCEMENT AND HOSPITAL

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.520
PERSONNEL.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.150
EVERY AMBULANCE IN THE COUNTY

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:30.490
WAS SCRAMBLED TO BRING THE

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:33.800

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:40.760
HANDS ON DECK.

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.130
I'D LIKE TO COMMEND ALL

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:42.770
STUDENTS.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.170
FLAGLER COUNTY SCHOOL

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:45.340
SUPERINTENDENT OLIVA SAYS WHAT

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.270
COULD HAVE BEEN MASS CONFUSION

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.610
AT THE SCENE OF THIS HORRIFIC

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:50.620
CRASH WAS INSTEAD A REFLECTION

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.940
OF SKILLS LEARNED IN PRACTICE

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.120
DRILLS.

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.820
THERE WAS NO PANIC AND ONE

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:54.440
STUDENT IN PARTICULAR SHOWED

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:55.860
REAL LEADERSHIP.

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.250
THE DRIVER OF THE BUS

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:59.180
SUFFERED SOME INJURIES AND HE

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:00.380
TOOK A LEADERSHIP ROLE AND

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.880
HELPED OPEN THE EMERGENCY EXIT

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.360
AND GOT STUDENTS OFF AND MADE

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:03.630
SURE EVERYBODY WAS TAKEN CARE

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.450
OF.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.660
TROOPERS SAY THE DRIVER OF A

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.430
SUBARU WAS BEHIND A MAZDA WEST

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.100
ON WHITE VIEW PARKWAY WHEN THE

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.630
SUBARU SLAMMED INTO THE MAZDA AS

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.630
THE MAZDA DRIVER WAS TURNING

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.400
LEFT ON TO RAVENWOOD.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:17.840
AS A RESULT OF THE COLLISION

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.880
THE MAZDA WAS PUSHED INTO

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.080
ON-COMING TRAFFIC AS IT ROW

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.170
TALTED -- ROTATED.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.240
THE 23-YEAR-OLD MAZDA DRIVER

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.910
WAS CRITICALLY INJURED, RUSHED

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:32.120
TO HALIFAX.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.680
ALL OTHER VICTIMS WERE TAKEN TO

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:34.720
FLORIDA HOSPITAL FLAGLER.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:35.680
25 STUDENTS, THE BUS DRIVER AND

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.560
THE DRIVER OF THE SUBARU.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.960
WAS A VERY SEAMLESS EFFORT.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.330
WE ACTIVATED OUR HOSTILE

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:44.300
INCIDENT COMMAND CENTER. ALL

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.730
THE DEPARTMENT HEADS RESPONDED

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.870
APPROPRIATELY.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.070
OFFICIALS SAY PARENTS KNEW AS

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.270
QUICKLY AS RESCUERS BECAUSE MOST

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:51.580
CHILDREN HAVE CELL PHONES.

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:52.430
PARENTS WERE PUT AT EASE BY

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.140
THEIR COURAGEOUS KIDS.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.080
THEY STAYED CALM WHICH WAS I

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.240
THINK THE MOST IMPRESSIVE TRAIT

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.240
IS THAT NOBODY PANICKED.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.320
THE INVESTIGATION INTO THE

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.180
CRASH ITSELF IS IN THE HANDS OF

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.620
FHP AND STILL ON-GOING.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.320
UNCLEAR WHAT IF ANY CHARGES WILL

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.260
BE FILED.
