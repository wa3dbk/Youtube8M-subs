00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.890
in both English and

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.190
as well as promote global
awareness and cross

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.830
cultural understanding.

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:28.910
The World Language
curriculum is aligned

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.560
to the Common Core State
Standards and results

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.970
in such intellectual benefits
as greater academic achievement

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:38.610
through all content areas,
enhanced self-esteem,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.880
increased creativity,
better communication skills,

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.350
and greater cultural awareness.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.430
A Howard County World
Language classroom

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.450
is interactive and engaging.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.370
Students are completely immersed
in the language and utilize

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:54.470
visuals, gestures,
movement, and other methods

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.360
to communicate meaning and
participate in activities

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.250
that appeal to
multiple intelligences

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.930
and learning styles.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.790
Elementary students learn
through the five C's -

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.250
communication, cultures,
connections, comparisons,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.630
and communities

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.580
as outlined by the
American Council

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.300

County World Language

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.940
teachers strive to conduct
their classes using the target

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.810
language 90% to
100% of the time.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.890
As research shows that
children learn language

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.030
best when meaning
can be communicated

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:36.980
in the second language without
the use of the native language

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.720
through extended
listening experiences

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.700
and negotiation of meaning.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.550
And when the language is used in
a relevant, meaningful context.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.860
Our World Language teachers
ensure that regardless of age,

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.050
second language learning is
meaningful, relevant, and fun.

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.830
The skills learned by students
who study a second language

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:57.510
at an early age including
improved cognitive

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.750
flexibility, better
problem solving,

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.020
and higher order
thinking skills will

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.250
transcend across
all content areas

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:06.830
as they progress through
their educational process

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.910
in the Howard County
Public School System.
