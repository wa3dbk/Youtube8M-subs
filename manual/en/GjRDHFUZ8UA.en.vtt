00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.500
Would you mind if I hurt you?

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Understand that I need to

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:20.000
Wish that I had other choices

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
than to harm the one I love

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
What have you done now! 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.500
I know I’d better stop trying

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.650
You know that there’s no denying

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.900
I know, should stop believing

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.950
I know, there’s no retrieving

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:02.000
It’s over now, what have you done?

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.000
What have you done now!   

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
I, I’ve been waiting for someone like you

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
But now you are slipping away ...oh

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
Why, why does fate make us suffer?

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
There’s a curse between us, between me and you

What have you done now!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
What have you done! What have you done!

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.500
What have you done now!

Would you mind if I killed you?

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.000
Would you mind if I tried to?

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.500
Cause you have

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.000
turned into my worst enemy

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.000
You carry hate that I don’t feel

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:02.000
It’s over now... What have you done?

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:06.000
What have you done now!

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.500
I, I’ve been waiting for someone like you

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.500
But now you are slipping away...oh 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.000
Why, why does fate make us suffer?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000
There’s a curse between us, between me and you

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.500
What have you done! What have you done!

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.000

I will not fall,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
won’t let it go

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:00.000
We will be free when it ends

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.700
I...

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
I’ve been waiting for someone like you

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.000
But now you are slipping away ...oh 

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Why, why does fate make us suffer

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.000
