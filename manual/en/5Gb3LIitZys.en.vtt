00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:03.940
Here I am.

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.640
Yes it is I, I am a

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:10.320
Pharisee.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.480
Now I am a Sadducee.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.970
You see? A nice hat, robe.

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:21.279
Again, a Pharisee--

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:22.399
Whaaaat...?

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.240
Now, a Sadducee, right?

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.760
No, okay, I think you get the idea.

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:33.290
Alright, I'm sure you've heard both Pharisee's and Sadducee's mentioned in the Bible.

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.339
Jesus dealing with both of these groups
of Judean society,

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:40.780
and if you are like me you've wondered, "which one is which?"

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.930
And [deep voice] "will they face each other in the playoffs" and [normal voice] "just what was the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:46.640
difference between these two

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.949
religious groups during the time of
Jesus?" Well...

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.570
You are in the right place to find out
because we are talking about

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.280
the Sadducees

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.219
verses the Pharisees on this episode

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.680
of Chuck Knows Church.  

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.520
[Begin intro music]

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.580
Okay, the Pharisees

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.040
and the Sadducees, two Judaiyan 
groups that Jesus contended with

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.100
primarily in and around Jerusalem and
the temple.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.830
Now to simplify a complicated comparison,
Pharisees

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:39.660
represented mainstream Judaism and... [jokes] they had a really great passing game...

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.420
While...

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:44.940
...Sadducees

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.290
exemplified the aristocratic, wealthy,

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.630
traditional elite; the upper social and
economic

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.520
echelon of Judean society... [jokes] with a great defensive line...

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.240
Despite these differences,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.660
both Pharisees and Sadducees were
represented in the Great Sanhedrin,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:08.720
the Jewish High Court, where among other
things civil and religious laws were interpreted.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.330
Sadducees held various political
social and religious roles,

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.610
including maintaining the temple. Now
their high social status

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.390
was reinforced by their priestly responsibilities

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.990
as mandated in the Torah. Pharisees on
the other hand...  

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:31.819
...Pharisees had the backing and
goodwill of

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.359
the common people in contrast to the more elite Sadducees.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.620
They were in a sense
middle-class Jews who many considered

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.189
the spiritual fathers of modern

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:47.010
Judaism. They believe for example in the
resurrection of the dead,

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:51.829
existence of an afterlife, and that God punish the wicked and rewarded the righteous

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:56.039
in the world to come,    while Sadducees...

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.079
Sadducees rejected any notions of

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:05.319
afterlife. Now, on these points then Jesus
and the Pharisees would have been in agreement.

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:09.340
Which provoked the Sadducees even more. The New Testament,

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.629
specifically the books of Mark and Matthew, describe how

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:17.780
Sadducees challenged Jesus and his followers about their belief in divine resurrection.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.639
 Jesus defends this belief

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:23.200
and in turn questioned the Sadducees
interpretation

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.519
of biblical doctrine. This of course was
seen as defiant

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:32.989
and an insult too Sadducees. Challenging their power and way of life

00:03:32.989 --> 00:03:36.180
and ultimately became part of why they
wanted Jesus arrested.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.400
And the rest, as they say,

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.720
is history. To learn more

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.260
ask your pastor. Tell--

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:48.220
[interrupts] Tell them Chuck sent you.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.959
Pharisee Chuck: Take that.
Sadducee Chuck: I was right in the middle of saying it, why would you interrupt me--

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.840
I was right in the middle
Pharisee Chuck: I am allowed say it too...

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.989
[arguing]
[Pharisee Chuck &amp; Sadducee Chuck are not getting along here]

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.440
[One of the Chucks] You're not the only Chuck here

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.310
[Sadducee Chuck] You know what, fine.. 
[Pharisee Chuck] Oh, is that how its going...?
[Sadducee Chuck] I'm just going...

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:03.659
[Pharisee Chuck] yep we're going...
