00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.500
The obnoxious money in:

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.580
How's life for you One Peso?

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.680
Well I've got nothing much to do.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.000
Since they made me into coins, 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.480
people have forgotten me. 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:39.660
Well you can't blame them,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.800
because that was too long ago.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.820
I wasn't even a money then.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.380
but hey, do you know I admire you.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.900
huh!? why so?

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.120
You are retired, but still have a lot of money.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.240
Compared to us having a hard time earning money.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:05.940
The prices nowadays are too high, even fares for LRT.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.520
Ah hehehe, so you noticed?

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.100
Actually I have a secret.

00:01:13.934 --> 00:01:16.134
but its too embarrassing to tell!

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.600
SECRET TO YOUR WEALTH !?

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.600
Wow! what is it?

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.520
its just me, c'mon don't be embarrassed.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:25.860
You know,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.320
on world war 2, 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.240
50 pcs. of Japanese money came to me for help.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.040
They asked if they can hide inside my house.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.220
It was war, they are afraid getting caught by Americans

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:41.620
Hmmmm..

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:43.040
So..

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.140
You're embarrassed because 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.220
you helped those Japanese hide inside your house?

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:49.540
hey

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:51.260
what are you thinking?

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.360
Japanese or not, their lives are valuable too!

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.360
that's not something to be embarrassed.

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.200
I'm sure I've done the same if it was me.

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.760
Wait, my story isn't complete yet!

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.360
This is what's embarrassing..

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:10.000
I didn't help them for free.

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:13.000
I made and agreement that they should

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.460
pay me rent every month while they stay in my house

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.120
That's still not embarrassing

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:23.580
It's understandable that they pay rent while the stay

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.800
Just like any room for rent, right?

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.920
So it that the reason for your wealth?

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.620
Did those Japanese rewarded you?

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.640
Ah, hehehe no..

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.340
I'm embarrassed because...

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:39.820
The reason why I still have enough cash is..

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.720
because..

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.940
I never told them that world war 2 ended!

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.260
They are still hiding and paying me rent every month!

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.060
Nyek!
