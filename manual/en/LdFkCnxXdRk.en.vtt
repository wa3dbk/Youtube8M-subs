00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.040
During this exercise we are focussing on the hips.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.140
This exercise will help you to gain more controle over your hip movement.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.680
Watch me.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.560
We are going to use 4 directions.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.760
Front.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.200
Left.

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.660
Back.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.740
And right.

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.200
I keep my hands on my hips.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.440
This way I can feel how your hips are working.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.700
You can also use your hands to help your hips a little if it is needed.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Bend your knees a little bit.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:02.620
This gives your hips more room to move.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.020
For example: Keep your legs straight and try to move your hips in different directions.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.860
You will notice that it feels very limited.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.200
So keep your knees bend and move your hips from left to right.

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.260
You will notice that your knees will automatically move a little.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.440
And give your hips some room to move.

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.900
So this is what we are going to do.

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.820
2 counts to the left.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:28.600
2 counts to the back.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.060
2 counts to the right.

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.520
2 counts to the front.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.640
Then we go back 2 counts to the right.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.180
2 counts to the back.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:36.660
2 counts to the left.

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.460
2 counts to the front.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.020
After that we speed it up!

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:40.620
1

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:41.460
2

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.960
3

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:42.660
4

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.440
5

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:44.080
6

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.840
7

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.340
8

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:46.100
To the right.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.600
1

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.100
2

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.600
3

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.260
4

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.880
5

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:49.640
6

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.360
7

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:50.920
8

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.060
Then 2 counts to the back.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:54.380
2 counts to the front.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:55.520
2 counts to the back.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.000
2 counts to the front.

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:58.600
2 counts to the left.

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:59.780
2 counts to the right.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.140
2 counts to the left.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.600
2 counts to the right.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.980
Now let's do that together to the music.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:07.140
( Counting in )

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:07.720
5

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:08.260
6

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:08.880
7

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.460
8

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.380
Faster.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.960
To the right.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.780
Back.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.640
Left.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.900
Let's do it again!

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.860
To the right.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.940
Faster.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.800
To the right.

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.640
Back.

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.760
Left.

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.640
Right.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:14.460
So that was the first exercise.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.500
For next exercise...

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:20.060
We are going to connect the 4 directions.                     With a fluid motion.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.420
We start in the front.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:30.000
And go around to the left in 8 counts.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.560
And then around to the right in 8 counts.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.360
Then we go around to the left in 4 counts.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:45.800
And then to the right in 4 counts.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.400
Again to the left in 4 counts.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:51.740
To the right in 4 counts.

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:59.040
Make sure you move as FLUIDLY as possible.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.040
So we have made a circle in 8 counts from left to right and 8 counts back.

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.180
Then 4 counts to the left and 4 counts to the right.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.040
And again 4 counts to the left and 4 counts to the right.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:14.140
Towards the front 2 counts

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:14.640
Towards the back 2 counts.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:15.140
Towards the front 2 counts.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.640
Towards the back 2 counts.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:17.540
Towards the left 2 counts.

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:18.240
Towards the right 2 counts.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.240
Towards the left 2 counts.

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:22.240
Towards the right 2 counts.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.240
Let's do all of this to the music.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.700
Again!

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:39.220
So now we have two exercises.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.540
So now we are going to combine the 2 exercises.

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.040
For the first exercise we move more direct.

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.860
And the second exercise is more fluid.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.500
En we are putting these 2 exercise together to the music.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.860
Are you ready?

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.500
And now the second exercise. FLUIDLY.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:09.800
Advice: Make sure you don't move your WHOLE body.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.000
But only your HIPS.

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:16.100
You should isolate your hips from the rest of your body.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:19.880
This way you gain control in the movement of your hips.

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:26.740
When you do this exercise, pay attention to your hip movement.

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:29.260
Your knees will move, because it's necessary.

00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:32.520
But the rest of your body should not do anything.

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.400
So this exercise was for your hips.

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:40.540
Do this exercise as much as you can. At least once a day!

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:42.220
And you WILL get better at it.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:46.180
Because this exercise will give you more control over your hip movement.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:51.340
You will get an advantage when doing different types of dance.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.500
Hip hop dance styles.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:54.040
African dance.

00:07:54.300 --> 00:07:55.180
Belly dance.

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:56.780
Dancehall.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.800
Twerking.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:59.540
You name it.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.560
The hips don't lie.

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:05.900
Good luck, have fun and...

00:08:05.900 --> 00:08:07.900
and till the next time!
