Steve: Hi, it’s Steve from PartSelect.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.870
Today we are going to show you how to change
the right-hand Crisper slide assembly on your

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:06.870
refrigerator.

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.980
Its pretty easy job, all we are going to need
is a Philips screw driver.

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:12.329
Let me show you how it’s done.

00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:20.700
Now to begin this repair the first thing we
will do is empty both of the Crispers, remove

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:31.349
the top one and the bottom one, and remove
the bottom shelf, just lift up on the back,

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.010
push it back, and pull it in through the front.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.829
Now there are two Philips screws that secure
that right hand rail to the cabin wall, we

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.899
want to make sure that we have the right one,
the bottom rail is a shorter rail than the

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:53.660
top one.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:13.580
Simply remove the two Philips screws 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:28.450
and lift the rail out, probably the easiest
way to install a new one is to side the screw

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:42.150
into the hole in the rail first at the rear,
just start that screw in place first.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:02:02.780
Its better we hit it in the right location.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:08.490
Tighten the front screw in the back and tighten
the rear one.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.370
Don’t over tighten these.

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:41.459
I am going to reinstall the lower glass shelf
and reinstall the crispers.

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:45.989
And our repair is complete, that’s just
how easy it is to change the crisper slide

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:47.360
assembly on your refrigerator.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.000
Thanks for watching and good luck with you
repair.
