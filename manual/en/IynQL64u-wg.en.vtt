00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.990
I'm Dr. Tom Umbach. I've been doing bariatric
surgery for 15 years, now, and I originally

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:17.810
came into bariatric surgery when I did my
fellowship at USC. I discovered then that

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.800
they had these operations--bypass, gastric
bypass, back then. These operations that can

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.360
help people lose diabetes, or to help cure
it or resolve it--their diabetes--completely,

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.980
without medication. And, so, as a general
surgeon that had seen plenty of people with

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.920
complications from diabetes, I was all over
that. That was incredibly powerful for me.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:43.140
One of the things that really appealed to
me about bariatric surgery was we were starting

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:51.280
to do it laparoscopically, and even 10 years
ago, really, people spent 3-7 days in the

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.810
hospital after an open bypass. And in my fellowship,
we learned to do it laparoscopically, where

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.239
we could now offer somebody the same surgery,
and yet they could go home the same day or

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.500
the very next day, because now these operations
are done through a little cuts, instead of

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.180
a big cut. I like the challenge of it; it's
very personally rewarding because these operations

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:12.810
are very tough and very tough to master and
difficult to learn, and that has been a very

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.420
rewarding journey for me as well. I love it
when, 6 months later, I'm seeing people in

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.170
the office and they're coming back to see
me and they've lost 60, 80, maybe even 100

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:25.710
pounds. They're no longer taking their diabetic
medications, and they've gotten rid of their

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.110
sleep apnea machine, and they've gotten rid
of their high blood pressure medications,

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.990
and they're out there hiking or traveling
or doing whatever, and they've really blossomed

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.510
as people. That's what I love to see. That's
one of the reasons we've named our company

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.920
Blossom Bariatrics. We're here because we
want to help as many people as possible. Sure,

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.890
I could have pricing that was 2-3 times what
we do now, but then I'd only have 1 or 2 a

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:52.150
month, and I really wouldn't be helping that
many people. So, I'm not in it to make, y'know,

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.650
a quick buck, or anything like that. I'm in
it to help as many people as possible. So,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.920
we have a very different philosophy than,
I think, a lot of offices do. So, we try to

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.540
keep our costs very low; any savings we get
because of the bulk we do, or savings of a

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:11.300
hospital, we tend to pass those on to patients.
I don't think about supporting patients the

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.500
same way usually doctors think about it. In
one of the things we bring to that is I like

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.610
to give my patients my cell phone. In fact,
it's on my business card and my cell phone

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.060
number is right there so they can call me
any time with questions or concerns. We try

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:31.550
very hard in the office to make it as convenient
to patients as possible, and part of that

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:36.010
convenience is adding in enough layers so
that everything is available in the office.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.500
So, for example, when patients come to their
first consultation with us, they'll see not

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.780
only me in consultation, but they'll also
see the nutritionist, because she's in our

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.740
office; they'll see the insurance specialist,
because they're in our office; we get a full

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.070
set of labs done; so, we oftentimes diagnose
medical problems that people didn't even know

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.030
about; we do a psychological evaluation--all
in that first visit. And that does a couple

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:01.180
of things: one, it's easy, because you've
just got to go to one place and get everything

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.379
done--one-stop-shop; but the other thing is
we're all procrastinators. So, if I give you

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:10.500
a long list of things to do, I won't get to
them because I'm busy. But if we get it all

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.819
done in that first visit, we have about 90%
of what we need to do--done! And that's just

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:19.019
going to make patients more successful in
the long run. There's no time like now! So,

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.569
now is the best time to get started and to
get moving on this. We'd love to be in this

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:27.800
journey with you together, here at Blossom
Bariatrics. So, please give us a call--give

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:32.000
us a call today, and let us help you through
this process together. Or check us out on

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:37.790
the website; we have a great website at blossombariatrics.com--lots
of good information, as well as there's people

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.430

questions. So, please, start today.
