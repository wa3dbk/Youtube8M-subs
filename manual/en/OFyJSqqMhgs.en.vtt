00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.130
I was really excited to come from a small town.  I'm from Kerrville, 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.270
Texas.  I know a lot of people haven't heard of it but it's only about 

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:24.240
25,000 people.  So when I got here, this campus is double the 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.150
size of my town. So I thought, "This is huge!" I was really nervous 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.260
and excited to be here on campus. I knew that I had so many 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.250
opportunities waiting for me.  So, that was my first reaction when I 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.230
got here.

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.140
There are a lot of tips that I could give to making the transition 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.200
smoother. I think probably first is to really be aware of the classes 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.240
that you're taking and really maybe do your research before you 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.260
get to campus.  I know when I first got to campus I had a hard time 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.130
with the coursework, more so than anything.  It wasn't really that 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.090
difficult to make friends. There are a lot of really nice, friendly 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:04.100
people here on campus, but really switching from high school 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.250
coursework to college coursework was what I struggled with.  So I 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:10.200
would say once you start seeing that maybe you're having a little 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.010
bit of a difficulty in a class or something, go to that tutoring 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:17.010
session, go to that professor, that teaching assistant because 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.230
they're there to help you. And so I would say definitely, definitely 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.250
get to know those resources and those people that can really help 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.230
you with your coursework and school in general.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.280
My most memorable experience at UT Austin was the Gone to 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:35.140
Texas event.  It's a huge freshmen welcoming sort-of party the 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.190
night before classes start, and I had so much fun at that event.  

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:43.030
Basically, we're all sitting as new freshmen right in front of the 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.120
tower.  The tower is lit up orange, and our graduating year is lit up 

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:49.230
in the windows.  President Bill Powers talks to us, there's a 

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:53.220
keynote speaker.  Then, I think the most memorable part of it was 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:59.070
all of the diverse dance groups and people, groups, parts of 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:02.030
student government, everyone that came to speak to us because 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.000
you're able to see what really UT is about, and how many different 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.140
venues, avenues, opportunities are available.  So I really loved 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.090
the Gone to Texas event.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.130
For me, the college experience has been a time of growth, a time 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:20.190
of change, and really just time where I'm kind of realizing who I 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.220
am and what I like.  I've been able to take so many different 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.090
classes. I've joined a business organization, and I've never even 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.030
been interested in business. And I've been able to meet so many 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.000
new people, so many different ethnicities and cultures, and I've 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.040
just, coming from a small town, I wasn't really exposed to so much 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:45.160
of that. And so being here now, I really realize, you know, where it 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.250
is that I want to be and where I want to go in my life, and it has 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.260
been a wonderful experience thus far.  I've really enjoyed taking 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.130
different types of classes, meeting different types of people, 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.120
joining different types of organizations, and just being a part of the 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.260
college life with all of us Longhorns. It has really changed who I 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.260
am and has helped me grow into the person that I'm becoming, 

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.270
and hope to become, I think.
