00:00:34.339 --> 00:00:37.498
(Millie) - SO! Any questions?

00:00:37.498 --> 00:00:39.749
(Linus) - Yeeees. I am wondering...

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:44.207
Do you people have toilet or you want 
 me to make waste in plastic bag.

00:00:44.207 --> 00:00:48.342
Oh no no... that's not necessary. It's just through 
 the kitchen. Second door on the left.

00:00:48.342 --> 00:00:54.899
You have toilet indoor? It's like living in future!

00:00:57.091 --> 00:00:59.183
(Max) - Oh come on... he's not that bad.

00:00:59.183 --> 00:01:00.923
*fridge door opens and urinating is heard*

00:01:00.923 --> 00:01:04.466
No! No, oh my... NOT IN THE FRIDGE!

00:01:04.466 --> 00:01:05.636
Oh my God.

00:01:05.636 --> 00:01:07.398
Not in the Tiramisu!

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.899
(Harmony) - We could ask Phil back?

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:11.381
If you can remember where you buried him.

00:01:11.381 --> 00:01:12.276
*screams*

00:01:12.276 --> 00:01:14.148
I didn't kill...

00:01:15.827 --> 00:01:19.915
(Linus) - The handle makes everything go away, just like magic!

00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:23.460
I will kill anyone who asks me about 
 what I've just lived through in there.

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.680
Right, enough shenanigans. Tonight's game...

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:29.510
(Linus) - OH! If I may...

00:01:30.388 --> 00:01:31.227
*foreboding BOOM*

00:01:31.227 --> 00:01:33.349
BISK!

00:01:33.349 --> 00:01:41.540
Dice? Metal. Heated until they glow like the eye of a maladjusted tiger.

00:01:41.545 --> 00:01:45.347
Held in hand for 5 seconds before roll.

00:01:45.347 --> 00:01:51.680
If you scream, lose point. Pass out? Game over.

00:01:52.656 --> 00:01:54.019
What the hell are those for?

00:01:54.019 --> 00:01:55.860
We keep track of score on hand.

00:01:55.865 --> 00:02:00.187
Lose one piece of finger for every hit point lost.

00:02:00.187 --> 00:02:02.867
Your fingers look fine...

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:07.850
Regional Bisk Champion, 1997 to 2012.

00:02:07.851 --> 00:02:10.800
Millie? Sidebar.

00:02:10.804 --> 00:02:13.109
You can't seriously be thinking about playing this game?

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:14.590
You know I can't turn down a challenge.

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:16.260
ARRGHHH.

00:02:17.352 --> 00:02:19.060
Let's do this.

00:02:19.065 --> 00:02:20.940
BIIIIISSSSK!!

00:02:20.943 --> 00:02:23.518
*crazy music plays*

00:02:23.518 --> 00:02:28.220
*kettle whistles*

00:02:28.225 --> 00:02:30.420
*evil laughter*

00:02:30.424 --> 00:02:31.507
(Sam) - Ready?

00:02:31.507 --> 00:02:32.438
(Max) - Yeah yeah yeah!!

00:02:32.438 --> 00:02:34.740
*flesh burning and screams*

00:02:34.745 --> 00:02:36.669
*more evil laughter*

00:02:36.669 --> 00:02:39.359
(Harmony) - Do it. Doooo it...

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:41.470
PUT IT IN YOUR MOUTH.

00:02:43.585 --> 00:02:45.770
(Linus) - BIIIIIISK!

00:02:45.771 --> 00:02:51.260
(Linus) - I claim all your battle bisk 
 towers, all biskapults and all surrounding lands.

00:02:51.264 --> 00:02:52.870
Blerrff.

00:02:52.874 --> 00:02:56.530
I think we should break for a bit. Max doesn't look so great.

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:58.530
hahahahahah... ha.

00:02:58.857 --> 00:03:03.040
Fine. Two minute rest.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.940
(Harmony) - Woah!

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.680
*Max giggles insanely*

00:03:23.194 --> 00:03:25.955
Why are you even here?

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:29.180
(Sam) - For the divine snacks and scintillating conversation.

00:03:29.183 --> 00:03:33.750
Oh, and between you and me, I'm planning 
 to get mah sex on with Harmony.

00:03:33.754 --> 00:03:35.880
But... commandment number seven!

00:03:35.885 --> 00:03:40.710
I do not plan to be reckless.

00:03:40.714 --> 00:03:45.047
Dangerous, maybe. Experimental, certainly.

00:03:45.047 --> 00:03:50.356
You touch one soft, black-as-the-night hair on her beautiful head

00:03:50.356 --> 00:03:54.469
and so help me I'll lock you in your 
 house and burn it to the ground.

00:03:54.469 --> 00:03:56.330
You don't know where I live.

00:03:56.334 --> 00:03:59.430
Oh, I will find you, boy...

00:03:59.434 --> 00:04:02.350
[whispers] I'm a librarian.

00:04:02.354 --> 00:04:06.590
Bom chikka wow wow...

00:04:06.593 --> 00:04:08.110
What's this?

00:04:08.112 --> 00:04:09.350
(Sam) - This is my romancing musics.

00:04:09.353 --> 00:04:13.040
If you could just let me? Chikka bow wooooow.

00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:15.875
Stop that.

00:04:15.875 --> 00:04:17.830
How do you like me now?

00:04:17.834 --> 00:04:19.396
*loud crunchy hit*

00:04:19.396 --> 00:04:20.720
Gaaaah!

00:04:20.722 --> 00:04:22.785
Resume play!

00:04:22.785 --> 00:04:24.630
(Sam) - I'm having a nosebleed!

00:04:24.634 --> 00:04:26.795
*crazy music restarts*

00:04:26.795 --> 00:04:30.540
*snip snip snip*

00:04:30.542 --> 00:04:33.150
*insane laughter*

00:04:33.153 --> 00:04:37.350
Oh God why... oh no... do it! Don't miss!

00:04:37.354 --> 00:04:39.390
*even more insane laughter*

00:04:39.393 --> 00:04:42.995
*muffled cries*

00:04:42.995 --> 00:04:45.350
*loud screams*

00:04:45.354 --> 00:04:48.760
BIIIIIISSSSSK!!!

00:04:48.761 --> 00:04:53.118
*Sam starts to sob*

00:04:53.118 --> 00:05:01.490
(Sam) - I literally can't comprehend what's going on!

00:05:02.632 --> 00:05:05.390
It's all becoming clear to me now. I understand this game.

00:05:05.394 --> 00:05:07.590
I can beat this man!

00:05:07.592 --> 00:05:09.750
Then let us...

00:05:09.754 --> 00:05:12.510
BIIIIIIIISSSSSSKKK!!!

00:05:17.394 --> 00:05:20.159
I thought you bow chikka figured it out?

00:05:20.159 --> 00:05:21.950
I will murder your entire family.

00:05:21.951 --> 00:05:26.058
You people, you play like you know not the meaning of loss.

00:05:26.058 --> 00:05:29.460
Hey man, I know loss.

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.296
Last year Millie destroyed this fire mage I played.

00:05:32.296 --> 00:05:37.138
I'd spent six months levelling him up.

00:05:37.138 --> 00:05:41.560
You three are destroyed! My Piglets of Truth are in your camps

00:05:41.564 --> 00:05:44.920
and you are overrun by my Merecats of Intolerance!

00:05:45.333 --> 00:05:47.466
(Sam) - Well... I'll play my uh...

00:05:47.466 --> 00:05:49.380
Badger of Solitude.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.830
My Raccoon of Honour.

00:05:51.108 --> 00:05:52.390
Dog of Disdain.

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.580
Defeated by my Garbage Truck of Destiny.

00:05:54.581 --> 00:06:00.090
How about I just kick your dick in?

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.948
(Linus) - Um... is that... a card?

00:06:01.948 --> 00:06:03.820
I don't believe that is a card...

00:06:03.821 --> 00:06:05.535
*horrified squeals*

00:06:05.535 --> 00:06:08.390
DESTROY HIM!!

00:06:08.394 --> 00:06:11.379
But... Bisk?

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:13.670
GET OOOOOUUUUTTT!!

00:06:13.672 --> 00:06:19.850
Very well... But the anticipation of Bisk is 
 not a fire that dampens easy.

00:06:19.853 --> 00:06:21.850
I will return, and when I do...

00:06:22.527 --> 00:06:24.140
Oh hey! What? No...

00:06:24.142 --> 00:06:25.820
*punch sound*

00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:27.660
(Linus) - You sir, have misaligned my braces!

00:06:32.297 --> 00:06:37.060
I feel we should all take cover.

00:06:37.061 --> 00:06:41.090
*grenade explodes*

00:06:42.499 --> 00:06:46.450
Well. I appear to have killed a man.

00:06:48.056 --> 00:06:55.160
*super jolly music*
