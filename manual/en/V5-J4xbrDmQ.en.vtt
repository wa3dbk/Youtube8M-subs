00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Hello, good morning,

00:00:25.001 --> 00:00:32.000
let's do the first training, 
as an inconsiderable distance of 3 KM,

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:40.000
this release is especially
for the young birds to acclimate to the flights.

00:00:40.001 --> 00:00:50.000
Here the weather is good,
we imagine that at the point of arrival it is also good, 
or what the weather forecast said.

00:00:50.001 --> 00:00:52.000
OK lets go!

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:56.000
Well, as you see above, they are almost at the loft.
