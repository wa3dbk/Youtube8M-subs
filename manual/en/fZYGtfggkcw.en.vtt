00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.040
Song of the City

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.240
The streets to me are the exact opposite of what you can learn inside of an institution

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:57.880
An institution is going to take you to the theater and to a closed place

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.180
a structured and classical one

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.980
and the streets give you everything this doesn’t give you.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.280
I met Maria in a rehearsal of the ensemble of the Provincial School of Music

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:15.940
I crashed the place once because I was told “come over at one, there’s a rehearsal”

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.860
and I was looking for an orchestra because I moved here to Rosario

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.340
and I had no Orchestra to go to.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.140
- Don’t tell me you’ve started keeping it in a place where you can find it.

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.660
-No, haha, how are you?

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.620
And we then took a trip together to Bariloche, where my house is

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:36.820
and then we started playing together and thinking of a project as the two of us.

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.260
When I’d stroll down the streets and I’d see a musician

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.380
I thought of them as those kids who aren’t really dedicated to it,

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.420
who don’t study and who like it a little, don’t overly develop an instrument

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.260
and are just shameless enough to go out to the streets and play

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:05.780
And then me, playing an instrument as is the violin, so orchestral and so structured

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.220
I came from a classical school, from theater
and stage

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.080
and then when I started playing with Kathy I realized it was totally  different

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.160
and for the better, that it was about a whole other thing.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.060
In my family there were already street artists

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.060
and so I thought I’ll give a try myself

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:32.180
Yeah, for an economical reason as well but it’s really more about the experience itself

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.660
Being there, running into people, having people tell you something

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.220
having the kids selling kleenex on the streets spare you a coin

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:46.600
watching people getting moved, all those things you live on the streets

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.320
And so I told Maria that she’d like it, that it’d be cool

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:57.120
And to me it’s also easier to go there as two rather than alone, you feel in company

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:02.060
Kathy was always inviting me to go out and play with her

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.260
and I wouldn’t dare because I had the wrong concept about playing on the streets

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.840
It was only then that I realized how people perceive it when you’re playing on the streets

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.980
people who cry, who feel moved, and all these things you’re not going to hear if you’re in a theater.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.440
With music you can have a way with people that you probably wouldn’t have without it

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:33.660
It shocks people because these are instruments you would only normally see inside of a theater

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.700
or in a more classical formation

00:03:37.700 --> 00:03:44.420
People on the streets generally ask me “what is that, a guitar?” And I’m like “no, it’s a violoncello”

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:46.980
They say things like “yeah, I’ve seen one in a movie once”

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.820
but it’s never an instrument with which regular people can relate to

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.660
at least not people who aren’t inside the music environment

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.660
it’s like a strange element

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.360
You walk down the Street and you don’t see a violin and a cello together

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.320
You can either see a violin by itself, or a cello, or a guitar, or a saxophone

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.500
So us, being two gives us the opportunity to play around

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:24.040
And the pitch and the embodiment are similar

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:29.160
so we can allow ourselves to go beyond in some aspects of the repertory.

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:40.260
Not everyone who’s walking down the streets would go to a theater

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.840
but if you go to the streets you can reach people just the same

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.740
and they can appreciate you just the same
