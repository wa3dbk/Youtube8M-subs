Hi, Welcome to the free online guitar lessons

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
In this short lesson I will explain how this system will work

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
if you want to learn how to play chords on a guitar

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
In this series you can follow a number of movies

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and I will give instructions from very easy to more dufficult 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
I will let you hear it each time, then I will zoom in to show you hoe to grab the chord

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
each chord gives you a number of possibilities

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
how to change the chord with other chords

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
and you can find that information underneath the movie (on http://www.gitaarcursus.com)

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
for example, I play a Dsus 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and the following chord is D

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
It also gives songs you can play with the given chord

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.000
The Dsus which we will start with

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.000
you can play a songs with from Anouk, the song is Michel

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:16.000
it will sound like this

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
this of course sounds familiair

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
the chord I just playes is easy

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
you need two fingers of the left hand

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
with the right hand you're going to play an arpeggio

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I'm going to explain arpeggios in other lessons

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
you can find that in the index

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.000
if you're going to excercise, make sure that every chord you play

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:47.000
you can grab the chord

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
in one move and if you strumm or pick the chords

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
it sounds ok

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
you can do this several times, say for example 10 times

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000
without making a mistake

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
then you're actually ready to continue with the next chord

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000
if you already can play several chords, than you have to take a look

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
at the movies in which I explain how to switch chords

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.000
there are different possibilies and I try to show you the best

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
what the least motion needs so you switch the chords

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
as smooth and quick as possible

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
so, summerized. I build from easy to hard

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:31.000
below the movies you see information about what sequel lessons could be

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I just gave you a tip to practice as much as you can

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
so that you can play flawless for 10 times in a row

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000
you can of course change that number

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
that  you only play 5 times or less but that's not my idea

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
because I think that if you can play it more times flawless, the chord is really in your hand

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000
but for now take a quick look at the next movies, the one about Dsus chord

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:05.000
there we're going to learn how to play this chord and other things

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000
have fun with the online lessons and if you have any questions
