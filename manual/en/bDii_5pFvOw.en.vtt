00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.490
Samsung Galaxy Camera.

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.960
Coming soon.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.360
From one side, the Samsung Galaxy Camera looks
like a normal digital camera.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:21.050
From the other side it looks like an Android
smartphone.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.230
The reason for this is simple - the Galaxy
Camera really is the unholy union of a proper

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.439
digital camera and mobile phone.

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.000
And it's about time too.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.489
It isn't the first time this has happened.

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:40.370
The Nokia 808 Pureview straps an amazing 41
megapixel sensor onto a smartphone.. but in

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.010
this case it's the end-of-life Symbian operating
system.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.039
The Polaroid SC1630 was announced earlier
this year but is beginning to look like it

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:50.149
will never arrive.

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.840
But the Galaxy Camera has a good chance of
actually turning up in the shops, and it runs

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.930
the popular Android operating system.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.670
What are we going to call devices like this?

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:03.670
Smartcams?

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.670
Phonecameras?

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.440
Or is this such a niche device that nobody
will really care?

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:12.890
The Samsung Galaxy Camera could either be
something or nothing in our opinion.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.430
But we can certainly see the appeal of it.

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.649
Let's look at the camera part first.

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.979
There's a 16 megapixel camera sensor on the
back with a massive 21X zoom lens with a 23mm

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.229
aperture on it.

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:31.820
The sensor is a proper digital camera CMOS
unit, not the low-grade sensor you would normally

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.500
find in a smartphone.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.361
The zoom lens is a proper zoom lens that retracts
into the housing of the Galaxy Camera, unlike

00:01:38.361 --> 00:01:41.540
the zoom in the Nokia which is purely digital.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.490
There's a smallish looking flash on the front
of the Galaxy Camera, but its powerful image

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.349
processing capabilities should help with low-light
photography on top of that.

00:01:50.349 --> 00:02:00.009
Video capture is up to 1920 x 1080 pixels
at 30 fps, or 720 x 480 pixels at 120 fps,

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.860
which is as good as most dedicated digital
camcorders.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:12.420
Samsung claim that the Galaxy Camera is 19.1mm
thick, about the same as the Nokia's 18mm

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.420
thickness.

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.959
Unfortunately, this figure is completely misleading,
which is quite disappointing.

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.709
We've looked closely at the press photos and
have determined that the Galaxy Camera is

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:27.340
around 35mm thick at the lens part, it is
only 19.1mm thick at the thinnest point.

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.799
And coming in at a whopping 305 grams, the
Samsung is nearly twice as heavy as the Nokia.

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:37.790
But, we compared this against our office digital
camera that offers broadly similar capabilities,

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.019
and the Samsung is half the weight and one
third of the thickness of that, so all these

00:02:42.019 --> 00:02:45.359
things are relative.

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:51.069
Inside is a 1.4 GHz quad-core processor coupled
with 8GB of internal flash memory, plus a

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:57.920
microSDXC slot that can theoretically handle
cards up to 2TB (or 2000GB) if they ever come

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.430
to market.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.970
On the back is a large 4.8" HD display of
unknown resolution.

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.019
Inside is a modest 1650 mAh battery, which
is quite small for either a smartphone or

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.079
digital camera these days.

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:17.540
The key selling point here is that the Galaxy
Camera runs Android 4.1, so you can take a

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.629
photo or video and edit it with a variety
of tools, and then upload it directly to whatever

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.579
repository or file sharing site you like.

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:30.390
The Galaxy Camera can even suggest photo editing
applications to help, and all data can be

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:33.530
automatically backed up to Samsung's data
storage cloud.

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.040
What's more, the Galaxy Camera is a fully-fledge
mobile phone and it can take a SIM card to

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:42.379
upload via an HSPA+ or LTE connection depending
on model.

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.560
And because this is an Android device then
it does everything that any other Android

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.760
device can do.. which includes using it as
a personal navigation device, although we're

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.099
not sure if it is possible to make phone calls
on it.

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.180
Professional photographers are unlikely to
be trading in their Hasselblads to get hold

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:04.859
of a Galaxy Camera, but the ability to take
decent quality photos, edit and upload them

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:09.129
seamlessly will certainly attract the attention
of many people who take pictures for a living

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.969
and keen amateurs looking for an easy but
powerful solution.

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:16.430
These people will probably have been waiting
for a device like the Samsung Galaxy Camera

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:22.180
for some time and won't need any further selling
to.

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.669
We don't know when the Samsung Galaxy Camera
will be available or how much it will cost.

00:04:26.669 --> 00:04:30.640
For most people it will be too bulky to use
as a smartphone, for a few it will be too

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.660
basic to use as a digital camera.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.280
But we think that a decent number of people
will want this right now as a compact camera

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.060
they can carry around with them all the time,
and these customers will probably not care

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.700
too much about the price at all.
