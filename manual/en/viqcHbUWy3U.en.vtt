The Nova 39 is a custom built sport boat with
a new revolutionary, patent pending hull design.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:13.110
This new hull produces air in sections of
the bottom without the conventional use of steps.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.279
This revolutionary design provides excellent efficiency

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.279
and ensurues safe operation and stability even through sharp turns

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:30.630
The Nova 39 offers more power options than
all competitors; such as Volvo Penta, Stern

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:37.270
Drive Diesel, V-Drives, coupled to the latest
technology lineal tunnels; as well as, outboard  versions

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.690
The Nova 39 Sport deck was carefully designed
to produce ample deck space to walk all around

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:49.210
the boat. Other features include a circular
windshield appealing to the eye but, also

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:54.670
very functional allowing safe access to the
steps in the cabin.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:58.510
Engine room ventilation is also done inside
the cockpit. Air intakes are strategically

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:05.329
placed inside the cockpit to minimize the
chances water entering the engine room.

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:11.080

from every angle.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:16.920
There is one large bulster to starboard accommodating
the operator while a double bulster to port

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:23.920
accommodates the passengers. The rear seat also
provides comfortable seating for three additional passengers.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.460
The cabin is based on a new concept. The hull
sides and the under deck have a molded finish,

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.000
no carpet is used. The only Vinyl used is for
the cushions.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.000
