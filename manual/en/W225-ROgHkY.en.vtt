00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.820
In this video tutorial, I'll demonstrate just
how easy it is to create a professional quality,

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.680
Red Book formatted CD-R in just three easy
steps using Sonic Studio's soundBlade application.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.680
Step 1.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.840
Drag and Mark.

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:31.170
I'll locate my audio files in the Finder,
select them, and then I'll drag them over

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:35.530
onto the soundBlade project's top panel, holding
down the command key just before you let go

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.360
of the mouse, and then drop the files.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.740
soundBlade LE will auto-magically creates
CDTracks, displayed in the Track Bar, from

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:54.580
your audio files.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.930
The order that you want them to appear on
the CD can be set by adding a leading 01,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.500
02, 03 prefix to the song titles as I've done
here.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:11.120
Remember: The command key is only needed just
before you drop the files.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.120
Step 2.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:20.710
Check Your Marks
Choose Window &gt; Mark Info and select the PQ

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.080
Info tab.

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.840
Notice that soundBlade has placed all of the
songs that were dragged onto the project file

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:32.780
into this window and automatically added the
critical metadata needed to burn a CD such

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:34.750
as start and stop marks .

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.640
Next, select the PQ Delivery tab in the Mark
Info window.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.479
The STATUS field prompts you to "Insert media
for delivery."

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:45.479
Step 3.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:54.850
Burn
I will insert a blank CD-R disc.

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.950
When ready to burn, soundBlade LE;s Mark Info
status area tells us that, "Media ready for

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.820
delivery."

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.440
Click the Execute button in the Mark Info
window to start the burn process.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.299
soundBlade will ask you to "Specify Folder
for DDP Image.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:16.400
CD will be replicated from DDP image."

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:24.840
Using the Finder browser, I will specify a
New folder for this 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:35.450
DDP and click the OK button.

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:38.489
The first step is to generate the DDP Image.

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.209
The progress bar appears.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:52.519
Once the DDP is generated, the CDR starts
to burn.

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:56.280
The STATUS field shows the progress of the
burn process.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:07.809
When the burn process is complete, your great-sounding
CD is ejected from the CD burner, ready 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:08.809
to play.

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:14.459
Here is a review of how to make a red book
standard CD in 3 easy steps using Sonic Studio's

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.120
soundBlade LE digital audio workstation.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.859
Step number 1) Drag and drop your audio files
from the Finder into the top panel of soundBlade's

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:26.790
Project window using the command key.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:31.540
Remember: The command key is only needed just
before you drop the files.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.700
Step number 2) Check your marks in soundBlade
LE's Mark Info Window.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.340
Step number 3) Burn your CD using the Execute
button.

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:47.590
A DDP image is created, and your CD is made.

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:57.260
