00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.459
Horace Kephart,

00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:30.369
writer and outdoorsman, who adopted the Great 
Smoky Mountains of North Carolina as his home.

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.660
He will long be remembered for his role in 
supporting the idea of a park in the Great Smokies.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.410
Kephart was well-known as an expert 
on outdoor equipment,

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:45.260
and his reviews could be found in Field &amp; Stream, 
Sports Afield, and Forest &amp; Stream magazines. 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.920
He was quite particular about his outdoor 
equipment, including knives, so much so that he 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.290
rejected existing knives for his own design.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:58.710
Glen Brooks also knows knives. 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.230
He's the maker of a limited number of 
Kephart Knife reproductions 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.570
being produced to commemorate what would 
have been Kephart's 150 birthday.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.790
Glen Brooks: A well handcrafted knife is different
than a production knife.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.640
It's a better piece of steel.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:14.900
It is

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.140
heat-treated with care,
not in mass.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:20.220
In this case I do two at a time.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:26.170
The heat-treating process is well-controlled, 
as far as hardness

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.510
and the area that is heat-treated.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.360
In a handcrafted knife

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:39.360
--well handcrafted knife--there are no 
cracks in between the handle and the blade

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.440
to draw moisture.
That will destroy the knife.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.580
This was the ideal knife then, 
and even now, it's a--

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:52.920
I believe it's as utilitarian as anything you can find.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.520
This was the right size.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.600
Four inch long blade,

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.310
one inch wide.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.729
Of course, four-and-a-half inch handle.

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.200
That's as much blade as you need for most 
utilitarian things, 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:08.979
around the camp, for skinning or hunting or

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.779
anything you'd want to do around the camp.

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:16.529
Narrator: It's a process that takes many steps, 

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:22.469
the know-how to turn these materials--
carbon steel and walnut--into a trusted tool,

00:02:22.469 --> 00:02:29.469
and an instinct for when the knife feels right 
in the hand. 

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:42.759
Glen Brooks: I've always had an interest in knives, 
ever since I was a little kid.

00:02:42.759 --> 00:02:49.129
At nine years old I started working
on knives, trying to make knives.

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.009
Formby's Tung Oil Finish,

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:55.549
and I believe it is a finish that's been 
used for many, many years.

00:02:55.549 --> 00:03:01.340
So I would imagine it could have possibly been used 
in the manufacture of the Kephart Knife

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.159
a hundred years ago.

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:08.099
The handcrafted knife has a much thinner edge,

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.039
much thinner blade.

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:17.779
The thin blade cuts very well. A thin blade is 
easy to sharpen. A thick blade is hard to sharpen.

00:03:17.779 --> 00:03:22.219
And a good piece of steel holds an edge for a long time.

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:30.279
A well handcrafted knife will give many years of
good service and last a long time.

00:03:30.279 --> 00:03:36.709
I've seen the original Kephart Knife, 
and I've read how much he used it in the woods.

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:41.729
And it was worn down some, but it wasn't
all that much. The blade still

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:46.399
looked plenty usable. The handle looked 
like it was pretty well used up.

00:03:46.399 --> 00:03:49.000
But that knife is over 100 years old too, so

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:55.239
you could say it gave good service, 
and I believe this one will too.

00:03:55.239 --> 00:04:00.159
Narrator: All the sanding, shaping, and polishing 
result in a superior handcrafted knife,  

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:06.069
one that's fit for the knifemaker's name.

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.229
Great Smoky Mountains Association offers the Kephart knife 
reproduction complete with 

00:04:10.229 --> 00:04:15.069
leather sheath and a walnut display box in 
limited quantities on our website, 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:18.000

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.059
and in visitor centers throughout the park.
