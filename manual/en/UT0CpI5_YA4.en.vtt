00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:11.900
Hi my name is Rebecca Hill and I'm a British
Horse Society Intermediate Instructor and

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.040
I'm also an Accredited Pony Club Coach and
I'm here today with Horsemart to show you

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.550
some Handy Hints for Horsemart people.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.180
So today's Handy Hint is how to make fly spray.

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.590
Fly spray can be very costly and as we all
know we need to use a lot of it in the summer

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:27.590
months.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:35.290
So what we are going to need today is some
Citronella Oil, some plain Malt Vinegar, some

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:43.680
Disposable Gloves, an Old Spray Bottle which
has been washed out and some water.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.630
Always apply gloves when you are gong to be
handling essential oils because you don't

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.560
know if your allergic to anything.

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.500
So I'm going to get the Citronella Oil, its
very cheap and you can buy it from any Chemist

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.930
usually costing just a few pounds.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:09.470
I'll add just a few drops you can see that
going in as so.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:14.020
You can smell it at the ends if you feel it
is not enough you can just add a little bit

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:15.020
more.

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.920
So we are going to add plenty of vinegar.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.450
So about half of the spray bottle of vinegar
so about this much on the smaller bottles

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:36.229
and we are going to just top that up with
tap water 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.259
like so right to the top.

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:45.049
Its also really good to use with horses that
have sweet itch.

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:53.090
But it all down their crest and their tail
so pop your lid on and then give it a good

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.539
shake.

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:01.119
Always label your products because you dont
want it to be misused for anything else.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.020
This is "Disco" hes a 16/1 Irish Sports Horse
hes going to be our demo horse and we are

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.580
going to do a little patch test with our fly
spray.

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.820
now the best place to do a patch test on the
horse is just down here on the breast.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:19.030
Because if there is any swelling it'll just
hang down and not get in the way anywhere.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.620
and you really only want to apply only really
small amounts on to a little part of the area

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:27.920
where you are going to rub that in and you
want to leave that a good 24 hours to make

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.909
sure there's no reaction there on your horse.

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:37.420
If everything is well and there's no reaction
and no swelling or no rash then you can spray

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:57.280
the horse all over as so in the summer months
to protect them from the flies.
