00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.950
Hey guys!

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:10.530
This is Game On, I'm Grace and I'm going to
be bringing you the gaming news of the day.

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.990
First up, bad news for anyone expecting Halo
5 this year as the voice of Master Chief has

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.410
said that it's likely that the new game won't
be coming out until next year.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.619
In an interview with GameZone, voice actor
Steve Downes has said players shouldn't expect

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:33.090
anything until 2015 but he did say that the
anniversary edition of Halo 2 will be coming

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.170
out this year.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.480
Although this isn't official confirmation
of the game, at least it's something to grasp

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:42.109
onto until Halo 5 is released.

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:47.730
Next up earlier this week there was word of
a new pokemon, number 719, coming to join

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.730
the ranks.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.460
And here she is, Diancie the mythical pokemon
is a rock and fairy-type described as having

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.190
a body that glitters pink captivating the
hearts of many.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.300
It has the ability to produce a great volume
of diamonds instanteously by compressing air

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:07.080
between its hands and uses these to attack
and defend.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.160
Details on how you can get your hands on Diancie
will be revealed at a later date.

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.720
Let me know what you think of this new pokemon
in the comments below.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:23.670
And finally, it looks like PS4 sales surged
ahead of Xbox One last month in the US.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.030
Sony Senior VP Guy Longworth is saying their
figures show sales nearly twice as high as

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.030
Microsoft's.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.330
In a competition that will continue, no exact
figures are being given out by either side

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:39.920
just yet but with the upcoming release of
exclusive titles such as Titanfall, it will

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.360
be interesting to see how the balance shifts
after each title releases.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.140
I'll make sure to keep you updated.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.930
Thanks for watching Game On News, I'm here

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.210
