00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.410
Hello and welcome to the HTML5 online training series.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:12.730
My name is Cesar and I'm your IT Trainer with 
 the ITS Training Program here at Cal State LA.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:20.400
First off, this training series will not only cover 
 HTML5, but we’ll also cover CSS3. 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.167
Both HTML5 and CSS3 are not new technologies.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.000
Instead, they are redesigns of their predecessors that 
 will ultimately help to optimize the Web.

00:00:31.542 --> 00:00:35.875
HTML and CSS are two completely different languages that are meant to work together.

00:00:36.627 --> 00:00:45.042
Recently, they have become increasingly popular, beneficial, and practical as 
 the way people access the Internet has changed.

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:48.092
So, what is HTML?

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:52.250
HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.

00:00:53.633 --> 00:00:56.750
It is used to place content onto a web page. 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.350
HTML5 adds features that increases code readability

00:01:01.675 --> 00:01:05.542
and reduces the need for external plug ins such as Flash.

00:01:06.242 --> 00:01:08.242
What about CSS?

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:12.188
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.

00:01:13.242 --> 00:01:16.025
Its only purpose is to style content.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.250
This includes positioning, color and sizing.

00:01:21.583 --> 00:01:23.917
CSS3 helps save bandwidth,

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:26.292
 reduces load times

00:01:26.667 --> 00:01:30.000
and includes new effects and animations.

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:35.333
Here’s what we’ll cover in HTML5, Part 1. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.875
An introduction to some HTML and CSS syntax.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.550
Then, we’ll take a look at how the two work together

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.000
and how you can go about constructing a web page from it.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.850
We’ll end the lesson with adding some text to our page.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:59.040
Take note that in this HTML5 video tutorial, we will 
 be using the free text editor Notepad++. 

00:01:59.208 --> 00:02:03.750
Any other text editor will also work, but Notepad++ is highly recommended 

00:02:03.832 --> 00:02:08.820
for its useful features including syntax highlighting and auto indentation.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:13.250
To download Notepad++, 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.040
go to

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:27.920
http://www.notepad-plus-plus.org/download.

00:02:29.192 --> 00:02:33.380
Next, we will need a browser that fully supports HTML 5.

00:02:34.083 --> 00:02:37.620
We will be using the latest version of Mozilla Firefox.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.830
To Download Mozilla Firefox, go to

00:02:41.708 --> 00:02:51.250
http://www.mozilla.org/download

00:02:57.833 --> 00:03:01.000
and click the Firefox for Desktop link.
