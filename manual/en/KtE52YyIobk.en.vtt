00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:03.755
- [Instructor] It may look like you have

00:00:03.755 --> 00:00:05.574
a lot of cables in your Wii box,

00:00:05.574 --> 00:00:07.515
but it's much simpler than you think,

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:10.723
and it's made so that each
cord can only go in one place.

00:00:10.723 --> 00:00:12.949
You can't go wrong.

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:15.937
Your Wii console box is
where the games play.

00:00:15.937 --> 00:00:19.080
It's a lot like a DVD player or VCR,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.247
it needs power

00:00:27.402 --> 00:00:30.652
and it needs to be connected to the TV.

00:00:32.446 --> 00:00:35.779
Your A/V cord looks like this

00:00:36.935 --> 00:00:39.134
with yellow transmitting video

00:00:39.134 --> 00:00:43.014
and the red and white
cables transmitting audio.

00:00:43.014 --> 00:00:45.836
Plug the big, single end of the cord

00:00:45.836 --> 00:00:48.669
into the back of your Wii console.

00:00:50.905 --> 00:00:53.194
Then find the input on your TV.

00:00:53.194 --> 00:00:54.130
Most of the time,

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.571
these are on the back of the television.

00:00:57.571 --> 00:01:00.682
You'll just match up the colors

00:01:00.682 --> 00:01:02.099
and plug them in.

00:01:05.338 --> 00:01:07.357
Unique to the Wii are the game controllers

00:01:07.357 --> 00:01:09.682
called Wiimotes and Nunchucks.

00:01:09.682 --> 00:01:11.895
Not every game will use the Nunchuck

00:01:11.895 --> 00:01:13.898
but for those that require you to use it,

00:01:13.898 --> 00:01:18.065
it plugs into the bottom
of the Wiimote like this.

00:01:19.578 --> 00:01:23.134
The Wiimote takes two double A batteries.

00:01:23.134 --> 00:01:24.967
Remove the back casing

00:01:26.197 --> 00:01:29.530
and then place the batteries in like so.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.657
The last remaining thing
to plug in to the Wii

00:01:41.657 --> 00:01:43.618
is the sensor bar.

00:01:43.618 --> 00:01:44.643
Take the cord

00:01:44.643 --> 00:01:45.893
and plug it in.

00:01:47.135 --> 00:01:50.316
Place the sensor bar
on top of or just below

00:01:50.316 --> 00:01:51.951
your television.

00:01:51.951 --> 00:01:55.388
Put it far enough forward that
nothing will block the view.

00:01:55.388 --> 00:01:57.309
When you first turn on your Wii,

00:01:57.309 --> 00:01:59.150
you're going to be pointing your Wiimote

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.650
at the area directly above the sensor bar.

00:02:06.677 --> 00:02:09.587
Make sure that the power
cord is plugged into the wall

00:02:09.587 --> 00:02:12.532
and then press the
power button on the Wii.

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:14.532
It's located right here.

00:02:16.422 --> 00:02:17.529
When it's powered on,

00:02:17.529 --> 00:02:19.696
the light should be green.

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:23.695
Makes sure the TV is turned to the input

00:02:23.695 --> 00:02:25.457
that you plugged your Wii into.

00:02:25.457 --> 00:02:26.561
If you're not sure,

00:02:26.561 --> 00:02:27.949
just flip through the inputs

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:30.606
using the TV video button on the remote

00:02:30.606 --> 00:02:33.791
until you reach a screen
that looks like this.

00:02:33.791 --> 00:02:36.522
The A button is the big, round button

00:02:36.522 --> 00:02:38.404
with the letter A on it

00:02:38.404 --> 00:02:40.656
in the middle of the Wiimote.

00:02:40.656 --> 00:02:41.489
Press it.

00:02:42.333 --> 00:02:46.057
You only have to go through
this setup process once.

00:02:46.057 --> 00:02:47.852
Now, point to the language that

00:02:47.852 --> 00:02:49.897
you want your system to use

00:02:49.897 --> 00:02:51.980
and press A to select it.

00:02:57.166 --> 00:03:01.259
Then point it to confirm
and press A again.

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:04.815
Next, choose where you
put your sensor bar.

00:03:04.815 --> 00:03:06.692
This will allow you to point your Wiimote

00:03:06.692 --> 00:03:08.488
directly at the TV screen

00:03:08.488 --> 00:03:10.493
which feels more natural.

00:03:10.493 --> 00:03:12.459
Press confirm.

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.626
Next, use the cursor to set
the current date and time.

00:03:27.407 --> 00:03:29.530
Now, choose whether you have a widescreen

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.530
or a standard TV screen.

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.973
Most newer, flat TVs will be widescreen.

00:03:38.647 --> 00:03:41.730
Press A to skip through the dialogue.

00:03:43.222 --> 00:03:45.549
Next, you have to give
your console a name.

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:47.430
This will be used to identify your console

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.490
if you play games over the internet.

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:52.162
Point the cursor

00:03:52.162 --> 00:03:53.344
at the white bar

00:03:53.344 --> 00:03:55.189
and press the A button.

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:58.338
This brings up the onscreen keyboard.

00:03:58.338 --> 00:04:00.784
Type in a name for your console

00:04:00.784 --> 00:04:02.298
by pointing at each letter

00:04:02.298 --> 00:04:04.465
and pressing the A button.

00:04:05.532 --> 00:04:06.365
Press OK

00:04:08.117 --> 00:04:10.034
and then press confirm.

00:04:13.754 --> 00:04:15.930
Alright, one more step.

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:16.829
What we have to do now

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:19.746
is select our country of residence.

00:04:22.604 --> 00:04:25.968
And we are not going to
use parental controls.

00:04:25.968 --> 00:04:28.305
If we have kids playing games

00:04:28.305 --> 00:04:30.598
that might not be age-appropriate,

00:04:30.598 --> 00:04:32.970
we would want to use the parental controls

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.355
but for now, we're gonna
leave them turned off.

00:04:37.355 --> 00:04:39.483
Now, we're going to place a game disc

00:04:39.483 --> 00:04:42.583
into the console and start playing.

00:04:42.583 --> 00:04:44.340
If your system is horizontal,

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:46.268
make sure the label faces up.

00:04:46.268 --> 00:04:47.406
If it's vertical,

00:04:47.406 --> 00:04:48.511
make sure that the label

00:04:48.511 --> 00:04:50.844
is facing towards the right.

00:04:52.078 --> 00:04:54.743
Just slip the disc into the disc slot

00:04:54.743 --> 00:04:57.768
and it should slide the rest
of the way automatically.

00:04:57.768 --> 00:04:58.913
If it doesn't,

00:04:58.913 --> 00:05:00.551
press the eject button

00:05:00.551 --> 00:05:01.634
located here.

00:05:03.498 --> 00:05:05.216
Once the disc is in the system,

00:05:05.216 --> 00:05:09.631
select the disc channel
in the upper left corner.

00:05:09.631 --> 00:05:11.674
And once it's done loading,

00:05:11.674 --> 00:05:12.775
and you can tell that it's loading

00:05:12.775 --> 00:05:15.181
because the discs are spinning,

00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:18.348
but once it finishes loading the game,

00:05:19.847 --> 00:05:21.932
you can press start

00:05:21.932 --> 00:05:24.015
and you're ready to play.
