00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.080
Alright, so we all know that person

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.800
who, every time you say anything,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.940
they're like "Actually, technically, tomatoes aren't vegetables!"

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.860
And... I just.. before we do this episode,

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:23.120
I just want to encourage you not to be that person

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:26.260
But, knowing the real classifications of the stuff that we eat

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.620
can tell you a lot about where fruits and vegetables

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.100
come from and how they're developed.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.820
So it's pretty interesting

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.080
just don't use it to be an insufferable pedant.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.540
For example, officially speaking,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.340
Anything that is a root, stem or leaf of a plant

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.980
qualifies as a vegetable.

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.120
meaning that some things that you might ordinarily

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.160
consider a fruit, is actually a vegetable.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.740
Rhubarb, for instance, we think of a

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:47.120
kind of like a fruity thing because

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.200
it's in pie and it tastes so sweet

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.760
but it's the stalk of a plant, so its a vegetable.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.000
Vegetable pie...who thought of that?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.420
Corn, zucchini, and green beans, on the other hand

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.420
all fruit, so are tomatoes.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:00.020
That's because these foods are not

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.340
roots, stems, or leaves.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.620
They're ovaries.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.340
Hopefully that doesn't make you feel too weird.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.820
So yeah, fruits are the ovaries of a flowering plant

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.980
that develop after its seeds are fertilized

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:10.960
or, sometimes, after they've been triggered to

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:12.100
develop without fetilization.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.440
From the plant's perspective, surrounding its seeds

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:16.680
with something soft and juicy and delicious

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.920
increases the chances that those seeds will get eaten

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:22.020
and then spread around in nice fertile

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.160
piles of poo.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.360
So broccoli and cauliflower are not fruit

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.360
even though they are flower buds because they're unopened

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.900
the flower hasn't transformed.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.780
True fruits come in lots of different types

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.460
and some of them make for excellent anatomy lessons

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:38.160
One key factor for botanists in categorizing fruits is

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:40.220
is how many ovaries the flower had.

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.820
So berries by definition are fruits that come from

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.320
from a single ovary with multiple seeds.

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.640
That makes grapes, bananas, peppers and tomatoes

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.700
all different types of berries.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.880
So hold onto your shorts because raspberries

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.880
and blackberries are something totally different

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:56.680
They're called aggregate fruits

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.040
a whole bunch of little fruits grouped together.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.900
And strawberries aren't berries either

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.980
in fact, the tasty red part of the strawberry isn't

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.880
even a fruit. Its a special kind of plant structure

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.580
called a fleshy receptacle.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.780
You actually have to look much closer at the receptacle

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.800
to see the fruit, which are called achenes.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.420
They're dry, one-seeded fruits that speckle

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.920
the red surface of the strawberry

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.400
Sunflowers produce another achene that you probably

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.900
know as sunflower seeds.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.560
Nuts are fruits too and their shells are coats

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.200
developed from the ovary wall.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.520
That includes things like chestnuts and hazelnuts

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:29.980
But technically, walnuts and pecans are not nuts,

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.320
along with other single ovary fruits like peaches and

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.620
and plums and coconuts, they're called drupes.

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.560
Drupes only have one seed with a distinct skin,

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.840
covering a fleshy middle layer.

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.420
In a drupe, the inner layer is often called stone-like,

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:43.860
and if you've ever accidentally chomped on a peach pit,

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.060
you understand why.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.160
Now if you want to get super fancy with your botanical terminology

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.260
raspberries and blackberries are specifically

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.740
aggregate drupes, and each small section is called a druplet.

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.800
But many fruits are more than just a ripened flower ovary.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.260
Take pome fruits, for instance, like apples and pears.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:00.300
Pome fruits are known as accessory fruits because

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.560
there's so much more going on in them than a simple ovary

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.800
The ovary makes up only the core of the fruit.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:08.280
The flesh of the fruit is actually modified

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.720
flower petals and sepals, the flower parts that cover a bud

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.040
leaving the knobby receptacle at the base of the flower.

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:15.640
And when you eat hesperidium fruits

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.760
you're also getting a mouthful of the unexpected

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:20.120
This category includes fruits with tough rinds

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.560
and little partitions, like lemons and grapefruits

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:24.460
and oranges. Turns out that those small packed

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.560
juicy bits in each section, called juice sacs

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:31.220
were once tiny hair like cells on the inside of the ovary,

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.300
but they filled bursting with goodness as the fruit ripened.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.480
So the next time you drink a pulpy glass of OJ

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.620
enjoy your mouthful of fruit hair.
