00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.621
Hi, I'm Mark Emiley and on behalf of Expert
Village. In this segment we are going to go

00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:11.160
over bottling and capping of our beer. Alright,
so now we've got our beer up on the counter,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.090
our bottles all rinsed out and dried and ready
to go, our bottle caps ready to go, our capper

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:23.990
and now we are going to use our filling tube
and attach that to our bottling bucket. I'm

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.630
using a filling tube that is a little simpler
than some of the conventional bottle fillers.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.560
If you have a bottle filler, it will be a
lot easier to do this. So now we are going

00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.800
to get ready to fill our first bottle. We
are going to stick the bottle under the filler

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.560
and open up the flow. And it will start flowing
into the bottle, as you can see here. As it

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:55.960
gets towards the top, we are going to turn
it off and slowly eek a little more in. Then

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:10.270
we are going to pull it out and we are good
to go. Now, we are going to grab a bottle

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.690
cap, put it on top of the bottle and put it
off to the side for now. We are going to cap

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:21.820
it later. Then, grab your next bottle, put
it under and start filling it up. If you have

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.350
a bottle filler, you can leave the spigot
open and the bottle filler will actually stop

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.840
the flow for you. You want the fill line to
be about an inch and a half to an inch below

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.610
the top. If you don't feel that you are close
enough, pull it down, take a little hit and

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:44.409
you are good to go. If you are using a bottle
filler, you may need to push it up slightly

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:49.479
on the side and it will fill it a little more.
So after we've filled all of our bottles and

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.819
put a cap on top of them, we are ready to
cap them. The reason that we didn't cap them

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:59.709
right away is because a little CO2 is pushing
out of that. And CO2 is carbon dioxide and

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:03.649
that's going to clear the head space out of
some oxygen which we don't want in our beer.

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:09.549
Now that we are ready to cap, we are going
to put the bottles between our knees, take

00:02:09.549 --> 00:02:17.129
our capper, open it up, place it on top of
the cap, get on top of it, push down until

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:24.610
it kind of pops and then your bottle has been
capped. You are going to repeat this for all

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.790
the bottles that you have. Once all your beer
is bottled and capped, you may want to put

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.910
a label on it. Or, at the minimum, you probably
want to write something on the top of the

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.359
cap so that you know what it is.
