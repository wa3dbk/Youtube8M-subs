Hi! This is Vincent Laporta for Expert Village.
Let's get started carving. As I said, we're

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.079
going to start with the little detail first.
So, we just take our thing, our blade, and

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:16.150
we just saw and up and down motion. We don't
try to guide it where we can break our blade

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.670
because they are thin. Don't be afraid if
you have to cut so far and then come around

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.960
to meet it, especially with eyes as circles.
You can just pull it out and then follow the

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:35.489
pattern.
Now remember, we're going to push it from

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.039
the middle out. I just pushed that in so you
can see the shape of the eye. We want to try

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:59.160
to match the same shape. Just follow our pattern.
There we go. I'm going to do the mouth too,

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:22.950
and then I'll push these pieces out together.
Get nice and firm with it, but don't be over

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:47.420
firm. Okay, we're almost done. There we go.
Now, I'll push these pieces out now so you

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:55.820
can see what I mean. You can use the back
of the tools to push out the little pieces.

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:03.470
You can use the back of your tool if you have
to push the piece out. Be careful. Push it

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:19.920
out even. Don't force it. We can clean that
up after. There's one.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.840
Don't worry about the little pieces of pumpkin
that are hanging. You can clean those up when

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:23.450
you're done with the cut.
