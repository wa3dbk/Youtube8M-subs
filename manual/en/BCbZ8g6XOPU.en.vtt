00:00:02.046 --> 00:00:05.906
&gt;&gt; From its beginning as
a land-grant institution,

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:09.476
UW Madison has had a commitment
to environmental stewardship

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:11.926
and serving communities
across our state.

00:00:12.216 --> 00:00:15.396
Here in Madison, we simply
call this commitment the

00:00:15.636 --> 00:00:16.566
Wisconsin idea.

00:00:17.106 --> 00:00:21.226
The ethos of conservation and
community building is in the DNA

00:00:21.226 --> 00:00:22.396
of every course we offer.

00:00:23.106 --> 00:00:25.426
&gt;&gt; That is, the science
and the research that we do

00:00:25.426 --> 00:00:27.656
on campus rolls out
into communities

00:00:27.966 --> 00:00:30.066
and meets a public commitment
for the greater good.

00:00:30.516 --> 00:00:31.716
&gt;&gt; I love the Wisconsin idea.

00:00:31.716 --> 00:00:33.916
I mean, the thought of
sharing not only our research

00:00:33.916 --> 00:00:36.426
and the things we know
about our broader community,

00:00:36.786 --> 00:00:39.446
but also hearing about their
weather stories and learning

00:00:39.646 --> 00:00:42.226
from their experiences, I
just find really exciting.

00:00:42.626 --> 00:00:45.286
&gt;&gt; This relationship with
communities doesn't stop

00:00:45.616 --> 00:00:46.836
at the borders of our state.

00:00:47.296 --> 00:00:50.306
We hope that by engaging
our growing community

00:00:50.446 --> 00:00:53.076
of international MOOC
learners that we can learn

00:00:53.126 --> 00:00:56.406
from one another, continuing to
develop unique points of view

00:00:56.826 --> 00:01:00.776
on diverse topics, from energy
production to global health

00:01:01.296 --> 00:01:03.046
to Shakespeare's
Hamlet and hunting

00:01:03.106 --> 00:01:05.056
in the Northwoods of Wisconsin.

00:01:05.356 --> 00:01:08.366
MOOCS compliment the teaching
and learning that happens here

00:01:08.446 --> 00:01:11.886
on our campus and make a
UW experience available

00:01:11.996 --> 00:01:13.676
to new learners around
the world.

00:01:14.186 --> 00:01:16.196
&gt;&gt; Taking the research
and the conversations

00:01:16.256 --> 00:01:18.066
that are happening
here and opening them

00:01:18.246 --> 00:01:19.386
to a wider, broader audience.

00:01:19.756 --> 00:01:22.116
Not just in the state of
Wisconsin, but around the globe,

00:01:22.576 --> 00:01:23.826
and bringing them together.

00:01:24.336 --> 00:01:27.586
&gt;&gt; Part of sustainability is
understanding how local actions

00:01:27.626 --> 00:01:29.886
have a global impact
and vice versa.

00:01:30.226 --> 00:01:31.706
And, so I'm hoping that part

00:01:31.706 --> 00:01:34.316
of this course can help
fill this knowledge gap

00:01:34.796 --> 00:01:37.706
and help connect
participants around the world.

00:01:37.906 --> 00:01:38.896
&gt;&gt; These MOOCs are meant

00:01:38.956 --> 00:01:41.596
to present the massive
choices we all face

00:01:41.746 --> 00:01:44.846
in our rapidly changing
world, and we look forward

00:01:44.846 --> 00:01:47.206
to starting some massive
conversations with you.

00:01:47.656 --> 00:01:48.536
On, Wisconsin!
