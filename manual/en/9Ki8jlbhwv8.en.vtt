00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:05.580
Now
directly themselves

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.709
adjustment 
adjustments here in 3

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:14.599
stage of the first phase
bolts

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.290
the second phase of this
screw placed

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:23.240
a third step depth
this lever

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.750
set width
capturing immediately

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.990
look like this
regulated here

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.309
all clear nut
extended or

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.739
pushed
lock-nut

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:39.530
all clear

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.059
If we twist 
this screw here or

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.260
here we share

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:53.179
if we twist

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:58.800
sock or
rises or if

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.729
twist in the opposite
side will

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:07.860
fall

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.979
but adjustable angle of attack
in fact, we need to

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.860
adjust
this thing, too, we

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.670
analyze why
we twist and

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.780
board changes its
angle

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.740
Now in the opposite
side will twist

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.330
She will be
flatten

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:40.100
It is the most important
adjust our

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:48.160
plow 
clear twist screw and

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.050
share

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:56.420
moves his
so adjustable and 4

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.960
this adjustment

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:09.500
toothed

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.350
sector and thereby
adjustable width

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.440
capture what
here should pay

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.560
Attention
When we

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.200
move

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.350
field board always
located on the axis

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.290
tractor driving and
it deviates

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:36.830
side at the expense of
such that the frame

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.370
of two pieces
square turns

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:43.640
he always keeps
this board in parallel

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:46.130
tractor driving and
parallel to the axis

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.110
tractor and it is very
importantly, it is also necessary

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.200
remember that this
adjustment so

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.510
acts

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.220
and is now starting to plow
adjust

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.659
what
yet it is important to remember

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:12.150
This is very important when
you will spend

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.629
any adjustment
furrow or not

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:19.769
sulcus always
Remember that

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.670
there and play this
Corps also has

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:33.209
backlash

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:39.329
and
before twist

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.400
this bolt we
should these elevators

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.579
always clean because
what

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:48.480
land will abut
and play away

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.609
respectively

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:56.250
We need them, too
remove and then

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.470
just screw this
strike on

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.370
the required depth

00:04:05.639 --> 00:04:09.989
same 
with this lever, you also

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:12.780
slide the width
but you have to capture

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:18.030
choose
play but

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:22.710
play than
bolts and play the most

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.160
frame
