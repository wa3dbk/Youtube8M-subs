00:00:00.049 --> 00:00:03.149
This video is an overview of monthly
maintenance for your autoclave.

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:07.779
However always refer to the appropriate
technical documentation for the complete

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:09.010
list of instructions,

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.259
safety alerts and sequence of procedures
before conducting any service or

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.880
maintenance operations.

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.560
Every 28 days the autoclave
automatically displays a

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.960
"perform monthly maintenance" message. This is a more thorough cleaning of the unit

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.439
and involves multiple steps. Clean the
chamber

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.650
and plumbing: with a cool chamber drain
the autoclaves reservoir

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.190
and refill with distilled water. Add one
ounce of speedclean autoclave cleaner

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.670
directly to the cool chamber. This is
where you load your instruments for

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.290
sterilization.

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:46.930
Run one pouches cycle, but push the stop
button when the drying cycle begins.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.399
It's not necessary for the dry cycle to
run during this maintenance.

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.129
Drain the reservoir again and refill a
second time with clean

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.159
distilled water for the rinse cycle. Rinse
by running one unwrapped cycle.

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:04.740
Push the stop button when the drying
cycle begins.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:08.890
After the cycle has completed, drain and
fill the reservoir with clean distilled

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:09.450
water.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.970
Then allow the sterilizer to cool. Remove
the trays and tray rack,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.630
and wipe with a damp cloth.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.580
Next remove and clean filters. Remove
filters by pulling upward

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.780
and twisting slightly. Filter should be
cleaned by washing with a mild soap and

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.200
distilled water solution.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.500
Use a small stiff brush or an ultrasonic
cleaner

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.770
to remove stubborn deposits. After
cleaning rinse the filters with

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.610
distilled water

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.050
and set them aside.

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.830
Wipe the inside of the autoclave
chamber being careful not to damage the

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:43.720
heating element,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.300
steam temperature probe, or water level
sensor.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.800
Reinsert the filters into the
appropriate holes by pushing downward

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.079
while twisting slightly.

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:58.290
Reinstall the tray rack.

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.160
Next, remove and clean the door and door
dam gaskets.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.830
Remove the door dam gasket
and then the gasket ring from the unit.

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.660
Clean gaskets and ring with speedclean,
distilled water

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.220
and a soft brush. Inspect the gaskets for
damage,

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:21.040
shrinking or swelling. Replace the gasket
if damage is apparent.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.260
Press the door gasket ring into the
channel and the door gasket

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.980
and place the door gasket back into the
door.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.330
The next part of the required monthly
maintenance involves verifying proper

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.400
operation of the pressure relief valve.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.720
Since high pressure and temperature
steam will be vented from under the

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.300
autoclave during this track

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:42.570
place a roll towel around the bottom of
the autoclave to act as a steam barrier.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.700
Press the unwrap cycle and then start.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.769
Monitor the display and wait for the
pressure to reach 20 PSI.

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:56.160
When 20 PSI is reached pull upward firmly on
the relief valve lever

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.830
on top of the autoclave capping and hold
it open for three seconds.

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:03.180
Steam should discharge freely from
beneath the rear of the unit.

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:07.640
Release the lever quickly and verify that the valve has closed properly,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.940
by noting that steam has stopped
escaping. If the unit is still releasing

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:12.580
steam

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.030
pull up on the valve lever again and
release it quickly

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.319
so the valve snaps back into position.
Repeat this if necessary

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.980
to make sure the valve is seated
correctly. Press STOP to cancel the cycle

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.829
preventing the unit from overheating.
Allow the chamber to cool.

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.000
If excessive force is required to open
the valve

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.540
or if it will not reseat properly,
contact your Midmark authorized dealer.

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:40.400
When the maintenance is complete the
"perform monthly maintenance" message will

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.010
go away

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.470
during your next sterilization cycle. M9 and M11's

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:48.510
are designed and tested to
provide exceptional reliability

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:52.730
throughout their service life. To ensure
integrity, performance and safety of all

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.930
major components,

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:57.950
it is the responsibility of the user to
have the sterilizer performance and

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:01.389
operation verified by Midmark Authorized
Service Provider

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:04.680
at least every 10 years or 10,000 cycles,

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.200
whichever comes first. For more detailed
information about maintaining your

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:09.660
autoclave

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.540
please refer to the M9/M11
installation and operation manual.
