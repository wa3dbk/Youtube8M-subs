00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.270
All the painters that I knew when I was young,
for all of them, Matisse was a god; you know,

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.140
he just had an astonishing impact on all painters
in the second half of the twentieth century.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.930
In fact, I never thought about him as a man,
and when I began to make enquiries, I came

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.950
to realise what an extraordinary human being
he was. 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.260
Matisse was born in the very north-eastern

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:44.050
side of France, just inside the border with
Belgium. It's where the First World War was

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:50.510
fought, in the thick of those terrible upheavals.
They were in his blood and in his bones; and

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:55.770
of course, he grew up not to paint horror
and destruction in the way that, say, Picasso

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:02.770
did. Matisse wanted, in his work, a world
of peace and harmony that he had never known.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:12.240
He sacrificed absolutely everything to his
art. When his father said painting was crazy,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.700
he had to enrol at art school in secret. He
ran away at the age of 21 to Paris to become

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:22.860
a painter, and everybody thought he was absolutely
mad. He himself said that, you know, it would

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.170
take 50 years, really, for people to understand.
He was trying to persuade himself that one

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.420
day people would understand what he was doing.
Of course, it was also very hard on his wife,

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.780
who for a very long time was the only person
in the world who really believed in him and

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:40.680
his art, so it was not an easy life for any
of them. 

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.420
He made the first Icarus in 1943

00:01:47.239 --> 00:01:50.850
what I think would be recognised as the
first cut-out proper. France, of course, by

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:57.399
now, was occupied, and Matisse was a bedridden
invalid, and when he cut that Icarus out,

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:02.540
it was a time when shells were landing in
his garden, and Germans had commandeered the

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.360
lower part of his house. He mounted it on
black and it's got what people thought were

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.840
stars all around it, golden; actually, Matisse
said they were exploding shells at the time.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:18.840
Of course, they were. Quite a lot of people
who visited Matisse did see him making these

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.549
things, and described it. They were sheets
of paper that had been covered with gouache

00:02:24.549 --> 00:02:31.109
colours. He sat up in bed against his pillows.
He'd pick up a piece and cut out the shape.

00:02:31.109 --> 00:02:35.359
His assistants, who had to paint the paper
for him, they had to pin it on the wall, because

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:39.510
he hadn't the strength to do that any longer.
He'd say no, that won't do; shave a bit off

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.790
there, cut a bit off there; and it went on
from morning to evening. One of them said,

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:51.790
he knew what he was looking for, but we didn't.
In his head, he must have had a picture of

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.660
how it was he wanted it to end up, and it
was never like anything anybody else had ever made

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:05.140
The Snail was a very late work, I think,
and it's not even cut out; a lot of it is 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:07.160
actually torn paper

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.740
He said what he was trying
to do was boil down something, anything, to

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.060
its essence without losing anything of expressiveness.
His whole life had been, one could say, a

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:23.580
conflict between colour and line, and now
he'd abolished that conflict. 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:25.080
Matisse didn't

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:29.790
really use words to express this; he expressed
these things with paint, but it is a kind

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:36.510
of spiritual harmony and liberation and freedom
that he achieved at the very end of his life

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.200
in his great cut paper compositions.
