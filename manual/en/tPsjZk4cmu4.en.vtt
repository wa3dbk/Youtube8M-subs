00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.180
and comes with great new features

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.849
ready to go you also experienced a new
back cigarillo joint that allows you to

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.039
clean under furniture without bending

00:00:14.039 --> 00:00:17.160
when it comes to low furniture sweeper
stop short

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.800
but not the G6 1-click and it reaches in
areas that most other sweepers kids

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.410
reach without bending down

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.910
the new and improved super sliders give
a whole new meaning to cleaning

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.970
a sliding glide on a service without any
effort and without changing any settings

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.520
I like vacuum cleaners &amp; other sleepers
that only go back and forth

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.390
this super sliders slide in any
direction and pick up in places where

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.989
sweepers can't has a 360 degree
swiveling head and black dress

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.160
and the new G6 is the best there is
and when it comes time this story

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.559
the GT's magnetic storage lots polls out
so it takes up less room than a broom

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.019
just hang it up at the way

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.929
stored in a closet or in any small space
and now with a new non-slip rubber tip

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.939
and leave it the new G6 is quite
simply the best there is

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.340
on top of all these great new features
remember the G6 with easy to use

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.619
and it to you count it's still the
lightest weight cordless sweeper out there

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.140
it picks up forwards backwards side to
side

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.329
and snuggles and fits in any direction
with its patented got breast technology

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:25.470
the G 6's brushes spin at 4,000 rpm and
creating a powerful vacuum action so it

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.990
picks up the big stuff and even the
tiniest dust and dirt particles

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.640
it even gets up in grout lines the GT's
corner brushes tackle messes Long Bay

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.759
sports and in the corner so nothing is
left behind

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.780
and with its nothing go rechargeable
battery you get 45 minutes of continuous

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.360
cleaning power and you'll never have to
worry about courts

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.700
nuts-and-bolts would destroy a regular
vacuum cleaners but the G6 picks up

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.369
with your back you can't like broken
glass

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:54.939
