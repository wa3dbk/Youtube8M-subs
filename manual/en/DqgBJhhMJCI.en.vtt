Hi, today I am making simple sweet potato latte which is popular in Korea.

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:21.630
First, heat 1 cup of milk. Today I’m microwaving it for 1 minute and 30 seconds. 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:30.780
And you can do this over stove top as well. Just simmer, don’t boil.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.900
In a blender, add ½ of a sweet potato, cooked, peeled, and diced, 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.440
1 tablespoon of walnuts,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.280
and about 1 tablespoon of acacia honey. Adjust the amount of honey to your liking.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:48.570
Then pour in 1 cup of hot milk. 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:55.240
And blend until homogeneous.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:56.230
Voila! 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:59.350
Koguma Latte, Sweet potato latte.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.150
Top with milk foam. 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.000
Today I used Nespresso Aeroccino Plus. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.280
This is easy to use and quick to clean. 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:15.860
And if you want, dust with ground cinnamon and decorate with chopped walnuts.

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:22.710
Sweet potato latte can be a quick breakfast or a great afternoon treat.

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.900
Bon appetit. 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:30.860
Try this for Thanksgiving. It's simple, easy, delicious, and healthy. 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:36.650
Everyone will love it. 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.540
And obviously Alex loves it so much, too.

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.940
Thank you for watching. Bye for now!
