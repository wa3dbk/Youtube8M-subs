00:00:07.724 --> 00:00:09.767
So how was work this evening,
neighbor?

00:00:09.933 --> 00:00:12.058
I need a lap dance, table 5.
Don't get too close.

00:00:12.224 --> 00:00:14.433
The guy smells like asparagus penis.
He's got a hook hand.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:16.475
You're not a neighbor.
You're a pot dealer.

00:00:16.974 --> 00:00:19.535
I have a smidge of marijuana
down in Mexico.

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:23.267
Bring it back before Sunday night,
I'll pay you $100,000.

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:25.350
What the fuck is that?

00:00:25.516 --> 00:00:27.850
I bought an orca.
I make a lot of money.

00:00:27.942 --> 00:00:30.757
You're probably going to get searched at
the boarder. You could wear a disguise.

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:32.552
Bane, from Batman, something like that?

00:00:32.677 --> 00:00:35.558
There's no drugs in here.
You've nothing to worry about.

00:00:36.159 --> 00:00:38.267
- How'd you like to make 10 grand?
- Drug dealing?

00:00:38.392 --> 00:00:39.766
Not drug dealing! Smuggling!

00:00:39.891 --> 00:00:42.183
Me crossing the border alone?
Huge red flag.

00:00:42.349 --> 00:00:44.350
But families?
They don't get a second look.

00:00:44.516 --> 00:00:46.142
So, I need you to be my wife.

00:00:47.141 --> 00:00:50.183
Look, I hired this dork that lives
in my building and a little gutter punk.

00:00:50.308 --> 00:00:51.474
Meet your new sister.

00:00:51.599 --> 00:00:55.183
We just have to dress-up like
a squeaky clean all American family.

00:00:55.906 --> 00:00:58.808
- You have a lovely family.
- Thank you. We're the Millers!

00:00:58.974 --> 00:01:00.600
- Honey!
- Eat a dick.

00:01:00.766 --> 00:01:01.975
Sorry.

00:01:02.933 --> 00:01:05.308
Ola! I'm here to pick up
a smidge of pot.

00:01:05.474 --> 00:01:07.045
This is not a "smidge".

00:01:07.558 --> 00:01:10.225
You got me moving enough weed
to kill Willy fucking Nelson, man.

00:01:12.022 --> 00:01:13.369
Is this part of your plan?

00:01:13.494 --> 00:01:16.182
You folks can make camp
with the Fitzgeralds tonight.

00:01:16.451 --> 00:01:19.266
When you've been married as long as us,
you're looking to spice things up a bit.

00:01:19.391 --> 00:01:21.983
I've never touched
another woman before.

00:01:22.602 --> 00:01:23.921
I would be okay with that.

00:01:24.849 --> 00:01:27.308
- I guess we're swinging.
- Oh, yeah.

00:01:27.474 --> 00:01:28.575
Here we go.

00:01:35.063 --> 00:01:36.642
I really like your family.

00:01:36.808 --> 00:01:38.517
- Is that a rocket?
- A cucumber?

00:01:38.683 --> 00:01:41.525
- They're interesting.
- The big black penis!

00:01:41.974 --> 00:01:43.757
- It's a skateboard.
- A skateboard, great!

00:01:43.882 --> 00:01:45.725
- Of course it is!
- The big black skateboard.

00:01:45.891 --> 00:01:48.683
Go! Go! Go! It turns out that we stole
from an international drug dealer.

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:50.516
You all die now.
Together, as a family.

00:01:50.641 --> 00:01:54.267
- We're not even a real family!
- My wife, she's just a cheap stripper.

00:01:54.433 --> 00:01:55.517
Okay, prove it.

00:02:01.961 --> 00:02:03.642
Have some respect.
That's your mother!

00:02:05.558 --> 00:02:07.225
- What's going on?
- A spider bit me!

00:02:07.391 --> 00:02:09.058
Fuck a donkey, it hurts so much!

00:02:09.224 --> 00:02:10.933
- Let me see it.
- You're not seeing it.

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.600
Would you just drop your pants?

00:02:12.766 --> 00:02:15.058
- We've all seen a dick.
- We have...

00:02:17.514 --> 00:02:19.183
What does it look like?
I can't look.

00:02:19.308 --> 00:02:20.725
- Fuck me!
- It's not that bad.

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.683
- You looked at it?
- I won't.

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:25.086
- How bad is it?
- Kenny is fine!
