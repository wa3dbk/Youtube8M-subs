Narrator:
Welcome to the West Wing Week,
your guide to everything that's

00:00:06.061 --> 00:00:08.728
happening at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:00:08.728 --> 00:00:11.094
With America's War in
Iraq coming to an end,

00:00:11.094 --> 00:00:13.428
the President welcomed Iraqi
Prime Minister Maliki to the

00:00:13.428 --> 00:00:17.328
White House and invited him to
a moving wreath-laying ceremony,

00:00:17.328 --> 00:00:19.728
and then spoke to troops at
Fort Bragg on ending the war

00:00:19.728 --> 00:00:23.161
responsibly and standing
by those who fought for it.

00:00:23.161 --> 00:00:24.861
After nearly nine
years of sacrifice,

00:00:24.861 --> 00:00:28.094
the tide of war is receding
and the troops are coming home.

00:00:28.094 --> 00:00:30.928
That's December 9th
to December 15th or,

00:00:30.928 --> 00:00:33.561
"A Final March Toward Home."

00:00:33.561 --> 00:00:38.928
The President:
So as your Commander-in-Chief,
and on behalf of a grateful

00:00:38.928 --> 00:00:45.127
nation, I'm proud to finally
say these two words --

00:00:45.127 --> 00:00:48.895
and I know your families
agree -- welcome home.

00:00:48.895 --> 00:00:50.628
(cheers and applause)

00:00:50.628 --> 00:00:53.361
Welcome home.

00:00:53.361 --> 00:00:56.428
Welcome home.

00:00:56.428 --> 00:00:57.628
Merry Christmas, everybody!

00:00:57.628 --> 00:00:59.928
Narrator:
The holiday season was in
full swing by the time this

00:00:59.928 --> 00:01:03.227
particularly historic West Wing
Week began with a flurry of

00:01:03.227 --> 00:01:05.461
White House traditions being
honored over the weekend --

00:01:05.461 --> 00:01:08.528
first with the arrival and
installation of the Menorah;

00:01:08.528 --> 00:01:10.795
then with the President
attending the Army-Navy Game.

00:01:10.795 --> 00:01:13.428
And the First Family attending
the Annual Christmas in

00:01:13.428 --> 00:01:14.494
Washington Celebration.

00:01:14.494 --> 00:01:15.895
The President:
You guys have got to help
us deliver the books.

00:01:15.895 --> 00:01:16.628
Are you strong?

00:01:16.628 --> 00:01:17.828
Okay, let's put it on there.

00:01:17.828 --> 00:01:20.528
Narrator:
On Monday, the President
welcomed Iraqi Prime Minister

00:01:20.528 --> 00:01:22.728
Nouri al-Maliki to
the White House.

00:01:22.728 --> 00:01:25.194
The two leaders held talks on
the removal of U.S. military

00:01:25.194 --> 00:01:28.795
forces from Iraq and on efforts
to start a new chapter in the

00:01:28.795 --> 00:01:31.161
Comprehensive Strategic
Partnership between the

00:01:31.161 --> 00:01:33.194
United States and Iraq.

00:01:33.194 --> 00:01:35.895
The President:
This is a season
of homecomings.

00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:39.961
And military families across
America are being reunited for

00:01:39.961 --> 00:01:41.461
the holidays.

00:01:41.461 --> 00:01:45.494
In the coming days, the last
American soldiers will cross the

00:01:45.494 --> 00:01:51.361
border out of Iraq with honor
and with their heads held high.

00:01:51.361 --> 00:01:57.328
After nearly nine years, our
war in Iraq ends this month.

00:01:57.328 --> 00:01:59.461
Narrator:
Later, at Arlington
National Cemetery,

00:01:59.461 --> 00:02:02.328
they honored the sacrifices and
service of all those who served

00:02:02.328 --> 00:02:06.094
in Iraq to reach this moment
full of promise for an enduring

00:02:06.094 --> 00:02:09.494
U.S.-Iraq friendship at the
end of America's War in Iraq.

00:02:09.494 --> 00:02:17.994
(bugler playing "Taps")

00:02:17.994 --> 00:02:20.761
Narrator:
On Wednesday, the President and
First Lady spoke directly to the

00:02:20.761 --> 00:02:23.394
troops at Fort Bragg and to
members of the Armed Services

00:02:23.394 --> 00:02:24.895
and their families everywhere.

00:02:24.895 --> 00:02:26.828
The President spoke about
the enormous sacrifices and

00:02:26.828 --> 00:02:28.861
achievements of the brave
Americans who served in the

00:02:28.861 --> 00:02:30.094
Iraq War.

00:02:30.094 --> 00:02:32.861
And about the extraordinary
milestone of bringing that war

00:02:32.861 --> 00:02:34.561
to an end.

00:02:34.561 --> 00:02:38.728
The President:
This country needs
to learn from you.

00:02:38.728 --> 00:02:41.661
Folks in Washington
need to learn from you.

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:43.394
Audience:
Hooah!

00:02:43.394 --> 00:02:44.227
(applause)

00:02:44.227 --> 00:02:50.361
The President:
For all the disagreements
that we face, you remind us,

00:02:50.361 --> 00:02:53.928
there's something bigger
than our differences.

00:02:53.928 --> 00:02:59.194
Something that makes us
one nation and one people.

00:02:59.194 --> 00:03:02.461
That's why you, the
9/11 generation,

00:03:02.461 --> 00:03:06.227
has earned your
place in history.

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:09.394
I could not be prouder of you.

00:03:09.394 --> 00:03:11.928
And America could not
be prouder of you.

00:03:11.928 --> 00:03:15.361
Narrator:
On Thursday, the President once
again vowing that we can't wait

00:03:15.361 --> 00:03:18.528
for Congress to ensure a fair
shake for working Americans,

00:03:18.528 --> 00:03:21.227
announced a rule change that
will ensure that more home

00:03:21.227 --> 00:03:24.261
health care workers qualify
for the overtime pay

00:03:24.261 --> 00:03:25.594
that they've earned.

00:03:25.594 --> 00:03:28.494
The President's special guest
at the event was Pauline Beck,

00:03:28.494 --> 00:03:31.294
a home health care worker
from California who allowed

00:03:31.294 --> 00:03:34.528
then-candidate Obama to spend
a day working alongside her

00:03:34.528 --> 00:03:35.994
on the job.

00:03:35.994 --> 00:03:38.861
Meanwhile, as the countdown
clock continues to tick,

00:03:38.861 --> 00:03:41.361
it's time to help the middle
class and all those trying to

00:03:41.361 --> 00:03:44.194
reach it by ensuring that taxes
don't go up by an average of

00:03:44.194 --> 00:03:48.661
$1,000 for 160 million
working Americans next year.

And thanks again for checking

00:03:57.928 --> 00:04:01.928
The President:
Now, I'm sure you realize
why I don't like following

00:04:01.928 --> 00:04:02.928
Michelle Obama.

00:04:02.928 --> 00:04:05.161
(laughter)

00:04:05.161 --> 00:04:06.561
She's pretty good.

00:04:06.561 --> 00:04:07.994
Audience:
Hooah!

00:04:07.994 --> 00:04:12.761
The President:
And it is true I am a little
biased but let me just say it:

00:04:12.761 --> 00:04:15.061
Michelle, you are a
remarkable First Lady.

00:04:15.061 --> 00:04:17.994
(cheers and applause)

00:04:17.994 --> 00:04:21.528
You are a great advocate
for military families.

00:04:21.528 --> 00:04:24.494
Audience:
Hooah!

00:04:24.494 --> 00:04:25.661
The President:
And you're cute.

00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:26.561
First Lady Michelle Obama:
No.

00:04:26.561 --> 00:04:29.494
(laughter)
