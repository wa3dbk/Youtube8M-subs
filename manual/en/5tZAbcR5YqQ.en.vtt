00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:03.470
Today we are going to install part number
87638 from Hidden Hitch.

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:08.600
And we are going to be installing this on
a 1998 Toyota Sienna mini van.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:12.559
And this also applies for part number 75120
from Draw-Tite.

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:16.030
To begin our install, we need to do a couple
things.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:19.100
We need to lower the exhaust to help get it
out of the way.

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.930
Sometimes, you can sneak it between the bumper
and tail pipe, but just to give you a little

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.800
bit of extra working room, we will go ahead
and lower it out of the way.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.390
And then also these tie-down hooks for shipping,
these come off and stay off.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:34.450
And we will begin by removing these.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:55.430
Alright, at this point we can go ahead and
install the hitch with the fasteners towards

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.489
the end of the vehicle.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.640
And it is a good idea to have an extra set
of hands with this one it is a little on the

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.640
wide side.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.679
We will just temporarily install it with the
bolts.

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:12.119
Once you get your hitch up there, what we
want to do is go ahead and actually get it

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:15.450
centered first, simply because we have to
drill the holes out towards the front of the

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:16.659
vehicle.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.420
And we have to get it straight right off the
bat because there are no holes to adjust it

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:26.779
after we drill our holes.

00:01:26.779 --> 00:02:09.170
We will go ahead and center it 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:30.950
the way we want, like we were done with it,
and then we 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:37.810
will go and drill our holes out.

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:46.099
We are actually going to start off a pilot
hole first with a quarter inch bit.

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:58.170
And then what will happen next, we will take
down the hitch and we will run the hole out

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.610
to 9/16.

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:26.879
That will insure we have a little bit of extra
room to pull the bolt and plate through the

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:37.030
frame and out the hole.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:55.730
We have our quarter inch hole drilled out
and the hitch out of the way, and we are going

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:55.020
to enlarge it to 9/16.Actually, we will leave
a 1/2 inch right now, then it will be a little

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:15.339
bit easier to go 
to 9/16 size.
