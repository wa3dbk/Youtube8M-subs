Aloha friends it's Cobi.

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.520
For this Veggietorial,
I'm going to show you how I make

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.180
Roasted Miso Brussels Sprouts.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.299
If your only experience
with the sprout has been eating them boiled

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:14.709
beyond the point of humiliation, this recipe
might change your whole experience.

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:18.500
It basically turns them into highly addictive
veggie crack.

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.970
This recipe is also part of a Thanksgiving
collaboration that is completely turkey-free.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.210
Barbara from BuonaPappa made Pumpkin Gnocchi
Sav from EatNowCryLater made Tofu w/ Grilled

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.050
Eggplant
Lainey from SImplyBakings made the cutest

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.730
Mini Caramel Salted Cheesecakes
And Haniela made a decadent Apple Cider Cream

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:42.730
Pie.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:46.980
I'll have all the links for you at the end
of the video.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:53.580
So, let's get started.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:57.252
Start by giving your sprouts a good wash and
Remove and tired, sad looking outer leaves.

00:00:57.252 --> 00:01:00.149
We only want the happy sprouts, because they
are the most delicious.

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.690
Trim off the stem and cut in half lengthwise.

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:09.510
To make the awesome sauce I used
white miso, mirin, rice vinegar and ginger

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.510
syrup.

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.090
Or be a rebel and use the sweetener of your
choice

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.030
Like maple syrup,agave nectar or sugar.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.200
Spread out the sprouts on a lined baking sheet
Then drizzle with sesame oil

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.100
and a generous pinch of salt.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.720
Spread in an even layer and roast for 5 minutes
(400F degrees)

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:37.150
Or until they turn one shade brighter in color.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.080
After we give them that little head start
on cooking,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.670
remove from the oven and toss with the miso
glaze.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:49.220
Make sure the sprouts are in an even layer
so they can roast up.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.659
Bake at 400F degrees for 20 minutes stirring
every 5 minutes.

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:58.720
They will caramelize very quickly, so keep
an eye on them so they don't burn.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.159
And ta-da, we just made Roasted Miso Brussels
Sprouts.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.159
So what do you think?

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:04.970
Brussels Sprouts: Love 'um or hate 'um?

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.960
What say you?

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:22.620
