look at the voicemail two one nine two
david p call twenty four hours a day

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:09.319
here is a voice mail we received about

00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:10.450
schedule

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.230

artwork

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:16.710
army

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:19.839
coauthor of the issuing abortion

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:23.409
where people kind of uh... early to know
that this debate and i didn't get a

00:00:23.409 --> 00:00:27.210
conversation about it is the reason
behind it

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.929
i will call correctly storm

00:00:28.929 --> 00:00:31.409
years years ago

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:35.470
people are going well or not they should
be exceptions for rape

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.930
and fifty years ago remember exactly
when but learning among conservatives

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:40.890
like was

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.080
okay well with the exception kuwait then
everyone involved in portland or seattle

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.190
rate

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.570
brought up the idea of illegitimate
babies when you go in right after the

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.270
break but it goin

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.090
ten twenty weeks later late-model
legitimately introducing you to operate

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.330
opened up the whole pandora's boxes of
problems in and abortion

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.410
urea back-alley abortions we have
activation break toward actual recorded

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:12.210
at the bush because you can afford to
greater charlotte or political reason

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.700
so package

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.380
bachelorette the source of the probable
you know sort of conversation about what

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.220
i mean i think that that's very true of
course that's with at the root of this

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.280
the idea that for any number of
different reasons women are going to

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:27.340
deceive and play used trickery

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.720
in order to obtain an abortion when they
want it and that of course

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:36.070
of course with the legitimacy of rape
discussions are connected to to abortion

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.500
no question about right but also i i
think it's two-sided there is also the

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.180
religious aspect of this entire thing

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.040
and republicans that plenty of
republicans saying that they should just

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.360
be banned all together i mean when
you're talking about when life begins

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.540
you're not talking about legitimate

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.850
imagine me right now we're that's
different

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.440
it's different but it is the same in the
sense that somebody would argue even if

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.400
there was a trait

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.040
blight began right away

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:05.410
ran therefore no abortion on the other
side i guess he shoots you just allow

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:08.909
any woman to have the choice

00:02:08.909 --> 00:02:10.469
the rape thing

00:02:10.469 --> 00:02:13.499
the rape thing doesn't even matter
anymore right right write write write

00:02:13.499 --> 00:02:16.669

develop that term i forget the guys last

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:18.139
