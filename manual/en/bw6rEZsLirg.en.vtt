00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.190
Welcome to Japanesquest.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.449
Today, We are visiting Kinkakuji Temple.

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:18.869
Kinkakuji is a Zen temple located in 
northwest Kyoto.

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:26.325
It was built in 1397 by Ashikaga Yoshimitsu,
the third shogun of the Muromachi shogunate.

00:00:26.325 --> 00:00:30.377
Kinkakuji is the leading symbol of the 
flamboyant Kitayama culture

00:00:30.377 --> 00:00:35.074
and was registered as a UNESCO World 
Heritage Site in 1994.

00:00:36.911 --> 00:00:39.688
Although the formal name of this temple 
is “Rokuonji”,

00:00:39.688 --> 00:00:42.049
it is widely known by the name “Kinkakuji”

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:47.067
because its golden pavilion “Kinkaku” draws 
most people’s attention.

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:51.729
It has 3 floors, and each one was built in
a different architectural style.

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:56.654
The 1st floor was built in a manner of 
the Heian period’s palatial architecture.

00:00:56.654 --> 00:00:59.544
The 2nd floor was designed like a 
samurai’s residence,

00:00:59.544 --> 00:01:02.204
followed by the 3rd floor as a Buddhist 
temple.

00:01:02.204 --> 00:01:05.934
The outside of the 2nd and 3rd floors is 
covered with golden foil,

00:01:05.934 --> 00:01:08.534
which reflects the sunshine all day long.

00:01:10.264 --> 00:01:14.333
While the Kinkakuji temple is well known 
for its magnificent golden pavilion,

00:01:14.333 --> 00:01:17.186
more than a half of the entire area consists
of a garden

00:01:17.186 --> 00:01:20.340
that features paths around the Kyokochi Pond.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.372
Kyokochi pond contains 10 small islands,

00:01:23.372 --> 00:01:26.632
such as Tsuru-Jima Island, and Kame-Jima 
Island.

00:01:26.632 --> 00:01:30.977
They represent a tortoise and crane, which 
are believed as symbols of good fortune.

00:01:32.653 --> 00:01:38.128
The golden pavilion Kinkaku shows the most 
exquisite beauty at sunset.

00:01:38.128 --> 00:01:43.015
Kinkaku during sunset sparkles orange, as if caught on fire.

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:52.124
Kinkakuji temple’s glorious appearance 
represents the flamboyant Kitayama culture 
in the early Muromachi period.

00:01:52.124 --> 00:01:56.657
In the latter half of the Muromachi period,
when the Higashiyama culture flourished,

00:01:56.657 --> 00:02:01.309
another temple, Ginkakuji, was built on 
the opposite side of Kyoto city.

00:02:01.309 --> 00:02:05.278
Both the Kinkakuji and Ginkakuji temples 
are highly appreciated

00:02:05.278 --> 00:02:08.990
as the part of Muromachi 
cultural heritage.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.395
That's today's episode of Japanesquest.
