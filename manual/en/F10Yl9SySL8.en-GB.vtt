00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.500
This is a Sapucaia moment – a special moment where we will give you the very best recipes with Sapucaia

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:33.660
And today we will present you one of our true classics: our around the globe well known caipirinha.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:44.760
First of all we will use a lime (tahiti lime) We will cut off the two ends, and then cut it in half, this way.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:56.860
We will use our special glassware – a special glass we call “ilhabela”.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.360
It’s an important glass for caipirinha, a glass that is especially developed for it.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:14.040
It’s this glass you should use to make a fantastic classic caipirinha.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:25.600
Put the lemon parts in the glass, and add a medium spoon of sugar.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.000
Take your muddler and squeeze out the juices

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.900
But don’t crush the lemon too hard!

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.200
Then we will add ice cubes – like this

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:57.040
And now a marvellous moment: we will add our since 80 years traditional cachaça

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:09.080
A fantastic caipirinha, made with cachaça Sapucaia Cristal, two years matured in amendoim casks – and if you allow me, I’m going to taste it now.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.020
I hope you’ll enjoy it too

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:19.680
