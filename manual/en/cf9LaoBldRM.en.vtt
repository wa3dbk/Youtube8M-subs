00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:03.197
(chalk writing on blackboard)

00:00:03.197 --> 00:00:06.336
(orchestral music)

00:00:06.336 --> 00:00:08.687
- Hey Caroline, I've
heard through other people

00:00:08.687 --> 00:00:11.667
in the office that you like dogs.

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:14.875
- Well Christian, as
a matter of fact I do.

00:00:14.875 --> 00:00:16.932
But, I mean, who doesn't like dogs?

00:00:16.932 --> 00:00:18.946
- They'd have to be some
kind of an inhuman monster

00:00:18.946 --> 00:00:20.891
because dogs are totally awesome.

00:00:20.891 --> 00:00:23.143
My dog Winchester does this
thing whenever I get home

00:00:23.143 --> 00:00:25.900
from work where he's super
excited and he's jumping

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.142
all around and he's happy,
and then he starts yawning.

00:00:30.142 --> 00:00:31.971
- Did you know that yawning
is actually the first

00:00:31.971 --> 00:00:35.090
expression dogs learn to use
when they're tiny puppies?

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:37.839
So it has multiple meanings
depending on the situtation

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:39.153
they're in.

00:00:39.153 --> 00:00:42.607
- So ecstatic joy could be
one of these emotions, right?

00:00:42.607 --> 00:00:44.845
- Well, dogs usually yawn
when they want to send

00:00:44.845 --> 00:00:48.557
a passifying or calming signal
to other dogs or people,

00:00:48.557 --> 00:00:50.662
like, hey everybody let's
just take a breather

00:00:50.662 --> 00:00:52.237
and chill out, okay.

00:00:52.237 --> 00:00:53.182
- Yeah that makes sense.

00:00:53.182 --> 00:00:56.253
Yawns have no element
of fear or aggression.

00:00:56.253 --> 00:00:58.391
It's like the exact opposite of a threat,

00:00:58.391 --> 00:01:01.124
but wait, why would my dog do that to me?

00:01:01.124 --> 00:01:02.564
- Sometimes dogs yawn when they're getting

00:01:02.564 --> 00:01:04.208
obedience training.

00:01:04.208 --> 00:01:05.681
If he's frustrated he might be asking you

00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:07.673
to give him a little break.

00:01:07.673 --> 00:01:08.506
(dog barks)

00:01:08.506 --> 00:01:10.338
That is, if he sees
you as the dominant one

00:01:10.338 --> 00:01:12.094
in your relationship.

00:01:12.094 --> 00:01:12.994
- Um...

00:01:12.994 --> 00:01:15.040
- Let's move on to the
next thing it could mean,

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.314
which is that your dog might
be cooling off his brain.

00:01:18.314 --> 00:01:20.543
There's a veterinary
behaviorist at UC Davis

00:01:20.543 --> 00:01:23.154
that thinks dog brains
get hot during periods

00:01:23.154 --> 00:01:24.368
of inactivity.

00:01:24.368 --> 00:01:27.305
It just gets warm because
the circulation slows down.

00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:31.160
So yawning supposedly cools
that arterial blood down,

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.718
helping the dog's brain function.

00:01:33.718 --> 00:01:35.663
- So I'm either dominating my dog too much

00:01:35.663 --> 00:01:37.283
or he's having trouble
thinking because he's

00:01:37.283 --> 00:01:39.264
not doing anything while I'm at work.

00:01:39.264 --> 00:01:41.185
- Well there's one other
thing it might mean.

00:01:41.185 --> 00:01:43.380
Dogs also yawn when they're
dealing with anxiety

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.485
or uncertaintly, and this
includes being excited.

00:01:46.485 --> 00:01:47.318
- Yes!

00:01:47.318 --> 00:01:49.423
So it's how he controls his enthusiasm.

00:01:49.423 --> 00:01:51.582
He yawns the same way
I try not to saturate

00:01:51.582 --> 00:01:54.181
everyone I meet with all of my ideas.

00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:56.296
Believe it or not, some people find my

00:01:56.296 --> 00:02:01.067
pleasing personality to
just be a little intense.

00:02:01.067 --> 00:02:02.506
- Sure they do.

00:02:02.506 --> 00:02:05.061
You know, dogs yawn when
they're nervous too.

00:02:05.061 --> 00:02:06.354
Like in a vet's office.

00:02:06.354 --> 00:02:08.870
Do you yawn when you're nervous?

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.703
- What?

00:02:09.703 --> 00:02:11.688
- Dogs can also catch
yawning from the human

00:02:11.688 --> 00:02:13.479
beings around them.

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:17.290
You know how, if you
yawn, then other people

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.094
in the room start yawning?

00:02:19.094 --> 00:02:20.533
Well that often has to do with a person's

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:23.053
capacity for empathy.

00:02:23.053 --> 00:02:26.182
You know that feeling
what someone else feels?

00:02:26.182 --> 00:02:27.756
- No I do not know.

00:02:27.756 --> 00:02:30.061
Feeling other people's feelings?

00:02:30.061 --> 00:02:32.098
That sounds awful.

00:02:32.098 --> 00:02:33.955
- Try reading about it then.

00:02:33.955 --> 00:02:35.968
The study was published in a journal

00:02:35.968 --> 00:02:37.960
called Biology Letters in 2008.

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.986
They said 21 out of 29 dogs yawned

00:02:40.986 --> 00:02:43.383
at least once in response to the yawn

00:02:43.383 --> 00:02:45.856
of an assistant in the room with them.

00:02:45.856 --> 00:02:49.467
- Okay, so human to dog yawn contagion.

00:02:49.467 --> 00:02:51.190
Sounds like the beginning
of a zombie movie

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:53.362
where everybody just yawns at each other.

00:02:53.362 --> 00:02:55.873
What about you out there
watching this video.

00:02:55.873 --> 00:02:57.325
Does your dog yawn?

00:02:57.325 --> 00:02:58.509
Did they catch it from you,

00:02:58.509 --> 00:02:59.927
or are they communicating their emotional

00:02:59.927 --> 00:03:01.366
needs to you?

00:03:01.366 --> 00:03:03.483
