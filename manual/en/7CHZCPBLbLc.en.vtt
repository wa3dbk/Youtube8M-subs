Hi guys, This is ToyScouter

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Today we're going to to take a close look at the Disney Princess 7 Figurine Playset #2

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
You can get this directly at the Disney Store

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Before I open the box, I just want to show you guys the back of the box

00:00:37.354 --> 00:00:42.154
These are the 7 Disney princesses after you have taken them out of the box

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:46.820
As you can see, you get all 7 princesses in one playset

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.320
So if you are a girl, you are going to love this playset

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.300
Before we take a closer look, I just want to show you the height of each one

00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:06.600
Mulan is a little over 3.5, Cinderella is the tallest, she is about 3.75

00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:10.000
Lets take a close look at each one

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
This is Mulan

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:22.000
As you can see, she is holding a fan and wearing her traditional Chinese dress

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Very colorful and detailed

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Next we have Pocahontas

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:56.000

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.840
and you can see her long hair

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.680
She looks like she is very happy and playful

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:36.940

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.200
She's in her yellow ballgown

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.420
Look like she is about to go dancing with her dress

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.640

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.420

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.560
She isn't a mermaid in this figure

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.680
She's in a pink dress

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.520

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.280

So if you're a girl and you are in between the age of 2-8

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.820
Ask your parents to go to the Disney Store, you might find it there

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:58.820
If not, you can always buy online

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:01.220
