Thanksgiving is upon us, and it's a time to
get together with friends and family, and

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.499
also give thanks for the joys in our lives.
For this special Thanksgiving episode, I'm

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:17.040
collaborating with a few of my YouTube friends.
Check out the rest of their video dishes on

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.910
this playlist to see what they've planned
for the ultimate Thanksgiving menu. Here I'll

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:28.950
be making a special Potato Gratin, or the
Gratin Dauphinois by Julia Child. Let's get

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:33.040
started!
You're going to need: 2 1/2 pounds of potatoes.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.320
I recommend Yukon Gold potatoes because they
work best for gratins. Their waxy texture

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.910
holds up much better than the starchy ones
like a Russet potato. 1 Garlic clove, now

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:49.660
Julia's recipe recommends that we rub it on
the dish with the butter but I like to infuse

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.879
it with the cream so that you get more flavor.
4 tablespoons of butter, 2 teaspoons of salt

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:02.890
and pepper, 1 cup of grated gruyere or swiss
cheese, and then 1 cup of boiling milk or

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:07.310
cream. You can use low-fat milk for this as
a substitute, but it's not going to hold up

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.960
as well in this dish.
First preheat your oven to 425ยบ F. Then boil

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:21.470
the milk and one clove of garlic. Smear the
baking dish with 1 tablespoon of the butter

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:27.720
and make sure you get into the creases. Peel
the potatoes and slice them very thinly, about

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:33.960
1/8 inch thick, like this. And use a mandolin
for this because it's the easiest way to get

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:41.430
even slices. Do this right before you plan
on making the dish so that you avoid any browning.

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.900
Now spread the potatoes at the bottom of the
dish and then layer it with the salt, pepper,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:02:00.530
cheese, and butter. Keep layering until you
reach the top. For the top layer I don't like

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:04.281
to put too much cheese because it tends to
burn in the oven.

00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:13.490
And now pour over the hot cream.
Set the baking dish in the top third of your

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:19.520
preheated oven, and then bake it for about
20 to 30 minutes until the potatoes are tender,

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.400
the cream is absorbed, and the top is lightly
golden brown. And let it sit for about 15

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:31.980
to 20 minutes. This will give it time to let
it set, so that you can cut it easily. Now

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.500
cut your gratin into slices and serve.
