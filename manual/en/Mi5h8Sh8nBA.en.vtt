00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.760
I have the best team....

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.720
There is no other team like Baahubali...

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.220
Be it Rana...

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.998
Prabhas...

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:31.780
sweety...

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.440
The entire team, all the actors, technicians...

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.440
Sendhil sir, Cinematographer...

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.860
But my maximum interaction was with Prabhas...

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.640
So i will tell a little bit about him...

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.140
For me Prabhas is like a real hero

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:48.820
Why because....

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:52.360
When ever he was in the shot, sometimes about 30.. 40...

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.360
50 feet of height.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.487
When i used to see him from here

00:00:56.487 --> 00:00:58.827
i was wondering how does he have the courage to stay at that height

00:00:58.827 --> 00:01:00.167
and also maintain the expression...

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.620
Also get the free fall look

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.320
I am sure you would have seen that in the Promo

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.300
i mean you will get to see now

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.260
So i think he is a real hero for me

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.680
because i have really seen him struggle

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.900
Work really, really hard, Physical strain, mental strain...

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.720
For me he is like a....

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:19.900
I've always seen him doing his best

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.740
let it be in pain

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.720
No matter what he will always do the best for the shot

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:27.500
I've learnt a lot from him

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.620
for being there for everybody on the set....

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.140
For me i had to do some sword fighting in this movie

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:34.069
so when i was enacting it

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.700
i had actually gone to Prabhas and asked him

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.540
Can you please help me? as i don't know how to do this...

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.864
As you would know how to do this

00:01:41.395 --> 00:01:42.595
So please help me...

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.720
Literally Prabhas was the one who helped me one night before my shoot

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.100
And that's how i went and shot the next day

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:51.800
Very very special film...

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.380
I am not sure what else to say, there are lot of people that i have to thank

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:58.780
