00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.300
Get back to the childhood, don't waste your
time

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:10.200
in front of the video games :)

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:30.200
first, fold the paper on half

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:50.200
fold the smaller side, on the longer side

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:28.200
now on the oposite side same folding

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:29.200
open it up

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.200
fold both sides to the crossing point

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.200
Open the upper part and fold it down

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.200
it should look like this

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.200
fold right corner to the top

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:17.200
fold the same side again to the middle of the plane

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:23.200
same folding for oposite side

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:35.200
Pinch it in the middle to make a peak

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.200
same procedure for the other side

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:35.200
fold the both peaks to the top

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.200
turn the paper

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:48.200
fold the top to the intersection line

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:49.200
Turn it on the other side

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:53.200
Fold the plane on the half

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:36.200
fold the end of the wings outside

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.200
pinch in the tale of the plane

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.200
Thanks for watching :)
