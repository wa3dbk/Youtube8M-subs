SHORT RADIUS, THE SKIER'S NEMESIS

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.660
"Short Radius The Skier's Nemesis", why this title?

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.140
Because the short radius is actually a nemesis

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.300
for most skiers,

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:37.980
especially the ones who started a few years ago, enjoing long turns carving skiing on easy and smooth ground.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:01:02.760
Especially on crowded slopes and steep slopes,

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:10.260
short radius allows to perfectly control the speed.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.900
A question that is normally asked to us is: 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.280
"How can I control my speed in short turns

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.580
on steep slopes, possibly with a lot of people around?"

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:30.620
Most skiers do 2 or 3 turns, and then maybe draw back, are not able to close the turns anymore, start to "run after" the skis.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:42.200
Now we are going to analyse the short radius technique, trying to give you actionable advises and to spur you

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:49.340
to use your dexterity, because everyone has skills that is not used.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:57.760
Let's now check out several times this great short radius run by Paolo on a pretty steep slope.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.500
First of all, let's notice the sense of rhythm.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.700
If we don't start with a well assessed rhythm in mind,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.880
being purposeful to follow it at any cost,

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.540
a short radius is not feasible.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.060
We can see it at normal speed

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.400
before going back to slow motion.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.720
So the first thing is the sense of rhythm.

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.920
Second point: rhythm is maintained if the whole body moves coordinately.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.100
Muscular contraction and decontraction and,

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.420
between the phase of contraction/closing the turn

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.460
and the phase of decontraction/beginning of the turn,

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:35.880
there is the pole's leaning.

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.680
So there must be a perfect coordination between

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.680
the foot and of the lower limbs muscles

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.020
and the preparation/the leaning of the pole.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.800
A3rd very important element is the indipendence

00:02:53.800 --> 00:03:00.500
between foot and bust direction. The bust must stay firm

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.960
towards the end of the slope, while foot follow

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.720
a very different direction.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:16.280
This authonomy allows the body to be constantly directed towards the valley, while the foot turn,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.420
helping the skis to turn, avoiding the body

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.240
to rotate at any turn following the skis.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.680
The speed of foot looking for direction

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:34.300
and for the wriggle that is necessary to close the turn and to start the new one.

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.080
The foot must be quick in looking for direction

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.280
and must be quick in reversing, changing the edge.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:49.640
To be quick in reversing, not losing time,

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.920
scratching at every turn closure,

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.620
when we are about to enter in the turn closure

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.080
we should only think that we want to "go away".

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:05.960
This wil let us start towards the new turn exactly when we give the right pressure.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:22.100
We examined 5 key elements.

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.560
Now let's observe again this short radius

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.800
focusing at every run on one of those 5 elements,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:39.300
without expecting to master all of them together.

00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:46.080
Trying to ski istinctively, driven by the sense of rhythm,

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.120
we will gradually reach the ability to execute

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.640
very brilliant short radius runs.
