Epson TM-C3400 Product Review

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.750
Hi, my name is Jessie, and this
is the Epson TM-C3400 product review.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.040
The C3400 is a full color printer.

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:17.800
Um,
you can use either continuous labels,

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.740
or individual labels like these.

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.199
Um,
the ink cartridge loads right here.

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.170
It's very easy to load.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.199
Its got all
three colors in it.

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.780
And it's a
drop-and-load printer also.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.410
So you just
take the roll of labels, which could

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.420
be any core size, and just drop it in
like so.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:50.520
OK, so the C3400 allows for
the use of various media types, one

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.309
of them being continuous labels, and
what that allows you to do is be more

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:00.910
flexible with your design in your labels.

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:07.390
Right now on our screen we've got a
barcode label, a full-color image,

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.970
which is our POS Puppy right here.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.660
So
I'mma enlarge it as much as I can, as

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.000
big as I can on this screen.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Like that.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:27.010
And go ahead and print one.

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:39.220
[whirring]
So the label is printed as close to

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.400
the design as possible, so now I'll
adjust it a little bit to make the

00:01:46.400 --> 00:02:01.260
artwork, or the label itself smaller
on the screen.

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.020
So now we're using less space on the
label and less label period or

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.280
receipt paper, whichever it is.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.110
And
then when we print this it actually

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.710
automaticaly trims the extra space
around the design, um, which helps

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:28.250
minimize waste.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:35.769
[whirring]
And there it is.

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.750
And there's the comparision with the
other one.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.670
The TM-C3400 is a medium-to-high volume
printer.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.020
It's available with USB or
ethernet interfaces, it's a fast and

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:48.020
flexible printer.

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.530
You can use multiple
media types like, um, individual labels,

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.950
or a continuous labels, receipt paper,
um, you can even print wrist-bands and

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:57.160
tickets.

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:02.750
