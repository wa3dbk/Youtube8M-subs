00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.430
Now let's examine the determinants of cardiac
output during myocardial energy failure.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:10.760
I think we can already agree on one: Rate.

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.020
Right now the pump is in energy failure because
of low, or in this case, zero, rate.

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.370
If I increase the rate to one beat per minute,
the maximal ventricular volume of 100 CCs

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:26.630
is ejected, and we have a flow of 100 CCs
per minute.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:34.020
At two beats per minute, 200 CCs is ejected,
and so on until the pump is going fast enough

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:38.550
that the ventricles no longer have time to
fill completely at this particular mean vascular

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.780
pressure and inlet impedance.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.460
The pump is then back in energy excess.

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.840
Clinically, we see pump energy failure in
complete heart block at a rate of 20 to 30

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.110
beats a minute.

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:56.280
If we increase the heart rate, there are concomitant
increases in cardiac output until about 70

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.550
beats a minute, at which time the heart is
no longer in power failure.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.030
Then, further increases in pacemaker rate
cause no further increase in cardiac output.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:11.920
So one determinant of cardiac output during
myocardial energy failure is rate.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.439
The other myocardial energy failure state
which, we are about to examine, is when the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.749
strength of contraction is insufficient to
overcome an outlet impedance.

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:26.969
Remember our earlier example, where a strongly
working pump was able to overcome an outlet

00:01:26.969 --> 00:01:29.549
impedance.

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:34.520
But if the strength of contraction were insufficient,
which is a condition I can simulate by manually

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:45.039
contracting the ventricles, there will be
a significant decrease in flow.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.020
The outflow impedance, together with the insufficient
strength of contraction, limits the emptying

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.259
of the ventricles.

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:58.669
Therefore they fill completely before the
end of diastole, thus causing intermittent

00:01:58.669 --> 00:02:00.310
inflow.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.729
This limited inflow reduces pump output.

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:09.570
Clinical corollaries are seen in all myocardial
energy failure states, such as myocarditis,

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:15.930
myocardial infarction, and aortic outflow
obstruction with weak ventricular contractions.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:19.790
With the insight that we have gained from
the model, you should be able to ascertain

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:24.250
that Starling's Law, which states that the
greater the filling at diastole, the greater

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.860
the strength of contraction at systole, expresses
a mechanism of cardiac output control only

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:31.800
during myocardial energy failure.

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:37.330
At all other times, it has only energy conservation
implications.

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:42.330
You should also realize that Poiseuille's
Law, which expresses outlet resistance as

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.700
a determinant of cardiac output, is once again
only valid during myocardial energy failure.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:53.090
At all other times, it merely expresses a
pressure gradient across an outlet resistance

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.000
point.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.230
All available data from human physiologic
experience correlates with the findings we

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.470
have seen in the model.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:06.100
Therefore, I believe we are safe in presuming
that the human heart is a non-sucking, intermittent

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.850
outflow, continuous inflow pump.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.820
We can also presume from the model that cardiac
output has two separate sets of determinants,

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.030
only one of which can be operative at a time.

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:22.230
It is the set that potentially limits the
output most that is the determinant at any

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.230
time.

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.570
The first set is applicable when the heart
is in myocardial energy excess and includes

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:34.230
mean vascular pressure, which includes fluid
volume and system compliance, and inlet impedance,

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.010
which is the product of a resistance point
and a distensible bed upstream from that resistance

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.120
point.

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:44.890
The second set of determinants is applicable
when the heart is in myocardial energy failure,

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:51.350
and includes low rate and/or insufficient
myocardial contraction to overcome outlet

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:53.650
impedance.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:58.180
You have now observed that most phenomena
seen in the cardiovascular system need no

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.849
other explanation than simple hydraulic mechanics.
