Hi, everyone!

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.880
This is Stephanie Manley and you know me from
CopyKat.com.

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.750
Today is another one of our videos in our
series of Home Economics Cooking.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.349
These videos are made for the beginner cook.

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:32.930
Today, I am cooking up fried apples.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.329
Fried apples is a great way to use apples
in the fall or heck, anytime you have apples.

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:40.800
It's really really simple.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.170
You only need a few ingredients.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.170
You need two apples.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.309
You need about a quarter cup of sugar.

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:51.379
You can use white sugar or brown sugar and
we're going to use about a quarter cup of

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.899
butter to cook these apples in and we're going
to need a little bit of salt.

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:59.180
Now, if you want to get fancy, you could add
a little bit of cinnamon or nutmeg, but I'm

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.429
just going to show you the clean version here.

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:03.990
First thing we need to do is wash our apples.

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:10.210
Once we get them washed up we can go ahead
and begin to cut our apples.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.090
You can cut them in a variety of ways.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.720
The first thing that you want to do is kind
of get the core out of there, so we are just

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:24.091
going to cut around the center and discard
the center because that's where the core is.

00:01:24.091 --> 00:01:25.091
It's a little bit tougher.

00:01:25.091 --> 00:01:27.140
We're not going to use those.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:34.229
First, I cut my apples in half and then I'm
just doing three cuts around the core.

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:39.350
Okay, so once we get these all cut up this
way, we're going to go ahead and simply cut

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:52.149
them into small thin bite sized pieces that
are about three-eighths, half an inch thick.

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:56.220
Okay, so now all of our apples are cut up.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.430
We're going to move over to the stove and
we're going to go ahead and begin to fry these

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:01.430
apples up.

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.170
Come join me at the stove.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.820
We have our burner on about medium heat.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:12.070
You want to do the same if you have an electric
stove top.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:15.140
We're going to add in our quarter cup of butter.

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:21.860
I'm going to let that melt for a second and
then we're also going to go ahead and add

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:34.160
in our brown sugar at the same time and we're
just going to stir these together.

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.360
When all of the butter melts we're going to
go ahead and add our apples.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:51.650
Okay, it's time to go ahead and add our apples.

00:02:51.650 --> 00:03:06.870
Okay, now we're going to stir these occasionally
every couple of minutes, and we are going

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:16.750
to cook these apples for about ten minutes
and then we'll be ready to serve our apples.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:21.800
We have just finished our apples, our fried
apples and they smell fantastic right now.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.500
Now, if you would like to jazz these up a
little bit, I recommend sprinkling on a little

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.550
bit of nutmeg or even a little bit of cinnamon,
but you can see these take just about 15 minutes

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:33.430
or so to make.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:36.560
You too can make fantastic fried apples.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:41.090
