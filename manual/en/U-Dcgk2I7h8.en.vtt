&gt;&gt;Carlie Preece: At the Graduate School at

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:13.179
Morehead State University we’re here to
make students transition into graduate programs

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:14.780
as seemless as possible.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.500
we’re with students through their entire
graduate career at Morehead State.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.460
So all the way from the application and admission
process

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.599
to offering academic advising while they’re
in their program and in their classes, all

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:31.380
the way through completion and graduation.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.800
So we’re here through their whole entire
academic career.

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.690
[music]
[7 second pause]

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.809
&gt;&gt;Oriana Reed: Um, when I first came here
they were really helpful; they took me on

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:49.370
a tour, they brought me here, they took me
to Reed Hall, introduced me to the faculty.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.129
It was really a good experience and they were
really willing to help me out.

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:58.239
[music]
[8 second pause]

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:05.070
&gt;&gt;Carlie Preece: We have an open door policy
here, so I think, you know, we have friendly

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.070
faces.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.780
We’re always here to help students.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:13.000
We have a new advising
center, so we can help students from, anything

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.360
from, working on an application to seeing
what classes they need to take the next semester.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.840
&gt;&gt;Oriana Reed: I really see that they um,
take the time to get to know you and try to

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.790
help you in any way that they can.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:31.860
Um, we even sat aside and talked to our Stats
teacher who isn’t a clinical faculty, but

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.880
we can talk to him about anything if we’re
having troubles

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.280
with anything, he’s there to lend an ear
and to help us out.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:40.870
&gt;&gt;Carlie Preece: Morehead is a very friendly,
down-to-earth campus.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:42.190
It’s small.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.290
Everyone knows everyone, so most of the graduate
students know

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:46.820
everyone in this office.

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:51.910
They know their professors, they know their
classmates so having an on-campus experience

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.720
is really special because they get to know
everyone on campus.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:03.350
[music]
[9 second pause]

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:10.500
&gt;&gt;Carlie Preece: The online classes offer
so much flexibility for students because we

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.750
have a variety of students.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.670
We have, um, students who have
just completed their undergraduate degrees

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.750
and are going straight through.

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:22.640
We have non-traditional students with families
and children and full-time

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.540
job obligations, so online classes offer those
students the flexibility they need to complete

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:34.260
a degree and be able to maintain their obligations
at home.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.620
&gt;&gt;male student: A the classes online, it’s
been really flexible for me.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:44.451
Been able to, I also assistant golf coach
so I help out with the golf team, able to

00:02:44.451 --> 00:02:45.780
make it to practice.

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.150
My morning is taken up, and then I got to
golf practice; which is at two and that’s

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.790
‘til six every evening so I couldn’t attend
class—even if it was available until six,

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:58.820
seven o’clock at night.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:04.920
So the online really makes it available for
me to take care of my work afterward and in

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.920
the evening.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.720
&gt;&gt;Carlie Preece: We try to make access to
information very easy and simple, so our website,

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.980
we keep it up to date with information.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.470
Any forms that students may
need, for example: an completion form, it’s

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.040
on there so they have access to every piece
of information they need.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.200
We also have a Facebook account, a
Twitter account.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.610
We are continuously updating students with
information they need.

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:39.670
Whether it be deadlines or events on campus,
we want to keep them as informed as possible.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:45.680

[13 second pause]

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:55.040
&gt;&gt;Carlie Preece: If you’re interested in
being a part of the Morehead State University

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.510
Graduate School, I encourage you to apply.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.010
I think that students are
surprised on how easy the application process

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:03.010
is.

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.430
Everything is online, moreheadstate.edu/apply.

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:07.580
They can contact me.

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:11.620
They can email me, call me, stop
by the office, send me a Facebook message,

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:14.150
a Twitter message, whatever is convenient
for them.

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:16.819
They can contact me at any time and we’ll
get the process started.

00:04:16.819 --> 00:04:17.129
