00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:10.230
No matter what your skin type, everybody needs
to keep their pores clean.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.510
So this next recipe is just perfect for any
skin type no matter what your skin condition

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:18.540
is.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.470
You're going to want to use this to keep your
pores clean.

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:22.240
And it's really simple.

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.510
You're just going to need some strawberries.

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:35.079
I've actually mushed with my fork about half
a cup of strawberries right in this bowl.

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:41.469
You're going to use one tablespoon of milk,
preferably organic milk.

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:46.480
Next we're going to add rice powder to my
milk and strawberry mixture.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:54.320
And this again, is just one tablespoon only.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.190
Then we're just going to mix this up.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.410
It mixes really easily.

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:09.229
And you want to make sure that you've mushed
your strawberries enough so you get a nice

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:10.710
texture with the mask.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.710
You want it to be a bit of a paste which we
have here.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.850
So this is perfect.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:16.850
This smells amazing.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.909
So you're going to want to eat it if you don't
use it as a mask.

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.060
And then you're just going to apply a thin
layer.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:35.710
It's going to be a little bit chunky in consistency
so you might want to lie down a little bit

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.330
while you're having this mask on your skin.

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:44.729
But I think you should take time out for yourself
and take the time to just relax and do something

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.100
nice for yourself.

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.182
The strawberries have a ton of vitamin C in
them.

00:01:49.182 --> 00:01:56.590
And in case you didn't know, strawberries
and vitamin C are a very basic foundation

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:00.729
for having perfect looking skin all the time.

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:08.061
The rice powder is actually going to serve
to absorb any oil or any bacteria that you

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:13.780
have in your pores and it's going to pull
everything out of your pores to really clarify

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.709
your pores and keep them nice and clean.

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:22.540
And the milk, it is soothing, but the main
function of the milk is the lactic acid which

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.540
is going to serve to exfoliate the skin.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.000
So your skin is going to be softer.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.940
It's going to be hydrated.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:35.069
It's going to be glowing from all the vitamin
C. And because of the rice powder, everything

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:39.230
is going to get sucked out of your pores so
you're just going to have really clean, clear,

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:40.959
and glowing skin.

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.340
And this mask is great for any skin type at
any age.
