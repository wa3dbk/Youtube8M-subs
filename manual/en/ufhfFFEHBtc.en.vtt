00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:01.380
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.940
Michael here with The Daily Note II/3.

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:08.090
So if you haven't got the notification yet,
you will get notified one day that there is

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.580
an update to S Note on your Galaxy Note 2.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.200
And of course, you will update this without
a second thought, but if you try to use this

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.519
app, it will quickly reveal that this app
works totally differently than the S Note

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.640
that you're used to.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.670
So in this video, I'll explain what this app
is intended for, and why it is an addition

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.669
to your Note 2, and not a replacement to S
Note.

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:38.160
So 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.260
the New S Note is almost an identical copy
to what's present on the Note 3.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.550
But to clearly understand how the new S Note
is different, you have to look at how S Note

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.560
evolved on the Note 3.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.610
On the Note 3, the functions of S Note that
existed on the Note 2 branched off into 2

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:55.960
separate applications.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.890
Action Memo and S Note.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.320
Action Memo is purely for note taking and
doing something with information written on

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.320
the note.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.500
It is an upgrade to the popup note function,
but it comes with it's own popup note reader

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.500
and editor.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.140
S Note just never comes into the equation.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:19.500
And on the Note 3, S Note is purely for creating
drawings or sketches with sophisticated tools.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.149
Looking back on the older S Note app, which
will still be present and work the same after

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:30.979
you install the New S Note, you will see that
it was made to handle both the functions of

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.549
creating drawings and sketches as well as
being an editor and manager of your popup

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.549
notes.

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:41.200
Since it seems less likely that Action Memo
will arrive on the Note 2, this is how you

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.240
should use both the older and newer S Note
from now on.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:49.289
For popup note editing and managing, you should
still use the older S Note.

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:52.670
For creating sketches you should use the newer
S Note.

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.749
Sure the newer S Note can be used with popup
note, but that's not what the new S Note app

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:02.640
was designed for, and it will only add unnecessary
steps to your note management, and there will

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.920
be some compromises to deal with as well.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:10.670
So now that you understand how the new S Note
works and when you should use it, let's quickly

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.690
install the update, which really isn't an
update at all, is it a new app.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.530
Anyway, let's install it and look at the improvements
on the new S Note as a sketch editor.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:22.910
When you open it for the first time, you will
get this nice intro, and you choose the type

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:27.480
of cover that you like, choose to import any
S Note files from you older S Note.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.890
And here we are.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.450
Let's create a new S Note.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.700
Now the one new feature that people may find
to have a lot of value is the new eraser mode.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:42.170
For example, when you have multiple overlapping
lines, and just want to erase a single stroke,

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:45.750
you can do that and it really is a wonderful
feature.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.590
As for other features, there are some additional
features to add YouTube videos and capture

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.780
videos directly onto the S Note, which are
cool but pretty minor.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.240
If you're curious what's on the Galaxy Note
3's S Note that isn't on the Galaxy Note 2's

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.820
S New Note, there are 3 things.

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:09.930
The graph and charting features, the isolated
editing box, and the ability to to add items

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.520
from scrapbook.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.100
A common question that comes up a lot seems
to be can you still import PDF's?

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.100
Yes.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.840
You can do that by going to Recent notes,
menu, my files, PDF file.

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.320
Another question is can I create an event
in S Planner with an S Note?

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.690
And another question I've seen a few times
is, can you access wolfram alpha through the

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:32.690
new S Note.

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.600
And the answer for both questions are no.
you will have to use the old S Note to do

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.820
that.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:42.290
So that's the thorough rundown on what the
new S Note brings to your Note 2.

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.240
It isn't an update by any means.

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:47.960
It's a new application that replaces some
of the functionality of parts of the older

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.910
S Note which some people may find more valuable
than others.

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:55.600
Once again, we've reached the end of today's
video.
