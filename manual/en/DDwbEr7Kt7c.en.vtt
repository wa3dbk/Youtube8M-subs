00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.950
\f0\fs24 \cf0 Moisturizers were originally
created to treat and relieve dry skin. \

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.890
\
But for many people, their ability to help

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:08.440
fine facial lines \
\

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.760
and wrinkles is much more important. \
\

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:21.930
How do they work this magic? Stay tuned!\
\

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:22.930
\
In a previous episode, \

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:25.279
\
I discussed the obvious and original reason

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:27.099
to use a moisturizer: \
\

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.339
To combat the signs and symptoms of dry skin.
\

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.059
\
These signs and symptoms include a feeling

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.710
of mild tightness \
\

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.660
and the appearance of fine flaking, both of
which are much more common on the cheeks,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:39.660
\
\

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.780
but can occur in other places. \
\

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.590
Since dry skin is caused by insufficient water
in your skin, \

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.239
\
the reason moisturizers work is \

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:49.289
\
because they effectively increase the moisture

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.100
content of your skin. \
\

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.589
Simple enough. Right?\
\

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:58.270
To go deeper, if the moisturizer increases
the moisture content of your skin, \

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:01.339
\
it thereby also slightly increases the volume

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:02.339
of your skin, \
\

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:05.960
which makes it more supple and less taut\'85
and voila! \

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.950
\
Feelings of tightness are relieved. \

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.080
\
Adding moisture also hydrates over dried,

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.280
dead, and flaky surface cells. \
\

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.590
This changes their shape and optical properties,
\

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.630
\
and therefore literally hides them from sight.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:20.630
Cool right?\
\

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.250
Now here\'92s the even cooler part. \
\

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.230
If increasing the moisture content of your
skin can slightly increase its volume\'85

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.230
\
\

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.509
Well\'85 What a perfect way to improve the
appearance of fine lines and wrinkles, \

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:33.939
\
even if only temporarily.\

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:37.579
\
For those of you who receive the weekly DermTV

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:38.579
newsletter, \
\

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.359
do you remember the tip on how to temporarily
help crows feet? \

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.240
\
The answer is by rubbing the area firmly for

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.729
a few minutes with a cream or ointment. \
\

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.690
The pressure from repeated rubbing causes
a little inflammation \

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.710
\
which causes a tiny bit of fluid to leak into

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.250
the skin that literally pushes out\'85 \
\

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.549
or really fills in\'85 the lost volume that
caused the lines. \

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.479
\
Moisturizers work similarly in helping fine

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.049
lines and wrinkles. \
\

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:09.229
Although instead of from the inside out, \
\

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.890
moisturizers work by infusing water from the
outside in. \

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:14.819
\
They do it with humectant ingredients that

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:16.980
literally grab, bind \
\

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.620
and then cause water to absorb into and slightly
swell your skin. \

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.290
\
And as you now know, that safe swelling will

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:25.290
\
\

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.980
temporarily diminish the appearance of lines
and wrinkles.\

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.709
\
Goodbye lines and wrinkles\'85 Not for long,

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:46.480
but at least for now.\
