00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:07.460
Hi, today I'm gonna tell you about
California white sage, we're gonna take a look at it

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:12.320
and just how it burns the different ways you can buy it, so it front of me I've got the

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:15.320
a big smudge stick of California white sage

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.370
A baby smudge stick

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:22.940
A loose cluster and a loose leaf

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.180
Now actually Californian White Sage burns really easily.

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.240
So, I'm just gonna light this, 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.600
if you just let it kind of flame for five

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.880
ten seconds- well you can count this, and just blow it out

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.300
and then you've got nice smoke. So you can use this

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.150
on yourself

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.270
You can use it on other people. I mean you don't need much

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:57.000
This is burning now, I've seen this do three people.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.550
You know just, one of you does it, passes it to the next one.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.049
It's not something that you need a huge amount of.

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.039
I'll just put this one out otherwise we're gonna be smoky today.

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:11.859
Right, the cluster here, now, yeah, you can burn this.

00:01:11.859 --> 00:01:16.670
You know and you can, if you want a bit more

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.679
you can get three going, this is gonna be fun.

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:24.469
And then you're gonna ramp up the old smoke here.

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:29.649
So there you go, I dunno what I'm gonna do with all this now.

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:34.509
So I'll just put it out, the best I can. Anyway I think I'm gonna have to accept we're gonna be smoky.

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:38.719
So the baby smudge stick- Oh my god. Okay the baby white sage

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:42.659
There we go, so if I was to cut the string off here and pull that apart

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:48.100
You're gonna get the little, just push this out the way here.

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:56.630
As you can see it keeps burning pretty well.

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.319
So if the baby one apart we're gonna get little one's like this about half of what you

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:01.459
get out of there

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:05.300
and there again you know it's is quite
compact and that burns quite nicely if I

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.270
In fact I'll, why not, you know, let's burn some more

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.500
And bring the house down, so when you're burning, this is from a baby smudge stick

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.800
Kind of pulled apart, that's nice as well

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:21.540
because you, it's all together

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:28.540
So that's gonna be- D'you think they'll be able to see me?

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.319
This is funny... So actually I'm just gonna- No I'm just- Put that over here.

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.319
Big smudge stick, you can pull that apart as well.

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:38.900
So why would you wanna buy a smudge stick then

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.840
if it's handier burning it in smaller parts, well it is a little bit more economical

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.800
you can actually pull apart here you will get the odd bit ping off like what just happened there

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.180
but on you get a little usable pieces and
I

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.129
I can't remember the last time I used a big one

00:02:58.129 --> 00:03:01.609
You know, you get lots of small pieces there

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.040
Then comparing this to something like Desert Sage, here.

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.290
So Desert Sage doesn't catch quite as well.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.409
I'll just burn this at the end here.

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:18.060
I hope you can still see me, but if I'm trying to burn desert sage

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:21.439
it does burn but it kind of, takes a little bit longer

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:26.280
Yeah that's burning there.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:30.019
But it burns in a different way. And then we also have blue sage.

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.620
Here. Which is the same family.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.680
Cor I can really smell it actually, it's lovely. This is something we've just recently started doing, Blue Sage.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:45.180
From Colorado.

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.359
And then sometimes, with these ones with the narrow leaves, you need to just pull them apart a little bit.

00:03:49.359 --> 00:03:51.310
To just give it a bit more air.

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.590
So that's just to compare the Californian White Sage to other kinds of sage.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.090
I hope you can still see me.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.450
Yeah lots of uses for this.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.680
So yeah you can smudge yourself, you can smudge other people, it can be preparation for something

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.840
So say

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.799
You're gonna do journey-ing, or healing yourself, healing others

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:14.349
Maybe you've just had a stressful day at work.

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.880
You've been around a situation that's just left you a bit- urrghh

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.340
Frazzle-dy, just a little bit of sage, a little bit of smudging.

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:25.170
You can use a feather, you can just hold it like this.

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:28.940
And I hope that gives you a bit more indication of

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:32.550
the whole White Sage thing, so, thanks a lot, cheers. Bye!
