00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.769
I'm Andy Sjostrom and my company is the
Good Handyman and I'm here to take care

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.060
of some projects around the house get
this house ready for sale.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:23.660
This separates a good handyman from about a me how much your handyman cares about your stuff

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:29.220
That's a pretty darn good indicator
as to how good of a job they'll do.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.620
Somebody just comes into your house and
just starts whacking away at stuff,

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:38.239
chances are you're not going to be
looking out for attention to detail as well.

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:43.200
If you've got really complex or bulky
light fixtures you can actually take

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.739
those down as well. Again, it's that prep
time ahead of time that makes your life easier.

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:51.239
A good thing to do before you
start taping off is to take a nice clean

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.870
rag wet it down and wipe off all the
surfaces that are going to get taped off.

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.609
Because a dirty dusty surface is not
going to hold that tape very well.

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:08.040
And you'd be surprised how much dust and
dirt lies up on these flat surfaces like this.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:13.939
So really just need to kind of go
around make sure that they are wiped clean.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.840
You don't need any soap.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.560
Painting is a dirty task it's messy and there's no

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.119
reason you can't spare yourself some of
that mess. I like to use latex or the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.610
nitrile gloves, the ones you get at a
hardware store are fine. But having these

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:36.450
on by the end of the job your hands
going to be full of paint.

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.619
And keep yourself clean throughout the entire
process. Because once you got paint all

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.310
over you, you're going to get it all over
something else. And then you're going to

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.370
spend time cleaning up and you don't
want to do that

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:52.060
Keep your job and your life simple. If
the paint is coming from a hardware store

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:56.530
or from a big-box store you want to make
sure that they shake it for you before

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.000
you leave. They'll just put it in the
shaking mechanism and they'll give it a

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.869
good shake. If not, just make sure and
give it a good shake and then you can

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:08.979
use the stick that comes with it. You
want to make sure that it's well stirred

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.330
or well shaken because if the
tint isn't mixed well you're going to

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:17.650
get blurry colors all over the ceiling
and all over the walls. You want to have

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.280
a nice consistent material. I'm using a
special tool for opening this can of

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.780
paint, it's called my set of keys.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:34.569
So in this case the customer has chosen
a nice soft chocolate milk color that's

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.640
going to work really well in here. They
got a good choice in sheen too - which is

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.280
the eggshell color and that's going to
stand up well to the abuse of bathrooms.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:49.510
You can wipe it down, you can rub it down
with a rag, you can hit it with mild

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.400
solvents and it doesn't take any damage.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.100
I like to use the reusable pans because for recycling purposes these things work great.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:08.320
And you're not using up lots of plastic trays when these guys just

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:11.740
clean up just as well as as the other ones do.
