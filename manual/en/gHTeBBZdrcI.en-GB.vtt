00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.000
(uplifting music)

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.839
- Play is absolutely essential for children.

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.509
- It's how children learn about colours,
textures, the world around them.

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.000
- It makes them happy, it makes them involved, it makes them feel loved.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.230
- It can be fairly challenging

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.680
for disabled and non-disabled children
to play together.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.410
Your child needs the extra support.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.570
- There are a lot of things that
disabled and non-disabled children can

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.250
play with together without really any,

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:31.910
or with very little adaptation needed.
- Everyone thinks it's dead complicated

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:32.590
but it isn't.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:35.590
Scope has a set of online guidelines

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.640
for inclusive play that is accessible and free for all.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.199
- You can use different size brushes,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.480
you can get sponges with handles.

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.019
Other children could just be

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.690
finger painting or making hand prints.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.100
For a lot of the things that you find around the house

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.070
I would say there's little adaptation needed for them to be able to play together.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.110
So if they're playing with pots and pans, then it doesn't matter whether you're disabled or not.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.740
I know my kids, we got a new washing machine just before Christmas and all they've played with

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.229
since Christmas, is the box.

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.780
Weâ€™re making musical shakers. There's lots of different ways you can adapt it according to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:14.840
the abilities of the children that you're playing with.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.790
- They chose pasta because it's easier for the children to manipulate and hold.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.380
The split peas are ideal for children
who need

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.400
a little bit more challenging.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.000
'Right everybody, would you like to make some puppets?' ALL: Yay!

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.900
- Watching kids play is one of the most wonderful things I've ever come across.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.500
- Just the best feeling in the world now when we see him playing with other children.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.810
- The baby giggles that you get really do melt your heart.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.910
- Even the smallest little step

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.140
is just great. I love it.
