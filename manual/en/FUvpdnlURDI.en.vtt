00:00:27.554 --> 00:00:29.794
Lets begin.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:37.580
Tuchina: Testing of bionic lower extremety prosthetics equipped with inertia sensors and intellectual systems  was completed in Italy.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.920
Cyberlegs device combines a prosthesis and an orthesis. 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:49.360
While prosthesis replaces a lost limb, the orthesis part allows some energy conservation during walking and makes locomotion more natural.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.520
Special technologies control impulses and minimize impact on contact with the floor.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.920
Intellectual system of the bionic prosthesis is capable of detecting whether the person intends tо walk

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.700
or stand up or sit down, and provides support with every consequtive movement.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:13.480
For the patients requiring more support, an addditional pelvic exoskeleton was designed that helps perform various activities.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:18.520
R&amp;D began in 2012 and at this point cost 2.5 million Euros.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.300
End-user price is still to be determined, but the researchers are convinced it will be adequate.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:35.000
Maria Tuchina:  Carbon3D – a Silicon Valley startup demonstrated new method of 3D printing that is 25 to 100 times faster than currently used methods.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.800
Scientists manipulate oxygen and light in order to moldobjects out of liquid media. 

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:48.560
For the first time a process of tunable (adjustable) photochemistry is utilized instead of layer-by layer printing.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.320
Liquid resin serves as the liquid medium.  

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.660
Combination of light beams and directed oxugen flow causes the resin to solidify assuming necessary shapes,

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:01.800
which makes commercially viable objects. 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:04.840
Resulting objects can be as small as 20 microns.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.580
CLIP method allows utilization of wide spectrum of materials for manufacturing 3D parts with new properties 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.560
(amongst them are elastomeres, silicon, nylon, ceramics and biodergadable materials). 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.300
Above that, this technology allows manufacturing of parts with unique geometry,

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:26.580
which in the future will enable production of individually customized dental implants or coronary stents.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:32.740
Maria Tuchina: Modern computer in all their splendor still are inferior to human brain in therms of computational power. 

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:40.440
 Scientists came up with an optic fiber that will increase speed and efficiency of computers.

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:46.340
Scientists from Singapore Center for Breakthrough Photonic Technologies in cooperation with British Research Center for Optoelectronics, 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:53.420
created an an amorphous glass  optic fiber made out of gallium sulfide and Lantanum oxide. 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.220
Emulation of function of chemical synaps is achieved by irradiating the fiber with alternating wave length light. 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:02.480
That is called a photonic synaps.

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.620
As a result, the researchers were able to reproducemechanism of propagation of signal in neurons,

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.360
and proved that optic neuron analogs can function similar to neurons of the human brain.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:22.020
Maria Tuchina: Researchers from Oregon State University (USA) have uilt Atrias robot that is said to be the fastest bipedal robot in the World.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:30.060
American engineers funded by DARPA abd supported by Human Frontier Science Program (HFSP) taught Atrias how to walk and run, imitating movements of large birds,

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.280
 which are probably the fastest bipedal creatures. 

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.640
Robot’s legs are made out of light and strong carbon fiber

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.960
and are attached to the springs made out of elastic fiberglass by means of four-lever mechanism, 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:45.260
enable efficient accumulatoin of mechanic energy and absorption of shock on impacts during jumping.

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:52.060
Atrias demonstrated perfect stability, qhile rebalancing after kicks and pushes of various force.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:58.280
Creators suggest the robot should be used to access otherwise unaccessible areas in the aftermath of natural disasters 

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:02.660
and the technologies used to build the robot be utilised in development of prosthetics.

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:08.520
Maria Tuchina: Where exactly in your brain is your “Self” located? How does the brain produce consciousness?

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:13.640
 American scientists attempted to answer those questions in the new research.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.780
Using Graph Theory – an area of mathematics that deals with interactive connections between members of complex networks,

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.640
like social networks or flight maps, researchers from Vanderbilt University found out 

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:31.800
 that consciousness  is most likely arises as an emergent property during processing of information, propagating across the brain. 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.100
So that no one particular area of the brain is not a home for the soul.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:41.860
Maria Tuchina: Chemists from the University of Illinois, lead by Martin Burke, created a machine that assembles complex small molecules. 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.100
It is just like 3d-printing, but on a molecular level.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:52.700
Professor Martin Burke, a leader of the team of researchers, spent years synthesizing important molecular building blocks.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.840
Over time he collected a qhole library of molecules of boron containing organic acids. 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:05.600
Combiing these elements in the right order enables manufacturing complex molecules of various configurations.

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:11.920
Comuter-controlled system of syringes and pumps manipulates the solution containing the building block – molecules. 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:15.540
These molecules can be sawn together into more complex configurations.

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:22.740
Researchers found a way to completely automate the process of the resulting compounds from all unnecessary byproducts and admixtures.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:28.800
The scientists hope that soon such machines could be used for synthesis of individualized medications.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.800
Maria Tuchina: On this optimistic note, we conclude our review of the news from the past 7 days.
