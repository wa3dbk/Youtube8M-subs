00:00:07.148 --> 00:00:08.611
This is a can of peas.

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:11.795
This can contains 200gr of peas.

00:00:12.527 --> 00:00:13.247
Every year

00:00:13.571 --> 00:00:14.817
tons of perfectly good food

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.138
are wasted and lost at later stages in the supply chain

00:00:18.516 --> 00:00:20.372
and due to lack of coordination 

00:00:20.649 --> 00:00:22.446
between producers and distributers.

00:00:23.136 --> 00:00:26.783
This amounts to 40 million tons only in the US

00:00:27.101 --> 00:00:29.042
and nearly 40 billion globally.

00:00:30.352 --> 00:00:31.601
That's a lot of peas.

00:00:33.895 --> 00:00:37.810
5.48 million people die of hunger each year.

00:00:38.499 --> 00:00:40.683
So it's not that there's not enough food

00:00:41.122 --> 00:00:43.169
it's that it's poorly distributed.

00:00:43.583 --> 00:00:45.297
That's why we need food banks

00:00:45.547 --> 00:00:46.662
and food banking networks

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.783
to take this surplus from manufactures and farmers

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:51.619
as well as private donations

00:00:52.053 --> 00:00:54.256
and redistribute it throughout the world

00:00:54.757 --> 00:00:57.095
to the places and people who need it the most. 

00:00:58.439 --> 00:00:59.547
Food loss and waste

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:01.932
also amount to a mayor squandering

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:03.899
of resources including

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.862
water, land, energy, labor and capital.

00:01:08.315 --> 00:01:11.165
And needlessly produce green house gas emitions

00:01:11.384 --> 00:01:13.321
contributing to global warming

00:01:13.565 --> 00:01:15.005
and climate change.

00:01:28.176 --> 00:01:28.790
Every year

00:01:29.134 --> 00:01:30.220
consumers in rich countries

00:01:30.523 --> 00:01:31.786
waste as much food

00:01:32.091 --> 00:01:34.108
as the entire net food production

00:01:34.374 --> 00:01:35.946
for sub-Saharan Africa.

00:01:40.286 --> 00:01:41.875
A can of peas can't change the world

00:01:42.388 --> 00:01:43.328
but you can.

00:01:43.841 --> 00:01:45.195

00:01:50.035 --> 00:01:51.611
or go to your local food bank.
