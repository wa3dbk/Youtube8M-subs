00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:10.519
It’s funny, because that’s what he told
me at the same time when we were having lunch

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:13.469
with David Lee Roth.

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.770
The Band Program is designed for the amateur
musician.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:18.082
Professionals are out there already doing
their own thing.

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:22.039
This is a place where you might have the skills
of a professional but you’ve got nowhere

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:23.039
to apply it.

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.340
Here we’ve got all the facilities where
you can apply those skills that you have and

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.099
be doing regular gigs and rehearsals.

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:32.770
Age doesn’t matter at all.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:37.280
We try and keep the ages fairly similar with
the under eighteen group, but once you do

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:42.989
reach eighteen years old, I don’t have a
problem putting eighteen year olds with forty

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:49.100
year olds who are of a similar ability and
like the same style of music.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.840
All of the band coaches that we have here
are all professional working musicians.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.410
We don’t run a Band Program here of Friday
and Saturday nights because we expect all

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.070
our coaches to be out there playing.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:02.120
The real exciting thing is we’re going to
have two programs to choose from.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:07.280
There is the rehearse to perform on the sensational
stage, or there’s also the rehearse to record

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:13.400
in our brand new recording studio downstairs,
which is just fantastic.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.650
Every single Sunday we have what we refer
to as a Big Gig where all of our amateur bands

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.830
that we train here get to come up and play
in front of all their family and friends.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:28.110
A lot of people talk to me about achieving
things that they never believe they would

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.079
achieve in their lifetimes.

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:36.170
Whether that’s a 35 year old housewife or
whether it be a 75 year old grandfather.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.360
I used to be a boring accountant, now I’m
a lead guitarist in a rock band.

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:44.450
And it beats playing air guitar in the lounge
room.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.540
One of the very first clients we had here
was basically told by his doctor that he might

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.580
only have six months to live about two and
a-half years ago, and he’s really credited

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.579
us with keeping his spirit alive.

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:59.140
So as opposed to Rock Lives, Rock makes you
live too.
