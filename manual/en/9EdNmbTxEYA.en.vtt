My 
name is Kathryn Robinson

00:00:23.049 --> 00:00:25.049
I'm from Phoenix, Arizona in the United States and I've been at 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:28.769
AISA for three years.

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.280
I've always wanted to be a teacher, my mom
was a teacher so I grew up in the classroom

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.790
since I was, could walk and I just always
had a love for learning and wanted to continue.

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:46.790
I believe the best thing about working here
is the freedom to really teach creatively

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:55.050
and teach with enthusiasm and to be able to
teach the different learning style.

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.710
Teachers get a lot of support in planning
their lessons, we have weekly meetings, where

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:06.710
we come together as a team and also with an
administrator that's in, running that program

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.240
and we collaborate and plan together what
we're going to do for those units of studies

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.360
so you're never by yourself doing everything,
you're always working together as a team.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.880
The administration is very supportive, they
offer different suggestions of how you can

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.770
incorporate different things you've learned
in professional development into your own

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.660
classroom, but they are very supportive of
different ideas they want teachers to talk

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:37.220
to each other and learn from each other and
they provide opportunities to do so.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:41.520
The American International School has offered
me the most opportunities for professional

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.520
development of any schools that I've worked
at, we've had at least one a year if not probably

00:01:52.209 --> 00:01:59.209
three or four more likely. Every year anywhere
from writing, to classroom management, to

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:06.280
math programs and just overall teacher education,
so I feel that I've gotten a lot of professional

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.520
development while I've been here.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.520
I love traveling and this was a great location,
I lived in China three years before here and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.250
this was a great location to branch off of
to see different places around the world,

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.610
experience and new culture that I didn't know
much about before I got here and it's a very

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:34.610
welcoming and inviting culture which is why
I've stayed so long.
