00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:08.569
Welcome to Hygiena's instructional video on
MicroSnap Coliform for milk samples.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.230
MicroSnap Coliform has AOAC approval for the
detection of Coliform in milk to a spec of

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:21.380
less than 10 CFU per ml but some dairies may
wish to operate a tighter specification of

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:27.500
1 CFU per ml or less. To achieve this tighter
specification, a larger volume of enrichment

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:32.140
broth is required to directly test 1ml of
milk.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.480
In this video, we will cover: product details,
storage and shelf life, the materials you

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:44.480
will need, and how to properly enrich the
sample, and detect coliform.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.699
MicroSnap Coliform is a rapid test for the
detection and enumeration of Coliform bacteria

00:00:50.699 --> 00:00:56.350
in milk products. Together, MicroSnap Coliform
and the EnSURE luminometer measure the coliform

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:03.350
bacteria present in a sample.
Test results are delivered in 15 seconds and

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.860
are measured in Relative Light Units or RLUS;
so the greater the amount of bacteria, means

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.420
the higher the RLU number, and the higher
the CFU count.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.110
Here are some important features about the
product:

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.990
The Enhanced Nutrient Broth is a non-selective
protein solution that enables low level enumeration

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:27.020
of milk samples in 8 hours.
The Detection device works just like chromogenic

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.200
media but instead of changing color, we illuminate
the bacteria useing a bioluminogenic test

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.180
reaction that generates light when enzymes
that are characteristic of Coliform react

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.790
with specialized substrates. Results are available
in 8 hours and can detect down to single figure

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.090
organisms, enabling MicroSnap to give same-shift
results.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.579
The luminometer uses a small yet robust internal
sensor that objectively measures contamination

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:57.380
so that you don't have to count colonies.
This graph compares the time to results of

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.939
low level Coliform detection methods. On average,
MicroSnap produces results twice as fast as

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.039
other available methods. By speeding up time
to results, you can reduce potential risk

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.040
by reacting to contamination and taking immediate
corrective action for future production runs,

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.680
ensuring your customer always gets the best
quality product.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.620
MicroSnap products have a 12 months shelf
life and should be kept in cold storage.

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:31.620
The materials you will need include: a 1ml
milk sample, a pipette and tips for 1 and

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:39.260
.1ml , 1 Enhanced Nutrient Broth vial, an
incubator capable of 37 C, a MicroSnap Coliform

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:48.190
detection device, the EnSURE luminometer,
a vortex mixer and a timer of your choice.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:55.460
Let's get started. MicroSnap is a 2 step test.
The first step is the enrichment step.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:00.870
Allow the enhanced nutrient broth and milk
sample to acclimate to room temperature.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.420
Write the product ID on the Enhanced nutrient
broth label for easy identification

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:11.720
Remove the cap. And then pipette in 1 ml of
milk sample directly into the Enhanced Nutrient

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:18.720
Broth tube.
Replace the cap. And shake by hand or vortex

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:28.530
for 10 seconds
Incubate the enrichment device at 37 C for

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:36.460
8 hours.
8 hrs

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:41.840
The second step is detection.
Allow the Coliform Detection device to acclimate

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.150
to room temperature before testing begins.
Write the location or product ID on the tube

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.900
label for easy identification
Holding the tube upright, forcefully flick

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.200
the detection device in a downward motion.
This will bring droplets of chemistry to the

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:01.210
bottom of the tube.
Open the Detection Device by twisting and

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:08.210
pulling to remove the bulb. Place the device
in a rack, with the bulb loose.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.840
Remove the ENB vial from the incubator and
mix by hand-shaking or vortexing for 10 seconds

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:21.840
to disperse sample.
Unscrew the Enhanced Nutrient Broth cap.

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:30.700
With one hand, grab the Detection Device.
With your other hand, Use a pipette, to aseptically

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:37.700
transfer 0.1ml of enriched sample directly
into the Detection Device tube.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:43.480
Replace the bulb on the Coliform detection
device

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:47.750
The easiest way to activate MicroSnap is to
hold the device in your first and use the

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:52.180
thumb and forefinger to break the Snap-Valve
by bending the bulb forward and backward.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:56.940
Next, Squeeze the bulb 3 times to release
all liquid to bottom of tube.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:02.300
Then shake for 5 seconds
Incubate MicroSnap Coliform for 10 minutes

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:09.300
at 37 ± 0.5 °C.
Meanwhile, turn on the EnSURE luminometer.

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:17.150
If you've programmed locations, navigate to
the appropriate location for this test.

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.020
After 10 minutes of incubation, immediately
insert the Microsnap detection device into

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:29.020
the read chamber, close the lid, and press
"OK" to initiate measurement.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:36.170
Results will be displayed in 15 seconds.
In this example, a result of 6 RLUs is a pass

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.630
and indicates less than 1 CFU of Coliforms
are present. Whereas in this example, a result

00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:55.630
of 590 RLUs is a fail, and indicates less
than 50 CFU of Coliforms are present.

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.270
For further interpretation of results, refer
to the table in the MicroSnap Enhanced Nutrient

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:06.080
Broth Kit insert for Coliform detection in
Milk samples, available on www.hygiena.com

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.710
To ensure you get the most out of your monitoring
system, and to be able to run charts and graphs

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.220
with your test results and quickly set pass/fail
limits, use SureTrend software and sync to

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:20.000
your meter. Learn more at hygiena.com
To properly dispose of MicroSnap devices,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:26.240
disinfect by autoclaving or soak in 20% bleach
for 1 hour. MicroSnap may then be safely discarded

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:29.970
in the trash.
Another product milk processors may be interested

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:35.520
in is MicroSnap Total, a 7 hour test for total
viable count results for milk samples. Learn
