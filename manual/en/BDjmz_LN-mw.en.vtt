00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:04.859
You ever wonder how clergy decide what to put on before they lead worship?

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.629
Do they have a stylist in back that tells when they should wear?

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:10.269
Black and flowing or

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:12.159
white and tunic'y.

00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:15.209
Let's see if we can answer these
questions as we discuss

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:16.820
[deep voice] the robe and

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.020
the alb.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.900
On this episode of

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.920
Chuck Knows Church.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.770
Alright, let me break it down for ya.

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.620
Let's start with the alb.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.190
What's an alb you ask?

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.960
Allow me to explain.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.090
The alb is a simple long linen tunic

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.980
popularized in Roman times. An everyday
ample white garmet

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.820
flowing down down to the ankles

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.039
usually tied around the waist with a rope-like chord or

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:01.400
cincture.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.390
Which today can be worn by both clergy
and laity

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.750
when leading worship.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.860
The pulpit gown

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.660
or robe, on the other hand

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.470
is traditionally black.

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.740
Although commercially available now in a
variety of other colors.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.260
And traced back to the academic
gowns worn in medieval universities.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.770
Now is in the early twentieth century
that the pulpit gown became popular

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.679
when clergy starting to get in touch with
their inner protestant reformation

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.680
heritage.

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.520
And then a spike in the alb fashion came late the
twentieth century when Christian clergy

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:43.069
reconnected with the birth of the church.
A sort of rediscovery of ecumenical

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.780
worship.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.040
That's right, I know the word ecumenical.

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:50.640
Now, the stole

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:56.110
Is worn over the pulpit robe. When..

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.619
Quite frankly we don't have enough time for that

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:59.900
today because we've got a bit too caught
up in the

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.520
alb and the pulpit gown thingy.
You know what we'll get to that in

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.570
another episode.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.040
But if you'd like to learn more about the robe and/or alb,

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:12.160
be sure to ask your pastor.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.380
Tell them Chuck set ya.
