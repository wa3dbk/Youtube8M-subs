00:00:00.339 --> 00:00:04.691
"Whose Line"!
Who will play?

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.231
Please, Gustavo and Anderson
will play "Whose Line".

00:00:11.621 --> 00:00:17.696
How does it work?
You wrote some sentences before the show.

00:00:17.696 --> 00:00:22.069
I'll ask the players to pick up
two sentences each...

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:25.280
And to put them in their pockets.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.001
And then what?

00:00:27.001 --> 00:00:31.531
They will improvise a scene, and at
some point they will use the sentences,

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:35.533
and it has make sense in the scene.
Okay?

00:00:35.894 --> 00:00:40.383
This is "Whose Line"
I'll ask you for a theme...

00:00:40.383 --> 00:00:45.513
Actually, no. I'll get it from
the sentences you wrote.

00:00:45.513 --> 00:00:50.376
Which is...
'Die, goddammit'.

00:00:53.576 --> 00:00:56.067
'Muere diablo'!

00:00:57.106 --> 00:00:58.267
Okay?

00:00:58.267 --> 00:01:04.639
So it's "Whose Line", the theme is
'die, goddammit', starting now.

00:01:11.624 --> 00:01:13.435
Welcome!

00:01:14.775 --> 00:01:17.216
Welcome, you may sit down...

00:01:21.419 --> 00:01:23.609
Grab my hand...

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:26.202
Who would you like to call?

00:01:26.202 --> 00:01:32.492
My... My uncle.
He... He died in an accident...

00:01:32.732 --> 00:01:34.113
What's your name?

00:01:34.113 --> 00:01:36.338
- My name is Carlos...
- Welcome, Carlos.

00:01:36.338 --> 00:01:40.600
But when... If he comes,
you have to tell him to...

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.139
Don't scratch my fingers.

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.622
- Sure... - That's because he was violent
and he kept scratching my fingers...

00:01:48.622 --> 00:01:52.626
Violent? It's dangerous
to summon a violent person.

00:01:52.626 --> 00:01:56.896
- But I need him to answer me something.
- Let's try. Tell me what.

00:01:57.496 --> 00:01:58.587
Tell...

00:01:58.588 --> 00:01:59.988
What?

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:17.319
- Uncle?
- My nephew...

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:24.001
- Uncle...
- Listen... They are flying animals!

00:02:24.451 --> 00:02:28.891
- They are flying animals!
- They are flying animals!

00:02:30.891 --> 00:02:33.062
No! Come back, uncle!
Come back!

00:02:33.062 --> 00:02:36.332
Easy! I'm on my break...

00:02:38.241 --> 00:02:40.711
- They are flying animals!
- Is that what he said?

00:02:40.711 --> 00:02:45.054
- That's dangerous!
- No, that's what I needed to know...

00:02:45.054 --> 00:02:51.396
What animals he raised,
because no one knew what was his job!

00:02:51.396 --> 00:02:56.486
And... It all makes sense,
I'll explain it in a minute!

00:02:57.787 --> 00:03:01.738
We didn't know what was his work,
and these flying animals...

00:03:01.738 --> 00:03:06.850
And he worked in a vineyard!
In an aviary!

00:03:21.028 --> 00:03:23.170
- What was that...
- I can't believe...

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.151
I wanna see how it ends!

00:03:28.622 --> 00:03:32.422
- What was your uncle's name?
- I don't remember!

00:03:32.662 --> 00:03:38.348
- I don't remember...
- He... He planted animals!

00:03:39.328 --> 00:03:43.419
- I don't remember...
- In a vineyard!

00:03:44.292 --> 00:03:47.802
The animals were buried!

00:03:48.372 --> 00:03:49.783
- Problem!
- What?

00:03:49.843 --> 00:03:55.286
- You said it wrong!
- Yes! That's what's happened!

00:03:55.286 --> 00:03:58.826
- It was wrong!
- Die, goddammit!

00:03:59.826 --> 00:04:04.728
Leave me the fuck alone!

00:04:09.578 --> 00:04:12.090
Daniel stayed there!

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.889
No way! There are some
things we just can't ignore!

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:20.061
Raise animals in a vineyard?
That's too much...

00:04:20.061 --> 00:04:22.311
- But that's in Colombia.
- I'll explain it to you.

00:04:22.311 --> 00:04:26.142
You can't raise a flying animal.
'Cause it flies.

00:04:26.142 --> 00:04:29.935
So you plant it.
You bury its legs...

00:04:29.935 --> 00:04:33.905
And you leave it there.
It tries to fly but it can't!

00:04:33.961 --> 00:04:38.540
Right.
Outstanding!

00:04:39.541 --> 00:04:42.841
