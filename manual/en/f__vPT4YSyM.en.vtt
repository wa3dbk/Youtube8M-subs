Are you a non-vegan with questions about veganism?
Are you a vegan and unsure of how to answer

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.049
the things people ask you? Do you want vegan
answers but refuse to read books that don’t

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:15.030
have pretty pictures? Are you kind of a cheap
ass? Then do I have the book for you!

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.840
Hi it’s Emily from Bite Size Vegan and welcome
to another vegan nugget! I just wanted to

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:26.449
take a second to tell you some exciting news-
my free eBook is finally out! It’s called

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:33.449
Vegan Answers to Common Questions and Objections.
(I can’t actually see it there, y’know…I’m

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:38.890
just making pretend for you). Anyways, I wrote
this book as a simple guide to a lot of the

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.800
questions and concerns people have about veganism.
I address questions like why be vegan and

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.720
not vegetarian, where do vegans get protein,
calcium, iron, B12? Isn’t going vegan hard?

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.460
Isn’t it expensive? And more! Plus it’s
got pretty colors and pictures! It’s so

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.360
much fun you won’t even know you’re learning!
