00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:11.529
you

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:20.410
fellow I want to cap and we're in the
studio today

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.130
to work on some projects together what
we'll be doing in our

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.250
in our assignment today is a watercolor
demonstration

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.020
along the lines of the paintings that I
have with me the two

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:35.870
on the back these are watercolors and
the one on this side is an acrylic

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:40.890
so we're going to be working on
controlling the out of control

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.050
these are situations that I often see in
my workshops where people struggle away

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.699
with the things that are going on in
particular were going to be working wet

00:00:49.699 --> 00:00:50.460
into wet

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:57.460
and building multiple layers on

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.270
so if I was painting in the positive

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:05.120
the way that most of us usually work I
would be filling in my shape with color

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.320
but instead of doing that because I'm
working in the negative

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.790
I'm painting the space around it so I'm
just gonna glide that color over and I'm

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.340
committing to memory this stroke that
I'm making

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:22.040
and I'm gonna pull the color out wash it
away

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.770
it's a really good idea to practice this
before you get into a painting

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.310
specially when you're working what into
what so they

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.670
your hand is trained to the shapes that
you're making

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.670
again I'm washing not color away what's
try once more without drawing at and

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.910
but that's the basic concept of what
we're after

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.220
so the stroke load up this brush

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.899
12 to will fill out a little bit more

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.050
so there's my basic shape now in my

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.509
sample in my photograph they have not
just cut into them

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:07.240
so I'm going to do that with my brush

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:14.240
I'm going to cut those in now so I'm
carving away at that shape

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:21.640
on

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.440
when you're working with watercolors you
don't have to just put it on

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.110
with thin layers drying in between

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.120
painters such fabulous stuff

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:38.260
0 it just spreads and it flows and move
so why not let it do its thing

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:42.440
I'm knocking a little bit about to
turquoise in there

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.030
just because I can still a little more

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.030
if you like it in one spot could it in
another spot

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.070
if you put it down on you don't like it
somewhere put it in another spot anyways

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.840
because

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.280
if at this point if I got panicky

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.240
and I grabbed a piece a tissue when I
start padding out the surface

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.940
I'm going it I'm gonna disturb things
and I'm not going to be happy with the

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.750
marks that are left on the paper

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.130
I want this to be really wet look at
those nice stark's in here

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.860
I'm thinking about overall movement the
structure

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.180
I love the plant the stems

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:29.060
work of you know some wash my brush 0
yet wants is put some that

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.590
rosy color in here first nice color

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.690
even though we've got some pretty bright
lights on here in the studio

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.540
you can see how long I have to work in
this wet

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:48.560
no way at approach building up these
layers because first of all I wet my

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.630
paper so completely to begin with

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:54.790
and put it on this non-core surface so
it's really just doing its own juice

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.330
are and I'm using all those thick paint

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.959
I've got my little rigor brash and I'm
wedding it down

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.600
went a got some more water and I'm going
to just

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:13.709
tickle it just like I am on my arm just
take a look across the surface

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:17.979
above the paper just because they said
its it's so vulnerable

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:23.200
just a wee brushing with this little bit
of moisture on this long brush

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.650
and I should get some nice little light
lines happening

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.289
because what I'm doing as I'm forcing
some backruns let's hope it works

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:33.650
you know whenever you want to it doesn't
but oh yeah there comes

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.010
we go put some lines down in there

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:44.010
just at break that up a bit

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:49.280
I'm going to turn my painting as I go so
that I can get into the shapes that I

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.490
want I'm comfortable

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.780
handling the brush this way you'll see I
keep my finger

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.719
on my paper where I need a reminder up
here's where I'm going to go

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:03.860
so I have a leaf here here's a little

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:07.830
here's a little less space between the
leaf the colors that I use

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.729
are guided by what color is already in
the under painting

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:18.729
it's entirely up to you

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:22.759
how many layers you like to build in
your painting

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:26.520
some people want to

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:29.860
leave it loose and diffused

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.379
so you may choose to only do

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:38.310
one or two layers and somebody else
might like to be a little bit more

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:42.169
specific about the shapes that you're
making and tell more

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:45.189
provide more information so

00:05:45.189 --> 00:05:49.490
that person may choose to build a lotta
layers and we looked at

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:53.360
building multiple layers and and that's
exactly what you would do you just

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:54.449
continue to do this

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:57.550
skip stand back from time to time

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:02.719
assess what's happening yes I am getting
a bit over background here so

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:08.379
dry of my brush she tease this said

00:06:08.379 --> 00:06:12.539
goodbye to the background

00:06:12.539 --> 00:06:18.490
let's hope

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:22.909
now the colors that are down here I've
got a little bit of the rosy color

00:06:22.909 --> 00:06:26.720
can't just tent don't need a whole lot

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.729
and I'm going to drop that

00:06:29.729 --> 00:06:33.889
in to paint around I'm thinking about
the large

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:38.280
mass form above the berries

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.310
rather than individual little bear East

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:47.940
its wash this down and decide how far do
I want to pull this color

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:52.740
i'm looking at the shape of this branch
don't need to define it too much

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.090
Marino just carving away and then I'll
wash it up

00:06:56.090 --> 00:06:59.490
there's some rosy kind of color here

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:04.530
its poll it forward get some black
cobalt turquoise late in

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:09.440
Jan I'm just sticking with the colors
that were in my underpinning

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:13.590
I know I'm completely safe to use

00:07:13.590 --> 00:07:16.849
the five colors that I started with I
can use them

00:07:16.849 --> 00:07:20.740
absolutely anywhere in this painting and
I won't get

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.909
into any problems it's when you are
three quarters the way through a

00:07:24.909 --> 00:07:25.569
painting

00:07:25.569 --> 00:07:29.979
and you start searching through your
power door into your paint box

00:07:29.979 --> 00:07:33.060
think it will what colour my going to
use now

00:07:33.060 --> 00:07:37.560
that's when we get into problems with
color harmony so if you stick with

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:43.000
whatever you begin your painting with
Carey that theme through

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:48.129
the whole painting you up I'm so we
guarantee yourself success as far as the

00:07:48.129 --> 00:07:49.009
color goes

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:51.060
no matter what colors you've chosen to
use
