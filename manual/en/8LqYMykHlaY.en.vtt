00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:03.200
Hello, my hair's weird.

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.840
Straight hair!

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.550
So, many of you guys know I like to put my
hair in a lot of different styles, curly,

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.480
wavy, straight, crimped.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.206
But if your hair isn't already
naturally wavy or or straight or

00:00:11.206 --> 00:00:15.940
spirally, then it can be really damaging
to get your hair those hairstyles.

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:16.990
The main one being straight hair.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.580
Because you really only have two options,
right?

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.220
The first one is a flat iron which
is really damaging for your hair.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:24.735
The second one is a blow dryer, though
the heat isn't as damaging from the blow

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:28.860
dryer, but all the tugging and
manipulating is what's really damaging.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:31.250
But there's no other way to
get your hair straight, right?

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.320
Wrong!

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.650
This is my friend.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:39.580
This is my hooded dryer you guys,
I love it so much it cost me like $130.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.370
Some of you might thing
that's really expensive, but

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.140
when you think about it a flat iron can
run you from a 100 to $300 I've seen.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.380
So I ain't buying it,
I think it's worth it.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:53.510
This right here is my little salon area,
I put this all together okay.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.070
I've got my products, lotions,
you know old bowls of cereal, all of that.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.630
And the purple people heater.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.600
I really like it and I haven't used
my flat iron much since I ordered it.

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.510
So, let's get started.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.560
Here is what you need, hair, these big
jumbo rollers, these little clippies,

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.870
a spray bottle full of water, and
something to do for like 30 to 45 minutes.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:15.660
Now, you want to wash your hair first.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.180
If there's too much product left over in
your hair, it can come out really flat.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.530
So wash it, get out, go ahead and detangle
it, spray your leave-in heat protectors,

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.250
whatever you want to put in beforehand.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.590
Then afterwards go ahead and brush it out.

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:31.040
Once my hairs all brushed out I'm
gonna take my big jumbo roller and

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.240
I'm gonna measure how thick or
thin the chunk of hairs should be.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.760
Starting with the center of my hair,
like so.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.250
Make sure that the chunk of hair isn't
too thick now, because if it is,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.690
it won't dry all the way through and
that's gonna be a big waste of time.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:46.050
So, you want to make sure it's thin
enough, but also not too thin.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:52.380
And take your little clippy, secure it,
and you have your first roll.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.150
Now this is, right here, why we need a
spray bottle because your hair is going to

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.740
try to curl up the whole entire time and

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.990
you want to make sure
your hair is 100% wet.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.090
Because if your hair dries before
you put it in the rollers and

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.190
gets curly before you have them in
the rollers, it's gonna come out curly

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.640
regardless of how long you sit under
the dryer making it again a waste of time.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.160
So keep going.

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:15.800
Probably like 10 minutes later you
will start look something like this

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.820
which is a good thing.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.680
That means we're almost done.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:19.650
Now.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.580
Make sure you have enough rollers.

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:24.370
If you have a lot of hair, you might
want to order like an extra package.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.670
I don't know where my last one went so
I'm gonna use this oddball one.

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.790
But I don't mind that it's different.

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.050
I really prefer the velcro roller because
they just stay so well but whatever.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.770
Now that I'm done, I'm gonna go ahead and
get my hooded dryer.

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:38.850
It's really cool you can adjust it to make
it high or low, throw it on the floor.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.904
You can change the heat setting to cold,
hot, low, high kind of like

00:02:43.904 --> 00:02:49.150
a regular blow dryer but without
the tugging and the, well hand usage.

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.250
You've two free hands for like 40 minutes.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.290
So you can play on your laptop.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:54.800
You can paint your nails.

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.010
You can dance to music.

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:57.260
You can talk to your mom.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.110
You can do your make up.

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:00.660
Whatever you want to do for 40 minutes.

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.340
Go ahead and do that.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.180
And then afterwards before turning it
off I go ahead and turn it on cool for

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:09.610
like 10 minutes and what that does is just
kind of like you know sets it I guess and

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:10.838
then I turn it off after that.

00:03:10.838 --> 00:03:11.543
' Kay.

00:03:11.543 --> 00:03:18.460
Now, afterwards, here's the fun part,
thank you machine, we get a reveal.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.430
Reveal gently, now.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.750
Not everything will be perfect,
but it's okay.

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:25.870
I don't, I didn't use the flat iron at
all to get this, and it's beautiful,

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:28.890
it's bouncy, and I love it,
and it feels really soft.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.270
Now the only thing you
might need a flat iron for

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:33.330
is if you have really
curly hair like I do.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:36.170
You'll want to turn your
flat iron onto low and

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.340
just kind of get the roots like so.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.140
But that's it.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.750
Just kind of like touching it up,
if you will.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.190
You know and if you sleep on it,
the same thing the next morning.

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:45.850
Just you know, touch it up.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.030
But it's way better than using the flat
iron all throughout your hair.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.314
And I'm just very happy,
my ends are happy and

00:03:52.314 --> 00:03:54.667
I really hope that you
guys like this tutorial.

00:03:54.667 --> 00:03:56.543

00:03:56.543 --> 00:03:57.208
