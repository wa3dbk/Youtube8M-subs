Hi my name is Armen Zargarian and this is
my third visit to Rightlook. After having

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.570
a successful visit for the Windshield Repair
and Wheel Repair training courses, I took

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:27.599
all those skills back home and I applied it
back to my business and I had wonderful results.

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.939
I decided to do paintless dent removal because
there are a lot of cars come through my car

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:37.650
wash that have dings on the door, hood, panels,
trunks, all the above I see it on a regular

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.970
basis and I thought, 'why not?' After
what Rightlook taught me through with Windshield

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:45.040
Repair and Wheel Repair, I thought 'hey
I can go over here and pick up another new

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:48.430
trade and apply it to my business.' And
that's what I did.

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.489
The class was wonderful, the hands-on portion
was phenomenal. The instructor, I can't

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.539
even explain his patience. I was getting impatient
with the work and there were multiple people

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.969
in the class and he was going through all
of us and helped us out, that was great. He

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:07.080
taught how to use the tools, taught us how
to access the car and basically every bit

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.410
of information that was needed he broke down
for us so we could take all these skills and

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.780
apply it right away. By the 3rd or 4th day
you're nailing out dents and that time when

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.800
you finally knock one out is the biggest relief.
Just knowing you can do it over and over and

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.630
over again once you've done one is a good
accomplishment. It's a big relief because

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.819
in the beginning it was very stressful and
very hard but because of the instructor and

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:32.349
the information that was given, it was very
helpful.

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:37.069
I do very confident offering these services
now. Maybe applying a little more practice

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.959
just so I could master it. The investment
I put toward Rightlook and all the training

00:01:40.959 --> 00:01:47.959
I've received, I am 100% content with. The
results and feedback, just the new skills

00:01:48.849 --> 00:01:53.950
that I've brought into my business, my customer's
reactions and interests just by presenting

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:59.929
a simple ad, a simple coupon, a simple banner,
just displaying that we offer these services

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:04.550
just goes to show how well Rightlook has narrowed
down what is necessary for a business to be

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.849
completed by adding these additions. I'm
more than happy with the money I've put

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:16.849
in and the resul\ts that I've gotten out
of it. It's been wonderful.
