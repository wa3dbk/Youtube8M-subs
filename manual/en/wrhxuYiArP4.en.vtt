00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:04.680
hey what's that line is out of your wits and
welcome to the monopoly an extremely excited

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:05.620
to hear it now

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:09.780
and what i'd like to show you some live pictures
behind with impunity of what a meeting with

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.590
mobile market and the reason I wanted to be
like this

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:15.380
is that I wasn't fit to actually in the room
with me

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.370
the matter of looking over my shoulder

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.170
of new audiences and accounts

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.720
so you know this is all really not state that
so let me tell you something real quick

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.050
that may surprise you know I mean did you
know that there are five billion people with

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.599
cell phones walking around each and every
day

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.520
there's only one point eight billion people
on the internet

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.960
the differences in at five billion in one
point it and so forth are completely and expose

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:38.730
market

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.919
nothing about what is it two things you have
to walk out your house with every day

00:00:42.919 --> 00:00:47.100
obviously the key is that with everything
itself I mean it's huge

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.730
there's also all these things like that

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:50.410
I've had been all these out with

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.630
they're also in mobile

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.299
which you can advertise on Iraq

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:55.780
so these are all things that you

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.760
no that has his potential to make a ton of
money with

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.929
we never really known for the pretty much
how to get into it right

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:06.420
but what I think it out with a step-by-step
system to conclude destroying the market have

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.200
been using it

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.869
for the past six months now is making a killing
but what I'm saying behind and one of the

00:01:11.869 --> 00:01:14.820
things that I would think that it's the fifth
amendment is it

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.520
because I collect the budget means building
a huge list within the law could serve as

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.549
I listen to a waiver cannot

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:21.920
see how it works

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.320
and then they want to do

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.299
is the market could face products to the people
once they get home

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.140
something about it

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.430
they now collective all these liens on the
for I could always lied to get on the phones

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.799
and then market and clipping President affiliate

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.950
it's coast I think that's true is a massive
one of America's

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.090
now this to you

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:39.930
inside the members area

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.070
I will not be so in the face of creeping up
outlets were convicted of killing

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.450
so when Israel on Friday when a recount

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.439
and as you can see so far today of course
that hundred influence

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:58.320
yesterday but that's in the seventies and
I think the only thing that easily right with

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.340
the lark think the state he is a surprising
thing

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.900
this twenty thousand seven and fifty three
people in this one is right here

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:10.629
with Clinton in one month the one campaign
and want to go in that single market

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:14.880
now that is the man to build a list of twenty
thousand people a month I know everyone says

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:15.869
the money isn't

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:17.120
the list right

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.889
well new voters chose voting on this if you
have

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.519
guess what you can go to listen twenty thousand
people plus in a month

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:25.559
well marty easy

00:02:25.559 --> 00:02:29.389
the all of them this one thousand five hundred
ninety nine when said neither not fighting

00:02:29.389 --> 00:02:32.229
with no markings two thousand twenty four

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:34.909
twenty one thousand in simi valley here

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:39.099
one thousand two to ninety four now between
this one and this one alone of Clinton over

00:02:39.099 --> 00:02:40.349
forty thousand people

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:41.829
with local marketing

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:42.929
and that is

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:47.379
just beginning his npr these list grew each
and every day as you can see here

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:51.909
so when the to renounce law gives the LA times
and have to show you what the time is

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:55.719
so what I want a quick thinking you know that
this is legit

00:02:55.719 --> 00:03:01.480
so right now you can see you next Friday July
ninth I had six forty two PM- pacific standard

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:02.279
time right

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:09.279
so now we know that could think you're going
to live in

00:03:10.749 --> 00:03:16.200
the library here and a lot of what I tell
us that that are that is fairly new

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:17.939
and then as you can see here

00:03:17.939 --> 00:03:23.060
so far it's %uh what eighteen forty three-a
same time is what is your view in LA times

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.049
and it's July ninth at so you know this is
live

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.499
I as you see so far as many two hundred and
ninety five dollars and so I'm not

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:36.619
yesterday in a seven hundred seventy eight
on Wednesday on the one thousand five dollars

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:38.059
in one day I had

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:42.509
two senate eight hundred seventy seven dollars
and then Monday and down here it's are sick

00:03:42.509 --> 00:03:44.709
and I am now the reason that is is because

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.109
when you collect huge list of global warming

00:03:47.109 --> 00:03:49.140
in the fall of zepa send out

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:54.290
what happens is once opposed or so what the
sales are to go away because people buying

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.610
votes when they get all the faults that once
as you can see here

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.749
when I first started my first campaign with
that with this account for marketing

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:05.640
I need five thousandth five hundred dollars
in one week

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.439
the next weekend and one thousand six hundred
dollars

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:09.839
and it's the kind of guys out here the
