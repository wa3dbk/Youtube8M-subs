00:00:04.638 --> 00:00:05.906
Brushes are one of
the most important tools

00:00:05.906 --> 00:00:07.007
a painter will purchase.

00:00:07.007 --> 00:00:08.242
You want to
make the most of your tools

00:00:08.242 --> 00:00:09.476
by taking proper care of them.

00:00:09.476 --> 00:00:11.011
Some general
rules to follow are:

00:00:11.011 --> 00:00:12.679
Use separate brushes
for water-based

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.281
and oil-based media;

00:00:14.281 --> 00:00:16.016
Never leave your brushes
sitting in a water

00:00:16.016 --> 00:00:16.950
or a solvent;

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.151
Don't scrub harshly

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:19.519
and make sure to
clean your brushes thoroughly

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:20.954
after each
painting session.

00:00:20.954 --> 00:00:22.723
This is especially important
when using acrylics

00:00:22.723 --> 00:00:23.957
which dry quickly.

00:00:23.957 --> 00:00:26.026
Here are some tips for
cleaning your brushes.

00:00:26.026 --> 00:00:28.562
Wipe your brushes clean
with a cloth first,

00:00:28.562 --> 00:00:31.582
getting as much of
the paint out as possible,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.735
and then if you're
working with oil

00:00:34.735 --> 00:00:36.537
you'll use a turpentine
or mineral spirit

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:38.071
to work out
the remainder of the paint.

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:39.706
For acrylics,
you'll just use water

00:00:39.706 --> 00:00:41.775
to rinse out as much of
the colour as possible.

00:00:47.948 --> 00:00:51.385
Then using a mild soap
and lukewarm water,

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:54.688
lather the brush,

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:58.091
and then I'm just going to
work the soap down

00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:59.726
all the way
to the ferrule.

00:00:59.726 --> 00:01:01.161
Just applying
a gentle pressure,

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:03.497
making sure I get
everything out of the base,

00:01:03.497 --> 00:01:06.667
from the base to the tip,

00:01:06.667 --> 00:01:08.907
and then you're
just going to rinse.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.744
And repeat this process
as many times as possible

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:21.224
until you get all of the
colour out of your brush.

00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:25.852
Keep in mind that certain
pigments will stain

00:01:25.852 --> 00:01:27.020
the bristles or filaments,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.188
and this isn't
a problem as long as

00:01:28.188 --> 00:01:30.924
there isn't any actual
paint left in the brush.

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:32.059
Then you're going to
squeeze out any of

00:01:32.059 --> 00:01:36.697
the excess water,

00:01:36.697 --> 00:01:39.199
and then reshape your bristles
with your hands

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.035
to get them back
in the original shape.

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:43.603
When drying your brushes,
lay them flat

00:01:43.603 --> 00:01:45.339
to prevent water from
damaging the ferrules

00:01:45.339 --> 00:01:45.906
and the lacquer

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:48.175
and to help the bristles
maintain their shape.

00:01:48.175 --> 00:01:49.242
Once your brushes are dry

00:01:49.242 --> 00:01:50.877
you can place them in
an upright holder

00:01:50.877 --> 00:01:52.879
with the bristles
facing up.

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:54.181
Your brushes will last
much longer

00:01:54.181 --> 00:01:55.215
if you just take a few minutes

00:01:55.215 --> 00:01:57.250
after each painting session
to take good care of them.

00:01:58.051 --> 00:02:00.053
