00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:09.640
One day, one ordinary day...

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.040
Without any warning...

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.160
...an unknown force came to earth.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.760
And it made them all stop.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.480
The consequences were immediate,
and they were devastating.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:32.200
Without trucks there were no
newspaper deliveries, no fresh milk.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.960
And the hospitals
quickly ran out of supplies.

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:42.800
School kids forced to eat leftovers.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.560
The pharmacies were out of drugs.
And the drinking water went bad.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.440
The grocery stores
were now completely empty-

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.400
-and the stench from the garbage,
which filled up the streets-

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.040
-was unbearable.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.760
As the world stood still...

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.520
...desperation spread fast.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.720
But just as the last hope was fading,
they stepped out of the shadows.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.720
The mentally and physically
unbreakable Customer Service Steve.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:31.960
The X-ray vision, problem-solving
genius Truck Techer Tess.

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.560
And the speedy mind reader
Parts Picker Pete.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:54.040
Mankind turned to the only
three people who could save them.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.360
The Uptime Team.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.520
Together they can move the world.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.160
If they only get there in time.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.680
The Volvo Uptime Team.
Coming soon at a theatre near you.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.600
The Uptime Team
are looking for new crewmembers.

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.120
Do you want to join them?
